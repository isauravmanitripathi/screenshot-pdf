All men, women and children\ninhabit some state or the other. No state lives in isolation. All states interact with each\nother. The interaction amongst the states has been occurring since ancient times. The\nnature of this interaction has certainly got transformed in the modern, globalised age.\nWhen the states interact, these interactions affect the domestic populations of these states.\nWhen all the states in the world interact, it creates an international state system. The\ninteraction that happens amongst the state in the international state system creates\nhistorical, political and socio-economic consequences for the domestic populations.\nInternational Relations (hereafter IR)is the study of all these interactions and the\nsubsequent consequences.\n\nHowever, the question that now arises in our minds is about what the concept of the\nstate primarily entails? How did it evolve? What is the present situation of the conceptual\nstate in a globalised world?\n\nThe next section attempts to provide a brief glimpse of the evolution of the state. The\nsubsequent chapters of Part-B of this section would help us to understand the deeper\nnuances of study of the state in an international historical context from ancient times till\nthe age of globalisation. Let us turn first our attention to the gradual historical evolution of\nthe state.\n\nHOW DID THE STATE EVOLVE?\n\nThe ‘State’ is a creation of man and not a creation of mother earth or nature, which makes\nit a man-made ‘construct’. Man was initially a hunter-gatherer. He was leading a nomadic\nlife. Over a period of time, as man developed techniques of agriculture and learned\ndomestication of animals, he decided to do away with his nomadic life in favour of a\nsettled life. As he settled in an area, the population in that patch of land began to grow. It\n\ngradually transformed into a microcosmic society. As this mini-society got established at\none place, so it did in other areas. Initially, a majority of these societies got established\nnear rivers or other water sources. This is also one reason why we had a majority of all\nancient civilisations established near rivers. Our own Indus Valley civilisation, which\nflourished on the banks of the Indus river, is testimony to the fact.\n\nAs the societal groups enlarged over a period of time, there was felt a need to\nestablish a code of conduct for the members of the society to impose a form of order on\nthe chaotic tribes. Once the rules of societal interactions were established, further need\narose to create an authority to enforce these rules. Initially, it saw its manifestation in the\nform of conferring the authority on the most elder people but, this gradually shifted to the\nstrongest man amongst the group. Over a period of time, a need was also felt to protect the\ngroup of persons, now in the form of a settlement, from attacks by members of the other\ngroups. This manifested not only in the physical protection of people but also the land\noccupied. Thus, protection emerged as the most rudimentary reason of political\nformations, headed by a strong chief.\n\nThese groups from one place interacted with other groups situated some distances\naway as well. The nature of this interaction often varied. The interaction at times was to\nsubjugate the other area and enhance one’s own area or, at times, it was to achieve mutual\ncoexistence. The protector of the area and its population by now was called the king and\nthe king was thought to possess divine powers during these ancient times.\n\nIn the ancient times, there was a complete absence of the concept of sovereignty. Yet,\nin the absence of the state sovereignty we have seen ancient empires flourish. One of the\nvery successful ancient empires was the Greek city state system. It had a common\nlanguage and religion. The Greeks later became subjects of the Romans. During Roman\ntimes, the concept of authority got significantly transformed. A new authority of the\npapacy (Pope) emerged along with the Emperor.\n\nMedieval society got established in the form of feudalism. The feudal medieval order\nwas effectively broken down with the coming of the Renaissance and Reformation which\nultimately culminated in the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 which created the first ever\nmodern nation states based on the idea of sovereignty. This was followed by geographical\ndiscoveries, enlightenment, age of reason and imperialism. The mercantilism that emerged\nduring this period along with industrial revolution and colonisation led the world\nultimately to the World War-I.\n\nWhat is worth noting is that, since the Peace of Westphalia and emergence of\nWestphalian nation state, the kings in command or monarchs not only became absolute in\ntheir power but also went on to shrug off Papal authority over the state. It is in reality this\ntransformation in the governance of the state that gave birth to modern statecraft. The\nnation states began to flourish under the rule of these monarchs. The new-found growth\nled to an urge to expand and indulge in practices like imperialism and colonialism. The\nimperialist world learnt its hard lesson during the World War I, but the settlement reached\nthrough the infamous Treaty of Versailles post-World War I also sowed the seeds for the\nnext total war—the World War II.\n\nThe period post world war-II witnessed the rise of super powers—the USA and the\n\nUSSR—with their mutual mistrust leading the world into an extended Cold War period.\nThe end of communism and the eventual collapse of the USSR in 1989 led to the rise of\nunipolarity, with the USA emerging as the surviving power bloc. This period of\nunipolarity saw a subsequent rise of a new force in the world called globalisation. As the\nstates got affected by globalisation, many scholars in the twenty first century began to\nadvocate that the relevance of state in a globalised world would become redundant.\nHowever, this was not the truth as, though, undoubtedly, globalisation has (and continues\nto) affect the states, it has only transformed the nature of the states in terms of their being\ndemonstrators of absolute power in the world. The role of the state remains intact even in\na globalised economy as globalisation can flourish only with rule of law and a stable\nsocial order which can only be guaranteed by the instrument called the state.\n\nPlease keep the meanings of the three following terminologies in mind throughout\nyour reading of the book:\n\n@ State — It is a political association that has a defined territory with a permanent\npopulation to be governed by a government which is sovereign.\n\n= Sovereignty — It means a situation of an absence of an authority higher than the\nstate. It means state has the freedom to take independent decisions in domestic and\ninternational affairs without being answerable to any authority above it.\n\n= Security — It means a situation of an absence of any threat. Security at a micro\nlevel is called human security, at state level is called national security and at a global\nlevel is called international security."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

This chapter acts as a foundation as well as\nthe entry point to the understanding of the rest of the book. | strongly urge the readers to\nread each and every term in this chapter carefully before proceeding to read the\nsubsequent chapters of the book.\n\nBASIC TERMS OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS\n\nAnti-ballistic Missile: It is a system with two components—namely a radar and an\ninterceptor missile. An anti-ballistic missile protects or defends a designated target against\nan incoming missile from an enemy territory.\n\nAccidental War: There are two meanings to this term. Firstly, it may be used to define a\nwar that may have resulted from a technical malfunction or mishap. In this case, it is\nunintentional and not deliberate. Secondly, it may be caused due to perceptions\nmisconstrued by a state where it fails to read a particular situation correctly and responds\nwith violence.\n\nAction-Reaction: This term is mostly used in conflict analyses and game theory. Lewis\nFry Richardson, a scholar who theorized the arms race, explained the concept in the\nRichardson process. To easily understand this concept, we can take example of two states,\nA and B. Let’s say, for instance, that State B increases its military capability. Perceiving\nthis as a threat, State A reacts by increasing own military expenditure. The reaction by\nState A is perceived by State B differently. State B feels that increased military\nexpenditure by State A has reduced the margins of safety of State B, and thus State B\nresponds to it, in turn, by increasing its own arms budget. Thus, an action leads to a\nreaction.\n\nActor: In international relations, any entity which plays an identifiable role or is a\nstakeholder is termed as an actor. It is a very broad term which is used to signify\n\npersonalities, organizations, states, institutions, and so forth.\n\nAdjudication: Adjudication is a process of using international law to settle international\ndisputes by referring them to a court of law. The League of Nations, after the World War—\nI, established the Permanent Court of International Justice, which was succeeded by\nInternational Court of Justice in 1945.\n\nAdministered Territory: This concept was advocated by Jan Smuts and George Louis\nBeer under Article XXII of the covenant of the League of Nations to control and\nadminister the colonial possessions of Germany in Africa, Pacific and Turkey in the\nMiddle East. It was a system that did not involve direct annexation and traditional\nimperialism. The ‘responsible’ states in ‘sacred trust’ of the League of Nations would\nprovide guidance and support to powers incapable of self-governing themselves. The\nPermanent Mandates Commission established managed the entire process. Frederick\nSamuel North edge, in his book, The League of Nations: Its Life and Times (1986), says\nthat the mandate system was the first ever experiment in the world with international\ncontrol on dependent territories.\n\nAIC (Advanced Industrial Countries): The Brandt Report of 1980 used this term to\nrefer to countries of North America, Western Europe, Japan and Australia. The UN also\nuses the same abbreviation and it refers basically to all developed countries.\n\nAlliance: When two or more actors formally sign an agreement to cooperate mutually in\nsecurity related issues, it is called an alliance. Normally, alliances are defence pacts that\noperate during the situations of war. Alliances have been most visible during the period of\nCold War, but in the post Cold War period today, as explained by Christensen and Snyder,\nstrong alliances would be difficult to envisage given the multipolarity of global politics.\n\nArbitration: In arbitration, the two conflicting parties argue to submit their difference to a\nthird party for settlement. The third party undertaking arbitration announces a binding\ndecision in the process of settling the disputes.\n\nArms Control: It is an exercise where an actor advocates restraint in acquiring, deploying\nand using military capabilities. The assumption underlying arms control is based on\ndeterrence policies. But arms control theorists, at an ideological level, differ from theorists\nadvocating disarmament. Disarmament scholars advocate a world without weapons or a\nsituation where the threat of using force reduces substantially. The scholars of arms\ncontrol on the other hand work along the existing structure.\n\n& er\nea |\n\nArmistice: It is an opportunity between two or more conflicting states to suspend\n\n\nhostilities and opt for a peaceful settlement. It is never unilateral but bilateral, and is a\ntemporary declaration of peace, providing an opportunity to the conflicting states to\nterminate the state of war. It helps in maintaining a status quo. From 1949 to 1978, there\nwas armistice between Arabs and Israel (explained in the chapter on the issues in the\nMiddle East-Section-H-Chapter-1).\n\nAsian Tigers: It is a term applied to certain states in Asia that had experienced aggressive\neconomic growth within a short span of time. These Asian economies have become a new\nstandard for economic liberalism in the recent times. The five Asian Tigers are Hong\nKong, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan. Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia in\nthis context are known as Tiger Cubs while Hong Kong and China are collectively also\ncalled Asian Dragons.\n\nAsylum: The word ‘asylum’ means refuge. It is a quasi-legal process where a national of\nanother state gets protection from a state for sanctuary. As per the article 14 of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948, the rights of asylum are vested in a state\nand not with the individuals.\n\nAutonomy: It is a term very frequently used in political discourse. The liberal meaning of\nautonomy is self-government. The Treaty of Westphalia, 1648, marked the origin of the\nconcept of the autonomy of states. It is stated that the beginning of the concept of\nautonomy also introduced the concept of anarchy amongst states in the international\nsystem.\n\nAnarchy: The etymology of this term derives from a Greek word which implies ‘without\na ruler.’ In day to day life, it is used as a term to signify chaos and lawlessness such as it\nhappens when there exists a situation of no stable government or monarchy to maintain\npeace. Normally, the term, in political discourse, is used when there is some revolutionary\nupheaval or sociopolitical turbulence. In international relations, anarchy is used\nspecifically to signify international politics where no state has any absolute control on the\noverall system. The first political philosopher who described international relations as\nanarchical was Thomas Hobbes. The realist scholars have used the concept of anarchy\nwhile formulating their theories.\n\nAppeasement: It is a term which is based on an assumption that there would be no war if\nthe demands of an aggressive state are met.\n\nBalkanization: The term was used by diplomats in later nineteenth century period to\ndelineate the policy of Russia towards the states of Balkan Peninsula. Balkan is a Turkish\nderivative for forested mountains. It is used as a term to describe fragmentation of a region\ninto independent but mutually hostile power centers. This term was used on erstwhile\nOttoman Empire States of Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania and Yugoslavia.\n\nBases: In the context of international relations, it is a term that signifies a point of military\nsupply and troop concentration. Bases are strategically located and during the Cold War,\nboth the US and the USSR established points of troop concentration in the territory of\ntheir allies.\n\nBalance of Power (BOP): This term has developed no clear meaning due to multiple\ninterpretations available. However, balance of power as a concept in international relations\nwas used from the sixteenth century to early twentieth century, to describe an instrument\n\nof policy to prevent power dominance. The European state system from 1815 to 1914 was\nan example of the use of BOP as an instrument to curb the quest for hegemonic ambitions.\nHedley Bull asserted that BOP has prevented the formation of a universal empire through\nconquest. As per Bull, BOP has not only protected the independence of discrete states but\nhas also facilitated the development of institutions like diplomacy and greater power\nmanagement. As per BOP, the world in which we live in is a system where countries exist\nin a perfect equilibrium. The BOP theory says that the equilibrium of the system can be\ndisturbed if a state in the system dramatically increases its power. This would compel\nother state in the system to form alliances or increase their own powers to reestablish\nbalance in the system which had been disturbed in the first place due to the increase of\npower by one state. A term derived from BOP is Balance of Terror. In Balance of Terror,\none state actor credibly threatens another state actor with destruction. During the Cold\nWar, the US and the USSR often used the term in specific references to nuclear deterrence.\n\nChoke Points: In context of naval diplomacy, it is a geopolitical term used to signify an\ninternational strait whose control could potentially affect commercial transit.\n\nCivil War: A civil war is an internal state of violence within a nation where two or more\nfactions fight to take over control of the political or legal apparatus of the state. There are\nthree broad reasons as to why a civil war may happen. A civil war could happen to end\ncolonialism; break away from a state and lastly, to achieve a reunion of separated states. In\ncase of colonialism, there could be a civil war when some people in a colony favour an\nend to colonialism while a significant body intends to support colonial rule for the fear\nthat the anticolonial insurgents could establish a political and an economic order that may\naffect those people.\n\nThe idea to secede away from a state may also lead to a civil war. In this case, it is an\nassertion of nationalism by ethnically homogenous people to achieve self-determination.\nThe civil wars driven by a desire to seek reunion too are nationalistic in character. At the\ndiplomatic level, at times there would be diplomatic support to insurgents to help them\nestablish a government in exile. There could be military intervention by third party states\nwhen they engage by sending their own forces in case of a war. A case in point is that of\nIndia intervening in East Pakistan (Bangladesh) Muktijuddho (War of Independence) of\n1971. Ironically, the UN has failed to evolve an effective mechanism to prevent third\npartly states to intervene in situations of civil war.\n\nCold War: The term was coined by HB Scope, who was an American journalist. Walter\nLipmann popularised the term, and stated that Cold War describes a situation where there\nis no war, yet no peace. It is a term that signified the global ideological tensions in the\nworld created in the aftermath of the World War II by the US and the Soviet Union.\n\nCharacteristics\n\nof cold war\n\nColonialism: Colonialism is a form of imperialism where one country tries to control the\npolitics and economy of another country. A country is made into a colony by a mother\ncountry, whereby the territory that gets colonised becomes a subordinate and servile\ncountry. The period from fifteenth to nineteenth century saw Portugal, British, France,\nHolland and Spain colonising the Americas, Asia and Africa. In the present context, non-\ncolonialism is a term used to signify domination by developed countries of post colonial\nindependent states. Similarly, internal colonialism as a term is used when a peripheral\nregion is treated as a subordinate by an economically dominant segment of the state. For\nexample, central Asian Republics were victims of internal colonialism post disintegration\nof the erstwhile Soviet Union. A process where a colony undertakes independence from a\ncolonial power is called decolonisation. After the World War II, the world witnessed a\nsurge of states gaining independence from colonial rulers and a term called the ‘Third\nWorld’ began to be used as a collective expression for these new states.\n\nDeterrence: In a simplistic sense, deterrence means a situation where a person A may\nseek a certain behaviour from person B. If person B does not display the desired behaviour\nor tries to deviate from the desired behaviour, then person A can deter person B from\nbehaving in an unacceptable manner by threatening person B with punishment. The basic\nidea of deterrence is to issue a threat to prevent any undesirable behaviour from another\nstate. Deterrence is a special form of a power relationship where an imposer may make a\nthreat upon a target whose behaviour the impostor wishes to oppose. Thus, deterrence is\nall about negative sanctions.\n\nDisarmament: Disarmament is a process to reduce, remove and eliminate certain weapon\nsystems identified by a state. It is normally used in the context of nuclear weapons. Once\nthe process of disarmament is complete, it leads to an establishment of a completely\ndisarmed world.\n\nExile: A situation where a person or group of persons is banished from one place to\nanother. Though it is mostly viewed as a punishment, it could be either self-imposed or\nenforced.\n\nExtradition: It is a legal term that signifies a situation or a process where one state hands\nover a fugitive to another state. To facilitate the transfer of persons, an extradition treaty is\nrequired. In the case of an absence of an extradition treaty, there is no duty upon a state\nunder the international law to undertake extradition. It is normally used for transfer of\ncriminals who seek refuge in a state other than the one where they happened to commit the\n\noffence.\n\nFailed Nation States: During the Cold War, the US and the Soviet Union extended aid\nand support to other states with an intention to contain each other. As the Cold War ended,\nthe term called failed nation state began to emerge and it signifies those states that could\nnot survive without an aid.\n\nms ina\nfailed state\n\nForeign Aid: It is a tool of economic diplomacy where the donor state may use monetary\ninstrument to achieve certain policy goals within the recipient state. The most important\nfactor in this scenario is the capability that the donor state needs to possess to assert\neconomic influence on the recipient state. The capabilities are often measured as surplus\nnational resource. At times, foreign aid could be used as a power instrument when it is\nused by a state actor to reward a behaviour of another state after removal of sanctions.\n\nFree Trade (related to laissez-faire): It is a form of trading system which involves two\nactors where the trade of goods happens between the two without any restrictions. It\nindicates the abstention by governments from interfering in the workings of the free\nmarket. Any form of free trade promotes competition and efficiency and therefore is\nbeneficial from an economic point of view. Free trade not only benefits a trader but also\nthe consumers because traders through free trade can access foreign markets while the\nconsumers can get access to imported goods. Thus, free trade promotes growth of\ninterdependence amongst the actors. When actors establish a free trade area, they abolish\nthe tariffs on identified goods amongst themselves and establish a free trade pact which\nthen becomes a prerequisite for the establishment of a customs union.\n\nGenocide: Genocide means the systematic extermination or mass killings of specific\ngroups of people. Normally, genocide is much broader than simple mass killings and may\ninvolve acts like starvation, forced resettlement and even mass deportations, as in case of\nthe Holocaust, which wiped out a significant ratio of European Jews. In December, 1948,\nthe UN General Assembly has passed a Genocide Convention and it came into force in\nJanuary, 1951. As per the second article of the genocide convention, genocide means\ndestruction in whole or in part, of a national, ethical, racial or religious group.\n\nGeopolitics: Geopolitics is a method of undertaking foreign policy analysis which tries to\nexplain the political behavior of the state on the basis of the use of geographical variables.\nGeopolitics is a dynamic concept. A country may not be as geopolitically important today\nbut may become so in future. For example, since the end of the World War II, the state of\nWest Asia, for instance, Saudi Arabia, has been geopolitically important due to the fact\nthat it possessed an extremely important resource in the form of oil and is located near the\nsea, allowing for easy trade of oil. However, as the world in the twenty first century is\nlooking for cleaner and greener fuels and alternatives to oil, the countries possessing\n\nnatural gas and access to sea may become more geopolitically important in the future.\nThus, the world is likely to see a decline of geopolitical significance of Saudi Arabia while\nIran and Russia, which are in possession of natural gas, are likely to become geopolitically\nimportant in the near future.\n\nGreat Powers: This term is used in the theory of realism by realist scholars and it\nsignifies the ranking of the global states in terms of their economic and military\ncapabilities they possess. The hierarchy that is established on the basis of capabilities is as\nfollows:\n\nEconomic/Military\nCapabilities\n\nThe term called ‘great powers’ found its first written mention in the Treaty of\nChaumont in 1817, as, by the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Austria, Britain, France,\nPrussia and Russia were granted the great power status for the first time. In 1944, a\nforeign policy and IR scholar named William Thornton Rickert Fox replaced the term\n‘great powers’ with ‘superpowers’ and since then, the US, Britain, France, Russia and\nChina have been given the status of superpowers.\n\nGunboat Diplomacy: It is a term that has been used with respect to foreign policy since\nthe nineteenth century. Its first mention was seen in the British foreign policy where the\nBritish navy would often be dispatched in a particular region to coerce a state or a ruler to\npay debts. The British even dispatched naval squadrons to enforce punishments and\nrestore order. Thus, over a period of time, gunboat diplomacy as a term came to be used\nfor naval ships which are used for signalling intentions to an adversary state and are used\nfor power projection.\n\nHegemony: Hegemony in the international system is the political, economic, or military\npredominance or control of one state over others. A state with adequate capabilities is\ncalled a hegemonic power in relationship to which the other states in the system define\ntheir relationship. When other states define their relationship with a hegemonic power,\nthey could display a behaviour of opposition, display indifference, or even practise\nacquiescence with the hegemonic state.\n\nHot Pursuit: It is a legal doctrine mostly associated with maritime law. Nowadays, it is\nused to cover activities on land where one state may reserve the right to pursue an offender\n\noutside its own territorial limits in national interest. In hot pursuit, the authorised agents of\na state begin the action in the jurisdiction of the violated party and engage in the operation\ntill the offender is broken off.\n\nImmigration: It involves the movement of people from (one place to the other) from one\nstate to another state in search of better employment and living conditions. It is different\nfrom a refugee wave. In immigration, the immigrant moves voluntarily rather than having\nbeen forced or evicted due to political or natural circumstances, which is the case with a\nrefugee. In some countries, the immigrants do pose a cultural threat to the receiving state\ndue to differences in their ideologies and beliefs. Immigrants do play an important\neconomic role in a society as they send remittances back to their home state.\n\nJunta: Junta means an administrative council or a ruling committee. In 1808, in\nopposition to the rule of Napoleon, during the Peninsula war, such councils were formed\nto signify a military government.\n\nMilitary—Industrial Complex (MIC): The term was used by the US president Dwight\nEisenhower in 1961 in his farewell speech. It was a term used during the Cold War times\nto establish a link between economic activity and military expenditure. The economic\ndefinition of MIC is that a state has consensus about the fact that if it undertakes military\nexpenditure, it would lead to the generation of employment, which would, in turn, boost\nthe economy. Thus, military expenditure is linked to employment generation. During the\nentire Cold War period, MIC was a phrase that signified the relationship between the\ngovernment and defense manufacturers.\n\nMultipolarity: Multipolarity identifies an international system with multiple poles or\npower actors. The first ever mention of the term dates back to the European system of the\nbalance of power. However, the term has become more popular since the end of the Cold\nWar and it refers to capabilities or power potentials of multiple actors to assert dominance\nin the international system. The US, Japan and the European Union in the post Cold War\nera are referred to as poles while India is perceived to be a near-polar power.\n\nParadiplomacy: In 1990, an American scholar named John Kincaid proposed the concept\nof paradiplomacy. If we try to define paradiplomacy in the Indian context, then it is a\nconcept where we analyse and study the role played by a local government or a state\ngovernment to enhance diplomatic ties with countries in the neighborhood. Paradiplomacy\ncan allow a state to promote trade, culture, flow of economic ideas, and even outsource\nbusiness and so on. In the recent times, paradiplomacy has been activated by India\nbetween India’s north eastern states and Bangladesh when Sheikh Hasina visited India in\n2017.\n\nRevolution: A revolution means a sudden change in the system of governance of a state\nthrough violence. A revolution also signifies a change in the value system of the state. For\nthe Marxist and Leninists, a revolution involves a socio-economic change in the society.\nScholars like Edward Hallett Carr and Martin Wight feel that revolutions often cause\ninstability and thus are not conducive to maintain order in the system.\n\nSphere of Influence: It refers to a situation where an outside state exercises particular\neconomic or military exclusiveness over another region. In the context of a sphere of\ninfluence, there is no sovereign control over the other territory. When one state exercises\n\nits sphere of influence over another state, it restricts the rights of the other power to\nexercise influence and also imposes limitations on the autonomy of states on which\ninfluence is exercised.\n\nTariffs: A tax on imports is called tariff. It is an important tool of raising revenue;\nhowever, at times, countries also use the system of tariffs for protectionism.\n\nTreaty and Conventions: A treaty is a written agreement which is signed by countries or\ninternational organisations, making it obligatory for the signatory parties to accept certain\ntules that have been consensually agreed upon in the contract. On signature of the treaty,\nthe signatory parties agree to follow the written obligations while agreeing to accept\nliabilities on failure to follow said obligations. The treaties are governed through the\nVienna Convention (1969), which is also called the laws of treaties or the treaty of treaties.\nOne important thing to remember is that when a state signs a treaty, it remains a party to\nthe treaty even if domestically, after signing a treaty, the state government changes. On the\nother hand, a convention is a special treaty that concludes the discussion of an issue of\nglobal significance leading to the creation of an agreement to be ratified by the member\nstates discussing the global issue. For instance, climate change and its consequences are\ndiscussed in conventions attended by several global member states.\n\n‘ES\n\nProtocol: It is also a kind of a treaty but a specialised one as it allows amendments and\nalterations in the main text of the treaty.\n\nee ea\nPet\nSignature and Ratification of Treaties: If a state undertakes a signature to a treaty it\nmeans that the state has an interest in following the points mentioned in the treaty.\nSignature is a legal process but is of two types—simple signature and definitive signature.\nIn a simple signature, a state is not bound to follow the points of the treaty until it ratifies\nthe treaty. Thus, it means that a simple signature involves no obligation on the state as the\nstate reserves the option of putting the treaty before the domestic national parliament\nallowing its people to have a say in the external matters of the state. On the other hand, in\na definitive signature of a treaty, the state expresses its willingness to be bound by all the\npoints of the treaty without the need for ratification of the treaty. When a state ratifies a\ntreaty, it gives its consent to be bound by the treaty. In the ratification of a treaty, the state\nagrees to get the treaty approved by its national parliament and also indicates its\nwillingness to be bound to other contracting parties in the treaty. In ratification, it gives the\nnational parliament of state a much bigger role to direct state’s external affairs.\n\nYay\n\nt ' '\nVeto: Veto means an ability or power to stop an undesirable outcome unilaterally. A state\nneeds to possess capabilities to exercise veto.\n\nADDITIONAL TERMS IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS\n\nAsia Pacific and Indo-Pacific: The term Asia Pacific encompasses Oceania, North-East-\nAsia and South-East-Asia. Asia-Pacific is not a security term but an economic concept\nused to describe the emerging market economies of South-East and East-Asia. On the\nother hand, Indo-Pacific is an evolving concept capturing the region from East-Africa to\nWestern Pacific and is a strategic-cum-economic conception with special focus on sea\nlanes of communication.\n\nComprehensive National Power (CNP): Every country has to undertake some actions\ninternationally. Such actions are based upon the strategic objectives a country may set. To\nachieve such actions as part of strategic objectives of state, it mobilises and utilises the\nstrategic resources at its disposal. The capacity to mobilise these resources to achieve such\nactions set by the strategic objectives of a country is called its CNP. When we say\nmobilisation of ‘strategic resources’, there is an understanding that these resources could\nrange from economic and military strength to diplomatic strength to national resources\nand so forth.\n\nHyphenation and Dehyphenation: Hyphenation is looking at two countries together\nwhen referring to their bilateral relationship. USA used the policy of hyphenation between\nIndia and Pakistan while building relationships with the two during cold war. Let us\nassume that there are three states A, B and C. In hyphenation, lets say A has hyphenated\nstate B and C. Now, if A augments the capacities of B, because of hyphenation, A will\nhave to factor out its impact on state C. One can understand the above illustration better by\nreplacing state A with USA and States B and C with India and Pakistan. The governments\nof USA, from Bush to Trump, have finally led to dehyphenation of India and Pakistan.\nThis has allowed the USA to augment military and strategic capabilities of India without\nworrying about its impact and reaction from Pakistan.\n\nJoint Naval Exercises: These are exercises between the navies of two friendly states\nprimarily organised to enhance join operational skills and doctrinal learning. Such\nexercises can also be multilateral (MILAN exercise, for example) and are usually theme-\nbased.\n\nJoint Naval Patrolling: To address maritime challenges, two countries may resort to a\ncooperative deployment of their navies. These arrangements could be made for prevention\nof piracy, tackle illegal smuggling, illegal fishing and so on.\n\nNatural Ally and Strategic Partners: Natural allies are states sharing common cultural,\npolitical, economic and historical values with each other, as, for instance, the USA and\n\nBritain did in the Second World War. On the other hand, if two countries don’t share the\nvalues as natural allies, but they witness a similar security threat, to mitigate the same, the\ntwo countries may come together and pool their resources, and then the two could become\nstrategic partners but not natural allies, for example, USA and USSR in world war against\na common security threat from fascists. (Indian concept of explanation, See Section-E,\nPart-D, Chapter 3)\n\nNon-Traditional Security Threats: These threats are very different from traditional\nsecurity threats which primarily encompass environmental, economic and societal threats.\nSome of the prominent non-traditional security threats include migration, poverty, climate\nchange, terrorism and Responsibility To Protect etc.\n\nNuclear Safety and Nuclear Security: Nuclear safety is concerned with safeguarding\ncivilian nuclear infrastructure while nuclear security is concerned with ensuring that\nnuclear materials, technology and weapons do not fall into the hands of non-state actors or\nterrorists. The then president of USA, Barack Obama, in 2009, initiated the Prague\nSummit or Nuclear Security Summit to raise issues related to nuclear security. India has\nratified the convention on Physical Protection of Nuclear Materials since 2005 and has\nbeen a party to the International Convention for Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism.\n\nOvert and Covert: When a country does something outright, in the open, it is called as an\novert decision. India tested nuclear weapons in 1998 and overtly became a nuclear\nweapons state. Covert are actions done undercover and in a hidden manner. For instance,\nthe RAW uses covert operations to keep Pakistan under check.\n\nResearch and Analysis Wing (RAW): During the British period in India, they created an\norganisation to gather external and domestic intelligence. This organisation was called the\nIntelligence Bureau (IB). After India became independent, the IB continued to gather\nexternal intelligence for India. After the defeat of India in the Sino-Indian conflict in 1962,\na need was felt to have a separate organisation for external intelligence. During the Indira\nGandhi government, in 1968, the separate agency called RAW was finally created with\nRameshwar Nath Kao as its first chief. The RAW is a wing under the cabinet secretariat\nand is directly answerable to the Prime Minister. One of the important responsibilities of\nthe RAW is to carry out covert operations with an intention to safeguard the national\ninterests of India. The personnel of RAW are not called agents but research officers. RAW\nhas its own service called RAW Allied Services (RAS). The RAW has successfully\nundertaken campaigns related to psychological warfare, subversion, sabotage and\nassassinations. In the chapters ahead in the book, we shall study some of the core\noperations of RAW.\n\nStrategic Depth: Let us suppose that there are three hypothetical states—A, B and C.\nStrategic depth is a policy whereby state A may try to enhance its influence in state B to\nthe extent that it emerges in a position to prevent the state C to exercise political influence\nin the state B. For instance, Pakistan has enhanced its presence in Afghanistan to ensure\nthat there is a favourable regime in Afghanistan since a regime favourable to Pakistan in\nAfghanistan will allow Pakistan to limit the political influence of India in Afghanistan.\nThus, Pakistan pursues a policy of strategic depth against India in Afghanistan.\n\nStrategic Restraint: It is a term used for conflict resolution where a state would not use\n\nforce to resolve conflicts but deploy diplomatic and psychological options to attain\nobjectives instead. In a policy of strategic restraint, a state prefers not to use violence and\nforce to resolve crises and disputes. An alternative term to strategic restraint is resolve\nwhere the state may resort to using force as an option in situation of crises. As we shall see\nin the subsequent chapters ahead, India uses a mixture of both resolve and restraint in its\nforeign policy towards hostile states.\n\nTactical and Strategic Nuclear Warheads: Tactical nuclear warheads are short or small\nyield nuclear warheads which are used immediately in proximate locations while strategic\nnuclear warheads are long range nuclear warheads having capability of intercontinental\nballistic strikes.\n\nThucydides Trap: A term used to signify a situation where a rising power establishes fear\nin an established power, leading to a conflict.\n\nWar and Conflict: When two countries have a disagreement which is not resolved, there\ncould be tensions. Such tensions could manifest as a fight by one aggrieved party against\nthe other. Such a fight or violence is called a conflict. Between two countries, if there is a\nviolent spat or a disagreement on any issue, it may lead to a conflict. The conflicts have to\nbe resolved through dialogue and negotiations to prevent a full-scale war. A war is a type\nof a conflict where the two countries may indulge in violence when one party officially\ndeclares and discloses the need to resort to violence to protect its sovereignty, rights and\nexistence. The 1962 Indo-China disagreement over the border question led to the Sino-\nIndian conflict. Neither side ‘declared’ war, and consequently, 1962 is called a conflict. On\nthe other hand, in 1971, India declared war on Pakistan after Indian base was attacked by\nPakistan."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The US used\nthis section to enter into agreements with various countries pertaining to nuclear\ncooperation. In 1963, India and the US had signed the 123 agreement for Tarapur Atomic\nPower Station. The US, after passing the Hyde Act in 2006, signed a 123 agreement with\nIndia in July 2007, thereby making an exception by allowing the US to permit nuclear\ncommerce with India despite India being a non-signatory to the NPT. After the NSG\nspecific waiver (explained in detail in the chapter of India-US relationship in the later part\nof the book), the 123 agreement was approved by both the houses of the US congress,\nthereby enabling the ‘US-India Nuclear Cooperation Approval and Non-Proliferation\nEnhancement Act.’\n\nAdditional Protocol: Additional protocols are basically safeguard agreements. After it\nwas revealed that Iraq had violated the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)\nsafeguards, a need was felt to have extra safeguards. Under the old IAEA safeguards, all\nNPT signatories would specify their nuclear sites and IAEA would carry out inspections in\nthe specified sites. Thus, IAEA, under the old safeguards, could only carry out inspection\nfor unauthorised activities only at designated or specified sites declared by a country. This\nbasically left an option open for states to carry out covert nuclear programmes. Thus, in\n1993, the IAEA designed Additional Protocols (AP) to tighten the existing safeguarding\n\nregime. But the AP was kept voluntary for a state. India, as part of the Indo-US nuclear\ndeal, signed the AP with IAEA. Indian specific Additional Protocols (AP) do not give\nIAEA the right to hinder or interfere with activities which are outside the scope of India’s\nsafeguard agreements, thus recognising that India reserves a right to a military nuclear\nprogram outside IAEA agreement.\n\nAtomic Energy Act, 1962: It was in 1948 that India passed its first atomic legislation to\nestablish a framework to manage the Indian nuclear sector. The Atomic Energy Act, 1948,\nmodelled on the British Atomic Energy Act, established the Atomic Energy Commission\n(AEC) as the main regulatory body. In 1962, the Atomic Energy Act 1948 was superseded\nwith a new Atomic Energy Act of 1962. Both the legislations have only centralised the\nIndian State Control over nuclear related activities.\n\noe i\nee\n\n‘\n\nAtoms for Peace: It was a programme which had its origin in the speech of US President\nDwight Eisenhower at the UN General Assembly in 1953. In the speech, Eisenhower not\nonly highlighted the dangers of nuclear weapons but also proposed peaceful use of nuclear\ntechnology. During the Cold War, the US began to use the programme to win allies in the\nglobal order. The US declassified nuclear documents and began to transfer nuclear\ntechnology to other states for peaceful use. India, Pakistan and Iran took advantage of the\ndeclassified knowledge to build up peaceful nuclear programmes.\n\nCivil Nuclear Liability Act: The Indian Parliament, in August 2010, passed the Civilian\nLiability for Nuclear Damages Act (CLNDA). The legislation is important because India,\nafter the signing of the Indo-US nuclear deal, would have to buy nuclear technologies\nfrom various countries. The law manages the liabilities of suppliers. Now, the Indian\nversion of the CLNDA is perceived by many stakeholders as unworkable due to\nsignificant ambiguities in the legislation. For example, there is ambiguity about\ncalculation of potential liability of a supplier. Due to this ambiguity, most of the insurance\ncompanies are reluctant to provide insurance coverage to the suppliers. Thus, in turn, due\nto the lack of insurance coverage, the suppliers are reluctant to supply parts and take part\nin Indian nuclear projects. There are other differences in the Indian law and other liability\nlegislations. For instance, Indian law has limited the total compensation to 320 SDR or\n450 million US dollars. Under the Indian law, the supplier of a nuclear part can also be\nheld liable for faulty supply of equipment in case of a disaster.\n\nThere is a case made for an insurance pool where contribution by Indian government and\ninsurance firms could mitigate the challenge of unwillingness to provide insurance cover.\n\nDeterrence: Explained in the earlier section.\n\nFirst Strike: First strike is a nuclear strategy of identifying and completely destroying\nenemy countries’ nuclear forces. The attacker needs to not only have complete idea as to\nwhere the enemy has kept its nuclear weapons (to destroy them) but also needs to have\nsome additional reserve of nuclear forces to prevent any devastating reprisal in case of an\nunsuccessful first strike. The first strike should not be seen as same as the first attack. A\nfirst attack would be a limited attack that may not destroy the enemy’s nuclear forces.\n\nFirst Use: If a state is not able to defend itself with conventional military forces or feels\nthat there is uncertainty in its capacity to defend itself through conventional forces, it may\nreserve a right to the first use of nuclear weapons. Normally, when a state feels that its\nadversary may possess significantly superior conventional forces, it may be compelled to\nadopt first use. But first use does not mean early use, as states having first use may still\nresort to use of nuclear weapons as last resort. India has no first use doctrine.\n\nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty: The first ever version of CTBT was proposed by\nNehru in 1954 to ban atmospheric nuclear testing. It was later in 1993 that the Conference\non Disarmament began to negotiate a CTBT. A text of the CTBT was finally prepared in\n1996. The treaty decided to ban all forms of nuclear testing worldwide. The treaty till date\nhas not come into force. As we shall see later in the chapter detailing India’s Nuclear\nPolicy, India due to various reasons, has refused to sign the treaty. As India refused to sign\nthe treaty, the treaty itself could not be enforced as it was based on consensus of all parties\nin the Conference on Disarmament (CD). In September 1996, Australia took the text of\nthe treaty to the UN General Assembly where while voting, India along with Libya\nopposed the treaty. The treaty can only come into force if all parties at the CD sign the\ntreaty.\n\nConference on Disarmament (CD): It is a disarmament negotiating agency with its\nheadquarters in Geneva. Five members from NATO and five members of Warsaw Pact in\n1960 in Geneva had established the Ten Nation Committee on Disarmament or the TNCD.\nTo encourage further dialogue between the US and Soviet Union, the UN, in 1961,\nestablished Eighteen Nation Committee on Disarmament (ENCD). The ENCD added eight\nmembers from the Third World and the ten from TNCD. The ENCD, in 1969, was\nrechristened and reconstituted as Conference of the Committee on Disarmament (CCD)\nand finally the CD replaced CCD in 1979. The CD has been instrumental in negotiation of\nCTBT (as explained above) along with acting as a forum to negotiate First Missile Cut-off\nTreaty (FMCT) and prevention of arms race in outer space treaty.\n\nFissile Material Cut off Treaty (FMCT): FMCT is a treaty being proposed to prohibit\nproduction of highly enriched uranium and plutonium. Regarding the scope of verification\nprocedure, there is unanimity that the procedure should be strong, effective and also\npolitically acceptable. Many countries have advocated that the procedure should not be the\nsame as prescribed under NPT. Some sections in the Indian establishment are of the view\nthat FMCT should have mechanisms whereby all states comply with all obligations.\nIndia’s ambassador at the CD has reiterated that India would only favour a treaty if it\nintends to ban future production of fissile material only.\n\n=a oy SS\n\ny\n\nMissile Technology Control Regime (MTCR): To prevent the proliferation of unmanned\ndelivery vehicles for nuclear weapons, an informal agreement has been established called\nas MTCR in 1987 by the US, United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and\nJapan. As per the MTCR, it places a ban on the transfer of such missiles that can carry\nmore than 500 kilogrammes or have a range beyond 300 kilometres. In 1992, the MTCR\nexpanded its mandate to add unmanned aerial vehicles.\n\nIndia joined the MTCR in June, 2016. In 2015, India’s membership to join the MTCR was\nblocked by Italy. China is not a member of the MTCR.\n\nExport controt_/\nCategories\n\nhes] =e\n\nec tee\n\nPeaceful Nuclear Explosion: When a nuclear explosion is carried out for non-military\npurposes, it is called a PNE. Such explosions are permitted by the NPT. Theoretically,\ncharacterising a test as a peaceful is very difficult. In 1974, India undertook a PNE at\nPokhran."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The idea of collective security is to create mechanisms\nlegally to prevent an aggression by any state in the system against other states. This\nsituation entails a collection of nation states enforcing peace by informing the aggressor\nstate of a credible threat of sanctions or military actions. The essence of collective security\nis to use military action to enforce peace and to use overwhelming power collectively as a\npunishment to the aggressor. In a system of collective security, the states remain sovereign\nbut relinquish the quest of using force to settle disputes among themselves to maintain\npeace among the members of the system. If a state illegally uses force against another\nstate in a situation of collective security, it is assured of assistance from others, where by\nthe state itself relinquishes its own ability to unilaterally use force. NATO is a collective\ndefense system and not a collective security system.\n\nThe first attempt of collective security found mention in the League of Nations but as\nthe idea behind the formation of the League of Nations, that of preventing another world\nWar, failed, its successor, the UN, did not bring up this issue for discussion.\n\nIn the post-Cold War times, the idea of cooperative security has become more\npopular than the idea of collective security. The eastward expansion of NATO in the post-\nCold War period justified the idea as it is also based on the logic that peace is indivisible\n\nand cooperative security therefore advocates use of regional institutions for collective\naction.\n\nNational Interest: It is used as an analytical tool in foreign policy to identify the\nobjectives of foreign policy of a state. National interest is always those basic determinants\nused by a state to guide state policy in relation to other states in an international system.\nAccording to Charles Beard, the term ‘national interest’ gained momentum in political\nlexicon during sixteenth century in Europe, when it replaced raison d’état during the\n\ngradual development of the idea of nationalism. The idea expressed was of development\nof interest of the whole of the society. Later on, it was used in the international relations as\nan exercise of state power.\n\nIn the subsequent sections of the book, we will see that the concept, in theoretical\npolitical analysis, is mainly used in the school of Realism and Hans Morgenthau was its\nmost influential advocate. Morgenthau, as shall be later examined, advocated that the\nprimary national interest of a state is acquisition and use of power, especially that of\nmilitary power. Later theorists went on to say that the interests of a state are diverse and\nguided by shifts in the international environment. The root of national interests remains\nsurvival and security of a nation."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Aid can be given with certain\nstrings attached but can also be granted without expectations of favour. The concept of aid\ngained popularity during Cold War times when aid was used as foreign policy tool by the\nUS through the European recovery programme.\n\nAmbassador: An ambassador is a principle enabling vehicle for official communications\nbetween states. An ambassador is a career diplomat of a sovereign state residing in another\nforeign state. It was in the fourteenth and fifteenth century in Venice and Milan, when the\nmodern practice of resident ambassadors appeared. However, it was only in the Congress\nof Vienna in 1815 that recognised Corps Diplomatique and established the concept of\nresident ambassadorial system.\n\nCapability: It is a term used while analysing the concept of power. The focussed attribute\nconsidered in case of capability is the possessions of the state actors involved. Earlier, the\nmilitary and economic possessions were used as terms to signify the capability of a state.\nHowever, now, even diplomatic skill are equally recognised. In order to be powerful and\nmore ‘capable’, one state should always possess more attributes than other actors.\n\nEconomic Sanctions: It is a form of economic statecraft whereby one state may resort to\ndeliberately coercing another state actor to follow certain policy objectives. It involves an\nimposer-target relationship. The imposer uses tools of statecraft to compel the target to\nbehave in a specifically desired way by threatening or imposing economic limitations,\nincluding boycotts and embargoes. Normally, in economic sanctions, the imposer tries to\ncontrol access of goods and services for the target.\n\nHot Pursuit: It is a legal doctrine which has been primarily associated with the high seas.\n\nIn the recent times, the states have started using the doctrine of hot pursuit on land to\npursue offenders which may normally be in the territorial jurisdiction of a foreign state.\nSuch kind of a pursuit of offenders in a foreign territory may happen only in exceptional\ncircumstances. The actions in such pursuits are always carried out by law enforcement\nofficials of a state.\n\nStrategic Partnership: Two countries normally have bilateral diplomatic relations.\nHowever, as the depth in bilateral diplomacy increases, the countries would favour\nchanging their diplomatic niceties into strategic partnership, just stopping short of an\nalliance. The important elements of cooperation could manifest in the form of\nconvergence in security diplomacy, defense diplomacy and even commercial diplomacy.\nThe origin of the concept of strategic partnership goes back to the Cold War era. During\nthe Cold War, states were allied to the two power blocks. However, as at the end of the\nCold War the states found themselves independent, each of them began to stitch an\nimportant relationship with a more superior power by using the term strategic partnership.\n\né t\nr\n\nP.\n\n.\n\nBj\n\n\\\n\nby\n,\n\nry y,)\n'\n\nIndia and its Strategic Partners: In SP, countries normally identify elements of vital\ndiplomatic convergence The concept of SP, as it has evolved in the last few decades,\nallows a state to enter into a cooperation-cum-partnership only in those areas where the\ntwo states feel that there is enough convergence, despite there being a lack of formal\nalliance. In other words, unlike an alliance that is binding for nations on all issues in all\nsituations, SP convergences are always in areas where both states envisage a long term\ncooperation. India, since the end of cold has signed SP agreements with may nations. We\nwill read about such agreements in detail in further sections of the text. For India, the\ncommon yardstick while entering into such an agreement is whether the other country has\na critical role to play vis-a-vis our national security and national interest.\n\nSummit Style Diplomacy: The origin goes back to the Cold War times when Winston\nChurchill used the term to define the summit meetings between the leaders of great\npowers. It is a form of international negotiation where leaders meet, negotiate and resolve\nissues. In summit level meetings, Churchill favoured face-to-face interactions with the\nleaders. In fact, Lloyd George also advocated that to settle things, leaders should meet face\nto face and talk. He is, in fact, known as the initiator of the idea of summit style\ndiplomacy. In modern times, leaders meeting face-to-face to resolve issues are more\ncommon.\n\nDifferent Tracks of Diplomacy: The word tracks in this context means channels used by\ninternational state order to undertake negotiations.\n\n= Track-I: This means official diplomacy where heads of the states and diplomats\nand other government officials interact and negotiate to resolve issues.\n\n@ Track-II: This means use of non-official actors like NGOs, civil societies,\nbusiness houses, media persons and even conflict resolution specialists negotiate to\nresolve issues.\n\n= Multi-track: Multi-track diplomacy is a term coined by Dr Louis Diamond who\nhas identified nine different tracks of diplomacy. The word track is mentioned as (T)\nin the below diagram.\n\n;\n\nWhite Shipping Agreement: When two states agree to conclude a white shipping\nagreement, both decide to exchange information with each other related to movement of\nnon-military commercial merchant vessels. Since, in the waters around a state, a lot of\nvessels from small fishing ships to big trawlers move around, such an agreement reduces\nthreat and brings more predictability and stability in the seas. Indian navy is striving to\nachieve complete Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) in waters around India. For the\nMDA to succeed, white shipping information exchange agreements help in knowing the\nvessels’ countries of origin, countries enroute and destination points, thereby helping in\n\n\ncollating MDA.\n\nNet Security Provider: It is a term associated with a country which can ensure a stable,\npeaceful and secure neighbourhood in the region it is based in.\n\nBackchannel Diplomacy: When two adversaries carry out secret communication through\nsecret lines to achieve a diplomatic breakthrough, such communications are called\nbackchannel diplomacy. For example, Barack Obama and Hassan Rouhani opened up\nbackchannel diplomatic talks that led to the US-Iran nuclear deal in 2015.\n\nPariah State: Any state in the international community which is perceived as an outcast is\ncalled a pariah state. It is also known as a global pariah.\n\nPing-pong Diplomacy: In the initial years of the Cold War, the US perceived China as a\nthreat because of the Chinese propensity to lean towards the Soviet. In Early 1970s, the\nUS and China began to exchange table tennis players. These table tennis matches paved a\nway for the two to open up communication channels which ultimately culminated in\nNixon’s visit to China. The ping pong refers to the table tennis opening up diplomatic\nchannels of communication.\n\nSoft Power Diplomacy: A concept of diplomacy coined by Joseph Nye where he explains\nthat it is a form of diplomacy exercised by a state to win its avowed aim without resorting\nto military coercion or by extending an economic inducement as a carrot.\n\nBrown Water Navy: It is a naval force which comprises of small ships, like patrol boats\nand gunboats, that are used to assist other mother ships. These vessels are primarily used\nin rivers.\n\nGreen Water Navy: It is a naval force which has capabilities to carry out offensive\noperations in the littoral zones of a state. They operate in coastal waters.\n\nBlue Water Navy: It is a naval force having capabilities to project power abroad in\nforeign territories. The naval force can project power in deep oceans far away from the\ndomestic waters of the state. Such ability to project power is possible through acquisition\nof aircraft carriers. India has aspiration of becoming a blue water navy."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Here, we will try to understand the technical differences amongst the different\nterms so that it eases out our reading of the book in its entirety where such terms would be\nfrequently encountered.\n\nAny economic integration opens up with agreement to remove disputes. In the first\nstage, the states may conclude a Trade Investment Framework Agreement or TIFA .\nWhenever two states intend to expand trade and resolve any bilateral disputes, TIFA is\ntheir usual first step. In 2009, ASEAN and the USA concluded a TIFA. At the same level,\nin the first stage, a Bilateral Investment Treaty or BIT too could be envisaged. The BIT is\nsigned to invite Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and to pledge to protect the investments\nof investors in each other’s territory. Germany and Pakistan had concluded the first BIT in\nthe world in the 1940's.\n\nThe second step in the integration is to first conclude a Preferential Trade Agreement\n\nor PTA. In a PTA, the participating states not only make the non-tariff barriers\ninsignificant but also the tariff barriers stand to be reduced. The PTAs are a prelude to a\nFree Trade Agreement or FTA. In an FTA, the states eliminate tariffs on goods and\nservices. The FTAs, by removing barriers to trade, promote a competitive advantage by\nboosting specialisation and division of labour. If countries envisage integration beyond an\nFTA, then they conclude a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) or\nComprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA). In CECA, the countries not\nonly promote trade in goods and services by liberalising tariffs, but also establish an\ninvestment regime. On the other hand, in a CEPA, apart from liberalisation of trade in\ngoods and services there are agreements on investments, intellectual property and fair\ncompetition.\n\nThe last stage is known as a Common Market where there is free movement of\ncapital and labour from one nation to another apart from the free trade in goods, services\nand investments. The Common Market removes all technical, physical and fiscal barriers\namongst participating states. The highest form of economic integration, however, is when\nthe group of states decides to charge a similar import duty for imports and allowing\ncomplete free trade amongst the group. Such an integration mechanism is called a\nCustoms Union.\n\nThe theoretical mechanism of integration is as follows:\n\nThree World Theory: The First World refers to the club of rich nations and this term\ncame into use during the Cold War to signify the nations of the West led by the capitalist\nUS. The Second World during the Cold War signified states economically and militarily\nstronger than the Third World and the countries led by USSR had this tag. A stereotypical\nterm, Third World, was used to signify states which were decolonised after the World War\nIl and were less industrialised and relatively poor states. Though the Third World\ncountries were mostly non-aligned countries, the tag was also associated with the\ncommunist state of Cuba.\n\n1, As mentioned in the syllabus of Political Science and International Relations optional (Paper-II, Part - Comparative\nPolitical Analysis and International Politics, item (6) for the Main examination conducted by the UPSC."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Societies also do not act and exist in\nisolation. All societies do interact and the interaction amongst the societies has been going\non since ages. But in the past, many times societies did interact with each other based on\ncertain rules and practices which were common to all those societies which interacted.\nThis gave birth to the idea of international society. It is understood that when some\ncommon rules and practices bind interactions in society, the world in which these societies\nare bound becomes an international society.\n\nThus we can conclude by saying that international societies play an important role in\nthe understanding of history and politics. International societies emerge when nations form\nassociations on the basis of certain values, rules and interest. The concept owed its origin\nto European nation states but today, in the post-Cold War world, this order is applied to\ndistinct political arrangements amongst distinct political communities.\n\nAccording to a scholar named Hedley Bull, when a group of states, on the basis of\ncommon interests and values, form a society and get bound by common rules of\ninteraction amongst themselves, this is the time when states accept no power higher than\nthemselves, thus existing in a situation of international anarchy.\n\nThe proper origin of the idea of an international society owes its origin to Europe\nwhere, in the modern times, especially after the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, we witness\nthe rise of the European state system which was based on core ideas, rules and practices\nwhich knitted the nations on themes like non-interference, sovereignty, equality, and so on.\nAfter 1648, the system that emerges in Europe not only gave rise to modern diplomacy but\nalso paved way for a drastic re-haul of the structures of the world leading to the birth of\nthe modern world."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

We do not include the time period when man was a hunter and a food\ngatherer, since it is part of pre-history, that is, the time period from where no historical\nrecord has survived and evidences mostly include only fossils and archaeological findings.\n\nIn our study of the ancient period, we shall have a look at cases of ancient Indian\nforeign policy, the case of the special hegemonic system of ancient Greece and the\ndiplomacy in ancient China. In the study all of three cases, it will become clear to us that\nsince ancient times, diplomacy did indeed exist. Even during this period, the\ncountries/civilisations conducted themselves according to a well-defined foreign policy.\nElements of modern international diplomacy, like alliances, treaties, self interests, strategy,\nand exchange of diplomatic envoys, hegemony and shifting conditions were deeply\npresent during this period. In fact, the first ever traces of diplomacy go back to as early as\n3000 BC in Mesopotamia, which showed the earliest recorded evidences. Traces were also\nvisible in 2300 BC when a peace treaty had been recorded between the Ebla King of Syria\nand the King of Assyrians.\n\nIn case of civilisations in the ancient times, things were very different than the\nmodern state system, where we have societies that have a well defined territory and exist\n\non the principle of legal equality and sovereignty. As man gradually transformed from\nbeing a hunter-gatherer and began to lead a settled life, the situation led to a rise in\neconomic complexity within the group, necessitating trade.\n\nDue to trade between communities not only did people from one region come into\ncontact with others, it also fuelled an urge amongst territory controllers (later known as\n‘kings’) to extend authority over more and more land. War certainly was one option but\nanother peaceful way out was negotiation through diplomatic envoys and treaties. A very\ninteresting feature of the ancient period was that not only was it monarchical but the king\nwas also ordained with divine powers and the reflection of this divinity found\nmanifestation in diplomatic missions as well.\n\nFor example, during ancient times, in the Middle East, not only did the kings sign\ntreaties on border trade, grazing rights, and so forth, these treaties were accompanied by\nceremonies and rituals and the treaties were concluded by diplomats. But more\nimportantly, in these treaties, there were frequent delineations of detailed and elaborate\nprocedures to be followed upon the violation of treaties. The violation of treaties was\nperceived to have divine retributions as the treaties were supposed to have been bestowed\nwith divine sanctions. Though nation states do not use divine concepts in official\ndiplomacy in modern times but divine words are still very much in fashion in the Middle\nEast and North Africa.\n\nIllustration-Divinity—Iran and Saudi Arabia\n\nRecently, in January 2016, when Saudi Arabia executed Sheikh Nimr Al Nimr, who\nwas a religious Shia leader in Saudi, executed for on terrorism offences, the Iranian\nSupreme Leader Ayatallah Ali Khomeni warned Saudi Arabia of “divine revenge”.\n\nNow let us turn our attention to the core text and case studies and have a look at\nancient India’s foreign policy to identify certain core principles of ancient diplomacy to\nbegin with."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

There were elaborate rituals on diplomacy. The\nbirth of the idea of diplomatic envoys goes back to the times of the Rig Veda;\nhowever, the existence of diplomatic missions in reality emerged much later. The\nconduct of the state in war and at times of diplomacy emerged during the times of the\nscholar Kautilya. His Arthashastra specially talks about diplomacy. It is only in\nArthashastra that we get an in-depth idea of ancient Indian diplomacy.\n\nArthashastra advocated that self-interest is the driving force of diplomacy and\nthat the state is the primary actor in politics. (Later in the chapter on Realism, we will\nsee that the modern realists have propounded similar notions while advancing the\ntheory of Realism in international relations.)\n\nAll states act to maximise their self-interest. Arthashastra says that State A may\nmake State B its ally, but this alliance between them will be based upon some kind of\nself-interest A may achieve on alliance with B and vice-versa. More so, even if a state\nmay behave in an altruistic fashion, it certainly would be having a touch of self-\ninterests in some subtextual context or other.\n\nAlliances were deemed important for various reasons. Self-interest is the driving\nforce of an alliance but alliances could be made for acquisition of territory,\nacquisition of uninhabited areas, and joining forces together to crush rivals or as a\ndefence against other powers. In any case, alliances were to be formed by elaborate\ntreaties to be signed by the king in good mutual faith.\n\nApart from emphasis on self-interest in diplomacy and alliance formation,\nArthashastra advanced the Mandala theory of foreign policy. This theory states that a\nstate’s immediate neighbour will be an enemy state and the neighbour of the enemy\nstate is an ally (we shall see later how India actually practises Mandala Theory in\nbilateral relations with Afghanistan).\n\nThe most interesting aspect of Arthashastra is its linkage of diplomacy and war.\nIt advocates that diplomacy is a subtle act of aggression done with an intention to\nweaken the enemy and gain advantage for oneself with an ultimate aim towards\nconquest. The role of ambassadors finds a special mention in the Arthashastra.\nAmbassadors are potential spies with diplomatic immunity. They play an important\nrole in apprising the ruler with all inside information of the kingdom they reside in.\nAt the level of foreign policy, the advice of Kautilya is that in foreign policy matters,\none either conquers or suffers conquest depending upon the role of the diplomats and\nthe kings. To explain this, in Arthashastra, he advanced an idea of foreign policy\nbased on expediency. He argued that if the domestic state’s king is weaker than the\nneighbouring king, then the domestic king needs to maintain peace and if domestic\nking is stronger than the neighbour then foreign policy should be driven by war with\n\nan ultimate aim towards conquest.\n\nThus, we can see that when it comes to Arthashastra, it clearly asserts self-\ninterest of a state as the core guiding tool for foreign policy. It also talks about\nalliances, treaties and diplomacies as was undertaken in Greece or in China (as we\nwill see ahead)."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

In fact, the\norigin of balance of power based foreign policy is seen in Europe during modern\ntimes, but was also evident in Greece as early as the ancient period.\n\nThe political entities in Greece in the ancient period were called ‘city states’.\nThe city states had differing forms of political control ranging from monarchy to\naristocracy to oligarchy but were commonly bound by religion and language. All city\nstates were differently governed but were independent of each other. In our study, our\nconcern is mostly about two important Greek city states, namely Sparta and Athens.\nSparta is a classic example of how ancient Greece exercised the concept of power.\nThe location of Sparta was such that in its north lay Athens and south of Sparta was\nthe city state of Peloponnesian. In Sparta, the lower class people were called Helots.\nSparta always believed the southern city states may use Helots to create trouble for\nthe city state Sparta. Thus, to ensure that nothing of this ever happens, to ensure\n\nsecurity of its own city state, Sparta built up alliances in the Peloponnesian peninsula,\nexercised its influence and ensured that none of the Peloponnesian city state use\nHelots and encourage them to revolt. The Peloponnesian states existed independently\nbut supported Sparta at times of need. Sparta also gave liberty to the Peloponnesians\nto exist independently and support Sparta in case of crises. Thus, through this alliance\nnetwork, Sparta ensured its own security effectively.\n\nIn north, Greece had Athens. Athens was frustrated with repeated Persian\ninvasions. To bring about an end to the Persian invasions, the city states of Athens\nformed a Delian League. This League consisted of around 200 city states, all which\nwere vulnerable to repeated Persian invasions. Through this league, Athens\nsuccessfully managed the Persian menace.\n\nThe story of Greece is not just about Athens and Sparta but other powerful city\nstates like Corinth, Thebes and Argos which were also strong and played a role in\nmaintaining the overall balance of power. In one of the wars in 404 BC, Athens got\ndefeated. Seeing this, Sparta began to assert its hegemony. To control the Spartan’s\nhegemony, Corinthians, Thebes and Athens formed an alliance against Sparta. Later\non, a peace treaty was pushed with Sparta to control its assertion. Thus, one can see\nnot only hegemonic tendencies but also anti-hegemonic coalition formed in Greece to\nensure balance of power amongst the states.\n\nThus, through our study of the ancient times, it becomes clear that certain common\ncore features in diplomacy did exist despite differences in space and time. These common\nthreads include\n\n= Alliance formations,\n\n= Self interest of states,\n\n= Importance of cooperation,\n@ Hegemonic assertions\n\n@ Role of treaties in diplomacy\n\nNot only did all these undoubtedly continue in the medieval period, but they were\nthen extended in the modern times, albeit in differing degrees of usage and in varying\nforms. The continuity is observed in Roman Empire in medieval times, including in the\nperiod of Renaissance and Reformation. Obviously, as the world became more complex,\nso did these core threads evolve with time. Let us look at the ‘medieval Roman Empire\nand how it fell to Ottoman conquests,’ finally paving the way for the rise of the modern\nworld."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

This paved the way for the land-owning\nnobles, called the gentry or aristocracy to assert superiority. This period is often known as\na period of feudalism in Europe. The nobles not only controlled the land but also the army.\nThe kings had less and less power with time. The kings were mostly dependent upon the\nnobles to supply soldiers and ammunition for the royal army in case of conflict as the king\nhimself did not possess resources to mobilise a strong army. The impact of feudalism is\nvisible in the society too. The medieval society was a relatively closed society. The nobles\nhad created a very hierarchical system where commodity production was highly\n\ncontrolled. The goods were produced mainly to fulfil domestic societal needs. There was\nabsolutely no need for extra production for any trade. This also proves why society in\nmedieval times was more developed in villages and lacked development for towns and\ncities.\n\nIn the study of international relations, our interest in the medieval period shall be\nrestricted to the West and the Eastern Rome. During this period the international\ndiplomacy as a tool did not flourish in the way it did in the modern times ahead. The main\nreason was the slide of Europe into the dark ages due to feudalistic tendencies. This period\nwas also marked by invasions, wars and ultimately, the Crusades. This period was also a\nperiod of transition. It ultimately began to decline from 1453, which paved the way for the\nrise of the modern world.\n\nIt is generally accepted by historians that Rome began to rise from 753 BC and\ncontinued its existence till 1453. The history of Rome in initial period from 509 BC to 27\nBC is that it existed as a ‘Republic’. The territory was managed by elected officials. It was\nonly from 27 BC to 476 AD that Rome had an Emperor and it is under the leadership of\nlater emperors that the Roman Empire began to expand. It is generally accepted by the\nhistorians that sometime around 117 AD, the Roman Empire was territorially at its peak.\nAs the empire expanded, the governance of a large territory became difficult. It was due to\nadministrative difficulties in governance of this mega-territory that in 285 AD it\ncompelled the Roman Emperor Diocletian to split the empire. From then onward, one part\nof the territory was called Western Rome while other was called Eastern Rome or the\nByzantine Empire. The Western and Eastern Rome began to have distinctive phases of\nhistory.\n\nAlmost beginning around 410 AD, various Germanic barbarians, namely Visigoths,\nbegan invading Western Rome. Western Rome had already depleted a sizeable amount of\nits resources in its conflict with Sassanid Persians. At the time of barbarian invasions,\nWestern Rome was relatively very weak both on the economic and military levels. Thus\nbegan the gradual decline of western Rome and, for the next 500 years, almost till 10th\ncentury, Western Rome crippled and slipped into the dark ages. However, the Pope in\nWestern Rome still managed to consolidate his presence though failing to exercise his\nauthority beyond a particular point.\n\nThis was not the condition in Eastern Rome. The Byzantine Empire or Eastern Rome\nwas located on land which was relatively resource rich. Also, its location was strategic in\nthe sense that it acted as a transit hub for European and Asian trade. Thus, the rulers of\nEastern Rome not only consolidated themselves after the separation, but also reformed\ntheir economic and military institutions at a time when the western part drifted into dark\nages.\n\nBut the success of Byzantine was not to be long lasting. The stability of the\nByzantine Empire had already roused the jealousy of the Pope. There were visible\ntendencies of interference from the Pope in East Rome. To counter and contain the rising\nauthority of the East, the Pope in the West, in 800 AD, crowned Charlemagne as the\nEmperor. But all these attempts to revive the West as a counter to the East ultimately led to\na split in 1054 AD between Holy Roman Emperor’s Churches of the West and that of the\nChurch of the East. This schism in the Church was followed by imperial feuds as to who\n\nwould be the successor in the East. This led to the East focussing more on internal feuds\nthan in presenting a consolidated front to the Seljuk Turks who began to attack the\nByzantine Empire. This internal fixation of the East led to the first blow which came\nwhen, in 1076 AD, the Seljuk Turks successfully defeated the Byzantinians in the battle of\nManzikert. It was from this time that the decline of the East began. The decline of the East\nfinally culminated in 1453 AD when Ottomans (who succeeded Seljuk Turks) defeated the\nEastern Empire with the capture of city of Constantinople.\n\nThus one can see that in the medieval period, western society was a very complex\nmosaic of the Papacy and monarchy. The church did play an important role in laying down\na behavioural norm for medieval societies. The role of the Papacy dominated this period.\nHowever, as we shall later see how, in the times ahead, the role of Pope declined with rise\nof modern states and absolute monarchies.\n\nThe entire medieval world order can be depicted as below:\n\nDukes and Earls\nBarons\n\nKnights\n\nAs one moves down the\nhierarchy, power in the\ngroup declines\n\n-» Completely powerless"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Due to the Crusades, the Europeans had\ngradually come into contact with the people of the Far East. When the Crusaders came\nback to European lands, they brought back a lot of luxurious commodities from the east.\nAs the Europeans gradually got accustomed to these luxuries from the East, the urge to\nacquire more of the same grew. Some of the rich nobles who tasted these luxuries\ndemanded more of them. They started exerting pressures on the land and serfs to produce\nmore in agriculture and crafts so that they could exchange them with the luxuries of the\neast. This pressure on the land and people, coupled with a desire to acquire luxuries, began\nto give the poor more reasons to acquire wealth and seek jobs to meet the rising demands.\n\nGradually all these energies pulsated outwards in its contribution to the gradual\ndecline of feudalism. People began to expand not only their skills but also began to move\nto towns. Gradually, more towns and cities began to emerge. A group of people in towns\nand cities acted as merchants who took control of ensuring the supply of luxuries. As the\n\nproduction in Europe began to increase and as merchants began to engage in more trade,\nthe domestic income in the hands of the new rising middle class began to grow. This also\ncreated an urge amongst this middle class to taste the luxuries. A new system was about to\nemerge even as the old feudal order began to get dismantled. The trade with east began to\nprosper, only to be limited, however, by the Turkish invasion of Constantinople.\n\nThe Turks captured Constantinople in 1453 and it came as a final blow to the\nByzantine Empire, which was already on the verge of decline since 1054 (the great schism\nin the church).\n\nThe situation in Italy in 1453 was relatively different. In Italy, there was negligible\nPapal control. The Papacy, over a period of time, had lost control of the Italian territory.\nItaly was largely controlled by merchants. An atmosphere of free thinking had prevailed\nhere as the merchants were busy in trade. Due to merchant control, a lot of scholars in\nItaly were motivated by the ancient past and were busy digging ancient Greek and Roman\nCultures.\n\nThe moment Turks captured Constantinople in 1453, scholars from Constantinople\nbegan to move to Italy. In Italy, they hardly faced any opposition from the merchants\ncontrolling the city and it began to serve as a sanctuary for scholars. These scholars, over a\nperiod of time, began to intermingle with the scholars in Italy. The scholars who fled\nConstantinople carried with them whatever ancient scholarly work they possessed. This\nled to a further impetus to the existing Italian scholars who were digging ancient Greek\nand Roman cultures.\n\nGradually, due to the integration of scholars in the system, coupled with an\nenvironment conducive for free thinking, Italy began to emerge as a centre of learning.\nScholars in Italy increased their intensity in digging ancient Greek and Roman cultures.\nThere was a sudden revival of ancient Greek and Roman cultures and a new urge to\nappreciate the ancient past and ancient classics.\n\nThe reading of the ancient past gave Europe a new lease of life. His thought\nprocesses gradually began to change. Man began to appreciate the ability to reason. For\nhim, this revival of study of ancient past and subsequent gain of aspiration culminated in a\nlandmark movement called the Renaissance. Renaissance freed man from the tutelage of\nthe past and encouraged him to think beyond. Not only did his mental horizons begin to\nwiden but it was coupled with another important invention—the press.\n\nOne of the most important things to happen during this period was the invention of\nthe printing press. The press provided an impetus to making the greatness of the ancient\npast available to all. This was accompanied by a rise in the vernacular languages. The\ntexts were now made available for the larger population to read. This increased the\ncuriosity of the common people, who, after reading ancient texts, including, more\nimportantly the Bible, began to develop a critical spirit of enquiry. This particularly laid\nthe seeds for religious reformation.\n\nRenaissance as a movement began to spread and it not only awakened man’s mind\nbut also taught him to appreciate other humans. This appreciation and love of humans saw\nits manifestations in art, architecture, sculpture, music, paintings, and so forth. It\ndeveloped during this period as a force under humanism.\n\nRenaissance certainly brought about the propensity towards rationality in the minds\nof people and encouraged them to think independently. It also encouraged people to\ncriticise things that lacked logic. Renaissance revolutionised the human mind and\ninculcated a spirit of learning.\n\nThis period of Renaissance is also crucial for other developments that paved ways for\nthe rise of modern Europe. Firstly, when Turks captured Constantinople, they also got hold\nof all trade routes by Europe and Asia. Europe witnessed a situation of deprivation of\noriental luxuries. The Europeans were gradually becoming impatient. They understood\nthat the Turks would act as obstructions in case of trade with the east. The Europeans now\nbegan to search for new trade routes and this search for the same paved way for the rise of\ngeographical discoveries. The geographical discoveries gave rise to a new merchant class\nand a subsequent new middle class in Europe which became a new social force. This class\nbegan to accumulate wealth and made attempts to control municipalities and later on, state\npower. Geographical discoveries also increased the ambition of men to reach new\nterritories to undertake more trade. Thus, this was the time period when we witnessed the\nrebirth of Europe. The Renaissance and geographical discoveries gave it the much-needed\npush.\n\nAnother important development of this period was invention of gunpowder. This\nbrought about a radical shift in political power structures. In the medieval feudal world\norder, as we saw previously, the kings were basically dependent upon standing armies\nfrom the nobles and barons. As the invention of gunpowder happened, the kings now were\nnot dependent upon nobles for armed support anymore. The relevance of nobles gradually\nbegan to decline, and taking advantage of invention of gunpowder, the kings began to take\ncontrol of the armies and began consolidation of their positions. The kings began not only\nto consolidate their positions but also began to give impetus to the rising middle class and\ntook steps to promote trade. The monarchs began to accept the new social rules and also\ndecided to shed off the medieval social order in favour of the new social rules and a new\nsociety.\n\nOne of the other crucial things happening in this period was gradual birth of a\nmovement called the Reformation.\n\nThe roots of Reformation could be very well traced in the ongoing revival or rebirth\nof Europe. Renaissance and geographical discoveries gave birth to trade and a rise of the\nmerchant class. This new merchant class made cities their new homes. As people saw\nopportunities for intellectual and material growth in cities, they gradually began to migrate\noutwards from villages to cities. The intellectual revolution brought about by the\nRenaissance also encouraged people to challenge the medieval notions of the authority of\nthe church. Over a period of time, as the printing press was discovered, not only did it\ncontribute in making available classics of ancient past for people, but the boost to\nvernaculars also led to translation of Bible for the common man who was hitherto unable\nto read it in traditional Latin. As people read the Bible, they began to question the\nauthority of the Church more than before. Two things clearly emerged out of this new\nsituation. Firstly, the rise of a city life drastically reduced the revenue of the church. As\npeople began to move to cities, they paid less attention on the church and focussed more\non survival. This drastically reduced the availability of money to the church. Church\n\nseriously needed finance to re-assert its authority over the people. Due to commercial\nrevolution and a need to sustain oriental luxuries, there was a thrust amongst monarchs to\npromote trade and patronise the emerging middle class to consolidate their position. Due\nto this, many monarchs also felt lesser need to use church for state power. The monarchs\nalso did not feel like risking the use of the church to suppress a newly emerging social\norder. Also, the past events like the Great Schism of 1054 had already caused cracks in the\nauthority of the Church.\n\nMore importantly, the invention of the printing press facilitated the emergence of\nreligious reformers like Martin Luther. In 1517, Pope Leo X desperately needed money to\ncomplete the construction of St. Peter’s Cathedral in Rome. To collect money, the Pope\nauthorised the sale of something called indulgences. The idea of indulgences went back to\nthe times of the Crusades. The logic was that if person committed a sin, he or she could\nask for forgiveness from God by purchasing an indulgence from the Pope on offering the\nrequired payment. The justification involved was that a person paying for the indulgence\nis paying a part of his hard earned money as a sacrifice to the Church and thus, God would\nforgive the person for his sacrifice. In 1517, when Martin Luther saw the authorisation of\nindulgence sale by Pope Leo-X, he stimulated a debate on the sale of indulgences and\nbegan to question its rationality. This debate ended years later not only in religious\nreforms in the church but ultimately concluded with a split in Christianity, leading to the\nrise of Protestantism along with existing Catholicism. The religious question concluded\nwith the Thirty Years’ War which ended in the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 and finally\nended the religious question once and for all in Europe.\n\nRenaissance, the Reformation and new geographical discoveries not only created a\nnew spatial awareness and an interest in cartography but also emphasised the need of\nterritorial expansion and strictly defined boundaries. The balance of power now became a\nnew instrument which would act to mitigate hegemony, thus rendering it a new tool in\nstatecraft. As the developments mentioned previously brought about a new doctrine of\nsovereign independence in Europe, the rise of the nation states and absolute monarchy\nushered Europe into a new phase of conflict. The Peace of Westphalia (1648) Peace of\nWestphalia, European settlements of 1648, which brought to an end the Eighty Years’ War\nbetween Spain and the Dutch and the German phase of the Thirty Years’ War, was the\npeace negotiated, from 1644, in the Westphalian towns of Miinster and Osnabriick. The\nSpanish-Dutch treaty was signed on January 30, 1648. This treaty finally ended the\nreligious struggle of Europe which began with the Reformation. The Peace of Westphalia\nstated clearly that the rulers of states have the right to observe religious tolerance in their\ninternal policies and there will be no Papal interference in religious affairs of the state. As\nthe Peace of Westphalia accepted that rulers of the states would have the right to decide\nthe religion of its subjects, it also was a clear acknowledgement of the state sovereignty.\nAdditionally, Spain also recognised the independence of the Dutch Republic.\n\nThe Peace of Westphalia created a basis for national self-determination and\nestablished the precedent of peace established by diplomatic congress. It also founded a\nnew system of political order in central Europe, later called Westphalian sovereignty,\nbased upon the concept of co-existing sovereign states. Inter-state aggression was to be\nheld in check by a balance of power. A norm was established against interference in\nanother state’s domestic affairs. As European influence spread across the globe, these\n\nWestphalian principles, especially the concept of sovereign states, became central to\ninternational law and to the prevailing world order.\n\nAt the political level, in 1700, in Europe the crisis emerged again on the question of\nsuccession to of the powerful Spanish crown after the death of Charles II, the last\nHabsburg king of Spain. The concern was that whosoever would be the successor of Spain\nshould be able to preserve balance of power. The challenge of succession was more\ndependent upon external forces like France and Austria, who, due to imperial\nrelationships, made equal claims. The war of Spanish succession came to an end with the\nTreaty of Intercut in 1713 which recognised the principle of the balance of power.\n\nAs the kings consolidated positions, their energies pulsated outwards and the urge to\nconquer lands for sustaining the new commercial and intellectual revolution. All this\nfirstly stabilised Europe, and secondly, gave birth to diplomacy. Not only did the states\nbegin to rise to the logic of territoriality but the states’ interests became so inextricably\nlinked with each other that if one state took an unwelcome measure, it affected others and\nthis led to a reaction by other states to normalise the unification, which gave way to rise of\nconcept of the balance of power. States realised that they needed a path open to the other\nstates through which important information and dialogue could flow. This paved way for\nrise of permanent ambassadors who began playing an important role in international\npolitics of the newborn Europe.\n\nThe king also realised the need to rehabilitate the nobles who were disenchanted\nbecause of their deliberate neglect by the king and thus, initially, it was the nobility that\nacted as the first diplomats in the diplomatic corps of the modern times. This gave\neliteness to the concept of diplomacy which happened due to rehabilitation of the nobles\nin the diplomatic corps and is visible even today in the practice of 21* century diplomacy.\nThus, this period saw the rise of a professional diplomatic service that had the ability to\nmaintain the balance of power through treaties which no more had religious sanctions but\nwere based on an agreement as per international law. Thus, the period from Renaissance\ntill the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 introduced in Europe the period of stability and brought\nabout rise of the principles of modern society like sovereignty, non intervention,\ninstitutions of diplomacy, balance of power and international law.\n\nMeanwhile, as trade flourished through new sea routes, it could not be financed\nanymore through money from individual merchants. There was felt a need for a more\norganised source of trade finance. This led to the rise of joint stock companies to finance\ntrade. As geographical discoveries continued, there came an age of enlightenment. This\nenlightenment by intellectual scholars which was a continuation of the spirit ignited by the\nRenaissance and reason had a profound impact on European society. The age of\nEnlightenment encouraged the man to think freely and scholars and intellectuals lent\nsupport in building a societal foundation based on reason and critical enquiry. The\nEnlightenment had two consequences on the European history. It, firstly, produced the\nspark for political revolutions and secondly, gave impetus to experimentation which\nultimately led to the industrial revolution.\n\nThe first cataclysmic event in the west was the American Revolution. The\nEnlightenment scholars had an effective contribution in igniting and sustaining the\nstruggle. The sustained intellectual contributions of Jefferson, Locke, Milton and Thomas\n\nPaine are a testimony to the fact. In 1776, America finally became a republic. It witnessed\nits own troubles in the form of civil wars in its road to stability. But the American\nRevolution had two important consequences. The first was that it sowed the seeds for a\nrevolution in France and the second, the ideal of democracy was seen as an inspiration by\nthe French. This paved way for the French revolution in 1789 which was based on the\nideas of liberty, equality and fraternity. The ideas spearheaded by the French Revolution\nresonated deeply amongst Europeans almost till 1945.\n\nThis intellectual revolution also brought about an urge in man to indulge in\nexperimentation. The manifestation of this spirit was seen at the industrial level where\nman began developing modern techniques of production. His thinking and application of\nreason in industry was encouraged through the ongoing period of Enlightenment. This\nintellectual revolution ultimately paved way for important changes in industrial production\nand gradually provided a strong imperative for the industrial revolution. As the industrial\nrevolution progressed, the monarchs not only felt an urge to procure resources to fuel\ndomestic industrial build-up but also felt the need to establish markets to sell their\nproducts. A strong need was felt to get resources and slaves for continuing the industrial\nrevolution. At the economic level, the manifestation of Enlightenment was a new\neconomic policy of ‘Mercantilism’ (dealt with later in detail) which developed and\nengulfed the thinking of European monarchs.\n\nThe search for new trade destinations for resources, slaves and later, markets for\nproduced goods, fuelled the industrial revolution and later contributed to the increase in\nthe interstate rivalry in Europe. As France, Denmark and Britain began to industrialise,\nthey gave way to imperial endeavours. The British certainly had the edge considering they\nwere the first amongst Europeans to stabilise politically through democracy which was\nestablished successfully after the Glorious Revolution of 1688. the situation created\nenormous desperation amongst Europeans to colonise distant lands in Asia and Africa.\nThe impulse to colonise of Asia and Africa certainly owes its origin to the mercantilist and\nimperialist behaviour of these absolute monarchs.\n\nThe fight amongst the Europeans to colonise the other part of the world created\nintense inter-European rivalry. This rivalry ultimately paved way for urge amongst\nEuropeans to maintain balance of power. To maintain this balance of power, the Europeans\nexperimented with a multitude of alliances. But, none of the alliance systems were\nadequate to prevent this rivalry from emerging again and again. This intense rivalry\nfuelled a situation of enormous mistrust and suspicion. These alliances certainly took the\nentire Europe to a very dangerous and volatile scenario where a major conflict was\ngradually becoming inevitable. Inter-state rivalry and the urge to stop the other nations to\ncolonise distant lands and ensure one’s own supremacy in the continent as a dominant\npower brought Europe to its first continental conflict which became a world conflict later,\nand was called the World War-I.\n\nThe next chapter creates a foundation of international history by explaining the\nevents building up to WW I, the inter war period and WW II."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The Industrial Revolution had led many Europeans nations to lead the search for\nresources and new markets. One of the manifestations of this was imperialism and\ncolonialism. Africa and Asia were the new battlegrounds for an imperialist Europe. As\nIndustrial Revolution progressed in Europe, it created stronger, more powerful economies\nback home. If the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 led to the emergence of strong political\nentities in the form of the nation states, then it is Industrial revolution that created strong\neconomies in Europe. Some prominent economies by 1900 were France, Britain, Belgium,\nthe Hapsburg Empire, Japan, Italy, USA and Germany.\n\nA special mention of USA and Germany needs to be made here. In the previous\nchapter we studied that America undertook a successful revolution and declared\nindependence in 1776. After Declaration of Independence it witnessed a mild civil war but\novercome it soon and embarked upon a programme of economic recovery. America almost\ngot a full century to undertake economic development without any external interference.\nFrom almost 1800 to 1900, as America was on a steady path to economic empowerment,\nthis time Europe started witnessing revolutions. Also this was the time period (1800 to\n1900) when Europeans also began Industrial Revolution, imperialism and colonialism.\nThis gave USA an opportunity to emerge as a strong player during World War-I.\n\nSimilarly, if we see that Germany, after its unification by Bismarck, had embarked\nupon a programme of rapid industrialisation, as also a path of colonial acquisitions.\nGermany, by 1900, became a very strong economic contender for power in Europe and\nalong with its new love for colonial conquests (Weltpolitik), it ended up outranking the\nBritish and French. Germany, empowered by its economic success, began to use its wealth\nfor enhancing its military and naval power. Soon Europe witnessed a tremendous rise in\nAnglo-German naval rivalry.\n\nApart from this, the strong economies of Europe also began to feel extremely\nsuspicious of each other’s economic success. Everyone wanted to ensure that the other\ndoes not become so economically powerful as to threaten somebody else’s existence. One\nconsequence of this insecurity was alliance formation. It began in 1882, when German and\nAustria Hungary formed an alliance which was subsequently followed by the Franco-\nRussian alliance in 1894 and, most importantly, the British and French Entente Cordiale of\n\n1904. In fact, at the time of outbreak of the WW I, these alliances played a very important\nrole. Some scholars, in fact, are of the view that it was these alliances and the bid to\nmaintain the balance of power that led to the-WW I. But, it would be wrong to accept it as\nthe sole cause of-the war, because there were many other immediate causes that—were\nresponsible for it, of which colonial rivalry was certainly a much bigger contributory\nfactor, along with the fervour of intense nationalism.\n\nSerbian nationalism in this context needs to be elaborated. The root cause of Serbian\ndissent was over Bosnia. In 1878, the Territory of Berlin was signed and as per this treaty,\nAustria was allowed to control Bosnia even while Bosnia would continue to be a part of\nthe Turkish Empire. On the other hand, Serbia had an aim of establishing a greater Serbia\nby uniting all Serbs and Croats living in the Balkans into large kingdom called Yugoslavia,\nfor which it needed control over Bosnia. Austria did not support Serbian nationalism and\nwanted to put an end to it because Austria knew that if Serbia has its way of getting Serbs\nand Croats, it would endanger the stability of the-Austro-Hungarian Empire because of\nthe large number of Serbs residing there. Serbians were supported by the Russians, on the\nother hand. For Russia, the Balkan was the only territory left where other European\npowers had not undertaken colonial expansion. The Russian support to Serbia was also not\nappreciated by Austrians at all.\n\nThus, to conclude, we may say that by 1900, Europe economically was able to assert\nitself, but was also in a very volatile situation because economic success ignited a race for\ncolonialism which created intense inter-state rivalry threatening the European balance of\npower and to maintain this balance of power, alliances were formed which again made the\noutbreak of a war imminent. Apart from this, as we saw in case of Serbia, nationalism\nitself was one of the causes of rivalry, and eventually brought Europe on the verge of\nworld war. Other reasons for unrest were the crisis in Morocco, the crisis in Bosnia, Agade\nand the war in Balkans. Some of these major sparks can be seen in the form of cases\nbelow."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Germany was quite\nalarmed to witness the treaty between the two erstwhile rivals and wanted to see if\nthis entente cordialle would genuinely hold fast under duress. It tried to test the\nentente in Morocco. Morocco was one area in Africa which was not yet fully\ncolonised by any European power but the French were adamant to control the\nMoroccan police and its banking system. The Germans openly began to assert their\nsupport to the Moroccan Sultan. In order to put an end to the rivalry in Morocco, the\n\nGermans organised a conference in 1906 in Algeciras in Spain. The British\nunderstood that in case the Germans are able to control Morocco through their\nsupport to the sultan, it would be a victory of German diplomacy and would\nultimately strengthen German Weltpolitik. Realising this in the conference in\nAlgeciras, British began to support the French. To Germany’s surprise, the French\nalso got support for their plan to control the bank and police of Morocco from Spain,\nRussia and Italy. This conference in Algeciras ultimately ended in support for the\nFrench by the majority and was not only a big diplomatic boost to the British and\nFrench cordialle but a big blow to Germany.\n\nAfter the crisis in Morocco, in 1907, Britain and Russia also concluded an agreement.\nThis was natural as Russia and France had already concluded an agreement in 1894 and\nBritish and French in 1904. After the defeat of Russia by Japan in-Russo—Japanese War of\n1905, Russia was badly in need of financial help. The British were not willing to help an\nautocratic Russia under the control of the Tsar. To ensure that British help Russians, the\nTsar in 1905 had made certain concessions for the Russian society of which the most\nimportant was the freedom of speech. These little concessions enabled the British to\nconclude an agreement with Russia and enabled it to receive the much needed financial\nhelp. However, the Germans, witnessing the agreement between the British and the\nRussians, now became deeply concerned again. The British had signed agreements with\nthe Russians and the French, both of them encircled Germany. The Germans now\ndeveloped a fear of encirclement by the British and their allies.

The major territory in Balkan region\ncomprised of Serbia, Greece, Montenegro and Bulgaria. Now the situation by 1912\nwas that Turkey or Ottoman territory had drastically weakened. Taking advantage of\na weakened Ottoman territory, the major Balkan states of Serbia, Montenegro,\nGreece and Bulgaria established a Balkan League. The Balkan League launched an\nattack on Ottoman territory with an intention of undertaking territorial expansion.\nThe British and the Germans were alarmed to witness this Balkan expansion. They\norganised a conference in London where they announced a settlement plan. The aim\nof the settlement plan was to put an end to the expansionist urges of the Balkan\nStates. The British were well aware of the rise of Serbian Nationalism. To ensure that\nSerbia does not become a powerful player outright in the Balkans, they drew up a\nsettlement plan in which they insisted upon having an independent Albania. An\nindependent Albania made the Serbs extremely dissatisfied as they wanted Albania to\nbe a part of Serbia, which would have given the Serbs an access to the sea, and would\nnot only serve to make Serbia strong, but would have also put Austria in a weaker\nsituation vis-d-vis Serbia.

On 28th June 1914, the Austrian Archduke, Franz Ferdinand,\nwhile on tour in Sarajevo, Bosnia, was shot dead by a Serbian terrorist, Gavrilo\nPrincip. The Austrians blamed Serbia for this. On 28th July, 1914, Austria declared a\nwar on Serbia. Serbia asked for military help from Russia. Russia obviously never\nwanted a repeat of its failure to help Serbia as earlier, and so, it ordered immediate\nmilitary mobilisation. Germany ordered a halt to Russian mobilisation. The outright\nrefusal by Russians to comply with Germany’s request compelled Germany to\ndeclare a war on Russia. Germany went on to even declare a war on France as\nGermany thought that the Russians and the French have an agreement and Russia\nwould eventually get French help. When Germany decided to attack France, it had to\ncross over Belgium, which had thus far remained a neutral state. Belgium had not\nformed any alliances. In fact in 1839, even Britain had assured Belgium that they\nrespected, and would uphold, their neutrality. As Germany proceeded to attack\nFrance and entered Belgium, the British ordered Germany to withdraw. The Germany\nrefused to comply, leading Britain to declare war on Germany. Towards 1917, the\nUSA found out that Germany was trying to persuade Mexico to wage a war on the\nUSA. In the entire duration of the war, Germany was reluctant to help Russia as it\nwas under the rule of autocratic Tsar but by 1917 April there was a Revolution in\nRussia (to be explained ahead). The USA was already supplying men and material\nsupport to Britain and France and after the Communist revolution in Russia, it\ndecided to become a proper supporter, thereby ending up in strengthening the allied\nsection of Britain, France and Russia. The support of the US in the war wreaked an\nultimate blow on Germany and Austria and helped to conclude the war. This\nEuropean conflict, which later on became a global conflict, owed its origin to the\nalliances, mutual hostility and intense nationalism of the nation states. It involved not\nonly the armies but also people on a large scale, making it truly the first ever modern,\ntotal and global war.\n\nAs the World War-I (WW-I) ended Britain, France and the USA emerged victorious.\nRussia and Italy were also amongst the victorious. Now it was time for the entente powers\nto take decisions about the central powers. The powers that lost the WW-I included\nAustria, Turkey and more importantly, Germany. The end of WW-I saw a rise of multiple\ntreaties that gave birth to future conflicts, including the WW-II.\n\n<> > Entente cordialle wins\n\n» Treaty of Versailles -The League of Nations\nBased on 14 points of Woodrow Wilson ~ > Established by a league convent\n\n» Treaty of St. Germain, 1919 —> Austria\n\n» Treaty of Neuilly, 1919-—» Bulgaria\n\n~» Treaty of Trianon, 1920» Hungary\n\nThe Treaty of Versailles of 1919 emerged as one of the landmark treaties at the end of\nWW-I. The importance of Treaty of Versailles can be gleaned from the fact that it\ncontained a league covenant which established an international body called the League of\n\nNations. This was followed by a specific demand by the British and the French to make\nGermany pay for war damages. The provisions for German reparations and compensation\nfor damages was made a part of Treaty of Versailles and sowed the seeds for the WW-II.\nThe treaty wanted to ensure that Germany would not emerge as a threat to Britain and\nFrance in the future. To ensure this, the Treaty of Versailles made Germany accept that it\nwould lose its colonial possessions, have a very limited military cum economic built up\nand pay to the British and French not only reparations but also share its resources with the\ntwo. Germany lost 12% of its population and 13% of its territory. Alsace-Lorraine, which\nhad been ceded to the German Empire by France after the Franco-Prussian War of 1871,\nwas taken back by France, and proved one of the biggest losses for Germany to have\nborne. Germany was also split into two with the creation of the Polish Corridor, which\ngave Poland access to the Baltic Sea.\n\nThe Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, 1919, dealt with Austria where it ended up\nlosing tremendous territory including Bohemia and Moravia which were given\nCzechoslovakia, Dalmatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, which were given to Serbia and was\nmerged with Montenegro to form Yugoslavia. Thus, the Treaty of St. Germain undertook\nterritorial division creating Yugoslavia. As per the treaty, Poland got Romania, Galicia and\nBukovina from Austria while Italy received South Tyrol and Istria. Thus, the Austro—\nHungarian or Hapsburg Empire finally broke up.\n\nIn 1920 came the Treaty of Trianon which divided the Hungarian territory whence\nHungary along with Slovakia and Ruthenia was given to the Czech, creating\nCzechoslovakia with Hungary. Burgenland was given to Austria, Yugoslavia got Croatia\nand Slovenia while Romania received the territory of Transylvania. Hungary lost two-\nthirds of its territory after this treaty.\n\nThe Treaty of Neuilly was signed in November 1919 to divide Bulgarian territory.\nWestern Thrace was given to Greece; Dobrudja was given to Romania and Northern\nMacedonia was given to Yugoslavia via this treaty.\n\nThe Treaty of Sevres came in 1920 to divide Turkey. The British got administrative\nrights over the territories of Iraq, Palestine and Transjordan while the French got Syria and\nLebanon. This formalised the ‘Mandate system’. Some Aegean Sea islands, East Trace\nand Smyrna were given transferred from Turkey to Greece while Italy got Adalia and\nRhodes from Turkey. Surprisingly, the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923 gave Turkey East\nThrace, Smyrna and Constantinople back. Saudi Arabia became independent.\n\nThe aim of the Treaty of Versailles through League Covenants was also to establish\nthe League of Nations. But before the League was established, in the transitory period\nfollowing up to the League, a body called a Conference of Ambassadors was established.\nThe body had to cease once the League of Nations was finally created. The League of\nNations was established on the principles of collective security but it certainly did fail to\npreserve peace. This failure is apparent in the sense that despite its existence, the WW-II\ndid occur. It would be wrong to assert, however, that the outbreak of the WW-II can be\nattributed solely to failure of the League. There were other reasons contributing to the\nconflict as we will see ahead. The League of Nations also succeeded in some instances, for\nexample,\n\n@ Instance 1: There was a dispute that broke out between Finland and Sweden\nover the Aaland Island. The League successfully arbitrated the dispute in favour\nof Finland.\n\n@ Instance 2: Successfully established the sub-organisations under the League,\nlike Labour organisation, Refugee organisation and Health organisation, which\ncontinued a sub-organisations of the United Nations after it was formed.\n\nBut largely, the League remained unsuccessful as the the US Senate refused to ratify\nLeague of Nations and Treaty of Versailles as it did not want to support the Artcile X of\nthe League of Nations whereby it was proclaimed that members of the League agreed to\nuse their powers to resist aggression wherever it might occur. The US did not sign the\nTreaty of Versailles, which had a huge impact on the League of Nations. The period after\nthe treaties was not a relatively stable period as the treaties had sown seeds for deep\nresentment leading to future conflict. Germany and Italy were certainly the two most\ndisgruntled parties after the Treaty of Versailles had been signed.\n\nItaly had joined the WW-I with a hope that, after the war, it would receive some\nterritory. However, Italy was not happy with the post-war settlement of lands. Also, its\nparticipation in the war lead to its poor domestic economic performance and its\nunhappiness over post-war settlement led to the gradual rise of Mussolini in Italy who\nwent on to establish the first ever Fascist State.\n\nThe issue for Germany was different. The German question deeply involved the\nBritish and French. When the World War-I ended, Germany had lost as a participant and\nas per the Treaty of Versailles, it was required to pay reparations. The French, before\n1919, had already suffered two German attacks. France, being one of the victorious\npowers, wanted to teach the Germans a hard lesson. The French favoured a weak\nGermany. In contrast, the British never wanted a very weak Germany since they were of\nthe opinion that German economy though weak enough, should still be able to purchase\nBritish goods and function as a ready market.\n\nTo resolve the issue, many attempts were made. Post Treaty of Versailles, the German\neconomy found itself devastated. Several times did Germany convey its inability to pay\nsuch harsh reparations as were imposed upon it in the treaty. The French would not accept\nany leniency, though the British certainly were more sympathetic in this regard. In 1922,\nwhen Germany again expressed its inability to pay reparations, the French responded in\n1923 by occupying the region of Ruhr from Germany. Ruhr was an important industrial\nbase. The British wanted to ensure that some peace prevails between Germany and France\nas even the USA wanted the same. Certain attempts to cool down the situations are evident\nfrom the Genoa conference where British thought to end German-French disenchantment\nover reparations. The US also tried to help out by extending monetary assistance to\nGermany. Through the Dawes plan, it tried to enable Germany by giving it loans to ensure\nthe payment of reparations to France. An attempt was again made in 1925 by the British\nthrough the Locarno treaties to put an end to territorial aggression. The execution of the\nKellogg Briand pact in 1928 ensured that 65 nations, including the USA and France,\nrenounced war.\n\nHowever, all these attempts received a serious setback in 1929 when the economic\ncrisis of the Great Depression occurred. All attempts by Germany to improve situations at\n\nhome and abroad received a setback. The German people were very angry with their\ngovernment for not tackling inflation and unemployment at home. The economic crisis of\n1929 gave an opportunity to the socialists.\n\nA brief note on political situation of Germany may enhance our understanding. After\nthe end of WW-I, the Germans adopted a new constitution in Weimer which gave it a new\nname—The Weimer Republic. The new Chancellor of Germany from 1923 was Gustav\nStresemann, who later continued to be the Foreign Minister of Germany till his death in\n1929. The major treaties and pacts that saw Germany’s recovery and its induction into the\nLeague of Nations as a permanent member of the security council in 1926 is credited to\nthe Nobel Peace Prize winning Stresemann. Stresemann died just as Germany was being\nhit by the economic crisis of 1929. Germany’s inability to meet domestic economic\npressures and its failure to pay smooth reparations led to the collapse of the Weimer\nRepublic in 1932 but, the systematic weakness of the German society post 1929 paved\nway of rise of the National Socialist German Worker’s Party (NAZI Party).\n\nThe Nazi party began a campaign of hope for the people. They pledged to the people\nthat, if voted into power, they would work for the revival of the economy. By 1933, the\nNazi party was able to secure a handsome electoral victory, paving the way for rise of\nHitler. He not only defied the treaty of Versailles and began economic and military\nproduction but also began work to restore the German psyche by inculcating a spirit of\nfierce national pride.\n\nHe gave effect to his theory of racial superiority, propounded by his deputy Joseph\nGoebbels, which ultimately ended up causing the Holocaust. He also announced a special\npolicy of Lebensraum, literally meaning the justified territory a nation believes is needed\nfor its natural development. The basic idea of Lebensraum was to get more space for the\nGerman people, which, according to him, was, in the form of the existing territory less\nthan what Germany needed to flourish, necessitating him to add extra territory by the\nconquest of war.\n\nBefore we proceed further to the events leading to the outbreak of the WW-II, a\nspecial emphasis needs to be put on Japan and Russia in the inter-war period. This is\nexplained through case studies below."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

When, in 1905,\n\na war started between Japan and Russia, Russia was defeated in the war. This also\ncontributed in lowering the domestic prestige of the Tsar.

As the World War I ended, the Treaty of Brest-\nLitovsk was concluded whereby Russians lost the territory of Poland, Georgia,\nFinland, Latvia, Lithuania and Ukraine. As Lenin began the consolidation of power,\nhe witnessed revolts from Mensheviks and also the Tsarists pushing Russia to the\nbrink of a civil war. Lenin, however, emerged successful and began to assert\ncommunism as an alternate to Tsarist rule. He succeeded in establishing the world’s\nfirst communist state called the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). The\ncreation of the USSR created enormous suspicion amongst the western states. Lenin\ndied in 1924, before the USSR could fully delineate its contours. The Russian system\nnow came under the control of Joseph Stalin, who consolidated his position through\nthe ‘Purges’ (aimed to end all opposition he may face) and the Gulag, the government\nagency that administered the Soviet forced labour camps.

Perry advocated that Japan open up its\nterritory for trade. The US heavily used Yokohama for trade. The Japanese felt very\nhumiliated at their territory being used by a colonial power for trade and its own\nsphere of influence. It was only in 1868 that Japan witnessed the Meiji restoration\nwhere Emperor Meiji re-established his grip on Japan and took on the path of\neconomic recovery. Meiji also embarked upon an expansion to annex Korea and\nMaunchuria, eventually bringing Japan into direct conflict with China in 1894-95\nand with Russia in 1904-05. Japan very successfully defeated both China and Russia.\nSpecifically after defeating Russia in 1904-1905, it emerged as a major power actor\nof the Far East. It was also in 1906 that Japan and Britain concluded a militarily pact.\nJapan effectively sided with the entente in the World War | and helped the British in\nlaunching attacks on the German bases in China. Japan was also present during the\nsigning of Treaty of Versailles in 1919 and was also a founder member of the League\n\nof Nations. The situation in Japan drastically changed after the world global\neconomic crisis in 1929. The domestic economy witnessed severe crises. The\nEmperor was unable to control his empire as there was rampant corruption. Also\nJapan began to face problems in its territories in China, especially Manchuria.\nGradually, due to all these factors, the army in Japan began to take control.\nManchuria was a territory in China that was being controlled by Japan. Due to the\neconomic crisis and the ensuing weakness of Japan to take on the crisis, China tried\nto put pressure on Japan for withdrawal. The Japanese army feared that Japan could\nlose an important outpost in Manchuria where they had significant interest. The\nJapanese army in 1931 attacked Manchuria. This was done by the army without the\nJapanese government’s approval. The then Japanese Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi\nordered a halt but the Japanese army was not keen on taking the Premier’s advice.\nChina took the matter to the League of Nation which ruled that both sides (China and\nJapan) are at a flaw and ordered Japan to withdraw from Manchuria. Japan refused to\ncomply with the directives of the League and left the membership of the League.\nEuropean states like Britain and France could not impose any economic sanctions on\nJapan as they were themselves crumbling under the economic crisis (of 1929). From\nthen onwards, the Manchurian crisis clearly asserted the failure of the League of\nNations to ensure compliance and Japan did remain a power actor till 1944, when the\nWW-II ended in its defeat."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Benito Mussolini was in power in Italy\nand Adolf Hitler in Germany. We also saw that in Germany Hitler had announced his\nfamous Lebensraum policy.\n\nTo give effect to Lebensraum, in 1939, Hitler invaded Czechoslovakia and Poland.\nThis invasion again plunged Europe into conflict, ultimately leading to the World War-II,\nwhich was waged in the period between September 1939 and September 1945. Between\nSeptember 1939 and December 1940 is the time when Lebensraum saw execution when\nGermany attacked Poland and Czechoslovakia. The Russians went to consolidate their\npositions in the territories they lost by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk specially Estonia,\nLatvia, Lithuania and Finland. Germans moved at lightning speed in attacking Denmark,\nNorway, Holland, Belgium and France. In September 1940, Germans fought the British in\nBattle of Britain but the British retaliated well. In June 1941, Hitler had concluded a Pact\nof Non-Aggression with Russia. But in October 1941, Hitler violated the pact of non-\naggression, and after initial successes in the war, launched an operation called Operation\nBarbarossa and attacked Russia. Germany made inroads into Russia but could not reach\nMoscow and Leningrad due to hostile climate and an excessively harsh Russian winter.\nEmperor Hirohito of Japan wanted to stay out of WW-II initially, but after witnessing the\nsuccess of Germany, he indulged in some military adventurism. The Japanese army\ncaptured Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Burma and Philippines. Japan also concluded\n\na pact with Germany where the Germans assured the Japanese every support in the event\nof an attack from the USA.\n\nThe Japanese army, meanwhile, on 7 December, 1941, launched an offensive on the\nUS naval base at Pearl Harbour. This brought the hitherto reticent USA into the conflict,\nand it entered the war against Japan. As per the Germany-—Japan alliance, Germany\ndeclared war on the USA. Germans, on the other hand, continued to face Russian\nresistance. The US first defeated Japan by successfully destroying Japanese military, then\nits navy and finally its air power. The USA then moved to support the British, French and\nthe Russians.\n\nThe entry of the US in WW- II was a game changer. Firstly, Britain, France and the\nUS, having made inroads through Sicily, caused the downfall of Mussolini. Thereafter, the\nAllied powers used Sicily as a base to attack the Germans in the Balkans and Central\nEurope. It was on 6 June, 1944, that Operation Overlord was launched by the Allies\nleading to the opening of the second front. The combined forces landed in Normandy\ncompelling the Germans to retreat from France and Russia. The conditions by May, 1945,\nwere such that Germany surrendered unconditionally while Britain and the US continued\nattacking Japan. The US finally dropped two atomic bombs on Hiroshima (6 August,\n1945) and Nagasaki (9 August, 1945) leading to a total Japanese surrender by 14 August\n1945 thereby ending World War-II.\n\nThe end of the war saw the replacement of the League of Nations with the United\nNations as a new, more effective arbitrator of peace. However, as the war concluded with\nthe USA and Russia emerging victorious, the world entered a new phase of history called\nthe Cold War.

Truman (US President).\nTreaties: Treaty of Riga, 1921 and Molotov—Ribbentrop Pact.\n\nPoland existed as an independent state till 1795. However, after 1795, the Polish\nterritory was divided into parts by Russia, Austria and Prussia. The Poles kept on\nfighting for independence till World War-I. After the WW-I, Poland managed to get\nWest Prussia back from Germany, thereby enabling Poland to have access to the sea.\nAfter the 1921 war between Poland and Russia, Poland, through the Treaty of Riga\n(1921) got a huge territory in the East near the Russian border. As the World War-II\nprogressed, and Germans attacked Poland in 1939, Britain and France helped Poland\nin its fight against Germany. At the end of WW-II, Germany was expelled out of\nPoland. During the WW-II period, there was a government in Poland which existed\nin exile in London. It certainly wanted to be back in Poland after WW-II. But before\nthe commencement of WW-II, Stalin had also reached an understanding with Hitler\n\nabout the fate of Poland. Stalin, through his foreign minister Molotov, had concluded\nthe Molotov—Ribbentrop Pact that assured Russia and Germany non-aggression from\neach other. However, Hitler violated the pact to use Poland as a base to attack Russia.\nAs per the Molotov—Ribbentrop pact, Hitler had allowed Russia to exercise control\nover East Poland (the area Russia had prior to Treaty of Riga 1921). But after the\nWW-II, Russia was determined to ensure that Poland is not used by any European\nState against Russia. Stalin knew this was possible only if Poland becomes a part of\nthe Russian sphere of influence. At the Yalta conference, Stalin was determined to\nensure the above. After WW-II, even before the government of Poland in exile in\nLondon could establish its rule, Russia had already established a pro-Russia\ngovernment in Lublin city in East Poland. France and Britain knew that Stalin held\nthe key to the East but still could not just allow Stalin a free hand. They could not\npossibly allow a Polish takeover by Russia without focussing on ‘self-determination’\nof the Polish people (the key idea that dominated the policies of the European nation\nstates since WW-II). The British and the French urged Russia to create a provisional\ngovernment for the time being with democratic elements from the Polish government\nin exile and later allow for fresh elections. By advocating this, Britain and French\nFrance played safe and could even convince their constituencies back home that they\nupheld democracy in Poland. As far as Russia was concerned, it certainly could not\nallow Polish aggression. Russians continued to strengthen their position and\neventually recaptured territories they had lost, before Treaty of Riga in 1921. This\naggressive tactic of USSR irked the USA as it became all the more suspicious with\nrising Communist influence in Europe. Russians used the same policy for installing\nCommunist regimes in Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania and Albania, heightening the\nfears of the West and cementing the divisions in the East leading to Churchill\nannouncing an ‘Iron Curtain’ in Europe separating the East (Communist) to that of\nWest (Capitalist).

Three parts were under the USA, France and Britain, broadly known as West\nGermany and other part was under the USSR, called East Germany. The western part\nconsolidated its position and underwent faster economic recovery, while eastern part\nremained mired in poverty. The escalation of the crisis happened in June, 1948. The\nwestern part decided to introduce a new currency in West Berlin. Russia became\nextremely upset at this. Since West Berlin was located almost 110 km deep within the\nRussian territory, Russia ordered a blockade of all rail, road and canals between West\nBerlin and West Germany. The Russians were of the view that this would compel the\nWestern powers to withdraw from West Berlin, but instead, the move backfired for\nSoviet as the British, French and Americans organised airdropping of essential\ncommodities to West Berlin to prevent it from starvation. Finally, in 1949, Stalin\nlifted the blockade and this came as a big blow to the USSR as its failure to achieve\nanything concrete had become apparent. After the Berlin blockade and airlift, in the\nwest, the German Federal Republic was formed, which elected Konrad Adenauer as\nits head, while in East, the German Democratic Republic. The west cemented a\nsecurity alliance in 1949 with formation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation\n(NATO), which included the major West European states. The US learned a hard\nlesson and came out of its isolationism to contain communism. The Truman doctrine,\nthe Marshall Plan and the formation of the NATO were steps in this regard.\n\nThe Cold War of containment of communism not only got institutionalised but also\nspread to Korea and Vietnam in Asia. But the establishment of East and West German\n\nstates only increased their antagonism. Attempts to unify Germany failed as, for\nAdenauer, integration of West Germany inside the ambit of the US and Western culture\nand values was more important than the unification, while for East Germany and Stalin, to\nprevent movement of people from East to West was more important. Thus it ended up in\nthe attempt of East Germany in 1961 to erect a Berlin Wall which became a symbol of the\nCold War till its final collapse in 1989 leading to German unification in 1990.\n\nMeanwhile, with the economic aid begotten under the Marshall Plan, Western Europe\nbegan integration. In 1951, France, West Germany, Italy and Benelux nations established\nthe European Coal and Steel Company which later on manifested in 1957 under the Treaty\nof Rome for the establishment of a European Economic Community. In France, Charles de\nGaulle had his own unique vision of a strong Europe based on the idea of an association of\nstrong nations and not a Europe dominated by the US or by Britain. Through his refusal to\nallow a NATO weapon shield in France and refusal to sign the Partial Test Ban Treaty,\n1963, he kept the Anglo-US dominance under check by strengthening relations with West\nGermany.\n\nGaullism (the nationalist and elitist approach of Charles de Gaulle, characterized by\nconservatism, national pride, the idea of France as a ‘strong state’ and advocacy of\ncentralised government) kept English dominance under check, and he also tried to\nrecognise the diplomatic relations with China in 1964 which the USA has not done post-\nWW-II. Thus, if Western Europe was undergoing tremendous economic integration, the\nEast Europe, the Satellite of Russia, had different instruments. The Russians firstly\nresponded to the Marshall Plan as dollar imperialism and in 1947 established the\nCominform, also called the Communist Information Bureau. The Cominform was a\nmechanism developed by the USSR to tighten its grip on satellite states of East Europe by\nundertaking industrialisation, collectivisation and centralised control. In 1947, the USSR\nalso announced Molotov Plan, which was a plan for economic integration under\nCOMECON (Council of Mutual Economic Assistance). With the coming of a communist\nregime in China, Russia and China concluded a treaty. This spread of Communism to the\nEast made the US look east as well. The expanding US influence in East Asia compelled\nRussia in 1955 to create a new Warsaw Pact on the lines of the NATO.\n\nBy the time the WW-lII ended, the US had inflicted heavy damage on Japan,\nespecially through the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The events, as they\nunfolded from 1947 till 1950, the most important being the agreement concluded between\nChina and Russia and China emerging as a communist state, made the US realise the\nimportance of Japan. In 1951, the US and Japan entered into a Treaty of San Francisco\nmaking these two allies of each other. The US desperately needed a base for operations\naiming to contain communism in the East. Japan, after cementing an alliance with the US,\nreceived tremendous economic support for economic recovery and gave US the needed\nbase for the East."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Since the war, Cuba had been under\nAmerican control. At the onset of the Cold War, America had a proxy in Cuba called\nFulgencio Batista, who was gradually growing unpopular. There were a lot of\nAmerican businesses in Cuba that flourished. Taking advantage of the weakened rule\nof Batista, Fidel Castro, on 26\" July 1953, led an attack on the Moncada army\nbarracks. He was imprisoned for this assault. By the time he was released, Batista’s\ntule dwindled as it faced financial bankruptcy. Thus, there was a vaccum to be filled.\nThis was undertaken successfully by Castro. One thing to be kept in mind was that\nCuba, at the time of the power transition, did not witness a civil war. As Castro\nstrengthened his rule, he initiated the programme of nationalisation of property\nowned by US business houses. Castro gave the logic of sovereignty and nationalism\nto justify his move. The US retaliated by closing down its markets for import of\nsugarcane from Cuba. A lot of Cubans were affected due to this. Some even left Cuba\nfor the US to settle in Florida. As the economy of Cuba got badly hit, Castro\ndomestically fuelled nationalism and internationally requested help from Russia.\nPerceiving this, the then-US President Kennedy gave the task of solving Cuban\nmenace to CIA. The CIA drew up a plan of using Cuban exiles in Florida to be\nairdropped on Cuban beaches (Bay of Pigs). The idea was that exiles would be\ndropped on the beaches, and as per the plan they would intermingle with the Cuban\npopulation to create unrest for Castro.\n\nThe basic assumption was that CIA thought that Castro did not enjoy popular\nsupport of the Cuban people. The plan was executed. The exiled Cubans were\ndropped in Bay of Pigs. Within a span of three days the local Cubans overpowered\nthem. The exiled Cubans requested help from CIA. The US did not help them as they\n\nwere not prepared for something like this. Observing the matter thus unfolding,\nNikita Khrushchev decided to defend the small range missiles in Cuba, since this\nwould not only defend Cuba, but also ensure his presence in Cuba, which would be at\na proximate destination to launch attacks on the US on the East Coast. The Central\nIntelligence Agency (CIA) got photographic evidence of sites of Russians creating\nmissile launching sites in Cuba, after which the US ordered quarantine and a\nblockade for incoming Russian ships and began to scan for nukes. Russia, in the\nmeanwhile, backed out. Diplomatically, a huge nuclear crisis was averted. The\nRussian aim seems to have been to teach the US how it feels to have missiles near\nthem (recollect US had stationed Jupiter and Thors in Turkey). The issue concluded\nby the acceptance of the US not to militarily invade Cuba and the subsequent\nremoval of its missiles from Turkey. Both US and USSR realised how quickly a\nsmall issue like Cuba could have escalated conflicts. They took a step towards\ndisarmament namely, the 1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty.\n\nThese two crises, Vietnam and Cuba, convinced the US to explore non-military\nsolutions. Even Russia realised that the arms race was not leading them anywhere. Even\nsteps like SALT-I and SALT-II were taken by Krushchecv’s successor, Leonid Brezhnev,\nthrough the active pursuance of the Brezhnev Doctrine to keep the East European satellites\nin check broadly continued the detente of Khrushchev.

The statecraft as an instrument has gradually evolved\nand, since the decline of feudalism, the other power contenders like the Pope and barons\nhave paved way for strong monarchies. These monarchies, along with professional\ndiplomats and treaties, maintained the balance of power, with the Peace of Westphalia\n(1648) and the Treaty of Utrecht (1713) finally settling the religious question and\ndeclaring the balance of power to be the core instrument of harmony. The period from\n1648 to 1776 witnessed the decline of Ottoman Empire and rise of the British, and\nRussian empires. The states did interact with each other in this period but primarily with\nan intention to ensure systemic balance.\n\nThe American Revolution ended up making the US as a superpower in the twentieth\ncentury while the French Revolution asserted that sovereignty rests with the people and\n\nnot the ruler. This assertion by the French Revolution had a serious consequence as it\nunleashed a force of national self determination which resonated all over Europe till World\nWar-II. But, another consequence of the French Revolution was that after the defeat of\nNapoleon, witnessing his expansionary urge in the revolution period, the Europeans\ndecided to ensure that no European nation should be allowed to disturb the balance of the\nsystem. The culmination of the French Revolution again saw an institutional attempt to\nmaintain the balance of power through the Concert of Europe. The Concert of Europe did\nbring peace in Europe but it also legitimised the domination of Europeans in Africa and\nAsia. The Concert of Europe was replaced by the League of Nations in 1919 which\nbecame the first universal international body. The League of Nations shifted the entire\nconcept of maintenance of peace with a focus on collective security as it was widely\nbelieved that balance of power was one of the causes of war. The more important point\nhere was that the League was based on a wider membership by inviting non-European\nnations which the concert had not.\n\nReplaced\nBalance of Power as acl Collective security\n\n‘ y\nBalance of ~ » Collective\nPower security\n\nSince the end of the Cold War, globalisation as a force has been unleashed. It has\ndeeply impacted the multiple dimensions of states envisaged. Since globalisation is\naffecting general decision making of states, a new force has been unleashed, arguing for a\nnew definition of sovereignty. For example, today, the idea of sovereignty being\nforwarded is for a state to be responsible for protecting its citizens and if a state fails to\nprotect its citizens, the principle of non-intervention (as envisaged by traditional\nsovereignty) is to be read as international responsibility to protect. The basic idea here is\nthat if a country fails to protect its citizens, and the UN Security Council is convinced that\nthe sovereignty of the people is violated then international players have a responsibility to\nintervene and protect citizens of that state. This principle of Responsibility to Protect\n(R2P) was recently the doctrine used in justifying intervention in Libya in 2011."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Both were hostile to each other’s ideologies\nand were determined to ensure the containment of the other. The idea to contain another’s\nideology brought almost the entire world into the aegis of the two ideologies. The\ninsecurity generated by each created an arms race which eventually transformed into a\nnuclear arms race. But the Cold War did establish its norms of governance of the\ninternational society. One thing was clear, both wanted to contain the other but the\ncontainment happened cautiously. Both powers avoided nuclear exchanges despite coming\nextremely close to the brink of a nuclear war in Cuba in 1962.\n\nAs the Cold War ended, one thing was clear: the prospect of the USSR being the sole\ncontender to the power of the US went out of the scene. Similarly, due to USA’s presence\nin West Europe during Cold War, it continued to enjoy their patronage. More so, the\nmilitary balance was now only in favour of US as no other power remained after 1989 to\nchallenge the US. One can easily assert that this was the time when the US became the\nsole unipolar superpower. Thus, when the Cold War ended, a new world order dominated\nby US supremacy was a reality. The USA, throughout the Cold War, had been a champion\nof human rights, liberal democracy and justice. But when the Cold War ended, there were\nmany countries that had not accepted these values which the US had stood for. Although\nthe US now, at the end of the Cold War, had the power necessary to spread these values\namongst these nations, it instead preferred to remain silent in the first decade after the end\nof the Cold War. After 9/11, when the US voted against the UN to control terror and ended\nup launching its own Global War on Terror, it irked many nations. The exceptionalism\nexhibited by the US post 9/11 did not go well with many Third World Nations.\n\nAnother factor that erupted as a strain was the reluctance of the US to accommodate\n\nrising economies as instruments of economic governance. For example, the International\nMonetary Fund (IMF) created after WW-II, was designed to help nations with monetary\nassistance to remove non-performing threads in an economy. But IMF assistance was\nconditional for nations and were offered specifically where IMF was allowed to interfere\nin the domestic affairs of the economy of a country, making many nations feel as if they\nwere dependents or satellites of the IMF.\n\nAs far as the United States is concerned, as the Cold War ended, it understood that it\nhas both power and capabilities but to some extent, it was confused with regard to what it\nshould do beyond the expected and necessary demonstrations with respect to democracy\nand globalisation. Almost till 9/11, it remained a superpower without a mission. The\nEuropean continent at the end of the Cold War also took steps to integrate further leading\nto the birth of European Union. It was a predictable integration as they had been steadily\nwitnessing integration even during the Cold War era.\n\nAs the US, in the second decade of the post-Cold War era, got militarily occupied in\nwars in Afghanistan (2001) and Iraq (2003), on the East came up a strong superpower,\nChina. China aggressively accelerated its economic recovery and began to emerge a strong\neconomic power in the East. It is only in the third decade at the end of the Cold War today\nthat the US has adequately acknowledged the ’rising China’ as a threat to the global\nhegemony of the US. It has since taken steps to counter the hegemonic rise of China\nthrough Tans Pacific Partnership (T.P.P.) and the ’Pivot to Asia’ missions.\n\nThe world today no doubt witnesses the unipolarity of USA, but many rising nations\nlike China, India, and Russia (after Putin in power) have restored the balance more\ntowards multipolarity. Globalisation will continue to integrate the world and countries\nhave realised non-military means to ensure peace in the system, but how far counter\nhegemonic initiatives work in restraining nations from the course of war needs to be seen.\nAlso, the world now witnesses multiple new threats in the form of terrorism, poverty,\nrising inequality and climate change. It is to be seen how the globalised world resorts to\nsolving these.\n\nThe challenges in the 21st century require a new form of diplomacy. Some of the\nchallenges like the containment of piracy in Africa, poverty in Asia, nation building in the\nMiddle East are some regional challenges. Arab Spring is throwing up new challenges in\nthe Middle East and it is still an ongoing transformation. Climate change and environment\ndiplomacy is now the next big global challenge where attainment of consensus on the\nmost viable course of action remains missing. The emerging economies are now exerting\npressures on institutions established by the west and are asserting force in favour of\nreforms. A failure to reform institutions like the World Bank and IMF is encouraging the\nemerging market economies to establish their own regional institutions, for instance, the\nNew Development Bank established by the BRICS countries. All these challenges require\na new level of cooperation which is now the main task of the state actors and diplomats\nglobally after the end of the Cold War."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

It tries and\nenvisages a world which ought to be a better place in the future. It prescribes suggestions\nto envisage the world as the scholars see it. It promotes a set of universal ethics with an\nintention to establish the idea of ‘one world’ throughout the entire scheme of things, with\nthe global citizenry taking centre stage in that thought. For the idealists, there is a firm\nbelief that people will always cooperate to achieve harmony rather than opt for war or\nconflict. People have an ability to think, but they shall exercise their rational faculties only\nwhen states promote education. It prescribes that leaders of the states should promote\neducation in the country since the more people are educated in a state, the more they shall\nexert control over their leaders so as to ensure peace. Thus, not only is education\nimportant, but public opinion in the decision making is also deemed to be paramount. The\npublic opinion is better informed if the public is provided access to education. The\nidealists are also of the view that international organisations play a very crucial role in\nglobal harmony and that is why they put a lot of emphasis on such bodies.\n\nOne form of Idealism is known as Pacifism. Pacifists are those who emphasise upon\nhuman reason, morality and advocate promotion of democracy and public opinion in\ndecision making. They press for a greater role of morality in the dealing and resolution of\ninternational affairs. Another group is called Globalists. The Globalists’ philosophy also\nrevolves around human reasoning and emphasis on democracy and public opinion, but\nwhat sets them apart is their emphasis on harmony of interests and universal ethics. One\ncommonality between Pacifists and Globalists is that both perceive war as exceedingly\nharmful and contrary to human interest. In another form called Classical Liberalism, we\nfind war branded as irrational, along with an emphasis on capitalism and an advocacy of\nidea that some greed is good.

Power: The school of Realism, from Thucydides until Hans Morgenthau, has not been\nofficially able to define what is meant by power. Some ideas, however, have emerged in\nhow thinkers may explain the role and function of power in a context. The basic idea in\npower in statecraft is a situation where one state is able to control the actions of another\nstate. In Realism, power is always used as a relational concept, meaning that power is\nalways exercised by one state in relation to the other(s). Also, in Realism, the term power\nis seen as having a strong underlying military connotation. Power is the military capability\nof a state.\n\n2. National Interest: Realists say that every state has individuals and individuals have\ncertain values. The individuals of a state, based on shared values, are able to develop a\nculture and a sense of common identity. The idea of protection is not just restricted to the\nsecurity of its people but also the protection of its identity and culture. If a state has to\nsurvive, then the survival of its identity and culture is its national interest. How the state\nuses this as its national interest in foreign policy is the objective of our study. This is\n\nlinked to the next concept.\n\n3. National Security: If, as explained above, if a state needs to survive, it has to secure\nitself from its enemy state(s). The ruler has to take adequate steps to ensure safety, security\nand survival of its people. Thus, national security is one of the primary national interests\nof a state.\n\n4. Conflict: Man by nature is conflict-mongering. It is this conflict-seeking nature of man\nthat brings him into confrontation with others. But why is man’s nature so fraught? Man is\nconflicting in nature because he has to ensure his own survival. Now if we apply this logic\nto the state, we may see that, since the national interest of the state is national security and\nsurvival, it brings one state into conflict with other states. In this situation, a state has no\noption but to fend for its own self as there is no one above the state in the system to help\nthe state. There are two important observations we need to remember here. First, there is\nno authority above the state for its help, which consequently means that in the\ninternational system, there is complete anarchy. Second, it is anarchy in the international\nsystem that compels a state to exercise self-help. Self-help could manifest as building up\nof economic and military capabilities. These capabilities can give the state an edge in an\nanarchic global stage and ensure its survival.\n\n5. Balance of Power: Since national interest of a state lies in ensuring national security, to\nmake its survival certain, in national interest, a state will undertake weaponisation. This\nweaponisation will secure the state but will also simultaneously cause insecurity in\nanother state. The other states will feel insecure as the state which undertook\nweaponisation endangers and undercuts their own security. This leads to the other state to\nform alliances. The state may undertake subversion or may compete by increasing its own\npower to help a check on a predatory power. This will enable it to balance out power on an\ninternational scale once again.\n\n6. Deterrence: As explained before, this is nothing but Balance of Power as understood in\nthe nuclear age. In today’s world, where there is a tremendous pace of nuclearisation and\nan arms race constantly underway, the balance of power has got a new name, called\n‘deterrence’. Deterrence is nothing but a threat of punishment by one party on the other if\nthe other party fails to behave in the way as expected by the threatening party. It is\nbelieved that the threat of punishment in deterrence is exercised by procuring and\nleveraging the nuclear option."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

He elucidated the trajectory of man\nturning from a nomad to a hunter-gatherer. Later he began to lead a settled life and\nfinally he developed a community around himself. While settling into an agrarian\nway of life, man preferred to live in a community as it could help him feel a little\nmore secure from the attack of wild animals and the devastation wrought by them.\nGradually, as the size of his community grew, so did the frequency of emergence of\nother communities. Now, man’s security was not merely endangered by wild animal\nbut by other communities and the fear of attack from other men. This situation was\ndescribed by Hobbes as a state of nature and a pre-civil condition. Hobbes explained\nthat man, in the state of nature, is not secure. Thus, he progresses to create a\nsovereign state. This creation of a state is based on an emotion of fear, and thus, he\nfeels his individual fears can be jointly collaborated by a security pact that can\nguarantee him safety. However, the problem is that if he created a sovereign state, so\ndid other communities. This subsequently led to the fear of other states. This situation\nis called a security dilemma. In this situation, Hobbes states, that a man can guarantee\nhis own individual security in a state but cannot ensure international security amongst\nother sovereign states, thus making war one of many available options. Thus, we can\nsee that Hobbes also agreed that war could be a potential tool used by a state for\nseeking survival in the international system.\n\nOne of the other important classical realists is Hans Morgenthau. Hans says that man\nis a political animal and he has a certain lust for power. As the nature of man is egoistic,\nhe craves for more power. The nature of man that makes him crave for power is called\nanimus dominandi. Ironically, it is this lust for power that also makes him search for\nsafety. His search ends in the establishment of control over a piece of territory. In this\nterritory he establishes a state as the formation of a state gives man the needed security.\nBut as he craves for more, this craving brings man into conflict with surrounding\nterritories similarly created by other individuals. This explanation of man’s behaviour is\napplied by Hans directly to the system of nations states. He says that the world comprises\nof states. States have a lust for power and survival. This lust for territorial expansion and\nthe urge to control more and more land and resources bring a state at the juncture of war\nwith another state or even multiple states. During armed conflict or wars, a defending state\nalso displays military power. This display of military power leads to human rights\nviolation, but this human right violation is justified by the defending state as necessary for\n\nthe protection of its national interest of survival and security. A leader of this state in this\ncase, by displaying some wisdom and resorting to the use of military power, is perhaps\nable to avert a greater evil. Thus, the idea propounded by Hans Morgenthau allows a state\nto act in hostility for the maintenance of its national interest and survival, especially if\nthey are under threat. The ruler shall use his/her wisdom to use force to protect the state\nand avert a greater evil and maintain the balance of power.\n\nRealism as a school has, over the decades, witnessed a shift to Neo-Realism from\nClassical Realism in 1980’s. This shift owes to the work of Kenneth Waltz’s Theory of\nInternational Politics (1979). The emphasis on human nature of classical realists have\ngradually been theorised by the Neorealists into an emphasis on anarchy. They also do\naccept the presence of the other non-state actors in the system but continue to assert the\nprimacy of the state. The Neorealists allege that as the international system is that of\ncomplete anarchy, it leads to nations acting in their own self-interest. This struggle for\npower is due to an absence of a global leviathan to protect smaller states. The Neorealists\nhave propounded a deterministic theory, which says that the structure of the system in\nwhich a sovereign state functions causes the state to behave in the way that it behaves,\nwhich is to say, that a largely anarchic global system occasions inevitable conflict and\nwarfare. Thus, they argue aptly that war happens in a context and the context is that of\nanarchy. Kenneth Waltz explains that international system consists of smaller units and the\nunits are these nation states. IR is nothing but the study of the interaction of these units.\nAll units in the system perform basic functions like taxation, municipal services, creation\nof infrastructure, and so forth. A change in the states’ behaviour happens when the balance\nof power changes. The units are impacted when there are changes in of the interaction of\ngreat powers. The Neorealists believe that there is always an establishment of a hierarchy\nof states that the international system changes when great powers in the top hierarchy rise\nor fall. A fall or rise may break down the system but eventually paves way for the balance\nof power to emerge again in some or the other form. In this sense, the Neorealists are also\n‘Structuralists’ as, for them, the structure of the overall system determines individual or\ncollective behaviour. Neorealism is therefore a structuralist determinist explanation."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Liberals are of the philosophical opinion that the state is not\nmerely an instrument of war (as realists would suggest) all the time. They say that the\nevolution of the state is based upon a well-founded social contract between the individuals\nand the state itself. The state is composed of individuals. The individuals have capacity to\nthink and the intentionality of that thought is aimed at cooperation with others.\n\nThe state, as per the social contract, needs to ensure conditions for the growth of the\nindividual. This is possible if one state cooperates with another state. If all the states\ncooperate for each other’s welfare, there will be peace. The states have to cooperate with\nother states because, as per the social contract, they have to work for the welfare of\nindividuals within the state, which is deemed impossible if the states remain in a\ncontinuous state of warfare and instability. If the state has to create conditions conducive\nfor growth of individuals, it can do so by cooperating with others. This interaction one\nstate undertakes with other state will be based on mutual interest. This interaction can also\nbe facilitated by international organisations. The overall analysis of such interaction\nleading to cooperation on mutual interests will foster peace. As the interaction between the\n\nstates will deepen, it will lead to interdependency of the states. As the states become\ninterdependent, if a situation of conflict arises, the states will resolve them peacefully and\nwould not opt for war as they would realise that mutual interest and welfare of the people\nis more important than the ensuing conflict to settle issues. As the states would modernise,\nthe cooperation would increase and chances of war would decrease. Thus, one can clearly\noutline now that the core of Liberalism revolves around human cognition, freedom\ncooperation, peace, progress, mutual interest, modernisation and liberal democracy.\n\nAll these core principles are also well established in the thought of scholars\nadvocating for core liberalism. However, there is a sub-school known as Neo-Liberalism\nwhich also accepts all the principles of core Liberalism but is less optimistic about\ncooperation as envisaged by core liberals. They are neo-liberals in the sense that they go a\nlittle beyond man and advocate cooperation on little larger scale:\n\nCooperation Type!“ Classical or core liberalism\n‘ /\nPeace and progress .. ~\\ Ideas _ es\nMutual interests ~ po\nModernisation Type II. Neo liberalism\n\nNeo Liberalism is the school of Liberalism that originated in the time period between\n1780 to 1850. This was the time when industrial revolution began and rapidly progressed.\nThe new bunch of scholars emerged on the scene during this period. These scholars were\ndeeply moved by the progress mankind was making at the industrial level. These scholars\nbegan to appreciate human capabilities. A wave of enlightenment began as the scholars\ntook appreciation of human cognition. The age of reason asserted that humans have ability\nto reason and are at the very centre stage of the entire civilisation and universe. This gave\nbirth to the ideas of more progress and a cooperative spirit amongst mankind. This time\nperiod also saw cementing of the idea of Classical Realism.

The answer is, at\nonce, both yes and no. They don’t fight wars amongst themselves at all. But they do see\ndictatorial regimes as a threat. The reason they see dictatorial regimes as a threat is\nbecause in these regimes, there is no transparency in decision making. Secondly, in these\nregimes, a dictator may resort to deception, thus making democracies more vulnerable to\ndictators and their political whimsicalities. In this kind of a situation, democracies may\ntake resort to replacing these dictator regimes and replacing them with parties amenable to\ntheir policies and the international statutes to bring about nation building and promote\ndemocracy, failing which, they may even go so far as to install puppet governments so that\nlong term peace may be achieved in the region. Unfortunately, this may not always have\nthe desired results, leading to more conflicts and global unrest in some cases (refer to the\nensuing case studies in this chapter).\n\nThus, as per the study of four types of Neo-Liberalism, we can clearly articulate that\nbroadly, the theory talks about globalism and the world order. According to neo-liberals, it\nis the interaction amongst the states that establishes the world order and not the balance of\npower. The world does witness global problems which could crop up in the shape of\nglobal warming, drug trafficking, black money, and so on. These are problems which\nindividual countries cannot solve. They require cooperation as states’ own resources are\ntoo limited to enable them to solve these problems on their own. The only solution for the\nstates is to interact amongst themselves. As they interact and coordinate, they strive to\nestablish a global consensus to cooperate and solve the problems. A global consensus,\nhowever, is only possible if the states apply prioritisation of their demands first and\nsecondly, undertake a process of transparent decision making in a democratic set-up to\nachieve consensus on the aforementioned priorities.\n\nIn 1972, a scholar named John Burton summarised the difference between Realism\nand Liberalism through his billiard ball model.

In IR, Marxist theory\nadvances that all that happens in the world is due to certain structures which exert\ninfluence on states compelling them to behave in the way they do. To understand IR, we\nneed to understand these structures.\n\nFoundation of Marxism in International Relations\n\nFor Karl Marx, the study of the social world needs to be a study of totality. By totality, he\nmeans that individual study of disciplines such as history, economics, politics and so on\nleads us to an incomplete understanding of society and the world, as to better understand\nthe social world, these disciplines need to be studied together. Marx believed that any\nchange in history is driven by a change in the economic development of a nation, and\nhistory is further characterised by the class struggle that ensues between the moneyed\ncapitalist classes and the poorer labour/proletariat classes. Marx propounds, through works\nsuch as essays (‘Wage Labour and Capital’) and books (Das Kapital Volume One, 1867)\nthat, in a society, there are two concepts—factors of production and relations of\nproduction. These two factors interact and produce tensions and the tensions both produce\nand determine the history of the society. As societies progress, the means of production in\nthe societies also change. The old traditional methods of production become outdated and\nredundant, and this puts a certain kind of pressure on the society.\n\nThe market institution is based on a simple rule of exchange whereby individuals,\n\nthrough a legal tender called currency, are able to exchange goods in lieu of that currency.\nThe legal tender called money is an instrument of exchange regulated by the government.\nThis brings the state into the fold of economy. This means that the state provides a legally\nrecognised instrument to allow transactions in the market, which indicates that the state\nand the market are interacting. This interaction is at the core of international political\neconomy. But economy was never the core field of study of IR. We can already appreciate,\nas per our understanding of chapters two, three and four, that initially, after the World\nWars, the situation warranted prevention of another war. The idea was that avoidance of\nwar and maintenance of peace is far more important in any study of IR. This relegated\neconomy to get a secondary position.\n\nThis fact is very succinctly put by Charles de Gaulle of France. He once pointed out\nthat statesmen should focus on war and peace issues as the economy can be handled by\n‘lesser minds’. Economy as a core domain in the study of IR has gained more significance\nsince the end of the cold war and onset of the ways of globalisation. Infact, the need arose\nfrom the 1970’s to bring in the economic paradigm and link it to IR. In the 1970's, we first\nwitnessed a prolonged US-Vietnam war. This caused tremendous drain of resources. This\nwas coupled with the oil crises of 1973 which again made US economy vulnerable. Then\nthe financial stress of USSR in the management of East Europe was witnessed during the\ntimes of Gorbachev and the end of the cold war. The subsequent US supremacy again\nbrought economy to a firm footing as globalisation began. Thus, economy became\nimportant in the study of society or polity.\n\nIt is in 16*/17* century that the new ideology of Mercantilism began to emerge. It\nadvocated that politics should use economics as a tool for power acquisition. It\nemphasised that the world is an area of conflict as each state has its own national interest\nand all national interests of states are opposed to each other as national interests are not\nbased on cooperation or gain for anyone. The situation is that states compete at the\neconomic level with each other in the world making it a zero sum game. It is a zero sum\ngame because the gain of one state is the loss of the other. This theory is at the core of\nMercantilism. Mercantilism also advocates a state to be careful of the gain another state\nmakes because a gain made at an economic level by another state will lead to the state\ngaining military strength. This military power that a state is able to achieve is the result of\na strong economy. This military power now can be used by the state to colonise territories\nand again increase its economic power. This is why governmental regulations of a state’s\nfinances and economic profits is necessarily tied in with the eventual desired\naugmentation of state power.\n\nThis will enable the state to acquire more national wealth. Thus a strong economy\nenables a state to pursue the twin goals of wealth and power simultaneously. The\nMercantile ideology has evolved over a period of time. In the 16\" century, when Spain was\nable to acquire bullion from its colonisation of America, the mercantilists argued that\nstates should acquire bullion to be powerful. But gradually, as Netherlands began to\nacquire wealth by a vast overseas territorial trade, the mercantilists argued that states\nshould acquire wealth through trade and by building a surplus. The next step of the\nevolution came when Britain began wealth acquisition by virtue of the industrialisation of\nits economy. This gave mercantilists a chance to argue that nations should focus on\nindustrialisation and gain wealth but to do so, the state should take measures to ensure\n\nprotection and development of local industries, giving birth to the idea of protectionism.\n\nGradually economic liberalism began. It advocated a situation where a market is\nallowed to operate freely without political interference. This school is of the view that the\nmarket should be allowed to operate freely to provide goods and services in an economy.\nPolitical interventions by the states, which would merely create conflict, came to be\nunderstood as retrogressive and thus avoidable. This system came to be known as\nlaissezfaire (free market trade without the interference from governments).\n\nThe idea was that no one country could possibly be successful in producing\neverything. Each has a specific specialisation in something or the other and if there is free\ntrade, this specialisation will enable economic interaction leading to trade and increase in\nglobal wealth. The way this school differs from the mercantilists is that economic\nliberalism puts the individual consumer at the centre stage and defines the role of the state\nas an agency. The idea is that the individual is always willing to maximise his interests and\nhis interests are maximised only in a free market economy. Many early economic liberals\nadvocated laissez faire—a situation where the markets operate freely and there is no\npolitical restriction. But we need to remember that market may not always operate freely.\nAt times it may not work for mutual gain of all. For example, during the recent drive of\nodd-even scheme in New Delhi in 2016, the private cab operators took the odd-even\nscheme as an opportunity and this led to surge pricing. Such a situation is called market\nfailure and to rectify this, we needed political regulation. Thus the modern and more\nacceptable view is that we do need the free markets but also a certain amount of regulation\nby the state in the management of the economy is desirable.\n\nNow if we look at the basic tenets of Marxism, it states that, firstly, economy is a\nplace where humans are exploited and there is class inequality. For Marx, economy is\nbased on two social classes—the capitalist class which owns the factors of productions\nand strives for profit maximisation; and the labour class, which sells itself to the capitalists\nto survive. The labour makes profit for the capitalist and the capitalist does not share the\nprofit leading to labour exploitation. Marx believes that capitalism is a step forward from\nfeudalism. The reason being that in feudalism, the serf was attached to the land and had\nlittle choice in choosing his master. Surprisingly, in many cases during the feudal era,\nwhen the land was sold from one feudal lord to the other, the serfs were attached and sold\nalong with the land to the new feudal lord. Marx says that capitalism is at least better in\nthe sense that the labour at least has some degree of choice and is free to decide to whom\nhe would sell his labour power to. But Marx also predicted that a time will come when the\nlabour class or proletariat will overthrow the capitalist or bourgeoisie class and takeover\nthe means of production.\n\nMarx stated that each state is driven by interests of the ruling class and the interests\nof the ruling class impacts the state power structure deeply. Thus, if there is a capitalist\nclass and if the state fights a war, we need to understand the concept of class interest in the\nwar as the capitalist class is based on profit maximisation and the urge to generate profit is\na never ending urge. Thus, Marx’s theory believes that capitalism is a repressive\nmachinery because, in its urge to make more profit, it will gradually move to those nations\nto explore new markets and options that grant it an opportunity to make further profit.\nThis aptly explains why Mercantilism and Economic Liberalism caused cultural\n\nimperialism and colonisation of a new order which is now reflected in the 21* century\nunder the dominant trends of globalisation by Trans National Corporations in their hunt\nfor cheap labour and more profit in the Third World countries. Thus, globalisation is an\nexample of capitalist expansion in 21* century."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Lenin said that in 18\"/19°*\ncentury, British made colonies, practised imperialism and became a strong political\nforce to contend with. However, in the beginning of the 20\" century, when Germany\nbecame an economic powerhouse after its unification and rose to a strength similar to\nBritain, it demanded its share in the colonies by announcing its policy of colonial\nexpansion under Weltpolitik. Lenin explains that this is part of a natural process as\nwhen one power economically expands, it will demand re-division of the sphere of\ninfluences for its own benefit and such disparities invariably bring conflict, as has\nbeen witnessed between the British and the Germans, finally climaxing in the World\nWar-I.\n\nTo enhance our understanding at this juncture, we may also consider the writings of\nAntonio Gramsci. Gramsci wanted to study as to why it was difficult to promote a\nrevolution in Western Europe as Marx says that an advanced industrial society will\neventually undergo a social revolution. He wanted to analyse why a nonindustrial,\nbackward Russia had succeeded in the revolutions while industrialised Western Europe\nhad failed. To explain this, Gramsci studied the entire phenomena through the lens of\nhegemony in his Prison Notebooks. Gramsci understood that power is a mixture of\ncoercion and consent. He explained that the primary focus of Marx was on study of\ncoercion and how a coercive society exploits the majority. He analysed the situation in\nWestern Europe, and found that there, power was driven by consent as well. Gramsci says\nthat in a society where hegemony is consent dominated, the ruling capitalist class first tries\nto control all cultural, moral and political values. Then they take steps to disperse these\nvalues amongst different classes in the society. In this value dispersion, the civil society\nplays an important role as civil society provides a platform for interaction of the masses\nwith the dominant group. The interaction helps in enhancing the understanding of the\nthoughts of the masses. A little bit of modification allows the dominant class to make its\nvalues acceptable to all and thus maintain the legitimacy of its power over society through\nwhat he calls ‘cultural hegemony’.\n\nThus, once the values are accepted, the superstructure is moulded, and the masses\nhelp in maintaining status quo rather than revolting against it. Gramsci propounds that\nMarx focussed only on the study of the base, but the study of superstructure cannot be\nnegated as the superstructure in this case is moral and cultural values. Thus, Gramsci\nasserts that a study is valid only if it takes into account both the superstructure and socio-\neconomic base. For the political hegemony of the dominant class to be challenged, the\ntransformation can only happen if counter hegemonic structures emerge in a society and\ncivil society allows alternative historical blocs to emerge.\n\nThe scholar, Robert W. Cox has further developed the core argument of Gramsci.\n\nCox has also criticised existing IR theories and developed an alternative. The first thing\nCox asserted was that theory is always for someone and for some purpose. He says theory\nis always a reflection of context, time and space. Thus, the knowledge is not timeless as\nwe need to study theories propounded till date. Cox asserts that theorists often serve\ninterests of those rules under whom they prosper and try in some or other way to reinforce\nand legitimise the status quo and make the society believe that IR can follow a very\nnaturalised set of laws.\n\nIn his book, Production, Power and the World Order (1987), Cox argues that the\nconcept of hegemony is important to understand the power structures of the world and the\nbehaviour of nations. He says we have an international system where there is a world\nwhich is dominated by the Anglo-US axis and they have developed a world order that\nsuits the axis. The Anglo-US axis has not only maintained hegemony only through\ncoercion but also through consent, where the consent generated is making all nations\nvirtually believe that free trade is beneficial for all societies. The fact is that this idea of\nfree trade being beneficial is even accepted by societies who are inherently disadvantaged\nby free trade. But Cox asserts (like Marx) that soon there will be counter hegemonic\nmovements to challenge this common sense notion of free trade being beneficial for all.\n\nThese views of Cox to some extent are extensively argued by another neo-Marxist\nscholar, Immanuel Wallerstein. His theory is based on the idea of world system analysis.\nHe says that the world is made up of unified areas, and in each unified area, we witness an\ninteraction between politics and economics. He says there are two types of world systems.\nOne is called ‘World Empire System’, where politics and economics are under a unified\ncontrol; for example the Holy Roman Empire. The second is the ‘World Economic\nSystem’. Here the economies are unified but politics is decentralised. Wallerstein, in his\nmodel, argues that the capitalist world economy is divided in a hierarchy. We have core\nareas on the top where we have a mass market and a strong state. In core areas we have\nvery advanced agricultural. Then at the other end, we have peripheral areas which produce\nbasic stuff like wood, sugar, grain, and so on. Then there are semi peripheral areas which,\ndue to their contacts with the core and peripheral areas, have succeeded in building an\nindigenous industrial base and successfully act as a buffer. The basic working model of the\ncapitalist world economic system is through unequal exchange where surplus flows from\nthe periphery to the core. In the periphery, the weak state is subdued by the strong state\nand the surplus appropriation is enacted by enforcement of the strong state. This creates a\ntension in the system. The tension is diffused by semi peripheral states which act as shock\nabsorbers or buffers. But Wallerstein asserts that, in the long run, all this will lead to an\nend of the capitalist system because a time will come when the quest to expand will halt,\nproducing crisis. Every World System has a beginning, middle and an end phase.\nWallerstein argues that with the end of the Cold War, the world system has entered the\ncrises stage which originated with 16* century geographical discoveries."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

As we shall study in this entire\nunit, India’s Foreign Policy till now has had a high degree of consistency since\nindependence. What is unique is that this has been the case despite different ideologies\nbeing in power over the last decades. This continuity hints at the presence of a strategic\nautonomy in the political ethos which is based on its civilization. One of the key elements\nis the cooperative behaviour India intends to achieve through peaceful resolution of\nconflicts as India gives preference to dialogue over coercion or violence. This point is\nmost visible in India—Pakistan relationship, wherein one of the governments will initiate a\ndialogue, and then due to irritants posed by non-state actors, the dialogue will be halted.\nThe act of non-state actor will increase suspicion between the two states.

A grand strategy is all about protection\nof domestic values. Every state has certain values and to uphold those values are the\nprimary goals of every state. But as a state cannot protect all values, it resorts to\nsatisfactorily protecting the few it holds most sacred. In case the value of a state may be\nthreatened, say by a non-state actor or an act of nature like an earthquake or tsunamis, how\nthe state manages to restore the value threatened is our concern here. The combination of\nits capabilities the state may deploy to protect its internal and external security is known as\ngrand strategy. This takes us to strategic thought. Strategic thought signifies the resources\na government has (like diplomacy, military, economic strength, cultural values, etc) and\nthe way it uses these resources to achieve security for the society.

Our\nconcerns in this section are to deduce the principles of modern diplomacy originating from\nThe Ramayana.\n\nAs readers are possibly already aware, in this ancient epic, Sita, the wife of Ram, is\nkidnapped by Ravana, the king of Lanka. Ram entrusts on Hanuman the responsibility to\nlocate Sita. Hanuman, who is able to locate Sita in Lanka, first tries to convince her that he\nis an agent of Ram and not that of Ravana. Once he convinces Sita that he has been sent\nby Ram, Sita conveys a message to Hanuman and Hanuman delivers the message back to\nRam. From this situation, we may infer that Hanuman, who delivered the message to Ram\nof Sita, is seen to be doing what a diplomat does in modern times. In modern times,\ndiplomats are called information agents. They carry information from one state and\nconvey it to their own parent state. As the diplomats carry sensitive information, when\nthey deliver it, the diplomats must provide a truthful account. They must not distort or\nmanipulate information. This is precisely what Hanuman did. He carried the information\nto Ram and delivered the message without distortion.\n\nThe next scene that is important for us is the court scene where Hanuman argues with\nRavana to liberate Sita. He initiates his dialogue by telling Ravana about the power of\nRam. He tells Ravana of how popular Ram is back in Ayoddhya. He informs the enemy\nabout his leadership and his followership. He is thereby indulging in something called\npower projection. He is projecting the power of Ram in front of Ravana.\n\nDuring ancient and medieval times in world history, power projection was always\nindividual in nature. It meant that diplomats, during this time, always undertook power\nprojection of an individual personality which was always invariably their own king. For\ninstance, if a king in South India during ancient times sent a diplomatic mission to another\nstate, says in West Asia or East Africa, the diplomat used to project the might of his king\nin the court of the other king. The diplomat would glorify his own king’s power, and his\nmilitary prowess and his territorial extent. That is why we say that in ancient and medieval\ntimes, power projection was always individual and personality-centric in nature.

Kautilya is India’s own realist as his ideas resonate with realism. Realism, for\nexample, Kautilya says, is when a state, as an instrument, focusses on power enhancement\nas the international situation is one of anarchy. In this context, the policy of the state\nshould be to acquire power. This is also the basis of theory of Realism we have.\n\nFor Kautilya, the state is the most important and legitimate instrument which enjoys\nsovereignty. The responsibility of the king is to guard his subjects and ensure their\nprotection and survival. This should be the primary national interest of the state. The core\nobjective of the state is to acquire wealth, deliver justice and undertake expenditure. A\nstate has to be strong and to be strong it needs good administration, stability and justice.\nThis results in a conducive situation for wealth creation and leads to military expeditions\nfor conquests. Kautilya talks about how a strong state is needed to create wealth. The\nwealth in the state is generated by an elaborate taxation machinery. The Dharma of the\nking is the welfare of the people. If the king is unable to make the people prosper, it is\ninevitable that people will become restless and they will rebel. The rebellion can take any\nform, including that of violence. Thus, the primary focus of the king should be welfare.\nWelfare can only be occasioned by the king if he takes steps to promote wealth creation as\nwealth augments power. The Kautilyan idea of national interest is, therefore, based on\nwelfare of people. If people prosper, so will the state. Kautilya’s concept of power begins\n\nfrom society. He says power is of three kinds. The first is intellectual strength.\n\nKautilya’s grand strategy is based on the idea that the king needs to be a conqueror.\nHe needs to aim to increase his power over neighbours. The king is envisaged as a\n‘Chakravartin’. Chakravartin (in Sanskrit cakravartin, and in Pali cakkavattin) is an\nancient Indian term used to refer to an ideal universal ruler who rules ethically and\nbenevolently over the entire world. Such a ruler’s reign is called sarvabhauma. The goal of\nsuch a king is to promote national economy and ensure national security and social order.\n\nThe state is primarily agrarian in nature. Cattle rearing and agriculture are primary\nactivities. This leads to production of surplus which leads to trade. As trade is undertaken,\neconomy is strengthened. A strong economy sustains the state and the army. To develop\nthis kind of a state, which is based on powerful agrarian economy, the state needs to\nconquer new lands. The king undertakes expeditions to conquer new lands. The new lands\nconquered would allow citizens to expand opportunities to earn livelihood. This is the\nDharma of the ruler. The goal of the ruler is a stable state which needs to be achieved for\nthe welfare of citizens and to achieve such a state, the ruler is responsible for good\ngovernance. Governance is a means to achieve the aforementioned goals, as well as to\nachieve social harmony.\n\nAt the foreign policy level, Kautilya has a different thought. As stated previously, the\ntuler has to be a conqueror (Chakravartin). If he has to be a conqueror, then war is a\nnatural outcome of his foreign policy. Kautilya says that the ruler has to be careful because\nhis immediate neighbours are enemy states who are jealous of the social harmony and\nprogress of the ruler and his kingdom. Thus, conflicts with neighbours are likely to be\nnatural and to resolve the conflict the king has to decide if he would resort to conciliation\nand give gifts to another state to make it an ally, or sow dissension and use force if needed.\nAll this depends upon the power of the king and options for war available to discussion\nand use of force when the need arises.\n\nKautilya propounds that the power exuded by the state is of three types. The first is\nindividual power. This is the power and courage of the king. This is psychological in\nnature. The second is hard power. This is the military and economic capacity of the ruler\nand the state. The third is soft power. This is the diplomatic power of the ruler. Kautilya\nsays that before a ruler declares war on an enemy state, he should measure his power. The\ntuler, before the declaration of war, should ensure that he possesses superiority over all\nthree levels i.e., terrain of warfare (place), season and his own counsellors. Hence, if a\ntuler is intelligent and moral and has good counsel, he will win diplomatically. If a ruler\nhas adequate economic and military strength he will win on the basis of physical power\nand achieve physical success (application of hard power). The ruler, Kautilya says, should\nstrive for soft power rather than hard power.\n\nDepending upon the situation, he has three types of war to wage. The first is\nDharma-yudha which is outright, righteous war, fought while following certain\npredetermined rules. The second option is alternative to Dharama-yudha which is war by\ndeception. There is no lawful framework governing this war. The third is silent warfare\nwhere a state undertakes war without public attention. Kautilya also says that aim of the\nstate should be to expand national power. This can be done by conquests or alliances. The\ncomponents of national power are called prakritis. There are seven components, viz,\n\npolitical leadership, administration, resources, infrastructure, economy, security forces and\nalliances. The ruler should use hard, soft and individual power to expand national power.\nSo, shakti and prakriti if used prudently, leads to rise of comprehensive national power."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Kautilya has explained state\npriorities and economic conditions and has propounded that the power of the state\nrests on seven prakritis and if any one of the seven Prakritis is weak, the state is\nfragile. We need to understand the contemporary security environment by applying\nhis theories.\n\nAccording to the political theories of Max Weber, a state could be said to\n“succeed” if it maintains a monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force within\nits borders. When this is broken (for instance, through the dominant presence of\nwarlords, paramilitary groups, or terrorism), the very existence of the state becomes\ndubious, and the state becomes a failed state. Political scholar Querine Hanlon says\nthat states are of three categories—weak, failing and failed. Hanlon says that half of\nthis world is in fragile category today and it is that leads to instability conflict and\nwar which provide conditions for terrorism, militias and crime in 21st century. Fund\nfor Peace’s Fragile States Index underlines the democratic character of state\ninstitutions in order to determine its level of failure.\n\nAn application of Kautilya’s ideas in 1948 Indo-Pak war explains the relevance\nof terrain, weather conditions and strategy as important dimensions. In August 1947,\nBritish rule in India came to an end. The state of Jammu and Kashmir was not clear.\nIn October 1947, Pakistan, through tribal Pathans, began to invade Kashmir. Sensing\na security threat, Hari Singh, Maharaja of Kashmir, acceded to India by signing an\nInstrument of Accession. The conflict between India and Pakistan on Kashmir ended\non ist January, 1949 with an agreed ceasefire. The ceasefire created a Pakistan\nOccupied Kashmir (POK) region. The Indian Army could have marched ahead in\nPOK zone to drive out Pakistan but the hostile climate and Pakistani guerrilla tactics\nprevented India from taking these measures. Kautilya clarifies that a state should not\ngo and fight in an area which has a territory which is ungovernable. The inhospitable\nterrain of POK and its hostile climate made India land up in a situation where it could\nnot, finally, capture POK. The logistics kept India back while poor military\ninfrastructure compounded upon it to complicate issues. The two concepts of\nKautilya, Bhumisandhi (not entering in territory which is ungovernable) and Vyasana\n(a state needs to take precautions and ensure logistics before war) were both missing.\n\nIn case of the 1962 conflict with China, which ultimately concluded in a\nceasefire in Arunanchal, the Chinese had indeed reached the foothills but retreated\nbecause the people of Arunanchal did not support China and from the Bhumisandhi\npoint of view, China refrained from getting into the business of capturing land\n(Arunachal) which was deemed ungovernable."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The Act of 1773 also made the Governor of Bengal as the\nGovernor General of British possessions in India. The British primarily aimed to ensure\nthat no European power threatens British presence in India.

In\neach instance the British tried to assert their Grand Strategy.\nInstance-1: In 1798, Napoleon invaded Egypt. Napoleon also planned, with the then-\n\nRussian Czar Alexander-I, in 1807 to invade India. The Russian Czar and Napoleon\nconcluded the Treaty of Titlist to achieve their objectives. When the British got to know\n\nabout this treaty, they sent friendly missions to secure Muscat, Afghanistan, Persia, Sindh\nand safely secured all routes to the British Empire in India.\n\nInstance-2: The British decided to manage the entire stretch of land border by\nestablishing a semicircle from Iran to Burma and the Indian Government decided that\nexcept Iran, the foreign relations of all states would be decided by the British Crown. They\nadopted the policy of a buffer establishment.\n\nThe idea was to protect one nation by making its neighbour a buffer from outside\ninterference. This policy was followed since 1880’s. The buffer was not a satellite state—\nit had its sovereign government internally but its external sovereignty was under British\ncontrol. For example, in 1902 Lord Lansdowne also clarified that a buffer state prevents\ndirect contact between the British and other states. The entire system of these buffers was\ncalled the system of rising fence. In the outer rising fence were Iran, Afghanistan and\nTibet and in the inner were Nepal, Bhutan and Ceylon. By this method, the British\nsuccessfully kept China and Russia at bay.\n\nInstance-3: China, in the mid-17\" century, was ruled by the Qing dynasty. It ruled over\nmajor areas in China but Tibet and Xinjiang were sovereign territories. The British had\ncontrol over Tibet, Nepal and Bhutan as buffers. These territories were neither princely\nstates nor colonies and the British maintained separate treaties with each of them. For the\nBritish, Tibet was not very important till early 1700. Over a period of time, some Tibetan\nmonks had established relations with the Tsar in Russia. In 1899, Lord Curzon decided to\nsend an expedition to Tibet for fear that the Tzar may use Tibetans to foment trouble for\nthe British. In 1903, the expedition left for Lhasa. But in 1904, when they reached Tibet,\nDalai Lama fled to Mongolia. The British subsequently signed a convention in 1904 and\nmade Tibet a British protectorate with Tibet remaining under the Qing Dynasty. From then\nonwards, Qing Dynasty ruled over it but Tibet was a British Protectorate. After the Tibetan\nrevolt in 1912, the British in 1914 undertook a survey and established a map and\ndemarcated, using a red line, the Indo—Tibet boundary.\n\nInstance—4: At the international level, post-World War I, India was a part of Imperial war\nconference and signed the Treaty of Versailles and subsequently became a member of\nLeague of Nations and ILO. India, surprisingly, was the one and only non-self-governing\nnation of the world in the League of Nations and after the World War II, India became a\nUN member in 1945 while still under British rule.

Ahimsa became a new line of thought. After 1947, there was\nfurther clarity on foreign policy. Idealism and world peace were established as stated goals\nby India’s non-alignment movement and were rooted in ideology of non-violence and non-\naggression. The Constituent Assembly debates talked about foreign policy twice. Firstly it\ndebated Article 51 in the constitution that strives to promote international peace and\nsecurity by having honourable relations with all and respect to international peace and\nsecurity by having honourable relations with all and respect to international treaties, laws\nand encouraged that disputes be settled by arbitration. This view of Article 51 was\nrecognized by Biswanath Das and B M Khardekar as combined legacy of India’s spiritual\nheritage. The second instance was that of the issue of India’s membership to the\nCommonwealth (elaborated as a case study in India—Britain relations chapter). The\nnationalist leaders favoured a united Asia and an Asian Federation. In 1930, the first Pan\nAsiatic Federation Conference happened as well. As the WW II ended, the establishment\nof UN translated the Indian idea of an Asian Federation into a World Federation.\n\nThe Congress had established an outlook on the world since 1885. Initially, the idea\nwas to use the support of the British to get Indians in the administration and then use it as\na bargaining chip. India supported the British against Russia but Indian leaders knew that\nRussia would not attack India. India opposed the British advancement in the North East as\nterritorial aggression. After WW I, India supported the idea of ‘Right to Self\nDetermination’ and democracy but as the British refused to extend it to India, the leaders\nfelt disillusioned.

India,\nunder Nehru, displayed a suitable combination of assertion and non-violence by\nmaintaining positive neutralism through non-alignment. The policy of non-alignment,\nrightly based on enlightened self-interest, aptly guided India during the turbulent Cold\nWar period and also echoed in us that great power status can be achieved only by moral\nidealism and not by any form of territorial or military aggression.\n\nHowever, despite India advocating for non-alignment, India did recognise and\ndiplomatically engage with a host of nations, ranging from Korea to Congo. The US\ncertainly was not comfortable with NAM and perceived it as an international liability that\nundermined American influence.

In 1949, an Afghan Trade Delegation\nvisited Delhi and concluded a Treaty of Friendship.

The problem repeatedly observed with DRDO is\nof over-promise and under-delivery. There is a huge soldier-scientist disconnect that\naggravates concerns of domestic defence production. The Home Ministry provides support\nthrough the Indo Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) at the Chinese border and Border Security\nForce (BSF) at Pakistan and Bangladesh border and is involved in border conflicts with\nthe nations.\n\nIn India, foreign policy and defence of the nation are domains of the Union executive\nthat finds mention in List 1 of the seventh schedule of the Constitution. As foreign policy\nis the domain of the executive, there is no need of Parliamentary approval to declare\ntreaties unlike in the US, where both houses of US Congress need to approve bills, thereby\nimposing limits on Federal authority. In the US, two instances are worth noting where\nCongress refused ratification. The first was when Woodrow Wilson agreed that the US\nwould be a part of League of Nations which the congress rejected and same was the case\nin 1999, when Clinton signed Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) while the Congress\nrejected it again. In India, if a treaty is very significant and if some groups oppose it and if\n\nthey want to ascertain the confidence of the government’s own numbers, then the\nParliament could vote. This happened, for instance, in case of the Indo-US nuclear deal\nwhen a vote of confidence was sought. However, in India, the Executive does not have\nunbridled control as the Parliament, through the Estimates Committee, the Public\nAccounts Committee, and various other notions and resolutions can scrutinise the\ngovernment’s actions and seek explanations. For instance, in the first annual financial\nstatement in the Parliament, some members had discussed the increase in postal rates in\nIndia and Pakistan."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Many\npeople in India did not appreciate India joining the British Commonwealth. A heated\ndebate took place in the Parliament and members proposed many changes. The\ngovernment finally accepted the use of appropriate language to explain the reasons of\njoining the Commonwealth to all members lucidly. This clearly proved that even\nduring the prime ministerial rule of Jawaharlal Nehru, he was highly checked by the\nforces of the Indian Parliament.\n\nAgain in November, 2013, Manmohan Singh had taken the decision to be a part of\nthe Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) Summit in Colombo at a\ntime that coincided with the fourth Eelam War. The DMK and AIADMK in Tamil Nadu\nLegislative Council passed a resolution urging the Indian Government to enforce\neconomic sanctions and let UN investigate civilian genocide in Sri Lanka. The sentiment\ntouched a raw nerve and Manmohan Singh decided not to attend CHOGM and send the\nForeign Minister instead.\n\nFrom 1950 to 1980, India had a closed economy and the private sector had little\nscope in having any role in foreign relations. However, by the end of the Cold War, the\nprivate sector had become a key player. In fact, in many bilateral relations, we find that\ntrade diplomacy is purely dominated by the private sector. As we shall see in subsequent\nchapters on Africa and Latin America, Indian commercial diplomacy is primarily private\nsector dominated.\n\nThe media plays an important role in moulding foreign policy and taking it to the\npeople. Media can draw attention on foreign policy issues. There have been cases where\nthe media was responsible for creating public support for the government but at times, the\nmedia is also found to indulge in manufacturing consent. The media was highly controlled\nin India during Cold War and was only somewhat liberated in the post-Cold War period. In\n1999, during the Kargil War, the media actually reported from the warzone and helped in\ncreating an emotional wave of sympathy for soldiers giving rise to a feeling of\nnationalism. The government also used the conflict situation appropriately to empower the\nmedia.\n\nIndian media helped shape perceptions but the lack of correspondence from abroad\nand reliance on foreign footage made the job difficult for them at times. The extent of how\nmuch media can mould perception is based on the government’s agenda and in India, the\n\nmedia is yet to evolve fully to influence the electorate as, for instance, in the US. For\nexample, the role of media in India can be judged by the fact that when in 2004-2005,\nIndia and the US undertook aggressive rapprochement, the left parties were highly critical\nof growing Indo-US proximity but the media stood by the government in their support to\nthe increasing bonhomie between India and US.\n\nA lot of foreign policy bureaucrats do play a role in PMO as also wherever they go on\ndeputation. At times, the PMO also creates special envoys to negotiate on issue of\nparamount importance, such as climate change and nuclear power. Considering the fact\nthat India’s economic profile is growing, coordination at times does become an issue."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The most important factor influencing the operational part of foreign\npolicy is the geopolitics that governs the nation and its neighbouring region. After India\nbecame independent in 1947, it initiated the process of developing its foreign policy. The\nIndian Foreign Policy (hereafter referred to as IFP) that came to be developed was under\nthe leadership of Nehru. Nehru nurtured and shaped the IFP but did not invent the IFP. The\nIFP has its roots in India’s past and its traditions. When India became independent, it was\neconomically and militarily underdeveloped. It was imperative, at that moment, to evolve\nthe right set of priorities. India had to make a choice of either developing the state\n\nmilitarily or economically. Nehru realised that states like Pakistan and Thailand focused\non developing their military establishments at the cost of developing their nations\neconomically; these states thereby had unstable politics. In this context, Nehru understood\nthat the foundation of social coherence lies in economic strength. The Nehruvian\nperspective was that economic strength is the guarantee of security of a state and a strong\neconomic base could also later enable India to develop a robust military. Nehru, therefore,\nshifted India’s focus on industrial development.\n\nAn understanding of the weaknesses of a nascent nation at the time of independence\nand the potential of India as a great power were the two core approaches that dominated\nthe IFP in that period. Some scholars assert that Nehruvian policy lacked a sense of\nrealism. This may not be entirely true because events during his tenure suggest that he\nsteered the country through the prism of the Cold War without sacrificing the quest for\nIndia’s strategic autonomy. During the Cold War, when the USA and the USSR were\ntrying to bring other states into their ideological orbit, Nehru, in order to shield India from\npredatory international powers, made a decision to join the Commonwealth as a security\nguarantee. Joining the Commonwealth in no way affected India’s quest for strategic\nautonomy in the international affairs. It would be right to assert that Nehru was against\nideologisation, but favoured the logic of power of ideas in foreign policy even while\nrejecting any sort of fundamentalism in the foreign policy discourse. In fact, Nehru never\nfavoured moralism in the application of foreign policy; rather, he stated that it was the\nbipolar world that had resorted to preaching one or the other kind of ideology. Nehru\nclarified that the art of conducting foreign policy is about asserting the national interests of\nIndia. Nehru stated that while a country is focussed on its own self-interests, it may enter\ninto situations leading to clash of interests with other states. In such scenarios, Nehru\nfavoured focussing on enlightened self-interest as a tool to harmonise the differentiated\ninterests of the states.\n\nThough the origin of IFP is traced to ancient texts and leaders, its immediate roots lay\nin the Indian struggle for independence against the British. It was during the Indian\nNational Movement (INM) that India developed certain principle elements to its foreign\npolicy that were used by India throughout the Cold War. It was during the INM that India\ndeclared its commitment to fight imperialism and colonialism and support the unity of all\nnations struggling to fight imperialism and colonialism. The period after the World War-II\nsaw the decline of imperialism but also led to the economic and military dominance of the\nUSA. This led to an arms race between the USA and the USSR which ultimately became\nnuclear in nature during the Cold War. It was against such a backdrop, with an arms race\nand an ideological war waging across the world, that India had to evolve its foreign policy.\nIndia, being a non-communist country, was not welcomed in the Soviet bloc. India on its\npart did not entertain any intentions of joining the Communist bloc either. Joining the US\nbloc was out of the question as India perceived USA as a mouth piece for capitalism\nwhich it believed to be a form of neo imperialism. During the Cold War, India always felt\nthat the USA is trying to step into the shoes of the erstwhile imperialist powers. Joining\nthe US bloc would have therefore meant for India to go against the entire tradition of its\nnational movement.\n\nThe Nehruvian idea was very clear. Joining any bloc would lead to lessening of the\nsovereign space for decision making that India fought for during the INM. For Nehru, the\n\npriority was to promote global peace and support anti-colonial struggles while adopting\nindependence in deciding domestic, foreign, economic and military policy. For India, its\nimmediate foreign policy priority was not the conflict in Europe but India’s immediate\nneighbourhood. For that matter, Nehru himself asserted that India’s neighbouring\ncountries were the first on his mind and this was followed by other Asian states and\nAfrica. For Nehru, the main problem during the Cold War was not Communism or its\ncontainment but the development of India and to do so, it had to avoid falling in line either\nwith the Soviet camp or the Washington led ‘Freedom’ camp that was gaining prominence\nin Asia. At the heart of our foreign policy was an urge to advance our national interests\nand ensure our space for strategic autonomy. For India, its priority was to have an\nindependent foreign policy. An independent foreign policy involved interactions with all\nplayers of the system while retaining the ability to make one’s own decisions regarding\none’s own issues. It is from here that the spirit of non-alignment was born. Non-aligned\nmovement (NAM) eventually emerged as India’s core foreign policy tool for the next few\ndecades.\n\nHave faith in UNO\nMaintain your distinct identity Interact with all nations but\nand autonomy in foreign policy stay away from power politics\nRe-distributed global fesources » Resolve all international\nfor economic development disputes peacefully\n\nServe own national interests» Emergo as a thid force\n\nand not as a third bloc\n\nIn fact, it is not wrong to assert that non-alignment emerged as the sister policy of the\nnon-violent Satyagraha movement pioneered by Gandhi. As more and more independent\nnations were sucked up into the ideological orbit of the two superpowers in Asia and\nAfrica, India saw this as a rise of neo-colonialism. For Nehru, the falling of the shadow of\nCold War in Asia and Africa was colonialism in new clothes. Thus, India and its foreign\npolicy took up the lead to support movements against colonialism and imperialism\n(perceived as neo-colonialism) to maintain world peace. These two were deeply enmeshed\nin the IFP concept of non-alignment which was based on the core principle of rationality.\n\nThe basis of non-alignment was the ancient Indian philosophy of looking at reality\nfrom different prisms and recognising that reality is not merely black and white and that it\ncould have many shades of grey. For the US, during the Cold War, the world was a\ncompletely polarised affair, with a clear demarcation of black and white and no other\nshade in between. Thus, the US found it very difficult to reconcile with the Indian concept\nof NAM all throughout the cold war."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

This brought India and Pakistan into conflict with each\nother. To complain about the Pakistani aggression, India, on advice of the British,\ntook the matter to the UN Security Council. The western powers led by the USA\nwere determined on getting an unfavourable resolution passed at the UNSC against\nIndia. They wanted to favour Pakistan for allowing its territory to be used by the\nWest to contain the Soviets. The USA, for that matter, had urged Turkey and Pakistan\nto sign a mutual defence treaty which was followed by the creation of the Southeast\nAsia Treaty Organisation (SEATO) in 1954 and Central Treaty Organisation\n(CENTO) in 1955. Pakistan emerged as a member of both SEATO and CENTO,\nthereby bringing Cold War politics right to India’s doorsteps. In order to strengthen\nthe case of Pakistan, the West started to support Pakistan outright at the Security\nCouncil. This compelled India to deter Western action by tilting towards Soviets and\ncompelling the Soviets to use their veto power in the Council. In fact, the Kashmir\nissue and the Soviets veto brought India and the USSR closer. This proximity\ndeepened in 1954 when Nikita Khrushchev on a visit to India visited Kashmir and\nasserted it to be an integral part of India. It is not wrong to conclude that the Kashmir\nissue led to qualitative improvements in Indo—Soviet relations.\n\nIndia, throughout the initial years, kept its foreign policy focus on providing support\nto nations to fight imperialism and preserve peace post-independence. Preservation of\npeace became an integral part of our own foreign policy because only with peace in the\nworld was consistent economic development possible. The preservation of peace found its\npresence even in the Belgrade Conference of Non-aligned states held in 1961 from where\na delegation was dispatched to both USA and USSR to halt nuclear testing. All these\ninitiatives of Nehru, despite the economic and military backwardness of India, brought\nIndia to the centre of the world stage.\n\nMany times, India’s offices were used to sort out international differences. In early\n1950’s, Northern Korea invaded South Korea. North Korea stated that the invasion was\nlaunched as an attempt to unify Korea. The US forces joined the war to assist South\nKorea. The US forces, led by General MacArthur, drove the forces of North back and the\nUSA forcibly unified Korea, stretching the unified territory till the Chinese and North\nKorean frontier. The Chinese felt that the US could attack their territory and they\nimmediately responded by dispatching their volunteer forces to check USA. The unfolding\nKorean crises led to the establishment of a Korean Commission at the UN under the\nchairmanship of India to resolve the issues. This issue of the Korean crisis proves how the\ngood offices of India were used in unravelling the knots between USA and China.\n\nChina’s history had been dominated by feudalism and a lot has depended on the\nability of the Emperor to provide staple food (rice) to the people. From 1945 to 1947, a\nnationalist uprising in China led to the coming of a new government. The erstwhile sick\nman of Asia had finally turned around with a powerful central government that ended all\ndisruption affecting China since the last century. India also understood clearly, like the rest\nof the world, that the Chinese revolution indeed entailed a fundamental transformation of\nthe Chinese society where the new nationalist upsurge led to the rise of a communist state.\nIn this rise of a new China, India now had to adopt its policy. The new China became very\nassertive and even dispatched a military force to Tibet compelling Sardar Vallabhbhai\n\nhave been better had India made an offer of a formal recognition of Tibet as a Chinese\nregion in return for a written agreement from China on border alignment, with concessions\non India’s border positions.

This made China more hostile to India and it saw its\nmanifestations on the border dispute. Perceiving no Chinese retreat from the disputed area,\ncoupled with discovery of Chinese roads through the Aksai Chin region; India initiated a\nforward policy ultimately compelling the Chinese to react in October 1962. The Chinese\nreaction in the form of a strike from across the border was again miscalculated by India as\nit thought that the Chinese could possibly launch a full-scale offensive in the Assam hills\nand occupy large tracts of North-East India. This led India to hastily seek USA’s support\nwhere a letter from Nehru to John F. Kennedy was sent to solicit military assistance to\nmitigate the Chinese threat. The Chinese, before USA could even respond, retreated back\nto the old positions and observed status quo. The intention of the Chinese was not to\nlaunch an outright offensive with India but, to teach India a lesson and assert Chinese\nsuperiority. Ultimately, China did not gain anything from the hostilities, as it later resorted\nto what Nehru had advocated. It initiated a replica of Nehruvian NAM in the name of\nChinese independent foreign policy.

She then visited USA with a hope of evolving a new dimension in the bilateral\nrelationship based on democratic values. Her visit to the USA, however, failed to\n\nfraternise an abrasive bilateral relationship. The USA spent its powers of persuasion in\nmuting Indian criticism of USA—Vietnam war, linking Indian response to the USA-\nVietnam conflict to future food shipments, which led Indira Gandhi to adopt a domestic\nstrategy to revive agriculture. Indira Gandhi, after her USA visit, was firm that India\nwould not remain dependent upon foreign states for food security and would achieve self-\nsufficiency in food production within the next five years.\n\nIt was during the 1970 Lusaka NAM summit where scholars were able to get an\ninsight into the essential tenets of foreign policy as was being adopted by Indira Gandhi.\nFor the first time, she emphasised that India wished to be friends with all nations but on\nthe basis of equality. She asserted that no state can look to India as an inferior state and\nIndia would conduct its diplomacy with all states (read the USA and the USSR) on equal\nfooting. In fact, Indira Gandhi boldly criticised the US at various NAM meetings for their\naggression in Vietnam while the Indian agriculture saw a revival.\n\nHowever, it wasn’t long before India faced another crisis in the form of East\nPakistan’s bid for secession from the unity of Pakistan. When the British left India and\nPakistan, they had divided Pakistan into West and East Pakistan. East Pakistan or East\nBengal was a Muslim majority area, with the population consisting of mostly Bengali\nMuslims. East Pakistan had always received a step-brotherly treatment from West\nPakistan. West Pakistan even imposed Urdu over their native Bengali Language and\nlooted East Pakistani resources without focussing on any substantial economic\ndevelopment of the region. This neglect paved way for the leadership of Sheikh Mujibur\nRehman, who, under the umbrella of Awami League, championed the cause of Bengali\nnationalism. In December 1970, elections took place in both East and West Pakistan and\nas per the result, Sheikh Mujibur Rehaman of the Awami League won the elections in East\nPakistan while Zulfikar Ali Bhuto’s Pakistan People’s Party won in West Pakistan. Bhutto,\ntrying to mitigate his party’s loss in East Pakistan, began to initiate a new ‘democratic’\nprinciple and began to assert that as per this principle, both West and East being at par\nwith each other, the West has an equal right to form the government in the East. West\nPakistan, thereafter, imposed martial law in East Pakistan, leading to arrest of Mujibur\nRehaman and a massive crackdown in the region. Due to the arrest of Rehman, an internal\ncrisis began in East Pakistan and a lot of East Pakistanis began to enter into India for\nsafety. India began to build international pressure on West Pakistan to halt suppression and\nrevert back to the democratic processes. The USA remained unmoved even as the\ninternational media highlighting the atrocities in the East. As USA refused to budge, India\ntook up the opportunity to conclude a Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation: with the\nUSSR in August 1971 where the Soviets agreed to an immediate consultation with each\nother if either side met with any form of aggression. The treaty served the purpose of\nwarning Washington not to pursue any military design against India.\n\nIn December 1971, Pakistan resorted to a pre-emptive strike on Indian Air Force\nairplanes. The Indian side perceived this as an attack on Indian sovereignty and decided to\nretaliate. War broke out yet again and within three days, Indian forces reached Dacca and\nrecognised Bangladesh as a new state, compelling Pakistani troops to finally surrender.\nThe USA even sent a nuclear armed USS Enterprise Aircraft Carrier into the Bay of\nBengal but the Indo-Soviet treaty constrained it further. Sheikh Mujibur Rehaman was\nhanded over power finally while India held 92,000 prisoners of war. This was followed by\n\nthe Simla Summit of June 1972, where Pakistani PM Bhutto urged for release of not only\nthe prisoners of war but also the territory captured by India belonging to West Pakistan.\nOn 1* July 1972, the Simla Agreement was signed urging peaceful resolution of Kashmir\nissue through dialogue and negotiations. The creation of Bangladesh came as a big blow to\nUSA, with US president Nixon, along with Henry Kissinger, having to reconcile to the\nnew ground realities of South Asia.\n\nThe USA faced another issue in 1974 when India tested a nuclear explosion. It\nunderstood that India cannot be taken lightly and that it is a major regional power. Indira\nGandhi, however, chose to keep the nuclear testing to level of peaceful use only and did\nnot go a step further to declare India a nuclear weapon state. India clearly understood that\nthe root cause of the regional imbalance plaguing South Asia was created by the USA’s\nsupplying of arms to Pakistan, which wanted to attain parity with India. The USA on the\nother hand, after the 1974 nuclear test by India, again announced an arms package\ndesigned for Pakistan. It asserted that 1974 nuclear test has disturbed the balance and the\nnew power structure favours India, compelling USA to redress and re-maintain the\nbalance. However, due to the severe economic costs of the 1971 war, India again slipped\ninto crisis and the subsequent domestic developments like emergency contributed to the\nfall of Indira Gandhi and the rise of Morarji Desai. Even during the Desai regime, there\nwas no change in the major practices of the IFP. However due to internal disturbances, the\ngovernment fell and was then replaced in 1980 with an Indira Gandhi government yet\nagain. Indira Gandhi, upon taking power in 1980, was confronted with the question of\nAfghanistan.\n\nIn 1979, on the invitation of Kabul, the Soviets had invaded Afghanistan. The USA\nrealised the problem and further began to pump aid and arms to Pakistan. The USA began\nto use Pakistan as a frontline state to support and arm elements to weaken Soviet presence\nin Afghanistan. Such elements created by the USA and nurtured by Pakistan emerged in\nthe form of Al-Qaeda and the Taliban. This period saw the birth of the Al-Qaeda to target\nthe Communist front in Afghanistan. India maintained neutrality. It neither condemned the\nSoviet invasion nor supported it. The USA asserted that non-condemnation by India is a\nsign of Indian support to the Soviet policy. But India stood upright and based its policy on\nthe merit of the situation. Indira Gandhi sustained a prolonged dialogue with the US and\nmaintained the economic dimension of their bilateral diplomacy. She did the same with\nrespect to China and followed the same policy to break the ice with India’s mighty\nneighbour. In both cases, she restored the same hallmark of the IFP, that is, to follow the\nIndia’s basic interests without sacrificing India’s strategic autonomy. She beautifully\nenmeshed flexibility with national interests and continued her foreign policy on realistic\nterms. Her most important contribution was to make India into a brand equal to the great\npowers.\n\nMoral goodness with no aggression bane ace as\n+ laieaailiiaaail\n\neo,\n\n* Focus trees\n\nlod to probloms in 1962\n* ad Indo-Pak\n\nwar 19620\" 1968 and 1971 \\\n+ Pakistan Policy = Dialogue\n\ny \\\n© Nuclear = Had nuclear programme\nbut no testing or PNE\n\n\"Seti an\n\nIndia conducts a nuclear test\nIndia tests. in 1998 and emerges as a\nPNE-1 in 1978 Nuclear Weapon State."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

His approach\nin foreign policy was to follow the tradition of non-alignment but he simultaneously\nattempted giving it a contemporary touch. In his visit to the USA in 1985, he reaffirmed\nthe common values that India and USA stood for while also highlighting the dangers of\nthe possibility of a nuclearised Pakistan. A considerable amount of diplomatic efforts\nunfolded between India and USA in political and economic aspects. Social and cultural\ndiplomacy found a new place in the evolving relationship. The major focus of Rajiv\nGandhi was on India’s neighbourhood where considerable diplomatic and political capital\nwas invested. During his times, India and Pakistan signed an agreement not to attack each\nother’s nuclear facilities but the rapid acceleration of Pakistani nuclear capabilities became\nan immense concern for India. Though Rajiv Gandhi was a strong advocate of nuclear\ndisarmament and in 1988 had even presented the Rajiv Gandhi action plan for nuclear\ndisarmament, he had to also guarantee India’s security. Rajiv gave a nod to the Indian\nnuclear scientist fraternity and authorised them to manufacture nuclear weapons for India.\nThis decision was taken to prevent any nuclear blackmailing from any side. Sri Lanka was\nanother state that demanded Rajiv’s attention. The Sri Lankan army had taken siege of\nJaffna region and the Tamilian Sri Lankans faced tremendous chaos and persecution. India\ndecided to airdrop supplies of essentials for the people of Jaffna which was perceived by\nSri Lanka as a violation of its sovereignty. To break the ice, in 1987, Rajiv and J.\nJayawardene concluded India—Sri Lanka Accord. As per the accords, LTTE would\nsurrender; there would be a unified Sri Lanka; Sri Lanka to undertake devolution in Tamil\nmajority areas and Sri Lanka will allow its territory be used by foreign powers. As per the\nAccord, an Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) would supervise the surrender of LTTE to\nensure peace. The accord and IPKF were perceived by many in Sri Lanka as a violation of\ntheir sovereignty. Jayawardene was succeeded by Premadasa who ordered immediate\nwithdrawal of Indian troops from Sri Lanka. Rajiv Gandhi, in the meantime, was\nassassinated by LTTE cadre and this led to withdrawal of all Indian sympathy for LTTE.\n\nRajiv Gandhi also took steps to speed up relations with China. During his 1989 visit\nto China, both sides agreed that the border issue should not hinder the improvement of\nbilateral ties in other dimensions. The idea of Deng Xioping was that the border issue\nshould be separated from other issues and both sides should deepen ties in other\n\ndimensions and later renegotiate the border issue in a more relaxed atmosphere. Rajiv\nGandhi agreed to this logic. During his tenure, Rajiv Gandhi remained committed to the\ncore values of non-alignment and supported anti-racialist struggles in Africa. He also used\nNAM as a tool to promote the economic interests of India. Thus, it is not wrong to\nconclude that Rajiv Gandhi, too, followed the policy of “enlightened self-interests”."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

At that moment, IFP had to face some serious challenges. These challenges\nare going to be elaborated in depth in the chapter ahead. Here, we attempt a brief glimpse\nof the situation.\n\nIn 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait. This led to the beginning of the Gulf War-I. As Gulf\nWar-I broke out in a region which was the economic lifeline for the west, USA jumped\ninto the conflict to help Kuwait. USA could not allow Saddam Hussein to have a free run\nin this strategic region. For India, the Gulf War-I had severe consequences. India had\nperceived Iraq very differently. Iraq was not only one of the most secular states but also\nnot a member of Organization of Islamic States. From the Indian point of view, Iraq was a\ncrucial state because it had always been favourable towards India on the Kashmir\nquestion. In 1990, India and Iraq had even entered into an agreement where Iraq was to\nsupply 2.5 million tons of oil to India in 1990-91. All this led to a delayed response from\nIndia on the Gulf war. India, however, supported the UN resolution against Iraq and urged\nIraq to withdraw from Kuwait. By that time, the USA had launched a fully-fledged\nmilitary invasion of Iraq to force it to withdraw from Kuwait. What also worked in favour\nof the USA was the situation in Russia. In 1989, the Soviet Union had already\ndisintegrated. The Communist regimes in Eastern Europe had collapsed. This ended the\nsole adversary of USA in the world. The US displayed tremendous military power in Iraq\nduring Gulf War. The situation ended the bipolar world order established after the World\nWar-II and eventually led to the origin of a new, unipolar world order. The USA now\nemerged as the sole superpower. Its military intervention against Iraq could not be\nchallenged by any player in the international system.\n\nAfter a while, in India, P V Narasimha Rao emerged as a new PM. Rao inherited a\ncrumbling domestic economy and a rapidly changing international situation. At the\ndomestic level, Rao initiated a dialogue to intensify relations with the USA and China.\nHowever, at that time, USA wanted a roll back of the Indian nuclear programme. The\nClinton administration, aiming for parity between India and Pakistan, began the\nhyphenation of the two states. In America, Senator Larry Presseler had passed an\namendment to some laws which stated that any state engaging in a nuclear weapons\nprogramme would not receive any aid and if any aid was being given to such a nation, it\nshall be suspended automatically. The Clinton administration, in their tilt towards\nPakistan, lobbied with the Congress aggressively for abolishing the Pressler amendment\nwhich, according to the USA administration, was a barrier to equip Pakistan with military\naid. Aid to Pakistan was suspended during the administration of George Bush Senior. It is\nironical that, to counter the USSR’s influence in Afghanistan, not only did USA aid\nPakistan, but also conveniently turned a blind eye to the Pakistani nuclear programme.\nThings, however, changed after Geneva Accords 1989 and subsequent Soviet\n\ndisintegration. The priorities of Clinton administration were the hyphenation of India and\nPakistan and to make both parties sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). In the\nperiod immediately after the Cold War, though USA had begun to favour Pakistan and\nwanted to revive its alliance with the country, it also realised that it could not ignore India\nas India was a new emerging market.\n\nOn the other hand, by 1990, following the complete disintegration of Soviet Union,\nthe erstwhile USSR was now succeeded by Russia, which meant that India had now lost\nthe patronage of the erstwhile USSR. What was worrisome for India was the future supply\nof defence products. During the Cold War, Russia was one of the major defence suppliers\nto India. Now after the end of Cold War, India had to renegotiate all contracts and at\ncertain places even sign new contracts. However, the greater dilemma was with whom\nwere these new contracts to be negotiated. There was a vacuum and not much clarity. At\nthis juncture, many in Russia felt the need to end the special favour for India. Under\nintense USA pressure, Russia even refused to provide India with cryogenic technology for\nits space programme, citing that the technology could be used by India for military\npurposes. However, things normalised when Boris Yeltsin visited India in 1993. During\nhis visit, the 1971 India—Russia Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation was revised with 14\nadditional clauses and was signed to mark a new era in bilateral relationship post-Cold\nWar.\n\nAt the same time Rao also developed new contacts with the five Central Asian\nRepublics that emerged after the breakup of USSR. Today, Central Asia continues to be\nthe area of the New Great Game where search for oil continues even at present. India is\nactively engaged in the region now, officially as a member of the Shanghai Cooperation\nOrganization (SCO). During the time, when Rao was reaching out to USA, China Russia\nand Central Asia, India’s relationship with Pakistan remained tensed. In 1992, the Babri\nMasjid demolition by Swayam Sewaks and the subsequent 1993 Mumbai blasts\ndeteriorated the relationship and could not be normalised as Pakistan initiated verbal\nthreats about using a nuclear bomb in case of a future conflict with India. By this time, it\nwas an open secret that China had helped Pakistan acquire its nuclear capabilities. Despite\nall these developments, Rao tried to put up a strong face but during this tenure, any\nimprovements in the relationship with Pakistan could not materialise."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The basic foreign policy idea of Gujral was\nthat India is a dominant power in the South Asian region and by this virtue when it deals\ndiplomatically with states around itself, it should not look for arithmetical reciprocity. The\ncore of the idea was to give more than what you may take from a foreign state. In a\nsimpler language, the Gujral Doctrine meant that if a neighbour moved an inch, India\nshould move a yard. This policy would enable India, according to him, to pursue a new\nquality of relationship with its neighbours, leading to sober and constructive responses\nfrom the neighbourhood.\n\nGujral took his first lead with Bangladesh. Bangladesh and India relations were\ndeeply frozen since the assassination of Mujibur Rehman. Gujral took into confidence\nJyoti Basu, the then Chief Minister of West Bengal, and began to initiate a dialogue with\n\nHasina Wajed of Bangladesh on settling the issue related to water utilisation of Ganga\nRiver. A thirty-year treaty on Ganga River water sharing was hammered out. This brought\nabout a new air of freshness in the relationship. After the death of Rajiv Gandhi, India had\nstayed away from the domestic political concerns of Sri Lanka and the relations had\nslipped to an all-time low. But Gujral also initiated talks with the Chandrika Kumaratunga\ngovernment in Sri Lanka.\n\nWith respect to Pakistan, Gujral asserted to call off all verbal warfare tactics which\nwere on in full swing due to the issues arising out of the nuclearisation of Pakistan. He\neven instructed RAW to dismantle all human assets it had established in Pakistan for\ncovert operations as he perceived them as tools that would hinder constructive\nengagement with Pakistan. Gujral revived the dialogue process with Nawaz Sharif at the\nforeign secretary level. India wanted a dialogue on the political, economic, cultural and\nsocial fronts while Pakistan’s sole agenda was Kashmir. A dialogue was initiated but ties\nhobbled. During Gujral’s term, relations with China improved significantly. Chinese\npresident Jiang Zemin visited India in 1996. Both sides signed an agreement to maintain\npeace and tranquillity at the border. Jiang visited Pakistan after his visit to India. He urged\nPakistan to shelve those issues for some time that hinder bilateral cooperation and explore\nother diplomatic dimensions. The reference indirectly was to Kashmir. But hardly any\nchange was seen in the Pakistani establishment. As argued previously, the core goal of\nClinton administration was to make India sign the CTBT; India realised that CTBT along\nwith NPT would create a discriminatory world order. During Gujral’s meeting with\nClinton in 1997 on the side lines of the UN General Assembly meeting, Gujral explained\nthe reasons for India’s refusal to sign the CTBT but also showcased the tremendous\neconomic opportunities available for the USA with India. This dual approach worked well.\nThus, during the tenure of Gujral, a push for economic diplomacy with the US became the\ncore driver of the foreign policy."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

From 11* to 13\" May 1998, the\ngovernment carried out nuclear tests. These tests were significant because one of the tests\nconducted in Pokhran was a thermonuclear test which indicated hydrogen bomb\ncapability. India reached the sub-critical level in the tests and generated enough data in\nthese experiments where further improvements could be carried out through computer\nsimulation. Thus, after the operation Shakti I-V (the codename for the tests), India\ndeclared itself a Nuclear Weapon State. The most important achievement of Pokhran-II\nwas the fact that India no longer required to undertake underground nuclear tests but could\nsuccessfully use the data generated for computer simulations to improvise the yield of the\nbomb. India thus declared a voluntary moratorium on further nuclear testing. The tests\ndone by India were immediately followed by nuclear tests by Pakistan. The Pakistani side\nalso tested their atomic bombs. Vajpayee in a letter to Clinton asserted that India faced\nthreats from China and Pakistan and that these were compelling reasons for India to\nundertake nuclear tests. The letter to Clinton was leaked to the New York Times and this\naggravated tensions further between India and China. After the tests in India, there were\ninternational sanctions including sanctions by IMF and World Bank on further assistance\nto India.\n\nHowever, Vajpayee decided to break the logjam with Pakistan and inaugurated a bus\nservice between Delhi and Lahore. Vajpayee also visited Lahore and concluded the Lahore\nDeclaration. Even as new enthusiasm between the two states to improve ties was being\ngenerated, the Pakistan army led by General Pervez Musharraf planned a new campaign in\nKashmir. The manifestation of this planning was seen in May-June 1999 when the\nPakistani side crossed the Line of Control and captured peaks on the Indian soil in Kargil.\nAs India began to drive out the intruders, Nawaz Sharif asked for help from the Clinton\nadministration in US in case India increased the offensive. Clinton, on the other hand,\nadvised Sharif to order his army to pull back from the occupied territories and not breach\nthe LOC. The conflict ended after Indian forces captured all the peaks occupied by\nPakistan. In Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif was deposed and after a dubious referendum,\nMusharraf took over as the President of Pakistan.\n\nIn 2001, another initiative towards dialogue took place between Vajpayee and\nMusharraf at Agra. The Agra Summit failed to achieve any breakthrough as Pakistan\nwanted Kashmir to be added as the core issue in the joint statement while India wanted the\naddition of cross border terrorism. Both sides rejected each other’s demand and therefore\nNo joint statement came out after the Agra summit.\n\nThe last year of Clinton administration saw a new approach towards India. The\nadministration tilted in favour of India during the Kargil conflict. This was followed, in\n2000, by a visit of Clinton to India and Clinton became the fourth USA president after\nEisenhower, Nixon and Carter to visit the country. Clinton’s visit saw a push towards\nbilateral economic diplomacy as deals worth three billion dollars were signed, ranging\nfrom broadband connectivity to energy dimensions. The emerging economic opportunities\nfor USA in India and a presence of a vibrant Indian diaspora in USA that played a pivotal\nrole in US politics proved instrumental factors in creating a new bridge in the bilateral\nrelationship. The Clinton administration was replaced by the Bush administration. The\nmomentum of establishing a new relationship with India gained strength with the coming\nof Bush. The 9/11 attacks bolstered some major changes in the subcontinent. Immediately\nafter the 9/11 attacks, India went ahead to put on record that it was willing to enter into\nmilitary alliance with and work with USA on its war on terrorism. Bush, on the other\nhand, while appreciative of the Indian offer, turned to strengthen its military alliance and\npartnership with Pakistan. Pakistan not only emerged as a non-NATO ally but also a new\nUSA-Pakistan axis was born. The US entered the subcontinent by invading Afghanistan\nin 2001. The rule of Taliban in Afghanistan ended. This was a big blow to Pakistan which\nfavoured the Taliban in Afghanistan as it enabled it to maintain strategic depth against\nIndia. The cross-border terrorism from Pakistani side in 2001 increased and saw its first\nmanifestation in the form of an attack on Kashmir assembly, culminating in the attack on\nIndian Parliament. India responded to this by launching a mega-military mobilisation\nexercise on Indo—Pakistan border under the name of operation Parakaram.\n\nThe US faced a severe dilemma on how to respond to the situation as, on one hand, it\nwas building up a grand coalition at the global level against terrorism. It could not afford\nto take the terrorist attacks on India lightly but could not be hard on Pakistan as it needed\ntheir support in the invasion of Afghanistan. The United States had to also ensure that\nIndia did not retaliate aggressively in response to the provocation perpetrated by Pakistan.\nThe strategy of the Bush administration was now to prevent a South Asian war and\n\nthereby increase its outreach to both India and Pakistan. As the American war on\nAfghanistan was ongoing, USA launched another invasion, that of Iraq, in 2003. The\nregime of Saddam Hussein was toppled and elections were organised. However, a\nsectarian conflict unfolded in Iraq and the region has remained unstable since then. The\nsectarian conflict let to the rise of ISIS as a new force in the region since 2014.\n\nThe Iraq war brought about a shift in the Indian policy as well. We noted previously\nthat India welcomed the US invasion of Afghanistan as the intention of the invasion was\nto dismantle the Al-Qaeda and the Taliban. But the US invasion of Iraq did not go well\nwith India. Though the Vajpayee government wanted to go ahead with its intention of\nproviding military assistance to the USA for the Iraq war, public opinion in India was\nagainst any support to USA since people were largely unconvinced by the logic that\nSaddam had weapons of mass destruction (WMD). Due to the fierce resistance by the\nopposition parties, the Vajpayee regime dropped the idea. The US accepted India’s\ndecision and still continued to strengthen ties with India. For the Bush administration, ties\nwith India needed to be strengthened at the highest level.\n\nThe sanctions imposed by the US on India post Pokhran were lifted. A new initiative\ncalled the ‘Next step in Strategic Partnership’ was launched and cooperation on Civilian\nNuclear and Missile defence dimensions began. As the relations with America progressed,\nin the 2004 SAARC summit, India and Pakistan not only resumed dialogue but issued a\njoint statement that laid down a framework to enhance bilateral commercial cooperation.\nAs the peaceful dialogue with Pakistan and strategic dialogue with the US began, India\nheld its next general elections and Vajpayee was replaced by Dr Manmohan Singh as the\nnext Indian PM."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

On 24* September 2004, Manmohan met Musharraf on the side\nlines of the UNGA Summit in New York. Singh outlined his vision of deepening the\nrelationship with Pakistan to such an extent that the borders on the ground dividing the\ntwo nations would become irrelevant. Confidence Building Measures (CBM) were taken\nto normalise the situation in Kashmir as well. The launch of a composite dialogue between\nthe two sides saw intensive discussions on bilateral issues ranging from Wullar Barrage to\nSiachen Glaciers demilitarisation to discussions on Tulbull Project. A bus service from\nSrinagar to Muzaffarabad was undertaken as an important CBM. Public opinion on both\nsides welcomed the diplomatic overtures. The policy of Manmohan was to evolve bilateral\nrelations based upon a strong constituency of peace, and working towards the\nestablishment of a favourable public opinion. But we should not forget that the trust deficit\nwas not bridged and the cordial atmosphere of the relations were constantly affected due\nto Jihadi attacks in India. Despite attacks in Delhi (2005), Varanasi (2006) and Mumbai\n\n(2006) however, dialogues continued, with Indian public opinion gradually tilting towards\nimpatience.\n\nThe relationship with China under Manmohan took a momentous step ahead. In\n2005, the Indian foreign secretary, Shyam Saran, and Vice-Foreign Minister of China, Wu\nDawei, met in Beijing. A new strategic dialogue unfolded between the two sides, on topics\nranging from UN reforms to combating terrorism. In April 2005, Chinese Premier Wen\nJiabao visited India and both sides entered a new phase of strategic and cooperative\npartnership. Emphasis was laid upon improving economic and trade relations and\ncooperation in the defence dimension. Efforts were made to resolve the border dispute by\nthe adoption of a new set of guidelines. Intense negotiations followed on bilateral issues,\nespecially on the border disputes, but no solution was reached except that the differences\nwere significantly narrowed. In 2006, both sides agreed to intensify military cooperation\nand defence became a new CBM between both sides. In 2006 itself, the two sides decided\nto boost bilateral trade and reopened the Nathu La Pass. The two sides also agreed to\ncooperate than compete with each other in each other’s search for energy supplies. The\nvisit of Chinese President Hu Jintao to India in 2006 led to a continued search for peace by\nthe two sides.\n\nThe India—Russia ties that had been stabilised by Boris Yeltsin were renewed afresh\nduring the regime of Vladimir Putin. In 2004, Manmohan and Putin met at the India—\nRussia Summit. The two sides decided to resolve their long pending disputes related to\ndefence. India was concerned about the supply of defence spares and their timely delivery\nand pricing. Russia was concerned about India’s IPR laws. During the 2004 summit\nmeeting, India conveyed its assurance to Russia that it would respect intellectual property\nrights of all equipments supplied to India by Russia and ensure they were neither copied\nnor secretly stolen by any state. The two sides subsequently strengthened cooperation in\ndefence and energy in the years ahead.\n\nThe Next Steps in Strategic Partnership launched during the Vajpayee regime\nbetween India and USA ultimately culminated into the India-USA Civilian Nuclear\nCooperation in 2005. The nuclear deal between India and USA not only opened up a new\nchapter in bilateral relationships but also signified that the USA had come to accept India\nas a major power of the future.\n\nOne of the big challenges that Manmohan Singh faced during his tenure as the PM at\nthe foreign policy level was related to Nepal. In 2005-2006, Nepal initiated a movement\nto rewrite its Constitution. The public opinion in Nepal was majorly against the monarchy.\nAs Nepal took up the path of democracy, the Maoist elements in Nepal joined the\ndemocratic momentum. Though India did favour democracy in Nepal, it was worried\nabout how or whether the Maoists would integrate well within the democratic process.\nUnder intense international pressure, in 2006, the King restored democracy which was\nunder suspension since the beginning of the Jan Andolan. India welcomed the move and\nkept a close watch on the unfolding Constitutional saga in Nepal.\n\nManmohan Singh continued to deepen India’s relationship with the ASEAN states\nwhich had started with a sectoral dialogue partnership between India and ASEAN at the\nend of the Cold War. During Manmohan Singh’s regime as the PM, India and ASEAN\nconcluded a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in goods (2010) and services (2012). Singh also\n\ninvested tremendous diplomatic capital to strengthen ties with Japan. The two sides, under\nthe leadership of Manmohan Singh and Shinzo Abe, concluded an agreement to establish\na single seamless whole envisaging free movement of navy, capital and people. Between\nIndia and Japan Manmohan also strengthened Indian ties with Africa. India launched\nmultiple initiatives, ranging from Focus Africa Programme to Pan-Africa-e-Network\nProjects, to enhance people-to-people ties. The ties with West Asia saw resurgence based\non the theme of oil diplomacy. It was during Manmohan Singh’s regime that the India and\nSaudi Arabia concluded a strategic partnership agreement. Cooperation with UAE,\nKuwait, Qatar and Oman continued. India and Qatar signed an agreement on LNG and\nQatar decided to supply India LNG for energy security. The foreign policy of Manmohan\nSingh saw India emerge as one of the lead players in the reconstruction of Afghanistan.\nHis ten year tenure as a Prime Minister gave Manmohan Singh an opportunity to touch all\ndimensions of international relationships, ranging from the Great Powers, Middle Powers\nto the immediate Neighbours."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

His very first\nforeign policy initiative won the hearts of many globally. Modi invited the heads of South\nAsia (SAARC leaders) during his oath taking ceremony in New Delhi in 2014. This\ngesture reflected of what awaited ahead in the high-powered diplomatic ventures he was\nabout to undertake. The earliest signs of Modi’s diplomacy date back to his tenure as the\nChief Minister (CM) of Gujarat. During his decade-long stint as the CM, he travelled to\nvarious countries to get investment for his state. During his foreign visits, he developed a\nstyle of personal diplomacy where he emphasised building of strong personal relationships\nwith leaders of the states he visited. This style of personal diplomacy is now recognised as\nthe hallmark of Modi’s way of engaging with the world. Modi’s diplomatic skills were\nfurther strengthened when Vajpayee, as the PM, deputed Modi to travel abroad for party\nwork where he always displayed avid interest in learning how foreign states solved\nproblems related to infrastructure, roads and rivers etc. and applying that learning to\nIndian situations. This ability of learning from foreign states to replicate the same in India\nis visible in his style of India First diplomacy.\n\nModi’s background in RSS has also inculcated in him a sense of a wider engagement\nwith people of all walks of life for suggestions. In fact, during his RSS days in 1970’s and\n1980’s, Modi effectively worked upon the RSS pillar, Samvad. Samvad also eventually\nemerged as a key pillar of his foreign policy. He has effectively developed contacts with\nfollowers at all levels. When he travels abroad, he does not restrict his engagement with\nmerely the heads of states but widens his reach to include private sector firms to monks to\nstudents to workers in factories. His idea of foreign policy or diplomacy is that it should\nnot just be perceived as the art of government-to-government interaction but more as a\nleader-to-people interaction. Diplomacy involving leader-to-people interactions is called\nretail diplomacy. In retail diplomacy, the state leader interacts, meets and shakes hands\nwith a wide spectrum of scholars to monks to workers. Retail diplomacy not only\nenhances the perceived approachability of the leader in the eyes of the public but also\nhelps in developing very strong interpersonal relationships. Thus, the two core diplomatic\nvalues identified in the Modi Doctrine are as below:\n\nPersonal diplomacy Hugs fetch more dividends\n> mb=-\nfor India first\nDemography\n\nDemocracy\n\nDemand Diaspora\n\nWhile interacting with world leaders, Modi ensures that he develops a strong\npersonal chemistry with them. Modi’s idea is that a strong personal bond helps India to\nbargain its national interests at the highest level possible. One of the most important\ninfluences of RSS on Modi’s foreign policy has been his interest in spearheading India’s\nculture and values and promotion of the same at a global level. The RSS background has\ninfused this value in Modi who practises the same with much vigour in the foreign policy.\nHis cultural and civilizational diplomacy is clearly reflected in his visits to temples in\nforeign states. The Modi doctrine is defined by his emphasis on 4D’s:\n\nModi has adopted Democracy, Demography and Demand as key drivers to highlight\nIndia’s economic powers abroad. However, Diaspora is the oxygen to his foreign policy.\nModi has, from day one, addressed concerns related to the Indian diaspora. On any foreign\ntour, Modi makes it point to address a gathering of the Indian diaspora. There are two\npurposes of addressing the diaspora. First, he addresses the diaspora to not only reconnect\nwith them as a messenger from their homeland but also to convey to them the problems\nIndia faces in the twenty first century. In most of his addresses to the diaspora, Modi\noutlines domestic issues of India and government initiatives to tackle them. He often\ndiscusses issues like lack of manufacturing base in India, issues related to cleanliness and\nso on. In the address, he apprises the diaspora of initiatives the government has taken,\nranging from Make in India to Swachch Bharat and so forth. The intention of this exercise\nis to convince the diaspora that they can emerge as effective stakeholders in the problems\nfaced by India. He intends to convey to the diaspora that their contribution is imperative\nfor India’s development story and its rise as a global power. Second, his address to the\nIndian diaspora in foreign countries are a message to the governments of those countries\n—‘if you take care of this constituency, they will take care of your governments in\nelections’.\n\nThis diaspora diplomacy is a classic example of how the diaspora can be a catalyst\nfor transformative diplomacy in the era of globalisation. His focus, in the long run, is to\nuse the diaspora for domestic development. His intention is to attract the interests of the\ndiaspora back home and affect a reversal from brain drain to brain gain. Thus, it is not\nwrong to say that Modi knows that the diaspora is a part of the great Indian family which\nwill be a partner to India’s emergence as a global player. This is also in sync with the\n\nBJP’s perception of the importance of the diaspora. An important thing to remember here\nis that in his addresses to the diaspora, he would link the past, present and the future in\nsuch an array that the diaspora gets galvanised, energised and enthusiastic to play a role in\nIndia’s future. His addresses to the diaspora in the USA, Australia and the UK reflect the\nintermixing of past, present and future. The doctrine of the diaspora here aims to attract\nFDI to India and use it for domestic development. Modi’s idea of diaspora diplomacy is to\nensure a collective Indian voice in the countries of their residence where they are\nsimultaneously loyal citizens.\n\nAnother very crucial dimension of the Modi doctrine is his thrust on economic\ndiplomacy. All diplomatic engagements undertaken by Modi till date are driven by the\neconomic thrust of making India a commercial power. The value of economic diplomacy\nwas imbibed by Modi from Gujarat. Gujarat had been an important port of international\ntrade during the peak of trade via the ancient silk route. Trade was natural to Gujarat and\nthis had emerged as a crucial element of the Modi doctrine. Modi understood well that\ndomestic growth rates cannot be boosted by domestic initiatives alone and that geo-\nstrategic imperatives arising out of external engagement with rest of the world are a key to\nIndia’s growth story. The economic diplomacy strategy of Modi is based on a model\nwhere domestic growth is to be propelled by FDI in the manufacturing sector. To make\nFDI absorption easy, the ‘Make in India’ initiative and ‘Skill India’ initiatives have been\nlaunched and steps have been taken to improve India’s performance in the ease of doing\nbusiness.\n\nIn 2014, Modi addressed the IFS probationers and instructed them to focus on\nenhancing India’s export potential in textile and traditional medicine. The important\nelement here is that Modi understands the needs of the investors well and has worked\nupon government-to-business contacts. For example, in order to illustrate this idea, Modi,\nduring an address at a business lunch in Tokyo in 2014, said that while he had been the\nCM of Gujarat, he had invited Japanese investments. As Japanese businesses came, he\nbegan to study Japanese tastes and found that the Japanese like to play golf. This led Modi\nto establish world class golf courses in Gujarat, thereby showing that what a proactive\ngovernment can do for investors. For Modi, economic diplomacy is about marketing,\nstreamlining, downsizing and modernisation brought about in a seamless manner within a\nglobal economy.\n\nReformin i\nDownsizing. apa\nStreamlining ————» Scale\nModernizing <— ‘ “Marketing\nSimplifying * Rationalizing\n\nUnder the new neighbourhood first policy, Modi’s key focus vis-a-vis India’s\nrelations with its neighbours is economic trade. Modi believes that aggressive economic\ntrade with neighbours will benefit all and the benefits will percolate deep down in the\nsociety. This will bring about a radical shift in the way its neighbours perceive India. The\nerstwhile image of India, projected to its neighbours as a ‘Big Brother,’ will transform into\none of a collaborative ally and shall prove positive spill over for the entire region. At the\nneighbourhood level, connectivity has emerged as an inbuilt dimension of economic\ndiplomacy. Apart from that, usage of India’s soft power capabilities has taken primacy in\n\nCore of Modi’s\nnomic diplomacy\n\n\nthe Modi doctrine. For instance, the intense diplomacy to get 21* June declared as the\nInternational Day of Yoga at the UN General Assembly is an example of soft power\ndiplomacy. Thus, one may conclude that the Modi Doctrine is all about putting India into a\nhigher international orbit and for achieving the same, tasks have been clearly cut out for\nthe future.\n\nOur understanding of the foreign policy of Modi helps us to analyse few goals the\nIFP intends to achieve in the future. Modi has clarified that India is not going to be a\nbalancing power but intends to aspire to be a leading power. India is to have a three step\nforeign policy\n\n(a) Observe and react to international events\n(b) If needed, infuse energy to shape international events\n(c) Occasionally, play a role to drive the events\n\nThe government’s Indian Ocean strategy, economic diplomacy, development\ndiplomacy, African Outreach, Pacific Island Outreach and Act East Policy are some of the\nbold and timely initiatives. The 3C formula of Connectivity, Contacts and Cooperation is\nbeing used. There is new energy for cultural diplomacy and Indian Diaspora and soft tools\nlike yoga. We will see in the various chapters of India and bilateral diplomacy in\nsubsequent sections that a new tool of gifting spiritual texts of India to world leaders is a\nnew phenomena. Though there is a thrust on building a personal chemistry with leaders,\nwe need to be careful as personal chemistry does not always give results. The issues with\nChina on NSG, Masood Azhar are some examples. Modi has realised that even if\ndiplomacy may not fetch political votes domestically, it does enhance India’s standing in\nthe world and helps garner resources for developing India. At times, domestic political\nstanding can be improved if a country leverages external partners well. In 1969, deeper\nembrace of USSR won the Congress support of the Left parties in India. This helped the\nCongress party counter the rivals on the Right side of the political spectrum. Though\nIndia’s great power diplomacy only boosts some excitement at the domestic political level,\nit is in reality, the neighbourhood diplomacy where there is greater domestic political\nresonance. For example, Nepal on Bihar, Sri Lanka on Tamil Nadu and Bangladesh on\nWest Bengal explain the same."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Our concern would be to investigate the\nphilosophical changes in the foreign policy of India that compelled it to embrace a\ncompletely new relationship with the external world. The essence of the section is to\ncapture the key drivers of foreign policy transformation at the end of the Cold War. One\nimportant thing to note here is that when Nehru was the PM, he tried to educate the\npolitical leaders and the public of India on foreign policy issues through his speeches. This\nwas not the case after the end of the Cold War. The Indian Prime Ministers, from Rao till\nManmohan Singh, did not favour much debate about the change of direction in the foreign\npolicy. I K Gujral was the only exception and he did vocalise a few ideas and shed some\ninsights on his doctrine.\n\nIn January 1992, Narasimha Rao attended the special session of the UN Security\nCouncil (UNSC) on nuclear issues. At the special session, the UNSC declared that\nproliferation of nuclear weapons is a threat to world peace. Rao understood that the world\nis envisaging collective action to restrain states from acquiring nuclear weapons. The\nimmediate priority of the USA was to make India sign CTBT and ensure India does not\nacquire nuclear weapon. Rao perceived that the special session of the UNSC had the\nbacking of world powers. However, the greater dilemma for Rao was whether he could\nhave allowed the international community to decide something that was at the very core of\nthe national security of India, especially when the previous decade of 1980’s had been\nspent in verbal clashes with Pakistan with regard to the latter’s nuclearization policy?\nIndia’s domestic and economic position was not strong enough at that juncture to give the\ncountry any weight at the global level.\n\nThe US, led by Bush at that time, proposed a multilateral agreement to India where\nIndia, along with Pakistan, China, USA and Russia, undertake discussions on nuclear non-\nproliferation in the subcontinent. For India, such a multilateral format of discussion was\ncompletely unacceptable because it favoured only a global framework in case of any\ndiscussion on nuclear issues. What irritated India further was that, as per the initiative\nenvisaged by Bush, Russia, China and USA could supervise India—Pakistan nuclear issues.\nThis was not acceptable to India as it saw China as a new guarantor of security in the\n\nregion in which India considered itself an equal player. Instead of committing to the\nproposal outright, Rao favoured a deeper discussion with the US at a bilateral level. Rao\nsuccessfully launched a dialogue with the US on one hand, and on other hand, at an\ninvisible level, began to prepare India for a nuclear weapon. The nuclear scientists were\ninstructed to prepare for a nuclear test but they demanded a delivery time frame of\nminimum two years. At the diplomatic level, India kept on bargaining for more time and\nsearched for all rules possible in the diplomatic book to avoid an entry into a multilateral\nnuclear treaty. By 1995, India was ready to enter a different strategic pedestal by\nconducting a nuclear test. On 15\" December, 1995, the New York Times reported that India\nwas making preparations for a nuclear test at Pokhran. India, in order to give a sign of\nrelief to the international community, affirmed that India is not planning Rubicon but also\ndecided not to give up the future option of tests. Rao continued to face two key dilemmas.\nThe first was what could be the economic consequences of the test and second was how\ncould he finally undertake nuclear tests, thereby shedding off all normative dimensions in\nfavour of the security considerations of the realpolitik.\n\nAfter the end of the Cold War, the security situation drastically changed. India’s sole\nsupporter during the Cold War—the USSR—was no longer in the picture. China had been\nconstantly arming Pakistan and equipping it with covert nuclear capabilities. The US,\ninstead of developing relations with India as the largest democracy in the world, favoured\nthe containment of India and its nuclear programme through the Clinton administration’s\novert fixation on non-proliferation. Though India since Nehru was an ardent supporter of a\nCTBT aimed for complete Disarmament, in 1996, when India read the draft of CTBT, it\nrealised that the real intention was not to go for complete Disarmament but ensure that\nstates like India don’t acquire weapons. At this juncture, a school of thought argued that\nIndia should not undertake a nuclear test but instead outline the journey for developing\ncredible deterrence. However, the scientific community ruled that for the deterrence to be\ncredible, India would need to conduct a small number of tests to get data for sub-\ncriticality. The BJP government led by Vajpayee took the risk and went ahead with nuclear\ntesting. The nuclear tests in 1998 gave India the opportunity to redress the contours of\nnuclear diplomacy. India was an ardent supporter of the fact that the world is\ndiscriminating between nuclear haves and have nots. After testing the weapons and being\narmed with a new confidence, India now began to call for incremental nuclear reforms.\nIndia shifted to advocacy for pragmatic arms control from its earlier strategy of\ndisarmament.\n\nEven post-1998, India has not given up the goal of complete disarmament. For India,\nthe immediate priority was to conclude a Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty (FMCT) because\nIndia was of the view that states should focus on reducing the production of nuclear\nmaterial. A cessation on the production of the nuclear material could be the first step\ntowards a treaty for complete disarmament ahead. The Indian policy had thus shifted from\n\nbeing a dissident at global nuclear level to a nation with its focus on developing an arms\ncontrol regime.\n\nAs the Cold War ended, there was considerable uncertainty about the future of India’s\nnon-alignment. As the IFP progressed in the first decade after the end of the Cold War,\nIndia kept on defending the concept but the way its foreign policy was unfolding clearly\nindicated that India’s focus was no longer simply on non-alignment. The idea of non-\nalignment was developed by Nehru. Later, it turned into a movement called NAM. NAM\noffered India a platform to pursue its international relations. The Indian policy of staying\nnon-aligned during the Cold War was based on the logic of maintaining strategic\nmanoeuvrability. India professed the idea that the decolonised states could lead an\nindependent worldview and a developmental strategy without getting entangled with the\nideologies of the Capitalist West and the Socialist East. Non-alignment emerged as a third\nway of articulating the philosophy of the third world countries. As the Cold War ended,\nthe idea of non-alignment lost its relevance and transformed into a philosophical relic. But\nmany years into the post-Cold War world order, India kept on insisting that the spirit of\nNAM was still as relevant. Many Indian foreign policy practitioners asserted that the spirit\nof NAM was alive in the pursuit of multilateralism and opposition to military alliances.\nIndia followed a policy of adopting itself to the changing world scenario after the end of\nCold War but decided not to give up the past altogether.\n\nDuring this time of a changing world order, Narasimha Rao emerged as a chief\narchitect of the change of the IFP. He did not reject NAM altogether but began to reorient\nthe IFP incrementally. As Rao opened up the Indian economy, and at the foreign policy\nlevel, Rao steadily began a more serious rapprochement with the West. India’s pro-West\ntilt later on continued under the regime of Vajpayee. The Vajpayee government, without\ndiscrediting NAM, somewhat marginalised it and continued with a pro-USA approaching\nits foreign policy. The relevance of NAM during cold war lay in giving international voice\nto a country like India which had not much real power. After the 1998 nuclear test, India\nhad now acquired a new tool of military power to bargain with the world and thereby the\nutility of NAM automatically diminished. During the Cold War, non-alignment was used\nas an economic tool to seek economic aid from both camps. At the end of the Cold War,\nthe old economic system led to severe economic crisis and had to be reformed. This also\nreduced the relevance of non-alignment.\n\nHowever, though the practitioners of IFP realised that the utility of non-alignment\nwas decreasing, they failed in identifying an alternative to the policy. This, they felt, could\ndeprive India of a force in global affairs. After the 1998 nuclear tests, India realised that\nthe only way it could leave a mark on the international system was through a\ndemonstration of its capacity to maintain peace. It realised that the idea of playing third\nworldism and anti-westernism cards would not help. India began to search for an\nalternative to non-alignment in the form of capacity demonstration. India now had the\noption of either sticking to NAM or establish a new partnership with the US and other\npowers. India began to conclude pivotal strategic partnerships with great powers to\nenhance its national strength.\n\nIn fact, four months after the 1998 tests, Vajpayee announced that India and USA are\nnatural allies. This announcement was a radical departure from India’s erstwhile foreign\n\npolicy which was bent upon non-alignment. This insistence on a natural alliance by\nVajpayee saw its magnification during the regime of Bush who took the Indo-USA\nrelations to an unthinkable level and brokered a nuclear deal with India, enabling it to\nemerge as a true world power. As India enhanced its ties with USA, it insisted that the IFP\nstood for multi-polarity and not an alliance with the west. India clarified that its policy\nwas to engage with all world powers who served India’s national interests. India began\nadvocating a multi-polar world but this advocacy clashed with its natural alliance with the\nUS. Indian diplomacy, however, embraced this duality. India called for a deep relation\nwith the US while keeping open the option to expand cooperation with other powers under\nthe idea of multipolarity. The emphasis on non-alignment was replaced with advocacy of\nmultipolarity and the gradual democratisation of foreign policy. The emphasis upon\nmultipolarity asserted India’s rise as a major power in global politics. The new self-image\nof India was enhanced further by rapid thrusts in domestic economy since the end of Cold\nWar, including the opening up of the Indian markets for the west.\n\nThe recent developments in Indo—USA relations, like the conclusion of the Logistics\nExchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA), which is a tweaked version of the\nLogistics Support Agreement (LSA), which the US has with several countries it has close\nmilitary ties, suggest that India will enhance its strategic space under the framework\nestablished by the US and that it may not be wrong to say that the possibility of a future\nalliance with west has started taking a root in Indian thinking. Indian advocacy of a\nmultipolar world reflects that India intends to retail space for strategic autonomy. India,\nduring Cold War, intended to be the leader of the third world. Since the end of the Cold\nWar, India has switched over to becoming a developed power in the twenty first century.\nIndia, while negotiating with the west, asserts that it is the sole state outside Europe and\nNorth America that stands for the core values of European enlightenment. For that matter,\nscholar and professor Sunil Khilnani asserted that the Indian experiment is the third great\nmoment of democracy in the world after American being the first and French being the\nsecond.\n\nFor the practitioners of Indian foreign policy, Lord Curzon is a great source of\nstrategic inspiration as his writings emphasised upon a powerful role India could play in\nthe Indian Ocean and the rest of Asia. The Curzonians in the Indian foreign policy are of\nthe view that India has the potential to influence not only the Indian Ocean but the entire\narc from Iran to Thailand. During the time of Nehru, the partition of India and Pakistan\nbecame an obstacle to the influence India could leverage in the Indian Ocean. The\ncomplicated post independence relations with Pakistan and China imposed limitations on\nthe exercise of hegemonic influence in the Indian Ocean. Throughout the cold war, India’s\nproximity to the USSR and its anti-USA approach also acted as deterrents to its display of\npower in the Indian ocean. Even though Curzon’s idea of India being a dominant player in\nthe Indian ocean were formulated on the basis of British interests, there is no reason why\nIndia today, decades after the end of the Cold War realise the vision. Since the end of Cold\nWar, India has switched its Indian Ocean policy. If during the Cold War, India’s policy was\nto keep foreign powers away from the Indian Ocean, now India intends to cooperate with\nthe US and achieve influence over the Indian ocean as its natural strategic space.\n\nEconomic modernisation » Energy security\n\nof communications\nReligious modernisation * ~* Maintain political stability\n\nIt will not be wrong to assert that since the end of Cold War, India has initiated a\nforward policy and its diplomatic activism is visible in India’s neighbourhood from its\nactions in Afghanistan to strategic partnership with Africa to the Act East Policy in East\nAsia. During the Cold War, because of the Indian policy of non-alignment and its closed\neconomic orientation, India remained isolated. At the global level, it did talk about macro-\nsecurity matters but could not provide any security to small states (like Singapore) in the\nregion. Thus, during the Cold War, Indian policy was primarily a policy of masterly\ninactivity. The end of the Cold War ushered in a wave of freshness in the foreign policy\nthought of India. As it began to reorient its economy, it initiated commercial contacts with\nvarious states. The focus for energy security shifted to west Asia and for investments and\ntrade to east Asia. An important element of the IFP became the focus upon building\ninstitutional link with regions. As India initiated a Look East Policy, it found easy\nsynchronisation with ASEAN’s Look West Policy and thus began the Indo-ASEAN\ninstitutional co-operation. A new component of Indian strategy was to go for\nimprovements in physical connectivity. The recently concluded BBIN (Bangladesh,\nBhutan, India and Nepal) agreement and India-Myanmar-Thailand highway are steps in\nthe direction of a new forward policy. To shed off isolation, India stepped up defence\ncooperation with states in the region. The recent defence and naval contacts from the Gulf\nto East Asia are testimony to India’s growing defence diplomacy. India is now focussing\nupon institutionalised defence contacts and strategic dialogue as themes of its forward\npolicy of defence diplomacy. India wants to be a key element in the maintenance of the\nbalance of power in the Indian Ocean to balance an aggressive and rising China."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

It engaged with the US and began to boost the\neconomic arms of its diplomacy. Two and a half decades of economic growth finally\nprovided India the resources to modernise its defence forces. The biggest impact at the\ndefence level is seen in the Indian Navy. Though Indian foreign policy has seen\nfundamental shifts since the end of Cold War, it has failed to bring about deep-rooted\nchanges with Pakistan and China also at times India has failed to demonstrate leadership\nin matters of global governance, like climate change and foreign trade. The polemical\narguments advanced by India at both places are hardly of any merit. Even recently, some\nforeign policy practitioners aim at reviving the idea of non-alignment which, as a\nparadigm, has lost its sheen in the post-Cold War times. Thus, unwillingness to shed off\nthe past is preventing India from taking stands on global issues of critical importance. The\nunresolved question in the Indian foreign policy is what role India aspires to play at the\nglobal level. India does advocate for multi-polarity, and as we saw in the previous section,\nit also favours democratisation of institutions so that it can be a part of the decision\nmaking process of the bodies like the UN Security Council and the World Bank.\n\nIn order to conclude this section, a few assertions can be made. Our study of IFP till\n\nnow shows us that Indian Foreign Policy during the Cold War had limited\nmanoeuverability. The limitations were imposed by India’s normative policy of non-\nalignment and an insular economic policy. Nehru gave India the needed push at the\nforeign policy level. He ensured that India’s idea of non-alignment gives it a standing in\nthe international arena, which, at the time, was highly divided due to ideological warfare.\nThe tenure of Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi saw attempts to take India away from the\nideological accents introduced by Nehru. In this regard, the efforts of Rajiv Gandhi to\nremove the choke points in India’s external interests are worth noting. Rajiv not only\ninjected blood in Indo—-USA relations but went a step forward with China. The end of the\nCold War led to a root-and-branch overhaul of India’s economic and foreign policy\nimperatives. The Nehruvian outlook of perceiving capitalism as an extension of\nimperialism leading to a deep hospitality to the West was replaced by new undercurrents\nin the foreign policy. The diplomatic straitjacket was now loosened up and India began a\nrapprochement with the West. The Cold War rhetoric of non-alignment and of being a\nprotestor in the global system was replaced with greater aspiration for power in a\nmultipolar world where India was now willing to take up responsibilities. The era saw\ndiplomatic innovations by Indian diplomats who became reapers of investment from\nacross the globe. The testing of nuclear weapon gave India a new power stature to\ninfluence and win over new friends in the international system.\n\ney + Pragmatic and proactive\n\nForward looking\n2 y. wv Relationship builder\nx +r Interest driven\nLeft-wing + “Commercial\nCrusade oriented ~ “Influence international\n\nPush by event” - events\nOutward looking and\nconfidence\n\nWhether India’s being a part of these institutions at the global level will reshape the\nworld remains ambiguous. India is not very comfortable with the ‘doctrine of\nresponsibility to protect’ and is also, at the same time, reluctant in shaping the global\nprogramme to fight climate change. Though India is critical of existing arrangements, it\nfails to provide an alternative. What prevents India to adopt a more intellectual approach\nto foreign policy? The reason is perhaps India is too imaginatively limited and for the\npresent, just willing to outline its own role in reshaping the global order as an emergent\npole in the same multipolar world.

The British established a double line of\ndefence, based on the policy of reverse slopes. Under this policy, as per the plan envisaged\nby the British, China and Russia were to have no presence in the subcontinent and the\nBritish tried to ensure this through the subordination of individual states. The British\nestablished a buffer state fence on reverse Himalayan slopes. The Partition of India and\nPakistan in 1947 saw a reversal of the reverse slope policy and opened up the possibility\nof foreign intervention in the region which India did not favour. After the Partition in\n1947, despite a loss of territory in borders of West and East, India emerged as a pre-\neminent regional power since a huge amount of land still came to India. Due to a huge\nterritory and its geographical importance in the subcontinent, the subsequent security\nconception of India was not national but geopolitical and regional in nature. India realised\nthat, due to its geopolitical location, it would witness a threat first from powers of the\nregion than powers outside the region. India felt that it may witness a threat from the\nneighbours who may be weak or unstable. India was of the view that if a neighbour is\nweak or unstable, it would be given an option to decide whether it wants an external, more\npowerful state, to intervene. This would bring external powers to a zone, India felt fell in\nits own sphere of influence.\n\nIndia felt that an unstable Pakistan meant a high possibility of a foreign intervention\nin Pakistan. Due to this reason, India has always favoured a stable Pakistan, but also not a\nPakistan that may be strong enough to potentially emerge as a threat to India. China,\nthrough its investments in the Gwadar port and the China— Pakistan Economic Corridor,\nhas favoured developing a strong economy in Pakistan to keep India under check. Thus,\n\nfor India, security of South Asia is based on stability of South Asia. India, in the\nneighbourhood, faces a Gringo problem. Like USA, India has realised that assuming\ndominance is a complex process. Other Asian states harbour a similar feeling for China.\nIndia has its own regional security policy. It feels that the South Asian subcontinent is\nIndia’s sphere of influence where India can be the only power that can intervene. India’s\nideal policy is not to allow outside powers to intervene in South Asia as it feels that South\nAsia is its exclusive sphere of influence. Nehru propounded this view during his earliest\ndays as Prime Minister. Some scholars have referred to such a view as the Indian Monroe\ndoctrine. In the 19\" century, USA exercised a similar influence in the Western hemisphere\nunder the Monroe Doctrine. Nehru, after Independence, resonated with similar views\nwhen he advocated that foreign colonial powers should stay out of South Asia. During the\nCold War, India followed the foreign policy of trying to limit the influence of foreign\npowers in Asia, but such an attempt proved difficult for India. During British rule, smaller\nstates were provided a sense of security by the British. India lacked both the resources and\nthe experience in governance to extend the same to its neighbouring states.\n\nNeighbourhood is India's\n‘Through not successtul but India sphere infiuence\nwanted to limit external influence _ ., Based on British policy\nin neighbourhood\nEp = British provided security to\nsmaller states.\nNehru realised that the threat is ~ { * India after independence perceived\n{rom the region first Due to such a location, India’s Relocation penpolitealy stategic\nsecurity strategy was geopolitical\n‘and regional\n\nHowever, India, during Nehru’s times, followed a global strategy of non-alignment to\nkeep India away from Cold War politics. The neighbourhood policy did not receive the\nsame attention as India tried to position itself as a neutral force in the era of bipolarity.\n\nThe coming of Indira Gandhi brought about a change in India’s neighbourhood\npolicy. She added a new component of bilateralism in the neighbourhood policy. Indira\nGandhi insisted that India should bilaterally resolve issues of the region without any\nintervention from external powers. Indira ensured that external powers have no role when\nmatters are resolved bilaterally by India. The Indian neighbourhood policy, for that matter,\nwas always fraught with contradictions. Regionally, in South Asia, India clung to the\nprecepts of the balance of power and sphere of influence, while rejecting the same\ninternationally. Regionally India provided security to small nations while internationally\nopposing the intervention of the great powers in the affairs of the weak states. India, under\nIndira, preached bilateralism at a time when it globally advocated for multilateralism.\nAnother feature of Indira’s neighbourhood policy was that she resorted to military\ninterventions with a neighbour if it threatened India’s security. India’s intervention in 1971\nduring the East Pakistan crisis is a testimony to the fact. Many of the neighbours began to\nperceive India’s military strategy as an interventionist approach.\n\nIndia emerges as a\n; Miltary intervention if regional [noone E sesotution of nel\n— qmmcienpl Indo centric disputes bilaterally\n\n» Regionally emerged as a\nsecurity manager\n\n™ At the global level became a\nresolution of bilateral disputes: protestor of international system\n\nWhen Rajiv Gandhi assumed control, the Indian intervention in Maldives and Sri\nLanka in 1980s (explained in the subsequent chapters) transformed India into a perceptual\nregional hegemon. Many scholars raised issues with India establishing itself as a regional\nhegemon. They asserted that India, during Indira and Rajiv’s times (under Indira Doctrine\nand Rajiv Doctrine), did not provide economic and security benefits to the neighbours (as\nthe definition of a regional hegemon warranted). In fact, as mentioned earlier, the South\nAsian states perceived India’s doctrine as interventionist in nature.\n\nNe Nn to take\nEconomic relationship ~ the bilateral disputes at the\nseem simennaes international level\nNeighbours began to * ™S Neighbours began to invite\ntilt towards China external powers in the region\n\nWhen the Cold War ended, India began to realise that the interventionist approach\nhad become unsustainable. India was visibly upset by rising anti-Indian sentiment. In\n1996, India began to negotiate a water sharing treaty with Nepal (explained in detail in the\nchapter of India—Nepal relations ahead). As the negotiation proceeded, a perception began\nto evolve in Nepal that India was grabbing the only national asset (water) that Nepal could\nlay claim to. As the crises deepened in 1990s, a new approach to the neighbourhood policy\nwas needed.\n\nWhen P V Narasimha Rao became the PM, he evolved a fresh approach to the\nneighbourhood policy. He followed a hands-off approach. His idea was that India should\nnot interfere in the functioning of the neighbouring states. If the hands-off policy did not\ncreate new tensions, it also did not contribute to reducing old problems. Later the,\napproach of Rao was carried forward by Gujral. I K Gujral, as Prime Minister, introduced\na proper doctrine for the neighbourhood for the first time.\n\nIndia not to interfere in\nthe neighbour's domestic ~\nand political affairs\n\nNarasimha Rao's\n\n» Hands-off approach\n\nneighbourhood policy\n\nI K Gujral’s foreign policy doctrine was based upon the logic of non-reciprocity and\ngenerosity. Under Gujral, India re-evaluated its self-interests and decided to be more\ngenerous towards its neighbours. Under the Gujral Doctrine, India’s avowed aim was to\nbuild goodwill amongst its neighbours instead of leaving space for the development of\nanti-India sentiments. India, though its non-reciprocity and generosity, wanted to show to\nthe neighbours that there lay a huge economic and political benefit in cooperating with\nIndia.\n\nIndia wanted to ease _ .- Change in India's economic\n‘out trade flows policy and free market\nIf regional blocks remained, it * Openness of economy for each\n\ncould affect India’s global reach, other perceived crucial to India\n80, India tavour positive cooperation\n\nSome in the Indian foreign policy establishment found that the Gujral Doctrine was\nidealistic, but the neighbours and the other states appreciated non-reciprocity and\ngenerosity. The first missing link in the Gujral Doctrine was that Gujral did not have\nample amount of time as the PM to force the foreign bureaucracy of India to accept the\n\nvalue of cooperation. Moreover, despite advocating openness and generosity, the Gujral\nDoctrine was reluctant on opening up foreign trade in the region.\n\n__ Rise of Pakistan-sponsored\nBhutani soil was being used for _ leredeom again Soe\nanti-Ind.a activity by insurgents e lnapiits\nsupport Pakistan\n\n‘Solution to one problem not lo be\nned ie coneepsiets by cas\n\nUdinteal eoal Soup oenent * piieareciprechy san emai neignnen\nmeans Se __ No territory of any South Asian stato\nto be used against any other stato\nGain mutual trust | * Non-interference in each other's\nMutual respect for territorial ternal terrtiory\nintergrity and sovereignty\n\nWhen the Bharatiya Janta Party came to power in 1998, it became busy in managing\nthe fallout of the Pokhran-II test. Most of the energies of the BJP were diverted into\nmanaging Pakistani state sponsored terrorism. The BJP government began to realise that\nPakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) had begun to deepen its presence in Nepal and\nBangladesh. The subsequent hijacking of the Indian Airlines IC-814 aircraft was\ntestimony to this.\n\nAs the BJP government began to shift its focus to its neighbours, it decided to use\nSAARC as platform for regional cooperation. However, the government was not able to\nachieve much success in using SAARC as a platform due to problems caused by Pakistan.\nThe Vajpayee government wanted a kind of South Asian Union by upgrading the SAARC\nwhere there was a free trade amongst states and a very small negative list. India had a\ngrand vision of using the South Asian Union under SAARC not only for economic\ncooperation but as a political union in the lines of European Union. However, one reason\nwhy the idea failed was that India, under the BJP, insisted on a security guarantee for\neconomic cooperation. Till 1947, the South Asian subcontinent had good trade relations,\nbut, when new borders were created, trade began to decline. Pakistan never opened up on\ntrade owing to hostilities with India. Bangladesh, after a few years of its creation, also\nceased enthusiastically cooperating on the economic front with India. Border trade became\nnegligible. Globalisation had impacted trade, and it had compelled some neighbours to\nopen up to India. However, since trade remained in favour of India due to trade surplus,\nthe states were reluctant to further open up.\n\n_» Protect national interests\npf of India\n\nTerritorial integrity to\n\nbe safeguarded\n\nThe Manmohan Singh government too tried to use SAARC as a platform to further\nintegration amongst the neighbouring states.

Firstly, in South Asia, since the end of the Cold\n\nWar, there had been a rise of international involvement in regional affairs. After USA\ninvaded Afghanistan, it has continued to remain a dominant power in Afghanistan. This\nhas only gone on to cement the USA-Pakistan relation that has been in existence since the\nCold War. The USA’s dependence on Pakistan increased after USA invaded Afghanistan.\n\nSri Lanka, on the other hand, witnessed the rising LTTE problem. In the recent times,\nNorway had emerged as a core player in solving the LTTE crisis in Sri Lanka. Nepal too\nhas always been dependent upon foreign powers for economic assistance. There has been\na rising Chinese presence in the region of South Asia. The Chinese Belt and Road\ninitiative and its rising presence in the Indian Ocean have given jitters to India. India has\nrealised the need to be a rising power in the post-Cold War times, which, many scholars\nread as India’s tendency to behave like a proto-imperialist power. India, according to such\nscholars, has not been able to enhance its influence in South Asia and has instead been\nperceived as a second-tier imperialist power by the South Asian states.\n\nThough, this scholarly view resorts to an extreme picture, the ground reality is that\nIndia’s abilities to push a strong regional agenda in its quest to emerge as a rising power\nhas remained weak. Since the beginning of the Cold War till the present, the societies of\nSouth Asia, instead of working with each other to enhance cooperation at the regional\nlevel, have preferred to look towards the North for technology and resources. Due to this,\neconomic interaction and integration of the South Asian region has remained largely\nneglected. Some scholars assert that India has tried to emerge as the regional hegemon, but\nthis may not be a genuine assessment of India’s neighbourhood policies because a regional\nhegemon provides economic and security benefits to other states while India has not done\nany such thing in South Asia. It is in this context, to rectify its earlier shortcomings in the\nneighbourhood policy, that India has announced its ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy in 2014.\n\nigh aac Rosdried Estabish Shit away _Poiitcal tos and\ntociviian a social from secunty ensure no security\nwomnasle tiaatem stescure  dlerna threat to india ot oun asia\nof trust\n\nModi’s vision of South Asia and the initiation of the neighbourhood first policy\nbegan on a political high when Modi invited all SAARC nation heads for his swearing-in\nceremony in 2014. The idea of the neighbourhood first policy is to link India’s\ndevelopment to the development of South Asia. In order to realise this vision, a special\nfocus is given to SAARC and the idea is to transform the entire South Asian region into an\nintegrated economic union with enhanced connectivity. The neighbourhood first policy\nhas picked up grains from the Gujral doctrine without publicly accepting the same. India,\nunder the neighbourhood first policy, has conveyed that it shall attach enormous political\nand diplomatic capital to fostering cooperation with the neighbours. A special thrust is laid\nupon improving connectivity within South Asia so that all the states in the region can\nbenefit from mutual cooperation leading to shared prosperity.\n\nIndia leads regional integration, _ Thrust upon trade and investment\n\nConstruct highways\nDevelopmental politics ~. nee J cael valk keane\nhautiad trust ~ ~~» Establishment of power grids\n\nJ ™ Foster connectivity\nFoous on shered prosperity *“ Neighbours to get resources.\n\nfor commercial diplomacy\n\nOn the neighbourhood level, India has put a dedicated SAARC satellite for all its\nneighbours. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) launched the satellite in May\n2017 for India’s neighbours so that they take advantage of telemedicine and e-learning.\nUnder the neighbourhood first policy, Modi first visited Bhutan. The subsequent chapter\non India and Bhutan will throw light upon his core foreign policy achievements. His visit\nto Nepal also strengthened the idea of India prioritising neighbouring states. In a landmark\nvisit to Bangladesh, Modi concluded the long pending Land Boundary Agreement. The\nvisit to Sri Lanka happened after a long gap. Modi also became the first head of the state\nto visit the Northern Sri Lankan region where Tamils reside.\n\nThe basic idea of the neighbourhood first policy is that India would shape events in\nits neighbourhood rather than merely reacting to them. Such an attempt to shape events is\nin sync with India’s quest to play an important role in global affairs. It also signified that\nIndia is now willing to shoulder responsibilities in its neighbourhood. Through the\nneighbourhood first policy, the idea is that India wants to adopt a well-defined model for\npromoting economic cooperation in areas of mutual interests. At the heart of India’s\nneighbourhood first policy is the economic diplomacy strategically followed by India.\nIndia wants to use the neighborhood first policy not only to limit rising Chinese presence\nin South Asia but also expand India’s influence in South Asia through commercial\ndiplomacy. The focus of the policy is on fostering regional trade through connectivity. The\nidea of the policy is also to use its pro-USA tilt in foreign policy to achieve a larger role in\nSouth Asia by emerging as a Net Security Provider.\n\n_~ Maximise security\n\nExpand sphere of «\ninfluence of India\n\n“ Secure economic growth\n\nThe core idea of Neighbourhood First Policy is ‘Vistaarvaad Nahi, Vikasvaad’. (The\nfocus is not expansion but development for all.) India wants to establish a developmental\ncompact with South Asia by line of credits, grants, skill development, and technology\ntransfers to all in the neighbours. India wants the development compact as a catalyst for\ngrowth in South Asia.\n\nUnder the Neighbourhood First Policy, India has infused a new level of energy at two\nlevels in its bilateral ties with neighbours. One of the first components of the new policy is\nto work upon building up of defence relationships. In 2017, when the Prime Minister of\nBangladesh, Shiekh Hasina visited India, the two sides concluded a defence cooperation\npact, In the post Cold War period, India has realised that the growing economic influence\nof China in India’s neighbourhood is likely to have strategic consequences, Scholars argue\nthat India has woken up late to the strategic power play in the subcontinent, but, India has\nnow sought to expand its defence and strategic influence under the Neighbourhood First\nPolicy. India now intends to build up its defence production base under Make in India\n\nprogramme to catch up with China. Secondly, under the Neighbourhood First Policy, India\nhas committed many projects in the neighbouring states but, there are several constraints\nin India’s strategic diplomacy. Firstly, inadequate resources create a constraint. Secondly,\nmost of the diplomatic scholars assert that even if India is able to commit projects, it fails\nto invest proportional diplomatic capital to pursue the projects. Due to this, the projects\nget delayed and lags are imminent. Thirdly, the strategic diffidence in the strategic culture\nof India is aggravated due to its insistence on going solo for such engagements. To address\nsuch issues, India needs to evolve a grand strategy for the neighbourhood. Secondly, India\nneeds to evolve a multilateral approach based upon global consensus on core challenges.\nFor example, when India asserts that a multilateral approach is needed in development, it\ncan apply the same thoughts to live diplomatic instances. For the last 13 years, India has\nbeen trying to develop the Chabahar port in Iran. The project has been delayed and is yet\nto be completed. When we apply the multilateral formula, we argue that instead of India\ndeveloping the Chabahar port alone, it can take help of Japan in financing and technology\nand co-develop the port. In fact, developing a loose multilateral coalition driven by the\nstrategic objectives and interests of India can help in mitigating the self imposed unilateral\nbiases we have in engaging with our neighbourhood. The essence of India’s new policy is\nto build up a new geo-economic constituency in the neighbourhood.\n\nNeighbourhood\nfirst policy\n\nRightto first TO Capacity of\nrefusal first deliver\n\n! \"\n\nTo trade with §=————__> Supply\nthird nations due to without delay\nsecurity concerns\n\nAid to the Neighbours\n\nSince 1950s, India has given technical assistance to neighbours like Nepal, Sri Lanka\nand Bhutan. India has been giving Human Resource related training in India’s\n\nneighbourhood under non-planned grants in the budget. India uses ITEC scholarships\nand line of credits as a tool of development diplomacy. The Ministry of External\nAffairs grants lines of credits to Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal while the Department\nof Economic Affairs in the Ministry of Finance allows lines of credits to other states.\nIn 2003, India launched the India Development initiative. Now, lines of credit are not\ngranted by the Department of Economic Affairs but interest subsidies are provided to\nthe Export-Import Bank of India (EXIM) bank and they, in turn, grant lines of credit.\nIndia also provides aid to foster relations as a goodwill gesture. Such aid is in sync\nwith the ancient Indian value of daan or ‘charity’.\n\nSome scholars argue that this aid is a step by India towards establishing regional\nhegemony while others tend to argue that aid by India to other states is to promote\npolitical and economic goodwill for mutual interests and shared prosperity. India and\nneighbours have a weak link at the political level. The exchanges are not frequent at\nthe political level, and therefore, mutual trust has not been built up adequately over\nthe years. Even when political exchanges happen, India has shown reluctance in\ncompromising its expectations. Political will to resolve historical disputes with\nPakistan and China has been relatively weak. Lack of economic, cultural, commercial\nplanning and delivery deficits are high. South Asian nations feel that, for India, its\nneighbourhood policy is more about security than anything else. For India, even if\nintegrity is at the core of its policy, it cannot have a Dhritarashtra-like blindness and\nhave its eyes shut to security concerns altogether.\n\nAbsence of a credible\n_- fadmap for political and\n\nDelivery deficits _\n\nProblem:\n\nin neighbourhood\n\nfirst policy\n\nNo plan to boost .\ncommerce, culture ~ “ Disconnect at the level of\nand connectivity cultural diplomacy and\ncivilizational agenda"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Nepal alleges that India has interfered in the internal affairs of the state and\nsuch intervention has not been appreciated by the Nepalis at all. India has publicly\nexpressed unhappiness with the Nepali Constitution. The chapter of India—Nepal\nrelationship will further elaborate upon India’s approach to the Madheshi issue.\nNepal has alleged that India resorted to a blockade for which Nepal was compelled to\ncomplain to the United Nations. Nepal even alleged that India used R&AW to topple\nthe Oli government. Things have normalised at present after the recent visit of\nBidhya Devi Bhandari to India in 2017. In Sri Lanka too, there were allegations that\nthe then-R&AW station chief for Sri Lanka, K Elango, was an active supporter of the\nSrisena followers who intended to topple the Rajapakse government. In Maldives,\nallegations are that India has been overenthusiastic and displayed inappropriate\nbehaviour when Nasheed was arrested. India even issued a public statement saying\nthat it was concerned about the arrest of Nasheed to which Maldives reacted by\nstating that it did not appreciate any interference by others in its internal affairs. Such\n\ninstances clearly prove that India should stop behaving like the erstwhile British Raj\nand stop feeling that its diplomats are viceroys. India has to remember that if a\nneighbour follows up with China for investment, it has a right to do so and India\nshould resort to patient diplomacy rather than displaying arrogance or resorting to a\nregime change. India should try to focus on other forms of diplomacy and create\ninfrastructure to stabilise things than resort to coercive diplomacy. A parliamentary\nstanding committee on external affairs has recently noted that India’s aid to\nneighbours has decreased and this is not a positive sign. Our Neighbourhood First\nPolicy can only be effective when bolstered with the understanding of the political,\nhistorical and social dynamics of each neighbour. The present day foreign\nbureaucratic manpower is inadequate to build such capacities.\n\nModi has attempted to emphasise upon economic integration, and if the goal\nmaterialises, then it could alter the face of the South Asian subcontinent and its future\npractice of international relations amongst each other. India has realised that a push\ntowards economic integration could establish a conducive climate for resolution of\npolitical disputes. Pakistan remains the slowest camel in the caravan. It insists that only\nthe successful resolution of political disputes can accelerate economic progress. India is\nnow finding a way to bypass Pakistan. India has developed relations with Afghanistan and\nIran. Also, India has concluded Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal—Motor Vehicle\nAgreement (the BBIN-MVA has been explained in subsequent chapters). The BBIN—\nMVA could become a South Asian growth quadrangle in the times ahead. India feels that\nBangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal are untapped storehouses of energy. If Nepal and Bhutan\nhave hydroelectric power potential, then West Bengal and Bihar have coal while\nBangladesh, Assam and Tripura have hydrocarbons. The entire zone is full of\nendowments. India’s Act East Policy and BBIN-MVA are a step to develop the North\nEastern Region as a growth engine under India’s Neighbourhood First Policy. Till now,\nIndia had remained reluctant as it felt that economic integration with neighbours would\ndeeply affect India’s aid policies and India may lose its economic aid leverage. However,\nat present, India feels that economic integration could add fuel to political ties in the\nneighbourhood that would yield positive results on the economic front.

Its traditional name is\nDrukyul, that is, the country of Drukpas or the ‘land of thunder dragons’. India’s relations\nwith Bhutan go back to 747 AD when a Buddhist monk Padmasambhava went from India\nto Bhutan and led the Nyingmapa sect of Buddhism. Thus, India contributed to the\ncultural growth of Buddhism in Bhutan. In the modern times, there were Anglo—Bhutan\nwars and Bhutan became a part of British Empire. In 1910, as per the Treaty of Punakha,\nbetween China—Tibet and Bhutan, Bhutan was not officially annexed but the legal status\nof Bhutan itself remained undefined. When India became independent in 1947, Nehru\nwent on a horseback to Bhutan to build relations and advised King J D Wangchuk to build\nrelations with India. Bhutan also preferred India over China as, in 1949, when China took\nover Tibet, it did create tensions and fears of annexation in Bhutan. In 1949, India and\nBhutan concluded a Treaty of Friendship. The treaty discusses peace, trade, commerce and\nequal justice between India and Bhutan. In the treaty, one important article was Article-2.\nAs per Article-2, India accepted the sovereign and independent status of Bhutan but\nadvised that Bhutan, in matters of external affairs, seek assistance from India. India did\nnot interfere in internal affairs of Bhutan and in fact, in 1971, took up the matter of UN\nmembership for Bhutan.

In Phase-1, from\n1960 to 1980, initially, India provided support for physical infrastructure creation. The\nsubsequent phase, from 1980 to 2000, was a period when Bhutan explored the dimension\nof a transition to democracy. During this period, India provided assistance for\ndevelopment of democratic values and provided capacity support for decentralisation. In\nthis period, institutional sharing of the best democratic and decentralisation related\npractices were encouraged for exchange. The third phase, which is ongoing from 2000 till\npresent, is where Indian developmental assistance has been diversified. Today, the\nassistance ranges from hydroelectricity generation to IT services including support in\neducation and skill development.\n\nA comparison with Bangladesh-Bhutan trade is warranted at this stage. The\nrelationship between Bhutan and Bangladesh is at three levels viz., trade, culture and\nenvironment.

India in the 1960s, had provided Bhutan with diesel sets which helped in\nproviding electricity in towns. During this period, Bhutan lacked capacity to generate\nelectricity and in 1967 Bhutan began to replace Indian diesel sets with import of electricity\nfrom Jaldakha plant in Bengal. In 1989, India helped Bhutan with the establishment of a\n33 Megawatt electricity plant in Chukha.\n\nIt is only in the 1980s that, with Indian assistance, Bhutan realised the potential of\nhydropower. Bhutan also became convinced that hydropower generation is safe and is\nenvironment friendly. Bhutan realised that if it succeeds in developing hydropower, it can\nalso emerge as a net exporter of the same which can eventually help Bhutan generate\nforeign exchange. They began to seek Indian assistance which can be broadly seen in two\nphases.\n\nPhase-1—1987 to 2007: In this initial phase, India provided assistance to Bhutan in the\nestablishment of specific site based plants at Chukha, Kurichu and Tala. India provided\nmonetary assistance in the form of 60% grant and 40% loan for these projects. Meanwhile,\nIndia domestically worked to establish grid infrastructure in its territory. As these plants\nbecame operational, they supplied electricity to India and this electricity from Bhutan fed\nthe Northern and North Eastern power grid in India.\n\nPhase-2—2007 to 2020: In this phase, India has committed to undertake creation of mega\nhydro plants in India primarily to harness the targeted 10,000 Megawatt electricity by\n2020.\n\nOver a period of time, due to the existence of hydrodiplomacy between India and\nBhutan, some issues have erupted on both sides. The Indian side witnessed massive\nflooding in the downstream state of Assam in 2014. Bhutan alleges today that due to\nhydro cooperation with India, there is a dominance of Indian firms in Bhutan.

In 1959, the confrontation\nbetween the king, Mahendra Bir Bikram Shah, and the NC reached a level where the king\ndeclared NC as corrupt, removed it from power and subsequently installed a party-less\nPanchayat system.\n\nThis system was such where people would elect their representatives but actual\npower would be wielded by the King. Thus, a highly centralised rule began from 1960.\nThe period of party-less Panchayat System witnessed protests from NC and other sections\nof society.

In 1994, the Unified Marxist Leninist Party (UML) tried to\ngenerate an anti-India feeling in Nepal. The UML began to assert that the NC is in reality\ncontrolled by Congress party of India. This led to a perception amongst the Nepali people\nabout India’s control and interference over Nepal and its internal affairs through the NC.\nThe anti-India plan worked in favour of UML and they succeeded in capturing power for a\nshort period of 9 months in Nepal.

Even the British had continued to maintain an open border between India\nand Nepal. The British and Nepal, after the Anglo—Nepal wars in 1814, concluded the\nTreaty of Sagauli in 1816. The British had drafted the Treaty of Sagauli on 2“ December,\n1815. The treaty was to be signed by Nepal by the deadline of 17* December 1815. Nepal\nrefused to sign it by the date declared. The British subsequently threatened an invasion of\nKathmandu and after a 92 days stalemate, a courtier, C S Upadhyay, signed the treaty. The\nTreaty of Sagauli was not signed by the King and thus led to troubles in later times but the\nTreaty established Mahakali River as a dividing line in the Western sector.\n\nAfter Independence, India continued with the tradition of an open border and it was\nnoted under the Indo—Nepal Friendship Treaty of 1950. The open border has helped\ndomestic Nepalese people to take advantage. The people of Nepal, through the open\nborder, also entered into India for economic opportunities. The Nepalis who come to India\nfor work are well accepted in India and are not treated as aliens. Nepali citizens have\nimportant contribution in India’s security setup as well.\n\nThe entire border is demarcated by border pillars but at various stretches, due to\nnatural calamities and lack of maintenance, the border pillars have gone missing,\nnecessitating a proper demarcation of the border to ensure that an absence of the same\ndoesn’t lead to escalation of tensions. In 1981, India and Nepal established a Joint\nTechnical level Boundary Committee to survey the boundary again. The committee in\n2007 submitted 182 strip maps which were to be ratified by both nations. The ratification\nof the 182 strip maps is still pending as of 2017. In July, 2014, both countries established a\nBoundary Working Group (BWG) to resolve the Kalapani and Susta issues. The main\nissue related to the border management between India and Nepal is that the borders have\nbeen demarcated on the basis of a flowing river. The problem is that the rivers shift their\ncourses over a period of time. This impacts the border which gets affected due to shifting\nrivers. No doubt the boundary of the river is also based on a principled fixed border but if\nthe river shifts, it results in creation of adverse possessions. The shifting of the rivers has\nled to the destruction of boundary pillars. The BWG will use GPS observations and\ngenerate data. The data will be used by the foreign secretaries of both nations to solve\npending border issues. The BWG is also to look into the Kalapani issue. The origin of the\nKalapani issue goes back to Treaty of Sagauli. As per the treaty, Kali river is designated as\nthe western part of the boundary. In between the two streams of the Kali river lies\n\nKalapani. The issue arises as the segments to the West of Kalapani of Kali river are\nclaimed by Nepal while India claims segments to the East of Kalapani of Kali river area,\nthereby making a claim to entire Kalapani. In the 1962 Indo-China war, Kalapani was\noccupied by Indian forces and India considers it strategically important."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

However, it has installed a capacity of around 800 Megawatts\nonly. On an average, 15 to 18 hours of power cuts are common throughout the country.\nUnfortunately, Nepal has not developed its hydropower potential due to a fear that if they\nundertake hydropower generation, India will assert dominance over the generated\nhydroelectricity.

In 1954, India and Nepal signed the Kosi\n\ntreaty. Kosi river causes tremendous flooding and has been also called the Sorrow of\nBihar. As per the treaty, the two sides agreed to cooperate to manage Kosi flooding. India,\nunder the treaty, committed to create a low head diversion or a barrage dam which,\nthrough gates, can regulate Kosi’s water flow. India constructed the barrage in Nepal and\nNepal agreed to give its management rights to India for 199 years. Over a period of time,\ncertain sections in Nepal have brought up some issues pertaining to the Kosi treaty. A\nsection in Nepal feels that barrages have a normal life of 50 years and India getting a lease\nof 199 years has given India rights to control it for long beyond the need. Certain sections\nin Nepal also allege that India, while managing the barrage, does not release adequate\nwater for irrigation and during floods, opens the gates, leading to many villages getting\nsubmerged completely. A solution to this issue may come forth if both sides undertake a\nmulti-stakeholder negotiation and resolve the issues.\n\nIn 1959, India and Nepal also signed the Gandak River treaty. The treaty has 13\narticles and under the treaty, both sides are to utilise water from the Gandak river to\ngenerate twenty thousand megawatts electricity. In 1996, both concluded Mahakali treaty.\nUnder the treaty, India has agreed to undertake the creation of three dams at Sarda,\nTanakpur and Pancheshwar. Both sides have agreed to share costs.

The Constitution was\ndrafted by the Second Constituent Assembly following the failure of the First Constituent\nAssembly to produce a constitution in its mandated period. The present constitution,\nwhich is its seventh, took almost nine years in the making. Nepal has alleged that India did\nnot “welcome” the Nepali Constitution promulgated by the Constituent Assembly but\nmerely “noted” it.\n\nWhat makes this constitution different from previous six’ constitutions is that old\nconstitutions were written by monarchs and this seventh one is written by an elected\nConstituent Assembly (CA). The new Constitution has been written by politicians and not\nby Jurists and legal luminaries. It has adopted a rights based framework which is high on\npromises. The CA mechanism was adopted to ensure that the diverse social and ethnic\ngroups of Nepal come together on a platform and work on rules to be made for the entire\nsociety. The CA aimed to have an inclusive order with all groups on board. However, the\nidea of a collective ownership to a constitution has not evolved. The Constitution has not\ngiven representation to the Madhesis on the basis of population. In the Pahadi region,\nthere is one representative for every 5000 people while in the Terai region, it is one\nrepresentative for every one lakh people. In the new constitution, the Madhesis and Tharus\n(who constitute 70% of the population of Terai) were left out. Madhesis consist of\nMaithili, Bhojpuri, Avadhi, Hindi and Urdu speaking people. The people in the hills or\nPahadis consist of Limbus, Khambus, Magurs, Gurungs, Tamangs, Khasas and Nepali\n\nAryans. Nepal has faced severe problems in accommodating people of South Terai. The\nPahadis, in the new constitution, have reasserted their dominant role. The new constitution\ndoes not have equal representation of all groups in the Parliament. The total number of\nseats planned for the Parliament is 165. More than 50% of the Nepali population lives in\nthe Terai region. The total seats allotted to people of Terai are just 65 in number. The\nPahadi region has got 100 seats at a time when they had less than fifty percent of the\npopulation. India has requested Nepal to go for an inclusive constitution with equal\nrepresentation. The Madhesis argue that by demarcating the Terai region differently, the\nPahadis intend to destroy the roti-beti character. Under the roti-beti characteristic concept,\nwomen from UP and Bihar states of India who marry a Madhesi will be treated as a\nforeigner for upto five years from now. The Madhesis protests this and want Ek Madhesh,\nEk Pradesh.\n\nAs mentioned, in 2007, there was an interim constitution that had, since then, been\ngoverning Nepal. In the interim constitution, as per Article 63(3), it was stated that\ngeographical position and special characteristics would guide the electoral constitution.\nThe Article 63(3) also stated that Madhesis would be given representation as per their\npopulation. In the new constitution, Article 84, which talks of representation, has dropped\nthe point related to Madhesis. The interim constitution, under Article 21, had advocated\nthat various Nepali groups will participate in state structure on the basis of the\nproportional inclusion principle, while under Article 42 of the new constitution, is\ndropped, something that which India is asserting be reinserted.\n\nCitizenship issues are also at the forefront. Many Madhesis have acquired citizenship\nby birth or naturalisation. As per the new constitution under Article 282, it mandates that\nthe posts of President, VicePresident and Prime Minister of Nepal and so forth, are to be\nreserved exclusively for those with citizenship by descent. India has been pitching for the\naddition of citizens who have acquired citizenship by birth and naturalisation also to be\nconsidered for higher posts. Over a period of time, some amendments were made by\nNepal in Articles 42, 84 and 286 (dealing with the delimitation process). Some sections of\nNepali groups in Southern Nepal for long undertook a blockade of Birgunj border in\nRaxaul. As a result of this, basic supplies could not reach Nepal. There was subsequently a\nsevere shortage of commodities, including LPG cylinders. The Nepali people have a\nperception that through the blockade (in which India categorically denies any role), India\nhas imposed its own version of economic sanctions in Nepal. The blockade has affected\nthe people in the Pahadi region a lot. Even in case of the Terai region, due to the blockade,\nthere was a strong anti-India sentiment. The major businessmen community in the Terai\nregion consists of Marwaris. They have good relations with the people of the hills but are\nnot very comfortable with the Madhesis, Due to the blockade, India’s story has not won\nand its soft power policy has been eroded. It is stated by a scholar named Joseph Nye that\nin the 21* Century, it is the soft power that wins. India must follow a strategy in Nepal that\nwields soft power influence. India should take steps to recognize the diversity of the\nNepali people and work with all sections of the society to eliminate poverty.\n\nDue the blockade, the Nepali state began to witness fuel shortages. India annually\nsupplies 1.3 Million Tonnes petroleum products to Nepal. Due to the blockade, Nepali\npeople had to resort to cutting of trees to meet the fuel shortages, There was a massive\ndeforestation and this led to a huge layer of smog in Kathmandu and other areas. Despite\n\nimmense poverty, Nepali people now had to face health related issues due to the smog.\n\nIn February 2016, the Nepali PM, KP Oli visited India and brought about an\nassurance to India on constitutional changes.

The language, a slightly varied dialect of Bengali, acts as a bridge between East\nIndia, North East India and Bangladesh. The piece of land where Bangladesh exists has\nundergone three partitions. It began in October, 1905, when the British, as per their\n‘divide-and-rule’ policy, divided the Bengal Presidency on Hindu—Muslim lines. The\nMuslims, in majority in the state, landed in the area that was to later become East\nPakistan. Due to massive mobilisation and political protests that eventually came to be\nknown as the ‘Banga bhanga Andolan’, the territory was reunited on 12\" December, 1911.\nHowever, as far as the national movement was concerned, the seeds for partition were\nalready sown by the initial decision of the British to divide the region along religious\nlines.\n\nThe Muslim League, which was established on 30° December, 1906 in Dhaka, later\ndemanded that the area be under East Pakistan during the Partition of India in 1947. As the\npartition took place in 1947, it led to the formation of East Pakistan with large-scale riots\npreceding the event in Calcutta and Noakhali.\n\nThe territory again witnessed a split in 1971 to become Bangladesh. The factors that\nled to divisions of East Pakistan in 1971 emerged in the period after 1947. East Pakistan\nalways had inadequate representation; it got access to fewer resources and, despite the\npopularity of the Bengali language, Urdu was imposed as the administrative language.\n\nThis led to confrontation between the government and the masses and violence erupted in\nEast Pakistan. In 1970, when elections took place, the Awami League won the elections.\nThe regime in West Pakistan refused to recognise the mandate of the election and\nunleashed violence, disallowing Sheikh Mujibur Rehman to take power. The subsequent\nplanning of a pre-emptive attack on India by Pakistan forced India to militarily retaliate\nand support the formation of independent Bangladesh as a new nation. The confrontation\nfinally led to emergence of Bangladesh in December 1971. From 1971 to 1975, came the\nera of Sheikh Mujibur Rehman who assumed power. In 1972, India and Bangladesh\nsigned a Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation which became the foundation of the\nmodern India—Bangladesh relations.\n\nToday, in Bangladesh, there are two key parties. Awami League, headed by Sheikh\nHasina, is a party which has stood up for secular ideals and is favourable towards India\nwhile Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) which is headed by Begum Khaleda Zia, is a\nparty that favours Bengali nationalism and is not favourably inclined towards India."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

In 1951, India had\ninitiated the construction of the Farakka Barrage. It was on the river Ganga, which\nflows from India into Bangladesh, where its primary distributary is known as the\nriver Padma. The river drains into Bay of Bengal after a confluence with river\nMeghna. In 1975, the barrage was finally constructed. Bangladesh began to insist that\nGanga is an international river so the water flow must be regulated as per a mutual\nagreement. The reason for India to establish the barrage was to flush out the silt of\nBhagirathi Hoogly river to ensure smooth operationalisation of Kolkata port. The two\nnations, in 1972, established a Joint River Commission (JRC) to negotiate terms of\nthe water settlement. Soon, differences arose over fair weather flow of river Ganga.\nIndia asserted its right of regular flushing of water of river Hoogly, which\nBangladesh vehemently opposed. This issue created some friction between the two\nnations. Some disagreements also emerged over post 1971 war settlements over the\nshare of spoils. Bangladesh alleged that it did not receive a fair share of the spoils of\nwar. The assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rehman on 15* August, 1975 ended the\nhoneymoon period.\n\nThe death of Mujibur Rehman saw a period of immense political instability when a\ncoup and a counter-coup were staged in rapid succession, following which Zia-Ur-\nRehman finally came to power as Bangladesh’s seventh President in 1977. Zia was not\nfavourably disposed towards India. He took the Farakka barrage issue to the United\nNations General Assembly (UNGA). The UNGA urged him to resolve the issue at a\nbilateral level. The act of raising the issue at UNGA created further tensions in the already\nstrained relations between the nations. In 1977, in India, Indira Gandhi was replaced by\nthe Janata Party government, which made an attempt to revive the fractured relationship\nwith Bangladesh. In November 1977, Babu Jagjivan Ram undertook an official visit to\nBangladesh and signed an accord to resolve the Farrakka issue. However, other issues\n\npersistent between the nations as irritants.\n\nEventually, the border issue between India and Bangladesh began to unfold.\nHistorically people of Bangladesh have been moving into the region of Brahmaputra\nvalley due to the lack of habitable and arable land in Bangladesh. India perceives this\nmovement as illegal immigration into Indian territory. The improvement in relations\ndipped with the comeback of Indira Gandhi in 1980 and finally improved somewhat\nduring Rajiv Gandhi’s tenure. Rajiv Gandhi successfully concluded an MoU on water\nissues in 1982 and in 1985, signed the Nassau Accord, which resulted in another MoU\nvalid for three years. A Joint Commission of Experts (JCE) was established for alternative\nwater-sharing plans and to augment the Ganga—Brahmaputra basin. Rajiv Gandhi also\nallowed Nepal to be a part of water sharing thereby sweetening the entire deal. However,\ndomestic constraints prevented the pact from yielding the desired results. The entire\nperiod, till end of the Cold War, witnessed a fluctuating relationship between the\nneighbouring states. The end of the Cold War saw a change in the domestic policy of\nBangladesh. The dictator Ershad decided to step down and elections followed in 1991.\nThe BNP won the elections. In 1996, the BNP was replaced by Awami League and the\nnew government concluded a fresh treaty over the river Ganga with India in 1996. Since\nthe end of the Cold War, Indo—Bangladesh relations are primarily driven by the policy\norientations of the two parties—the BNP and the Awami League. The BNP has a\npropensity to incline its polices to favour Pakistan and China while the Awami League\nfavours a partnership with India."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

While dividing the\nterritory in East Pakistan, Radcliffe did not pay attention to small patches of land called\n‘enclaves’. These enclaves were, in the pre-independence era, called Chitmahals and they\nwere used by the Raja of Cooch Behar and Maharaja of Rangpur as stakes in the game of\nchess. After independence, Radcliffe drew a line to divide the territory. Efforts were made\nby Nehru in 1958 to divide the territories through an agreement with Feroz Khan Noon.\nAs per the agreement, India got the enclave of Dahagram and Angarpota while half of\nBerubari enclave was to be given to East Pakistan. The origin of the Berubari territory also\ngoes back to the time of Radcliffe. Radcliffe tried to demarcate the boundary on the basis\nof thanas but he accidently omitted the Berubari number-12 thana. The Nehru—Noon\nagreement resolved this issue. As the Berubari number-12 thana was within the Jalpaigudi\nthana, half of it was given to East Pakistan as they laid claims over it. To give effect to the\nNehru—Noon agreement 1958, an amendment under article 368 of Indian constitution was\nmade under the 9* Amendment Act of 1960. When Bangladesh was created in 1971, Indira\nGandhi decided to resolve the pending disputes with Mujibur Rehman. In 1974, a Land\nBoundary Agreement (LBA) was designed which clarified the need to exchange 111\nIndian enclaves in Bangladesh and 51 Bangladeshi enclaves in India. In these enclaves,\ncitizens were living with no available rights and facilities. On 16\" May, 1974, the\nagreement was signed but was not ratified by India and thereby the exchange under the\nLBA could not proceed successfully. According to the LBA, Bangladesh was to get\nDahagram and Angarpota while India would get the other half of Berubari.\n\nDahagram and Angarpota were to be connected through a corridor called Tin Bigha\nand India was to lease out the Teen Bigha Corridor to Bangladesh in perpetuity. Due to\nstrong internal resistance, the Indian government was finally only able to grant\n\nBangladesh access to the corridor in 1992, and that too, for a limited number of hours per\nday. Full access to the corridor was finally granted in 2011. In 2006, the Hasina\ngovernment in Bangladesh assumed power and in 2007 established a consultative\nmechanism in the area demarcated in the LBA. The people in the consultative mechanism\nasserted that they would not leave their areas. The rights of the people inhabiting the\nregion of the LBA now came in stark incongruence to the precepts of the LBA which\nadvocated territorial relocations. In 2010, Hasina visited India and in 2011, a Protocol to\nthe LBA was agreed to.\n\nAs per the protocol, it was decided that status quo was to be maintained in the regions\nand the wishes of the people would be respected. Thus in 2011, the procedural acceptance\nwas completed on ground and the national exchange was agreed to. Since there was to be\nno cession of territory, the Indian Parliament ratified the bill in May 2016 and the entire\nprocess got completed by June 2016."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

In the ancient times, Gautama Buddha sent the two monks, Tapusa\nand Bhallika, with eight strands of his own hair to promote Buddhism in the Myanmar\nregion. Tapusa and Bhallika built a pagoda in Shwedagon, which is now known as the\nShwedagon Zedi Daw. Ashoka, during his reign, also sent missionaries to Burma. The\npeople of Burma, since the ancient times, have been majorly Kshatriyas and their origins\ncan be traced back to India, in the Gangetic valley. The 17th century Pyu dynasty used\nIndian titles like Hari Vikramaditya and Surya Vikramaditya. In modern times, the British\nhad exiled Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last Mughal Emperor of India, to Yangon in Myanmar\nand the Konbaung King of Myanmar to Ratnagiri.\n\nIn 1951, India and Burma established diplomatic relations through a treaty of\nfriendship. Although the bedrock of the relationship is the India~-Myanmar Treaty of\nFriendship signed in 1951, the foundation of the Indo—Myanmar relations was laid down\nby the visit of Rajiv Gandhi in 1987. After the victory of Ne Win in Burma, he undertook\ndrastic nationalisation which led to lot of discrimination from the Indian diaspora present\nin Burma. The Indian diaspora in Burma had British origins as Burma is an erstwhile\nBritish colony that gained independence in 1948 and the British had taken a large number\nof Indians to work in Burma as plantation workers. The regime of Ne Win did not boost\nthe Burman economy, plunging the nation into deep economic crisis. In 1988, Ne Win’s\nresignation led to a referendum on whether or not multi-party democracy needed to be\nadopted in Myanmar. General Saw Haung took control of Myanmar and established the\n\nstate law and order restoration council (SLOC). In 1990, SLOC announced elections.\nHowever, as per the SLOC, the election was to be held only for the purpose of redrafting\nthe Constitution of the Myanmar.\n\nIn the elections, the National League for Democracy (NLD) won 392 of 485 seats\nand the rest were won by the National Unity Party (backed by the army). The NLD\ndemanded immediate transfer of power on the basis of popular vote. This led to a\nconfrontation based on the political values of democracy and autocracy. India has always\nbeen a supporter of NLD. Subsequently, Aung San Suu Kyi, the founder of NLD, was put\nunder house arrest because of China’s support of SLOC. Post 1992, Myanmar decided to\nhead towards an open economy and joined ASEAN as a member and ended martial law. It\nalso revived its relations with India. Since 1993, Indo—Myanmar relations have prospered.\nThe military backed party is called Union Solidarity and Development Party, or USDP.\n\nAs India, at the end of the Cold War, announced its Look East Policy, the significance\nof Myanmar increased. In 2011, Thein Sein took steps to promote democracy. In the same\nyear, Thein Sein visited India while in 2012 Suu Kyi visited India after her release from\nhouse arrest. Manmohan Singh also visited Myanmar in 2012 and these visits eventually\nbrought security and developmental diplomacy back on track. In the March 2016\nelections, NLD won again and Htin Kyaw became the new President of Myanmar.\nMyanmar remains extremely important to India for its proximity to Bengal, Bihar, Odisha,\nBhutan and India’s North East. It also shares a border with China. The Myanmar territory\nis used by insurgents for drug trade and narcotics crimes. India had maintained cordial\nrelations with Myanmar despite it being under military rule for a significant time and even\ntoday, Myanmar remains a focal point of India’s Act East Policy."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Over a\nperiod of time, they became prosperous and asserted their economic strength in the\nsociety. The local people of Myanmar were not happy and felt insecure. From 1920s to\n1940s, there were violent revolts. During Ne Win’s time, the non-Buddhist people were\nalso targeted. Many of them left Myanmar during Ne Win’s time.\n\nFrom Bengal, a lot of Muslims were taken by the Britishers to Burma from 1823\nonwards when the British occupied the Rakhine state of Myanmar. After the independence\nof Burma in 1948, these Muslims stayed back in Burma. Many of them are settled in\nSouth West Burma, which is known as the Rakhine area. The Rakhine area is in Arakans.\nFrom ‘Rakhine’ a word has originated for these Muslims in Myanmar’s language and the\nword is Rohangs. These Muslims are therefore called Rohingyas. According to the 1982\nCitizenship law of Myanmar, the Rohingyas were not recognized as an official ethnic\n\ngroup and since then have become stateless in Myanmar. In the 1990s, a movement in\nMyanmar began, which came to be known as the 969 movement. The movement was a\nbrain child of Kyaw Lwin. Under the 969 movement, the government used Lwin’s ideas to\nwin over people by preaching the good practices of Buddhism. In the 2000s, another\nmovement called the 786 movement began. The origin of the 786 movement is in Arabic\nAbjad numerical system and is inspired from the opening passage of Quran. In Myanmar,\n786 usually demarcates an area as belonging to Muslims. The Buddhist began to\nmisinterpret the 786 movement and they began to think that this means that 786\nmovement aimed to dominate 21° century (7 + 8 + 6 = 21) as the Islamic century. It saw a\nrise in insecurity of Buddhists manifesting in riots in 2011 in the Sittwe-Rakhine region\nand the brain behind this ethnic violence was Ashin Wirathu. A widespread belief in the\nfact that Muslims want to dominate Myanmar spread like wildfire. The rise of the radical\nand rightist Ashin Wirathu has brought out the face of radical Buddhism. This has led to\nthe mass exodus of Rohingyas to Indonesia and Thailand in 2015. Those who remain are\nritually ghettoised and persecuted. India is not a signatory to the UN Refugee Convention\nof 1951 and thus is not mandated to accept refugees. But, on humanitarian grounds, India\nhas accepted a few Rohingyas. India needs to develop an imaginative diplomacy for the\nRohingyas, India needs to ask Myanmar to rehabilitate the Rohingyas as not rehabilitating\nthem is detrimental to Indian security interests.

Though it is stated that the\noperation was jointly carried out by India and Myanmar, in reality, the operation was\ncarried out by the Indian army alone and Myanmar was not involved in the design of\nthe operation. The operation was launched because Research and Analysis Wing\n(R&AW) had provided information that a huge consignment of arms for North\nEastern insurgents had reached Cox Bazar (Bangladesh) and was to be sent to\ninsurgents in Manipur. The arms, as per intelligence, were meant for groups in\nNagaland and the Isak-Muivah group in Manipur. On 31* March 1995, it was\nreported that a large number of insurgents had entered into Mizoram. Mizoram, being\na peaceful state, had lesser presence of forces. Forces were deployed for counter\n\ninsurgency in the states of Manipur and Nagaland. In the initial phase of the\noperation, troops were air dropped into Mizoram from Manipur and Nagaland. Radio\nsets and other technological instruments were used to intercept the insurgents’\nmessages. On 5\" April 1995, the insurgents crossed over to Myanmar and started\nusing porters to carry loads of material. The Indian troops began a hot pursuit of the\ninsurgents. This led to the Indian troops capture an insurgent named Hathi Barvah.\nHathi was trained by the Pakistani 151 near Karachi. Hathi provided valuable\ninformation about insurgent route, ammunition, and so forth on interrogation. In May\n1995, after deployment of forces, the operations were carried out and finally by 21\"\nMay 1995, the operation was officially called off.\n\nAnother key driver of defence cooperation is maritime security. As India undertakes\noil exploration in Myanmar, maritime cooperation has emerged as a new dimension. As\nMyanmar faces piracy and illegal fishing problems, India has been providing training to\nMyanmar’s forces and especially navy.\n\nNagas have been living in the North East since time immemorial. In 1935, Myanmar\nwas created as a separate state. It got decolonised in 1947. After the decolonisation of\nMyanmar, new boundaries were created with India. This led to a division between India\nand Myanmar and affected the Nagas, who became ethnic minorities on both sides. To\nresolve the issue, the governments of both countries decided to establish a free movement\nregime (FMR) which could allow Nagas greater interaction either side of the border. As\nper the FMR, the Nagas can travel 16 km across either side of the border without a visa.\nThis FMR facilitated interaction between Konyaks, Khiamniungans and Yimchungar\nNagas living in Eastern districts of Nagaland. Not only does regular movement happen\ndue to the FMR but children from NSAZ come to the Indian side to study as well. In the\nrecent times, the Myanmar side has started erecting a fence along the border. The locals\nbelieve that Myanmar is doing so in concurrence with Indian authorities. The Indian side\nhas clarified that the fence is on the side of Myanmar and not India and a fence on the\nIndian side will be created only if locals approve. The creation of the fence has angered\nthe locals as they feel this fence would restrict their movements.

Historically, both were are\npart of the colonial empire established by the British. From the Indian Foreign policy\nmakers’ point of view, Myanmar is a nearneighbour whom India considers to be well\nwithin its area of interest. India has been quite uncomfortable with rising Chinese forays\ninto Myanmar. India certainly wants to delimit Chinese assertion in Myanmar as it\nconstitutes Myanmar to be region of the Indian spear of influence. India asserts this\nbecause it supported democracy in Myanmar since the 1980s. However, to lay down a\nfoundation for political reform, India, since the beginning of 21* century, had to support\nthe Military Junta. Burmese scholars believe that the reason India became unsuccessful in\nchallenging rising Chinese influence in Myanmar was its support to the Junta. The\nscholars also believe that when India began to support the Junta, it began to lose goodwill\namongst the Burmese population.\n\nAt present, India’s influence is missing in the two camps of Myanmar—one camp\nthat supports democracy and that which is supported by not only the ethnic minorities of\nMyanmar but also the USA, Japan and South Korea; while other camp is dominated by\nChina and Tatmadaur or the Myanmar military. Though India has favoured the democracy\ncamp, the views of the reformists hardly match with India. Drug trafficking across the\nborders is viewed by the reformists as a source of income, but perceived as major threat by\nIndia.\n\nIndia and Burma gained independence simultaneously (within six months of each\nother), and initially, the two sides developed proximity when India proposed non-\nalignment. But gradually, as the military began to assume control in Myanmar, the two\nsides began to drift apart. The drift was aggravated by the issue of the Chettiyar\ncommunity in 1988. In 1988, the ‘8888 revolt’ started in Burma. (It began on 8-8-1988\nand is hence called 8888). The revolt was led by Aung San Suu Kyi. Suu Kyi fought for\ndemocracy and won the election in Myanmar, but the military junta rejected the polls and\nlaunched massive crackdown on the activists. India, in 1992, condemned the human rights\nviolations in Myanmar by supporting the UN resolution.\n\nIn the 1990s, when the Look East policy was announced, India neglected Myanmar\nand prioritised engagement with the Asian tigers. In 1998, the Vajpayee government\ndownplayed all support to the reformists, branding it as an international issue that could\nonly be dealt with by Myanmar. It began to offer the arms deals to the Junta, and the\nsupport to the Junta continued subsequently by the UPA government. In 2007, in\nMyanmar, the democratic protests under the Saffron revolution were crack down by the\n\nJunta. In 2010, India hosted Than Shwe for a state visit and offered monitory assistance to\nMyanmar. In 2011, during the visit of Thein Sein to India, India extended $500 million\nline of credit to the country. Whenever a bilateral visit was undertaken, there were fresh\ntalks about connectivity. However, this remained merely rhetorical. Since the British\ntimes, owing to logistical difficulties, the Indo-Myanmar region lacked road and rail\ninfrastructure, and supported a tough terrain, inhabited by insurgents on both sides. Since\n2011, the coming of Thein Sein government has initiated a policy of global engagement.\nThis will be beneficial for India as the Chinese influence in Myanmar will gradually\ndiminish as Myanmar searches for new friends. India, since 2011, has decided to take this\nnew opportunity to rebuild ties. India is now establishing physical connectivity as part of\nits Act East policy. India now recognises that Myanmar is a bridge to South East Asia.\n\n(Use Myanmar for Myanmar is a link in India's\nenergy security ~  Act-East policy to South East Asia\nLimit growing influence ..

However, the Chinese continued to enhance their strategic\npresence in Myanmar and use its presence to increase their reach in the Indian Ocean.\nHowever by early 2000s, Myanmar realised that its engagement with China had become\nso deep that it had reached a dangerous level and Myanmar needed to break the ice with\nthe West. Since the coming of Thein Sein, Myanmar began to emerge as new darling of\nthe western states. As Myanmar decided to lessen its dependence on China, it began to\nopen up to Singapore, India, Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia.\n\nThe USA too has opened up to Myanmar, as it knows that a deeper engagement with\nMyanmar favours USA in its attempt to keep the rise of China in check. The Chinese, on\nthe other hand, began to support the United DWA state army (UWSA). The UWSA has\nbeen getting arms and ammunition from China to fight the Myanmar government. The\nfuture depends on how Myanmar and the USA shall evolve and strengthen their\nrelationship and whether USA will provide military and defence supplies to Myanmar to\ncounter China. After the 1962 Sino—India conflict, the Chinese have supported Mizo and\nNaga rebels and has even provided them training to keep India under check. Till the rule\nof Mao lasted in China, the rebels received direct support from the Chinese state. India\nhas, in 2015, concluded a peace deal with NSCN-IM group. In 2015, India resorted to a\nsurgical strike on the Indian side of the Indo—Myanmar border and targeted the insurgent\nNSCN-K group.

India, time and again, did\ntry to convey to Ceylon that it had no expansionist agenda and acknowledged its\nrespect for Ceylon’s independence and sovereignty. India, for that matter, had not\ninterfered or reacted in 1963 when China and Ceylon signed a maritime agreement\nfor commercial trade. India also refrained from objecting when Colombo was used by\nPakistan as a refuelling hub to reach Dhaka in the 1971 war.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the British took Indian Tamils to Ceylon to work as\nplantation workers. After Ceylon became independent, the Sinhalese government\ndiscriminated against Tamils, thereby deepening the void in Indo-—Ceylon relations.\nDuring Nehru, no attempt was made to bring any Tamils back as, for generations, these\nTamils had lived in Ceylon and were more citizens of that state than of India. Ceylon, on\nthe other hand, devised a mechanism to make it tough for Tamils to acquire state\ncitizenship. They also wanted to ensure they put an end to Tamil dominance in public\nservices. Due to the British missionary work, the children of the Tamils grew up to hold\npositions in Ceylon’s administrative departments. Post-independence, through the\nSinhalese language barrier, they made it tough for Tamil administrators. However, in\n1964, there was a Shastri-Sirimavo pact that was signed whereby Ceylon agreed to give\nthree lakh Indian Tamils in Ceylon citizenship and India also agreed to repatriate a\nsizeable number to India. However, the matter of repatriation did not complete till 1988.\nIn 1975, Sirimavo Bandaranaike had imposed emergency in Sri Lanka while in 1977 this\nwas done by Indira Gandhi in India.\n\npane nel oes ca eiione < » Began with Sirimavo-Shastri pact-1964\n“Continued with Sirimavo-Indira pact-1974\n\nJayewardene JR, who succeeded Sirimavo Bandaranaike, did not promote Indo-Sri\nLanka relations despite his coming to India for a state visit after being elected.\nJayewardene continued to marginalise Tamils and Tamil subjugation continued unabated\nin Sri Lanka.

Jayewardene advanced a liberal and open\neconomy and positioned Sri Lanka westward. Jayewardene not only allowed deeper\npresence of US firms in Lanka but granted refuelling permit for the nuclear powered US\naircraft carrier Kitty Hawk. The situation especially deteriorated in 1977 and 1981 due to\nTamil riots. The ruling party of Tamil Nadu, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra\nKazhagam (AIDMK) was an ally of the Congress Party at the centre, and Indira Gandhi,\nin 1981, warned Jayewardene that India would not tolerate the persecution meted out to\n\nTamils and advocated him to be cautious. Post 1980, India adopted a very delicate policy.\nIt is widely alleged by scholars and theorists that India used the Research & Analysis\nWing (R&AW) to train Tamil rebels in Sri Lanka. The aim was to use Tamil rebels to\ndestabilise the Jayewardene regime and also while also ensuring that the Tamil rebels do\nnot succeed in creating a separate state. The R&AW supported Tamil Eelam Liberation\norganisation. It was in 1976 that the Liberation of Tamil Tigers Eelam (LTTE), a separatist\nand insurgent militant force, was formed by V Prabhakaran. The LTTE witnessed the\nR&AW’s support Tamil Eelam Liberation Organisation (TELO) and began to seek support\nfrom Tamil political leaders in Tamil Nadu. As the R&AW had gradually succeeded in\ndestabilising the Sri Lankan government, it slowly stopped supporting the rebels. But by\nthis time, the LTTE had emerged as a powerful force and began to assert itself as the sole\nrepresentative of Tamils in Sri Lanka. When Indira Gandhi died, Jayewardene took the\nhelp of Pakistan and the US to get Sri Lankan forces trained to counter the LTTE rebels.\n\nThis move on the part of Sri Lanka was not well-received by India. In 1987,\nJayewardene formally requested India to oppose any kind of military intervention by the\nLTTE in Sri Lanka but India failed to act on behalf of the Sri Lankan government in any\npositive way. Sri Lanka launched an operation where the Indian Air Force airdropped food\nand other essentials to Tamils. India—Sri Lanka Accord (ISLA) had been signed on 29 July\n1987, which assigned a certain amount of autonomy to Tamil areas with Eelam People’s\nRevolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF) controlling the regional council and called for\nthe Tamil militant groups to lay down their arms.

The basic idea of Rajiv Gandhi\nwhile concluding the Accord was that the ISLA would provide India an opportunity\nto shape the post war political trajectory of Sri Lanka. The ISLA had two goals.\nFirstly, the idea was to persuade the conflicting ethnic groups to join mainstream\npolitics and secondly, seek political devolution in Sri Lanka by altering the\nconstitution of the state to get autonomy for the Tamil community. The ISLA was\nrejected by the LTTE and it resorted to violence against India and Sri Lanka both and\ncontinued till 2009.\n\nThe Sri Lankan government in 1987, through the 13th Amendment, resorted to\n\nthe devolution of power by creating Provincial Councils. Though the 13th\nAmendment was rejected by the LTTE, it did restructure the contemporary political\nsituation of the post-colonial Sri Lanka. Though the Councils have been created, but\nan analysis of the present state of the councils prove that they have become an\nextension of the ruling political party in power at the Centre. Corruption and\npatronage politics has slid the councils into complete decay and institutional\nparalysis.\n\nAs the ISLA was executed, a large number of LTTE cadres avoided surrendering\nweapons to the IPKF and consumed cyanide. Many even began to fight the IPKF. The\nviolence unleashed post the ISLA in Sri Lanka created renewed tensions in the minds of\nSinhalese who began to perceive India’s role as an undue interference in Sinhalese internal\naffairs that was not in Sri Lanka’s best interests. The Indian government increased the\nIPKF numbers from 6,000 to one lakh and justified the raise by citing national security\nreasons. In 1987, the Sri Lankan Parliament also passed the 13\" amendment act to the\n1978 Sri Lankan Constitution and began the devolution of powers. The Provincial\nCouncils Act No. 42 of 1987, establishing provincial councils. On September 2 and 8,\n1988, President Jayewardene issued proclamations enabling the Northern and Eastern\nprovinces to be one administrative unit administered by one elected Council. In 1988,\nelections were organised in North East Provincial Councils (NEPC) and A V Perumal of\nEelam People’s Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF) won the elections, becoming the\nfirst Chief Minister of the North Eastern Provincial Council.\n\nIn 1988, when the elections were held in Sri Lanka, both the political parties led by\nJayewardene and Sirimavo Bandaranaike demanded the withdrawal of IPKF. India\ninsisted that the IPKF had not been sent unilaterally by India but was the outcome of the\npeace accord signed in 1987. In 1989, as the election results came out in Sri Lanka,\nJayewardene was replaced by Ranasinghe Premadasa, who immediately demanded the\nwithdrawal of the IPKF from Sri Lankan territory. As elections were due in India in\nNovember 1989, Rajiv Gandhi agreed to the recall of the IPKF to contain the situation\nwith Sri Lanka. In fact, it is widely alleged that Ranasinghe covertly began to support the\nLTTE with an intention that the Sri Lankan government and the LTTE both would\ncollaboratively drive out the IPKF. India, under Rajiv Gandhi, linked the IPKF’s\nwithdrawal to the implementation of the 13* Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka\nthat granted councils in Tamil regions. In November 1989, in the Indian elections, V P\nSingh won and in March 1990, it ended the IPKF mission and delinked the IPKF’s\nwithdrawal from the 13* amendment. The IPKF was recalled to India and the entire idea of\nNEPC devolution collapsed. In May, 1991, the LTTE assassinated Rajiv Gandhi and then\nwas subsequently designated as a terrorist organisation. After the death of Rajiv Gandhi,\nmany Tamil groups also began to stop supporting the LTTE. As India realised the failure\nof its mission, it also felt the need to go for a fresh look at India’s Sri Lanka policy."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The\nBritish, to prevent Russian advancement into Asia, decided to render Afghanistan into a\nbuffer state. It fought three Anglo—Afghan wars against Afghanistan, among which the\nmost significant is the third Anglo—Afghan war of 1919 where King Amanullah succeeded\nin gaining right to independently govern Afghanistan. The war got concluded in 1919 with\nTreaty of Rawalpindi, thereby giving Afghanistan the right to be independent of British\ndominance. King Amanullah subsequently initiated the modernisation of Afghanistan. He\nwas succeeded by King Nadir Shah and Zahir Shah later. It is king Zahir Shah that gave\nAfghanistan a Constitution in 1964.\n\nDue to internal weaknesses in the regime and heightened Cold War tensions, in 1979,\nthe Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan and installed Babrak Karmal as the head of state.\nThe US tried to counter Soviet presence in Afghanistan by supporting rebels to undertake\njihad. Saudi Arabia propagated the Wahabi ideology while Pakistan a base to the US in the\nendeavour. The US initiated a fully fledged Mujahedeen campaign in 1980s to counter\nSoviets. US initiated a Mujahedeen campaign in Afghanistan by training people to wage a\nwar against the Soviet to save Islam. US trained Mujahedeens (fighters) to wage a Jihad (a\nwar to protect the religion) in Afghanistan. US mobilised these Mujahedeens and\nestablished a common platform ‘The Base’ (in Arabic language called Al Qaeda) US\npromised these Mujahedeens that if they succeed in removing the Soviets from\nAfghanistan, the US would help them to acquire power in Afghanistan. These\nMujahedeens unleashed a campaign of violence in Afghanistan making it tough for the\nSoviets to exist. The internal weakness of the Soviet puppet regime became clear and\n\nGorbachev replaced Babrak Karmal with Mohammad Najibullah to save Afghanistan. As\nthe Soviet Union failed to save Afghanistan, in 1989, under the Geneva Accord, Soviet\nUnion decided to withdraw from Afghanistan. As USSR withdrew from Afghanistan, the\nUS too stopped all support to the Mujahedeens and did not help them to acquire power in\nAfghanistan as promised earlier. These Mujahedeens now became angry and decided to\ntake revenge against the US. From 1989 to 1996, these Mujahedeens began to come\ntogether and they succeeded in using a common platform to plan a revenge against US.\nThis common platform was called ‘The Base’ (In Arabic language it means Al Qaeda). As\nAl Qaeda was used, there were educated students in Afghanistan who became concerned\nabout the future of their country. They knew that Najibullah was a weak ruler as he did not\nenjoy the Soviet backing anymore. By 1996, these educated students began to come\ntogether to establish a group to provide leadership to their country. This group was called\nTaliban. Taliban comes from the first few letters of the word called TALIB which means\neducated students. The subsequent ending of the Cold War and Soviet withdrawal from\nAfghanistan post-1989 provided space for Mullah Omar, who was backed by Al-Qaeda, to\nfully establish a furiously regressive Taliban rule. The Taliban rule, firmly established by\n1996, controlled Afghanistan till 2001. It was post 9/11 that US initiated Operation\nEnduring Freedom and Operation Anaconda to counter Taliban presence in Afghanistan.\nThe US Congress granted clearance and authorised the use of military force abroad,\nclearing the way for the invasion of Afghanistan in October, 2001. The Taliban and Al-\nQaeda were tackled with the help of military on the ground. To build up a political\nconsensus, the year 2001 saw a Bonn Conference in the city of Bonn in Germany. The\nBonn Conference succeeded in installing an interim government in place.\n\nSubsequently, Hamid Karzai was chosen as the first democratically elected President\nof Afghanistan in the most crucial period in its history. With the coming of Barack Obama\nto power as the US President, he shifted the focus on ending the Afghan war. In 2012, the\nUS and Afghanistan concluded a Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA). The aim of the\nBSA was to elicit the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan. The US, in the\nmeantime, while discussing and finalising the withdrawal of troops, opened a new front of\ntalks with liberal Taliban elements known as the Good Taliban with an aim to reconcile\nthem to the mainstream. The US, on ground, have continued to focus on nation building in\nAfghanistan and have worked for the capacity building of the Afghan National Security\nForce (ANSF). Even after the US troops finally withdraw, the ANSF is deemed to be\nstrong enough at present to prevent the Taliban from recapturing Afghanistan again. Let us\nnow turn our attention to Taliban.\n\nIn 2016, in a missile strike by the US, Mullah Mansoor, who had succeeded Mullah\nOmar as the new leader of Taliban, died. Mansoor was a product of the ISI of Pakistan and\nwas given logistical and military support by Pakistan. After Mansoor had assumed the\nleadership of Taliban in July 2015, the Taliban was on a rampage. Taliban and its key\npartner that is Haqqani Networks had initiated a series of urban bombings. Taliban in the\nrecent times is following a two point strategy. It is trying to attack cities, civilians and\nprotected targets like embassies etc. Through this, they are trying to give a message that\nthey can strike anywhere and can assert more power than the state. Secondly, they have\nstarted attacking provincial capitals in Afghanistan. After attacking the capitals, they\ncapture power for some days in the capital cities. Through this, they are trying to expose\n\nthe limits of Afghani state power.\n\nISI of Pakistan has its own game plan, They wanted to support Mansoor by giving\nhim military support to satiate his appetite for military weapons while using him as a pawn\nto bargain for peace thereby enabling the ISI to install a Taliban government in\nAfghanistan. After the death of Mansoor, there has been a power struggle in Taliban. The\npower struggle is between Sirrajuddin Haqqani, Rasool and Mullah Yakoob. The power\nstruggle is not merely political. Taliban today controls billion dollars worth opium trade in\nthe Helmund Province in Afghanistan. The middle and the junior leg of Taliban is least\ninterested to join power as doing so would strip them of the power they wield today. The\nmiddle and junior leaders in Taliban have already formed their own little empires in\nAfghanistan and are not supporting the senior leaders in peace talks for the same reason.\nHamid Karzai was the first person to understand that if Taliban is not taken on board for\ntalks, then the fate and future of Afghanistan is very bleak. But, as seen, there is no unity\nin Taliban for talks. There is a belief that many junior and middle level leaders and cadres\nof Taliban have started deflecting towards ISIS which is striving to create its own version\nof a franchise in Afghanistan. Pakistan since 1970’s feels that it can have a deep say in the\naffairs of Afghanistan but the Pakistani ISI and the military lack the capabilities for such\nstrategic ambitions. Thus, India will play a larger role in Afghanistan in the future.\nAnyday, the Taliban will listen more to India than Pakistan because the Taliban is\nideologically tilted towards Deobandi school of Islam and India is not only the birthplace\nof Deobandi Islam but also has a good rapport with the Deobandi leaders. The\nQuadrilateral Coordination Group (USA, China, Pakistan and Afghanistan) has become a\nnew Concert of Powers group striving for a peaceful and a stable Afghanistan."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

India’s\ndiplomatic energy in Afghanistan is invested primarily in enhancing its own interests in\nAfghanistan.\n\nIndia’s first and most important interest in Afghanistan is to ensure that Pakistan does\nnot gain an edge within governing structures of Afghanistan. India feels that if Pakistan\nsucceeds in installing Taliban or a Taliban-sponsored regime in Afghanistan, it will be\ndetrimental to the cause of the regional security of India. On the other hand, Pakistan feels\nthat India should not be allowed to get a hold on Afghanistan and perceives any growing\nIndo—Afghan proximity as an attempt by India to counter Pakistan by maintaining its\npresence in Afghanistan. Each has tried neutralising the other’s influence in governance\nand management of Afghanistan, leading to a classic security dilemma where any measure\nby one elicits a counter response from other. Pakistani military has long supported\nTalibani elements and helped them flourish near the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan\nand continues to believe that the presence of the Taliban in Afghanistan would be the most\neffective way to undercut Indian influence in Afghanistan.\n\nPakistan continues to maintain strategic depth in Afghanistan and certainly favours\nless Indian proximity to Afghanistan. As Karzai rose to power in Afghanistan in the post-\n2001 period, India decided to deepen its engagement with Afghanistan by opening\nconsulates in Herat, Mazar-e-sharif, Kandahar and Jalalabad. Pakistan alleges that India\nuses these consulates to contain Pakistan as these consulates give Indian agencies an\naccess to gather intelligence from across the border. Pakistan also alleges that India\nprovides assistance to Baluchistani rebels through these consulates. Pakistan has also tried\nto limit India from undertaking commerce with Afghanistan by refusing to allow transit\nrights over Pakistan to reach Afghanistan. India has used the alternative route of Iran to\nreach Afghanistan. As Indian developmental activities continue in Afghanistan, India has\nrealised the need to protect its Border Road Organisation personnel by using the Indo—\nTibetan Border Police which is stationed in Afghanistan.\n\nDespite all tactics adopted by Pakistan to keep India out of Afghanistan, India\ncontinues to deepen its ties with the region by engaging with Afghanistan. Apart from\nensuring that the region does not fall into the orbit of Pakistan giving it leverage against\nIndia, another crucial policy determinant of India in Afghanistan is to ensure zero\nspillover of extremists to India. India has been a victim of state sponsored terrorism from\nPakistan and engages with Afghanistan to ensure no spillover of extremism or Islamic\nradicalism happens in India. If Pakistan succeeds in helping the Taliban establish a footing\nin Afghanistan, this would enable Pakistan to train extremists and militants in the\nuncontrolled Taliban region and use them against India and more specifically, against\nKashmir. In fact, at present, the extremists fighting in Kashmir owe their patronage mostly\nto Pakistan’s ISI and have drawn inspiration from the resistance offered by Afghan\nmujahideen against the Soviets during the Cold War. India was under the impression that\nafter 9/11, the US would put pressure on Pakistan to dismantle the Jihadi networks that\noperate from Pakistan, considering that India too had been a victim of terrorism emanating\nfrom Pakistani soil. However, a reluctant approach by Islamabad to clamp down on the\nJihadi cells in their territory has given the Jihadis the needed space for growth. Pakistan\neven continues to use Jihad as a part of its grand strategy as it gives them the power to\ninfluence the region."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

India\nestablished a base at Ayni in Tajikistan, which was used to assist the Northern Alliance\nduring the Taliban regime. In the Afghan chessboard, Iran seems to be a crucial player for\nmany reasons. Firstly, Iran favours engagement with Afghanistan to assert its regional\npower. Iran certainly does not want Pakistan to deepen its roots in Afghanistan as Iran sees\nPakistan as a Saudi Arabian ally. Iran is a Shia nation while Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are\nSunni nations. It’s the sectarian divide that configures the Iranian perspective of Pakistan.\nAt the same time, Pakistan is also intensely uncomfortable with the India—Iran—\nAfghanistan axis that has every possibility of emerging. India is deepening its proximity\nwith Iran to reach Central Asia. India is developing the Chabahar port of Iran for this\npurpose. As the geopolitical influence of CA in the region increases, more and more\nplayers would be involved. The US is not keen to witness greater Chinese and Russian\nproximity in CA while China and Russia use Shanghai Cooperation Organisation to keep\nthe US influence under control in CA. The US favours deeper Indian engagement in CA as\nthis will counter growing Chinese influence. As USA-Iran ties have improved, the US\nfavours an Indo-Iranian foray into CA to contain Chinese influence in the region. As the\nUS began to withdraw its troops in 2014, it started cooperating with Russia. It was a\ndiplomatic masterstroke as it gave a stabilising effect in the region. Russia opened up its\nairspace for the US to transport its troops and supplies and this served Indian interests as\ncooperation between US and Russian decreases the significance of Pakistan, which in turn\nsuits India.\n\nIndia’s post-2001 engagement has to be also seen in a different context. India, today,\nsuccessfully uses Afghanistan as classic case to assert its regional hegemony. As India’s\neconomic and military profiles grow, India would be trying to use Afghanistan to establish\nits own credentials as a regional security provider and a regional stabiliser. India knows\nthat its ability to emerge as a great power in the near future hinges upon its strategic\ncapacity exercised in dealing with its own region.

The subsequent period saw a steady decline of the\nIndian presence in Afghanistan. But all this did not demotivate India to the extent where it\nthought of retreating completely.\n\nIn fact, India stayed back and decided to chart out an independent strategy. To\npreserve its interest in the changing strategic landscape of Afghanistan and because of the\ncommitment of NATO forces to withdraw, India stepped up its decision to provide training\nto the ANSF. It began to rework its engagement with Russia and Iran and also made a\nstrong attempt to reach out to various sections of the Afghan society. Indian cooperation\nwith Russia and Iran is important in context of the period of renewed efforts as none of\nthem favour Sunni dominance in Afghanistan and are committed, for the benefit of India,\nto keep out Pakistan.\n\nIn 2011, India and Afghanistan concluded a Strategic Partnership Agreement (SPA).\nThe idea was now to use the SPA to regain the lost strategic space.\n\nMinerals\nDefence cooperation\nequipment supply f Cooperation in security\n4 | wt and law enforcement\n\n_» Fight international terrorism\n\nieee ear ultume —» Organised crime\nStrategic partnership\nIncreased training agreement ~—* Illegal trafficking in narcotics\n\nt defence level ~ ‘\n. “™* Hydrocarbons cooperation\n\n* Money laundering\n\n}\n\nEnhance Afghan\ndefence capabilities"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

However, till the time Pakistan does not stop sponsoring Taliban and halt\ncultivating anti-Afghanistan forces, the situation will be fragile. Pakistan wants to use\nAfghanistan to maintain strategic depth against India and till the time it does not do away\nwith this policy, it will remain a stumbling block to regional peace. Turkey, in 2010,\norganised a conference on the future of Afghanistan. This led many to speculate about the\nrole of Turkey vis-a-vis Afghanistan. The Turkish foreign policy establishment feels the\nurge to revive the Ottoman empire and Turkey is looking at finding a suitable diplomatic\nspace in the region to increase its influence. Although Russia has, as stated in previous\nsubsections, allowed the withdrawal of NATO troops through the Northern Distribution\nNetwork routes, it certainly favours less of US presence in the region.\n\nAs far as China is concerned, it is not comfortable with US military presence in the\nregion. China is an aggressive player in Central Asia and as it creates a resource-centric\npolicy to garner resources from Central Asia, it would favour a stable Afghanistan. China\n\ncertainly favours the absence of Taliban in Afghanistan and is cooperating with the US\nand Pakistan in the negotiations with the good Taliban. China knows that the presence of a\nforce like the Taliban in Afghanistan can act as a springboard for extremism in Xinjiang\nand revive Uyghur militancy. However, due to its all-weather friendship with Pakistan, it\nprefers not putting pressure on Pakistan to dismantle terrorist networks as it knows that if\nPakistan maintains strategic depth against India in Afghanistan, it will weaken India in\nAfghanistan and subsequently Central Asia. This would indeed be favourable to China as\nit would then not fear Indian competition with respect to the resources of Central Asia. On\nthe other hand, the US favours more Indian presence in Central Asia to counter China and\nkeep a check on the growing dominance by China in central Asia.\n\nRussia is concerned with rising ISIS presence in Central Asia and it feels that ISIS\nand Taliban can use Central Asia as a base to target Russia. Russia feels it could be\ntargeted by the ISIS and Taliban duo due to its support to the Shia Iran and Syria. Russia\nfeels that an anti Russia coalition could be created by the Sunni groups like ISIS and\nTaliban. Russia feels that ISIS and Taliban could use narcotics trade from Central Asia to\nweaken Russia. This has compelled Russia to be an important stakeholder in Afghanistan\nand is negotiating with Taliban. Iran feels that ISIS and Taliban can create troubles for Iran\nin the Eastern fringes where Iran has a border with Afghanistan. Also Iran fears that in the\nlong run if Afghanistan becomes unstable, it could lead to a refugee influx from\nAfghanistan to Iran. Keeping these threats in mind, Iran is also trying to offer refuge to\nTaliban and is harbouring a breakaway faction of Taliban (breakaway from Mansoor\nfaction) led by Mullah Zakir. The future of Afghanistan depends upon the commitment of\nUS in the peace process. Obama had given China a leadership role in Afghanistan but the\nTrump Administration has asserted that it will not allow China to flex its muscles in\nAfghanistan where it has spent tremendous resources. Trump Administration has\ncomplicated the entire situation due to difference in perception. During the Obama\nadministration, US and Russia were of the view that Taliban is a part of the solution and\nthereby focussed on integrating Taliban to the mainstream. But, now the Trump\nAdministration has conveyed that Taliban is a part of the problem and not the solution\nwhile Russia continues to feel that Taliban is a part of the solution. Thus, this difference in\ninterpretation of Taliban has put Taliban and Russia on a divergent path. This new\ninterpretation of US has put it on a similar path advocated by India because India since the\nbeginning has asserted that Taliban is a part of the problem and not the solution. This is\nlikely to manifest as a new phase of Indo-US cooperation in the future of Afghanistan."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

An analysis of Afghani history clearly tells us that most of the regional and\nglobal actors have used Afghanistan and have ensured that it perpetually remains in a state\nof instability. The situation has assumed a new sense of urgency after the departure of the\nNATO troops in 2014. It is in this context—to manage the transition—that the role of\nregional players has assumed significance. When Ashraf Ghani assumed office as the\nAfghan President in September 2014, he spent the initial few months in improving ties\nwith Pakistan. He expanded his engagement with the military set up of Pakistan. Ashraf\nGhani’s engagement with Pakistan was based on the logic that Pakistan is the key to\nengagement with the Taliban.\n\nEven the US wanted an engagement of Afghanistan with the Taliban. But since 2014,\nPakistan’s ISI has been using Taliban to instigate violence in Afghanistan. After giving\nenough time to Pakistan to mend ways, Ghani finally understood that courting Pakistan\nwould yield little or no result. In a joint session of the Afghanistan Parliament in April\n2016, Ghani threatened to drag Pakistan to the United Nations (UN) for inciting violence\nin Afghanistan. After the death of Mullah Qmar of Taliban, his successor Mullah Mansor\nwas also killed by the US in a drone strike in Baluchistan. It is in this context that regional\ncooperation has emerged as a viable model for ensuring stability in Afghanistan. However,\nthe goal of envisaging regional cooperation remains a distant one due to regional power\nstruggles.\n\nTurkey hopes to use Afghanistan Iran favours less US presence and wants\nto revive Ottoman empire » US out of the region\n\n... Russia wants stable Afghanistan which\nis not a source of Islamic instability\n\nQatar wants to host Taliban to shed off eal .\nthe tag of a GCC player and assert its “ ™ Soe 9 Stan Wer Righaréstan vaeput thing\nReap AE nin ey towards political investment\n\nChina has mostly undertaken economic investments in Afghanistan while following a\nhands free approach at the political level. At the economic level, it has made its presence\nfelt in the Mes Aynak copper mine project where it intends to extract copper to the tune of\n100 billion dollars. It was in September 2012 that China decided to end the policy of\nmasterly inactivity. It decided to engage with Pakistan to ensure reconciliation with the\nTaliban. It also decided to train Afghan forces and police.\n\nChina has been concerned about the security situation post the withdrawal of the US\ntroops. China is of the opinion that the Taliban should not be allowed to re-establish\ncontrol in Afghanistan as they could lead to a spark of insurgency in Xinjiang province\namongst the Uyghur. China has become all the more cautious about the role Pakistan\nwould play in the future as rumours of Pakistan training the Uyghurs have surfaced.\n\nThe coming of Modi government in India has also led to a shift in India’s Afghan\nPolicy. India, under its new regime, has communicated to Afghanistan that it will favour a\n\nstrong and prosperous Afghanistan and would remain committed to the development of\nAfghanistan even after US troops withdraw. In fact, India has expanded its security profile\nin Afghanistan and provided military jeeps and four Mi-25 attack helicopters. India has\nunderstood that it has to fight its own battle in Afghanistan and cannot rely on US for\nsolutions. India still asserts that the root cause of the trouble in Afghanistan is Pakistan’s\nincitement and sheltering of the Taliban whereas China refuses to accept the Indian view.\nThus, both China and India have different perceptions on how the future transition of\nAfghanistan should be managed. Since 2012, another unique situation witnessed in the\nregion is the renewed relationship of Russia and Pakistan. Russia, since 2012, has\nprofessed a new interest in Pakistan, which has manifested in the form of multiple high\nlevel bilateral visits and a defence exercise between the two in 2016. Russia is expanding\nits alignments in Asia and Pakistan has assumed a central position in the Russian foreign\npolicy. However, whatever be the shape of the Russia—Pakistan relationship, Russia can\nnever replace the US when it comes to defence aid to Pakistan.\n\nIndia and Iran are also deepening their engagement primarily to reach out to\nAfghanistan and Central Asia without going to Pakistan. Any Indo-Iranian cooperation\nthat is undertaken is perceived by Pakistan as an attempt to encircle it. Though Pakistan\nand Iran have also tried to improve their ties, yet nothing concrete on ground has so far\nbeen achieved. When the US announced that it would withdraw its troops from\nAfghanistan starting 2014, it generated more apprehensions in Iran. This was because of\nthe departure of the US would automatically mean more leverage to Pakistan in the region.\nSince 2014, Pakistan too has been at the forefront along with Afghanistan and China,\ninitiating a dialogue between Afghanistan and the Taliban. As negotiations happen, it\ngives Pakistan a new influence in the region. This is not appreciated by Iran as it\nundermines the Iranian influence in the region outright. Thus, there is a possibility that\nIran may revive support to proxies (the Shia Hazrana Community in Afghanistan) to\nundermine Pakistan. The present US President Donald Trump has already conveyed his\ndispleasure with the US-Iran nuclear deal. This may compel Iran to further ignite the\nregional rivalry again. It is in this context that India’s soft power attributes can help\nstabilise Afghanistan. The recognition by Ashraf Ghani of the fact that India is a credible\nplayer has brought India back into the Afghan calculus. Since India has invested around\ntwo billion Dollars in Afghanistan, this has helped India to generate tremendous goodwill\nin the country. India has also decided to address the feeling of neglect amongst the\nminorities in the provinces of North Afghanistan by undertaking investment in the area.\nHow India will manage the instability in Afghanistan in future will finally determine the\nrise of India as a global player. Afghanistan, in this context, is a litmus test for India."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Sailors\nfrom India sailed in South East monsoonal winds to reach Africa (from June to\nSeptember) and used the North Eastern monsoonal winds (from December to March) to\nsail back. In the ancient times, India had developed considerable marine and naval\ntechnologies. Reference of maritime strength of India is found in the Rig Veda. A glimpse\nof India’s natural convergence with West Asia and Africa is found in a guide book for\nsailors called the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, a Greco-Roman text attributed to\ndifferent dates between the 1* and 3\" centuries BCE, which aptly summaries India’s\nancient sea links with Zenj Coast and Egypt. During ancient sea trade, Indians used to\ntrade rice and wheat cloth with incense, palm oil, ivory and gold from Africa. The sea\ntrade with East African Coast also facilitated the movement of Indian traders into south\nand central African territories. Due to the flourishing trade, a lot of Indians also began to\nmigrate to Africa. At any point of time in Africa, we had some form of Indian presence. In\n1497, when Vasco de Gama reached Malindi, he also noted the presence of Indians in\nMombasa/Khilwa etc. If the ancient time was marked by trade, it opened up people-to-\npeople contacts, which, in medieval times, saw one of its manifestations during the\nMughal rule when Africans were placed in the Mughal army and they were mainly the\nSiddis (people who are descendents of Bantu tribes). They were also found in the army of\nMohamed Bin Qasim.\n\nAfter the commencement of the imperial age in Europe, Africa became a colonial\nbattleground. The British, French and Portuguese were the leaders in this race for\n\ncolonisation. The 17\" century period saw slave trade beginning in Africa. Slaves were\ntaken from Africa along with resources to sustain the Industrial Revolution back home in\nEurope. The presence of European powers in Africa also created more opportunities in\nAfrica. For examples, as the French colonised Mauritius and Reunion, there was a need of\nmasons, blacksmiths and carpenters and so on. Perceiving these as opportunities, the\nIndian traders in Africa also brought skilled persons who fit the job descriptions from\nvarious parts of the west coast of India. A lot of Indians began to settle down to these jobs\nin Mauritius, Reunion and other East African States. Gradually, the British also emerged\non the African scene. In 1833, slavery was abolished in Britain. After this, a new system\ncalled indentured labour system, was evolved. The British now brought bonded labour\nfrom India to work on sugar plantations and cotton plantations. Bonded labour from India\nalso worked on railway establishment in Africa. Free passengers were those people who\nhad money, were willing you pay for transport to Africa and were driven by the spirit of\nentrepreneurship.\n\nThus, during this time also we see a continued link with Africa which had begun with\nancient time maritime trade.\n\nThe following diagram represents the ancient sea trade and movement of Indians in\nEast Africa:\n\n= | » East Africa: Ancient sea trade and movement of\nIndians in East Africa\n\na Medieval times trade and Africans in Mughal army\n\n“HH » Well established coastal diaspora from India on\neast coast contributed even by British indentured\nlabour system\nDuring British colonial rule in India, three important actors in our relation with\n\nAfrica were Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and the Indian National Congress. The\nCongress, since its inception, showed support to and solidarity with the African cause. In\n1890, the British sent Indian soldiers to fight to Sudan—a move that the Indian National\nCongress opposed vehemently as Indian soldiers in Sudan and Ethiopia did not fight for\nany cause that ultimately had any benefit for India. Rather, they were used by the British\nto suppress the natives. In 1893, Gandhi went on an assignment to Africa. During his\nstudy in Africa, he witnessed severe racial discrimination. During his stay in Africa till\n1913-14, he evolved and practised the concept of Satyagraha, which eventually emerged\nas a technique of mass mobilisation. The success of Satyagraha in Africa affirmed its\nutility as a tool of non-violence and it went on to be later used as one of the core tools of\nIndian National Movement.\n\nDuring early 20th century, when the Indian National Movement gained momentum,\nIndia did not lose touch with Africa. India always felt that Africa, like India, had also been\na victim of imperialism and that India needed to assist Africa in its fight against imperial\npowers. In 1927, the Indian National Congress (INC), at its Calcutta session, took a\ndecision to open offices overseas. Offices by INC were opened in Africa to assist\nAfricans. In 1927, Nehru had already participated in the Brussels Conference of oppressed\nNationalities and had advanced an idea of India being a kingpin in the process of\n\nliberating the world from imperial powers. The conference moulded our foreign policy\nthought from 1928 onwards as far as Africa was concerned—we began to link our\nfreedom struggle with the imperial struggle of Africa. India evolved a thought that its own\nfreedom struggle and Africa’s struggle against imperial powers as well as its fight against\napartheid was in natural continuation with the idea of one world, free of imperialism and\noppression. This Afro—Asian solidarity also moulded our foreign policy which after\nindependence emerged as the policy of Non Alignment.\n\nThe first phase of India’s relations with African nations from 1950s to 1970s was a\nperiod marked by tremendous improvement. Indian policy with regard to Africa evolved\nin support of African independence. India assisted the process of decolonisation in Africa.\nIndia’s success in having attained independence through peaceful and non-violent\nmechanisms also encouraged the Africans to look for support from India. The legacy of\nGandhi in Africa and his experimentation of Satyagraha and its resultant success for India\nstrengthened this bond. Nehru played a critical role in fostering close ties and gave open\nsupport to Africans against colonisation. Moreover, Africa was also one part of the world\nwhich had not fallen into the ideological divisions occasioned by the Cold War, and\nbecame, for India, a region to assert power politics through NAM."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

In 1946, South Africa came out with a Ghetto Act which aimed to aggregate\nresistant colonies in South Africa as per racial differences. This move irked India,\nand in 1946 itself, the interim Prime Minister of India, Nehru, took up the issue of the\nGhetto Act in the UN by invoking article 10 and 14 of the UN Charter. Despite\nflourishing trade, India decided to cut ties with South Africa after its insistence on\nmaintaining status quo.

Thus, Indian policy in Africa introduced anti-racialism as a new\ntool along with anti-colonialism and anti-imperialism. India taking up the fight against\napartheid in the UN in 1964 also resonated well amongst Africans, all the while India’s\nintense and sole focus being on non-violent modes of protest.\n\nIndia advanced support to Africa against colonialism but it did not insist on fixing a\ndate to end colonialism in Africa. This upset many African leaders as they deemed that\nIndia may not be serious about supporting the African struggle against colonialism. Things\nbegan to change for India domestically after the 1962 war. Firstly, after the war, India\nbecame busier to counter an aggressive China at every forum. In contrast to the precepts\nof non-violence championed by India, China, on the other hand, preached armed struggle\namongst Africans. This appealed more to some African leaders who were not happy with\nthe results that the slow approach advocated by India brought about. For instance, Algeria,\na French Colony in Africa, resorted to an armed struggle against France. Due to all these\nreasons, support for India gradually began to decline amongst the African nations. The\ndecline was visible prominently after the death of Nehru. Support for China began to grow\nand China began to make inroads into the African territory.

India always had close relations with this part of the continent. Nehru\nwanted to support East Africa against colonialism and sent his trusted aide, Apa\nSaheb Bala Saheb Pant, a respected Gandhian, writer, freedom fighter and diplomat,\nas India’s ambassador to East Africa. His home had become a nerve centre for all\nefforts coordinated against colonialism. The British were alarmed upon seeing this.\nThey pressurised Nehru to recall Apa Saheb Pant. Nehru was forced to recall Pant,\nleaving the East Africans disillusioned. This again created a strain on India’s relations\nwith East Africa.\n\nThe next phase (1970’s to 1990’s) began with India opening its relations with Africa\ndue to its historical connect, bolstered by a common colonial legacy. However certain\ncircumstances and issues ended up in creating a strain for India’s relationship.\n\nThe decline in Indian popularity encouraged China to make inroads. As the African\ndecolonisation was completed, the African nations were looking for a role model for\ndevelopment. India made strategies to regain the lost path, using NAM as a tool to rework\nits relationship with Africa. To seize the new opportunity in Africa, from 1970s, NAM\nbecame economy-oriented and India was in a place where it could flex its muscle because\ndomestically things were in better order. The Green Revolution had succeeded in\nimproving the food security situation. A military conflict with Pakistan succeeded in\nIndia’s favour in 1971. India, then, decided to become economically assertive in Africa.\nThe most important policy, however, was with respect to the Indian diaspora. During the\nNehruvian era, Nehru insisted that the diaspora of India in Africa should place interests of\nthe host nations they reside in over and above their own interests. More so, due to strategic\nconcerns of the NAM, India gave less preference to the needs of the diaspora at that time.\n\nQ\n“\n\nDuring the second phase of reconnect (1970s till the end of the Cold War), the\nimportance of the Indian diaspora increased. The success of India’s Peaceful Nuclear\nExplosion in 1974 also contributed to the rise of India’s international image from 1970s.\nIndia began to use NAM Summits to economically integrate diplomacy with Africa and\nfocussed on strengthening the South-South Cooperation (SSC). In 1970, at the NAM\nConference in Lusaka, India outlined its new approach for Africa. India encouraged Africa\nto undertake vigorous domestic growth and pledged technological and economic support\nin this endeavour to strengthen the idea of SSC. India encouraged its Heads of Missions in\nAfrica to focus on economic assistance to Africa and told the diplomats to promote\neconomic engagement. A special role for the diaspora was envisaged in this by the new\nrelationship as Indira Gandhi called upon the Indian Diaspora to act as ambassadors of\nIndia."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The\ntime that the Cold War ended was also the time when Indian economy made a transition to\nan open economy. To sustain the open economy, India needed oil, which it already had\nfrom its supply from the Middle East. Over a period of time, as India diversified its import\nbasket, Africa came in the picture. India began to forge oil based relations in Africa for\nenergy security. India intends to obtain ownership in oil blocks in Africa. This strategy of\ngoing for equity oil is any day better than buying oil from open spot market because\nownership in an oil block gives India a very deep exposure of the African markets. For\nIndia, Africa is a rising continent and offers multiple opportunities for our private sector,\nwhich can help bring India and Africa closer to each other. The location of Africa is\nstrategic as it helps India to connect to Central and South Americas through the Cape of\nGood Hope and to West Asia through the African Maghreb.\n\nThere are many drivers to India’s Africa Policy. First, we need to understand that\nIndia’s intention is not only limited to harnessing African resources but goes much\nbeyond. India has always kept it clear that due to our historical relations with Africa, it is\nin our interests to assist the entire African block in overall development. While assisting\nthe African development process, India does not follow the white man’s burden approach,\nbut rather intends to share its own knowledge and developmental experiences with Africa\n\nfor the mutual benefit of both. Since the time of Nehru till the present, India has initiated\nmultiple programmes in its bid to aid to African development. A brief mention of the\nprogrammes will ease our understanding of India’s foreign policy towards Africa.\n\n(1) LT.E.C programme: The acronym stands for Indian Technical and Economic\nCooperation. The Nehruvian foreign policy envisaged the idea of ‘one world,’ which\nenvisaged an interdependent world where countries cooperate in socio-economic and\ndevelopment well-being. After independence, India received tremendous assistance\nfrom international agencies and forums (for example India played an important role\nin UNCTAD) in its developmental endeavour. India thereby reached an\nunderstanding that it would be important for India to share the development lessons\nand its experiences with other nations. Nehru had this dream of ensuring that other\ndeveloping countries learn from India’s own learning. This envisaged India to\nposition itself as a trainer for the developmental need of other Third World Countries\n(TWC).\n\nConsultancy services _ ~~ Skill training\nPosting of experts > » Defence training\nabroad for assistance J\n‘Scholarship to countries ~ Training of civil servants\nfor student exchanges\n‘Special Commonwealth\n_» Assistance for Africa Programme\n(SCAAP)\nTraining related to\n\nSkill, vocational, defence, ~~\n\ncivil servants, consultancy\neRe PME * Technical cooperation scheme\nof Colombo plan\n\nKeeping this in mind, on 15th September 1964, India launched this bilateral\ninitiative for Africa called ITEC. India envisaged giving training to other countries\nfor their overall development. For Africa, ITEC had two parts. As of now, ITEC as a\nprogramme continues to be one of the most important diplomatic tools for India\nabroad. Second, ITEC is now multilateral in nature and is linked to initiatives under\nthe ASEAN. Third, the ITECis managed by the Development Partnership\nAdministration Division, a division in the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA).\n\n(2) South-South Cooperation (SSC): We have already mentioned SSC and India’s\neconomic diplomacy earlier. Let us develop an insight on SSC in this section, as it\nstands slightly outside the purview of economic diplomacy. The origin of SSC goes\nback to Bandung Conference in 1955. In the conference, the African nations decided\nto initiate a partnership with each other at the development level. Since 1961, this\npartnership became a part of the NAM. Initially it had two components, namely,\ntechnical cooperation amongst developing countries and economic cooperation\namongst developing countries. The idea was that the participating countries shall\nundertake developmental cooperation which would involve multiple stakeholders\nincluding national governments, civil societies, public-private partnerships and\nindividuals. It envisaged the sharing of knowledge, developmental experiences,\ntechnical assistance and so forth. India always believed that North-South\n\nCooperation is important and it would act as a supplement to South-South\nCooperation. India approached SSC without any conditionality, and with full respect\nfor the sovereignty of the other participating countries. In contrast, economic\ndiplomacy is an economic engagement by countries for self-benefit through trade. In\nfact, SSC is also different from North-South Cooperation as SSC is a demand-driven,\nvoluntary, horizontal programme with no conditions attached. In the 21st century,\nIndia, under SSC, promotes sustainable development, inclusive growth, infrastructure\nand energy as goals. India assists Africa in SSC in all the parameters above.\n\nP Multi stakeholder approach\n\nBased on equality\n\n‘Agenda based cooperation\n\nHalimark of Indian foreign policy\nContemporary relevance in the 21% century\n\n(3) Pan Africa e-Network Project: Since 1990s, India has made tremendous\nprogress in providing education and health in remote areas through developments in\nthe ICT. In 2004, APJ Abdul Kalam, while addressing the Pan African Parliament,\nenvisioned satellite based connectivity with all African nations to assist them in\nhealth and education. The Indian government used the idea to initiate Pan Africa e-\nNetwork Project. The government established a huge network to provide services in\nconsultations with Telecom Consultants India limited. The project was officially\ninaugurated in 2010.\n\nE-commerce Tele-education\nInfotainment Tele-medicine\nMineral mapping e-governance\nMetrological\nservices\n\n(4) TEAM-9 Initiative: In 2004, the Indian government launched the Techno-\nEconomic Approach for Africa India Movement. This is a regional initiative\nexclusively meant for eight West African States. India feels the need to establish a\nconnect with West Africa as it’s a resource-rich region. India, through TEAM-9,\nintends to help development in this resource-rich but underdeveloped region with\nassistance for infrastructure and low-cost technology. The aim here is to provide\nassistance to specific projects and give a thrust to the private sector of India so as to\npromote trade. India has earmarked 500 million dollars line of credit here. The West\nAfrican region does not have large Indian diaspora but the Gulf of Guinea is certainly\na new hotspot of oil in Africa.\n\n(5) India—Africa Forum Summit (IAFS): Continental level engagements with\nAfrica is not new for India. The origin of such interactions go back to 1993, when\nJapan initiated the first ever Tokyo International Conference on African Development\n(TICAD). This was followed by China initiating the Forum on China—Africa\nCooperation (FOCAC). On similar lines, to open up continental level engagement,\nIndia launched its first ever IAFS in 2008 in New Delhi. The forum concluded with\nthe New Delhi Declaration which reaffirmed the shared vision of vibrancy and\nresurgence in India—Africa relations. The declaration set an agenda for India and\nAfrica to collaborate on sustainable development, climate change and UN reforms.\nSubsequently, a second such summit was organised in 2011. The second IAFS was\nheld in the Ethiopian Capital, Addis Ababa in 2011. The Addis Ababa Declaration\nadopted anew cooperative framework based on capacity building, peace and security.\nIndia envisaged the creation of institutions like the Indian Institute of Technology and\nthe Indian Institute of Foreign Trade in Africa. In the second IAFS, India also\ncommitted to creating a two-million-dollar fund for the African Union Mission in\nSomalia to curb piracy. The third IAFS was held from 25th to 28th October in 2015.\nThe third IAFS is unique in multiple aspects.\n\nThe first aspect is the issue of participation in the IAFS. This is because, in 2006,\nthe African Union (AU) in the city of Banjul (capital of Gambia)announced the\nBanjul Formula. According to the Banjul Formula, (adopted in 2006), India would\nextend an invitation to 15 African Head of the States to participate in the India-Africa\nForum Summit which would include five participating states of NEPAD (New\nEconomic Partnership for African Development—A programme of African Union to\nseek global support for the development of Africa) programme, 8 member states to\nbe identified from Regional Economic Communities of African Union and the\nChairperson of the African Union Commission. These 15 nations would participate in\nIAFS. In the First IAFS, there was a participation by 14 states, while in the Second\nIAFS, there were 11 states that participated. In IAFS-3, India decided to do away\nwith limited participation (as per the Banjul Formula) and invited all 54 Head of the\nStates from Africa. This was done because India had decided to launch the ‘Outreach\nto Africa Programme’ in the third session of the IAFS. Second, the IAFS—3 opened\nup on the cultural note. The opening ceremony of the summit saw India showcasing\nBhangra and Yoga. The two showcased India’s soft power export and asserted India’s\nemergence on the global scene and signified a resurgent Africa. For the first time in\nthe history succeeding the Cold War, India organised a successful event, hosting 54\nNations at one place. The [AFS-3 concluded with the Delhi Declaration — 2015,\nwhich articulated the India—Africa relationship as ‘Partners in Progress’ and pledged\nto work ‘towards a dynamic and transformative development agreement’. India\nofficially pledged support to the African Agenda 2063 and committed resources to\nAfrica to help achieve goals of the Agenda. India also announced 10 billion dollar\nline of credit for projects, along with thirty thousand scholarships. What also makes\nthe Delhi Declaration 2015 unique is that the areas in which Africa and India are\ngoing to collaborate were broadened to now incorporate solar technology, food\nsecurity, blue economy, rural housing, skull development, use of social networks to\nenhance people-to-people cooperation and sustainable development. Delhi\nDeclaration has also adopted a monitoring mechanism to implement the agendas\n\nenvisaged. They have also adopted the India—Africa framework for strategic\ncooperation. The next summit that is IAFS—4 is planned after 5 years (that is in\n2020)."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Due to the crises\nat the global level, the demand for oil has decreased. As the demand abroad declined,\n\nAfrican economies had also been affected. However, many African nations have used\nthe crises as opportunities. In order to ensure that domestic employment is not\naffected, many African nations have opened up sectors for cooperation with foreign\nplayers. It is with this regard that India stands to play a role. For instance, Kenya,\nGhana, Ivory Coast and other nations have decided to invite investments in small and\nmedium Enterprises, infrastructure, modernisation of agriculture and alternative\nenergy. All these sectors present umpteen opportunities for India. As learned\npreviously, India, in the third IAFS (2015) has committed assistance to Africa for\nsolar technology, food security, rural housing and skill development. Even at the\nbilateral level, with the visits of Indian President and Vice President to Namibia,\nIvory Coast, Ghana, and Tunisia, India has committed to continued support.\n\nIn order to promote trade, India has used instruments like lines of credit, Focus\nAfrica programme and Duty Free Trade Preference Systems. The CII and FICCI from\nIndia also play an important role in this regard. They regularly organise platforms in\nconsultation with African forums, giving India an opportunity to leverage its private\nsector. The private sector appropriately uses these forums to create business in Africa. A\nbrief mention here of the Duty Free Quota Free (DF QF) market access; the Focus Africa\nProgramme and Indian firms in Africa will aid our understanding.\n\nThe Doha round of negotiations in 2001 for the first time envisaged DFQF market\naccess to Least Developed Countries (LDC). It was only in 2005, in the Ministerial\nConference (of WTO) in Hong Kong, that the decision was taken that the developed\ncountries would be allowed to undertake DFQF market access to LDCs. On the sidelines\nof the first IAFS in 2008, India went on to formally initiate Duty Free Trade Preference\nScheme (DFTPS), designed to boost bilateral trade. The scheme has got further impetus in\nits effort to boost trade after its modification in 2014. The measures by India have further\nstrengthened South-South cooperation.\n\nIn 2002-2003, India also launched its Focus Africa Programme (FAP). This\nprogramme is underway in select twenty-four African nations. Within this programme,\nheads of the Indian Missions in these 24 nations act as commercial sales agents.

Our aim in this part is to analyse\nChinese presence in Africa and scrutinise the Chinese approach in the continent.\n\nChinese presence in Africa goes back to the Cold War times. It was during Mao’s era\nthat the Chinese began to promote armed struggle in Africa against decolonisation, which\nappealed to many African states. This also gave China an opportunity to provide economic\naid for decolonised nations, thereby making inroads in these states. However, the Chinese\nengagement in Africa emerges aggressively after the end of Cold War. As Chinese\neconomy began to grow by the 1990s, it also began to search for resources. Africa, being a\nresource-rich region, was a natural choice for China. China also found Africa to be a\nfavourable market for its goods. In order to develop Africa as a sustained supplier of\nresources and a market for goods, China began to undertake creation of infrastructure in\nAfrica so that it gives China an easy route to transport resources back home. Apart from\nthis, China has been giving a lot of economic aid to Africa.\n\nHowever, many are dissatisfied with the aggressive Chinese resource-centric policy\ntowards African. The scholars assert that the Chinese model in Africa is based on its greed\nfor resources. A simple algorithm lies at the heart of its policy: China goes to an African\nnation, sets up industries and factories, exports Chinese labour to Africa, digs out\nresources from the nation, brings the resources back using infrastructure they have created\nto connect the industry to the port. De Soysa (a scholar) remarks that in this entire Chinese\nmodel, the African country does not stand to gain anything except very little pecuniary\nprofit in the form of taxation. The lives of ordinary Africans in that country do not change\nas the people receive no skill development from China so that they are absorbed in the\nindustry. This leads to a lot of disenchantment in the local people, leading ultimately to a\n\nkind of hatred against the Chinese presence. However, the state, instead of supporting the\npeople, supports the Chinese in their endeavours, ultimately becoming a rentier state. (A\nrentier state is a state which derives all or a substantial portion of its national revenues\nfrom the rent of indigenous resources to external clients.)This ultimately weakens\ninstitutional development in Africa.\n\nChina has, as per its ‘going out strategy,’ tried to link its domestic development to its\nglobal aspirations. The going out strategy is reflected well in Africa where China has\ndiplomatic relations with more than 48 African nations. The basic strategy is to give\nAfrica aid, and undertake trade and diplomacy to establish a market for goods. We also\nneed to remember that Africans have an inclination for China as, firstly, African states are\nmotivated by the Chinese state led economic development model that has made them a\nregional hegemonic power. They take pride in how China, under Deng Xiaoping, started\nfrom a scratch to reach where it is today. This state directed capitalism, despite China\nbeing a communist regime, has earned it respect in Africa.\n\nSecondly, the Africans to some extent are disillusioned with lack of development of\ntheir domestic economies despite proximate ties with West and Europe since a very long\ntime. But the most important connecting factor between Africa and China is how the\nAfricans are portrayed. The West has always been pessimistic about the future of Africa,\npartially due to deeply entrenched habits of racial profiling a feeling of racial superiority.\nFor example, in one of the covers of The Economist magazine, it went on to brand Africa\nas a hopeless continent. In contrast, China has always appreciated African dynamism,\nwinning a lot of confidence amongst Africans.\n\nThe Chinese model is unique in Africa in the sense that China allows poorly\nperforming corporates backhome to take up opportunities in Africa. If a corporate has not\nbeen performing well, the Chinese government would encourage that company to re-\nemerge and prove its worth by giving it support in exploring the African market. It has\nbeen seen that, with state support, these companies are able to re-emerge powerfully. This\nkind of an exercise also boosts the domestic corporate sector. The networking for\ncorporate sectors is enhanced further by interaction undertaken by China at the Forum for\nChina—Africa Cooperation (FOCAC).\n\nAll this gives China an opportunity to play a deeper role in Africa and gain the\nneeded diplomatic weight at international forums.\n\nFocus only on\nDee Historic infrastructure\nsian poly beneficial for self\n: # ‘\nExtends aid without Less regard for\nany conditions unlike ~ > » environment and\nWestern institutions labour standards.\n’ ’\n‘Non Flooding of African\ninterventionist markets with\ninferior goods"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Nigeria is a resource-rich country and is in possession of a lot of crude oil. India\ntoday imports anything between 8-12% of Nigerian crude oil. India exports to Nigeria\ncommodities like pharmacy products, rice and rubber while it imports oil, steel and\ncashew. Though, at the trade level there is an imbalance as India imports more (crude oil\nbeing the factor) than its exports, as the Nigerian economy has embarked upon a\nprogramme of diversification, the trade imbalance is likely to be rectified soon. Due to the\ndiversification of the Nigerian economy, tremendous scope for Indian investment in\ninfrastructure, and energy education, financial inclusion and poverty alleviation can be\nenvisaged. To encourage firms to take advantage of the diversification of Nigerian\neconomy, it has offered tax rebates and other benefits to various companies. A lot of\nIndian firms are already present in Nigeria. Bharti Airtel, Essar and Tata are some firms\ndoing good business. Bajaj has been exporting a lot of automobile units to Nigeria. In\nAugust, 2015, Indian High Commission in Nigeria organised a ‘Brand India’ exercise. A\nlot of Indian companies, like NIIT, Tata, Dabur, Ashok Leyland, and so on, used this\nforum to showcase their expertise in infrastructure and IT sectors.\n\nAs per R. Ghyanahyam, IFS and India’s High Commissioner to Nigeria, there is\nimmense trade potential between India and Nigeria, which can be significantly enhanced if\nboth nations try to guarantee investment protection. In 2017, at the 4th India—Africa\nHydrocarbon Conference in New Delhi, India had committed to double its oil imports for\nNigeria. Nigeria, in the recent times, has tried to modify its oil selling and contract\npolicies. Before this modification, the buyers of Nigerian oil had to purchase oil from spot\nmarkets. The problem of purchasing oil from spot markets was that it was vulnerable to\nprice shocks. Nigeria has now started encouraging term contracts. As per a term contract,\na fixed quantity of oil is to be supplied to contracting party at a stable price. Nigeria has\nalso decided to sell oil directly to oil suppliers. In this context of a modified policy\narchitecture, the Indian Oil Company (IOC) stands to gain as it had decided to agree for a\nterm contract import of three million tonnes per annum crude from Nigeria in 2016.\n\nEnergy security\n\nNigerian (crude oil import)\n\ndiversification\npolicy\n\nInfrastructure\nFuture potential Education and\nareas of collaboration student exchange\nFight against\npoverty exchange\n\nFuture Sectors for India—Nigeria Cooperation\n\nICT development: As a lot of Indian companies are in Nigeria, one area of potential\ncooperation is corporate learning, software development and value-added services.\nAs the demand for tele connectivity and internet grows in Nigeria, the Indian\ncorporate sector can enhance the ICT skills of Nigerian population in association with\ngovernment agencies. This will create a lot of goodwill for India in Nigeria.\n\nHealthcare: In Nigeria, healthcare is a neglected area. The Nigerian government has\nnot yet equipped Nigerian healthcare with the needed capacity. This provides an\nopportunity for India. More so, in Nigeria there is an attitude amongst people to give\npreference to anything which is foreign. This attitude is most visible in healthcare.\nEvery month, more than 5000 people on an average fly abroad for treatment. A lot of\nNigerians also come to India as treatments in India are cheaper than in the US and\nEurope. However, the lack of connectivity via direct flights between India and\nNigeria creates a difficulty in mobilisation of patients. Thus, two things can be done\nto leverage the opportunity. First, to take medical tourism to its full potential, we can\nenhance flight connectivity with daily, regular direct flights and secondly, encourage\nIndian hospitals to open up hospitals to cater to the market in Nigeria itself (for\ninstance, Apollo hospital has opened a hospital in Nigeria lately)."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

In 1977, a socialist leader, Albert Rene, gained\npower in Seychelles through a military coup. Since then, a lot of attempts of coup\nwere made in Seychelles to remove Albert Rene. A most embarrassing situation had\nemerged in 1981 when a South African secret service agent, Hick Hoare, had landed\nin Seychelles disguised as a businessman but his plan was unfolded the moment the\nsecurity agencies of Seychelles discovered huge cache of arms in his check-in\nbaggage. Hick Hoare hijacked an Air India plane AI-707 aircraft and flew to\nJohannesburg. Finally, to put an end to repeated coup attempts, Albert Rene decided\nto ask for help from India. In 1986, the R&AW station officer advised Albert Rene\nthat his own Defence Ministry Qgilvy was planning a coup. Albert Rene had a\ndialogue with the then Indian PM (Indira Gandhi) who handed over the matter to\n\nAdmiral RH Tahiliani and R&AW officials. In close conference between Indian navy\nand the R&AW, it was decided that India would dispatch INS Vindhyagiri to\nSeychelles to participate in the National Day celebrations of Seychelles. The plan\nwas that the moment INS Vindhyagiri would reach Seychelles, it would plant a\nrequest to increase its stay in Seychelles due to an engineering defect on board.\n\nThe operation was given its code name, ‘Flowers are blooming’. INS\nVindhyagiri reached Seychelles and reported the engineering defect and requested an\nincreased stay, which was subsequently granted. In the next 12 days, during the INS\nVindhyagiri’s stay in Seychelles, the deck of the ship was used for aggressive power\nprojections, conveying to the defence minister Qgilvy the clear consequences of a\ncoup. The 12-day presence achieved the objective and Qgilvy left Seychelles and a\ncoup was averted.

The history of CA is a testimony to this fact. The\nimportance of the region has been highlighted by the mighty empires of Genghis Khan,\nTimur Beg and Alexander of Macedonia. In the early Christian era, CA oversaw a\nmagnificent ancient Silk Route. This Silk Route connected the Far East with Europe Silk\nRoute and was dominated by the Chinese. The Chinese influence in the region began to\ndecline by 6th and 7th Century when Islam made inroads into CA from the Arab world.\nHowever, even with the Chinese influence in the region in the decline, silkworm\nagriculture in the Fergana Valley continued. Arabs took over the trade along the Silk\nRoute, Silk Route which now entered a new cultural arena. The region saw the rise of\npowerful Persian and Turkic empires. The cultural legacy of these two mega empires is\nvisible in the region till today.\n\nThe picture in the modern times is relatively different. In 18th and 19th century, the\nCA region witnessed annexation by the Tsar (monarch) of Russia. One reason why the\nTsar was worried about the regions in the south was because of the British Empire in\nIndia. The British in India had been very aggressively undertaking consolidation. The Tsar\nbecame concerned about the security of his own empire. Thus, for Russian Tsar, the most\nimmediate goal was to ensure that Afghanistan should not fall into the hands of the\nBritish. In order to ensure this, Russia began to consolidate its position in CA. In 1865,\nRussia completed the annexation of Tashkent city and by 1881, the Tsar had consolidated\nhis presence in trans-Caspian region. The competition between the Tsar and British was so\nintense that CA was actually transformed into a buffer by Russia to use against the British.\n\nMeanwhile, the British also became increasingly uncomfortable and insecure due to the\nTsar’s aggressive influence. The British perceived the expansionist agenda of Tsar as a\npotential future threat to their own empire in India. The British fought multiple Anglo—\nAfghan wars to establish control over Afghanistan. In the process, in the modern times,\nAfghanistan and CA both unwittingly became buffer states. The British carried out the\nestablishment of a boundary in Afghanistan to keep a check on Russian influence. This\nboundary, called the Wakhan corridor, created acted as buffer. This entire scenario of the\nAnglo-Russian rivalry in the region has been termed by historians as The Great Game of\nCA. Thus, the origin of the Great Game goes back to the 19th Century when the Russians\nadvanced to the region of CA and Caucasus, which was perceived by the British as a\nthreat. The British responded to resist the influence of Russia by establishing a huge\nnetwork of agents in the frontier areas to gather intelligence against the Russians. The\nBritish even tried to make Afghanistan a buffer state, though remained largely\nunsuccessful. The importance of CA for the British increased in 1904 when Harold\nMackinder published an article observing that if Russia is able to position itself in the\nEurasian heartland, it would gain power to pivot the region to emerge as a world power."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

This is so because the Soviet rule in CA saw Soviets investing heavily\ninto education and electricity in CA. The scholars have asserted that the Soviet\nrule in practice was a mixture of imperialism and state building. Francine\nHirsch in his study Empire of Nations asserts that Soviets did not follow the\nsimple divide and rule logic, as other imperial powers, in CA. The Soviets\nintroduced industrialisation of CA apart from applying colonial patterns for\ncotton and energy resources. Oksana Dmitrieva asserts that Soviet-CA\nrelationship is a unique case with no parallel in the world. The CA states were\naptly called as patrimonial states (Alexander Cooley) where Soviet maintained\nauthority by giving resources to regional and sub-regional informal institutions\n(like clan etc.). Such institutions worked so well that even when Gorbachev\nintroduced Glasnost and Perestroika, there were hardly any mass uprisings on\nthe ground. The end of the Cold War saw the CA states transform into now\nRepublics with authoritarian rulers. An immediate absence of interest of any\nGreat Power created new spaces for new ideas. The West led civil society\norganizations promoted pluralism and market economy while Saudi Arabia\ninitiated the spread of Wahhabism. CA eventually became a new space for\npropagation of religious agendas. As Russia struggled with its domestic issues, in\nthe post Cold War period, China focused its energies through Shanghai-5 to\nconclude the pending border disputes with CA. USA, though was interested in\npromoting NATO in the post-Soviet sphere, but, decided to refrain from the\n\nsame in CA. Despite all this, due to the deep entrenchment of Russia duris\nCold War; in the Post Cold War period, it still remained the major actor |\ndefault."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The states\nhave established complete authority over their media and domestic security structures to\nensure that there is no threat to the authority of the one party patrimonial rule. In all the\nCA states, the opposition is in exile and all threats to the authority are well conflated. Post\n9/11, CA became a new hub for the USA’s Global War on Terrorism (GWOT). USA\nconcluded fresh flying and refuelling agreements with CA. This gave the CA states new\nplatform to assert their authority by asserting their local rules. The CA states did cooperate\nwith USA but also asserted their dominance by limiting the influence of USA to seek\npolitical reforms domestically. The old Great Game got revived once again and was now\nplayed, post 9/11, between USA, China and Russia as new actors. Today CA is an area of\nhigh geopolitics as great powers try to buy local loyalties of CA states with an intention to\nblock their rivals to gain any geopolitical significance.\n\nBackground of India’s Relations with CA\n\nIndia’s relations with CA go back to the ancient times. A study of the site of Altyn-Depe, a\nBronze age site in Turkmenistan, also proves that Harappa did have interactions with CA\nas some artefacts of the late Harrapan stage were found at the site. In the 2nd century BC,\nAryans from CA began to migrate towards India, and took along with them domesticated\nbreeds of horses. During early ancient and medieval times, it was the Silk Route that\nconnected India with the region. The Silk Route had three branches—the north, south and\ncentral. It is the southern branch of the Silk Route that connected CA with India. Thus, the\nIndian subcontinent was connected with China on one side and to CA on the other side.\nFrom the first and second century BCE, we see the major tribal nomadic groups moving\nvia the Silk Route to reach India. Over a period of time, at later stages, through this route\ncame the Sakas, the Parthians and the Kushanas. The Kushanas established a very strong\nand unified kingdom under them, including large parts of the northern Indian territory. The\nKushanas also patronised Buddhism which not only flourished under their rule but also\nreached other territories like China and CA under their patronage. The cultural impact of\nBuddhism in the region can still be seen today. The ancient Silk Route thus contributed to\ncultural exchange and introduced varied elements of other cultures in the Indian\nsubcontinent.\n\nAggressive Trade in goods\n\neconomic trade ~_, Flow of ideas\n\nFlow of religious values\n\nIn Persia, during the medieval ages, the great Sasanian empire was the last empire to\nthrive before the rise of Islam. The trade on the Silk Route in the medieval times began to\ndecline. The Sasanian Empire continued its hostility towards the Romans, and thus, the\nfocus on trade dwindled away. During the medieval times, Islam gradually came to be\nfirmly rooted in CA. Islam also gradually began to trickle into India. This gradual\nmovement of Islam in India did provide an impetus to trade but it never quite reached the\nsame magnitude as that of the ancient times. Indians exported cotton, shawls, dyes and\nayurvedic medicine to the region while it imported horses, gold and dry fruits. This revival\nof trade also established a small segment of the Indian diaspora in CA during the medieval\ntimes. Towards the middle of the medieval period, maritime trade with Europe began. The\nEuropeans began to trade with the Far East. During this time period, the Muslims and\nPersians resorted to strengthening their control over land trade as Europeans began to\nconsolidate maritime trade."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The most visible contribution could be seen in the Kashmir\nregion. From ancient to medieval times, a lot of craftsmen migrated from CA to India\nand settled down in the region. The craftsmen began to practise embroidery and\nshared the technology with locals. Over a period of time, the Kashmir region gained\nprominence in making shawls. Even today, Kashmir continues to dominate shawl\ntrade in India. Irfan Habib, in his book A People’s History of India: Technology in\nMedieval India, C. 650-1750, also says that Noria, an ancient water wheel for\nirrigation which pumped water out of a river, came to India via the Silk Route.\n\nAs the Mughal Empire in India began to crumble, India slipped into the hands of the\nBritish. On the other hand, the CA region came under the influence of the Tsar of Russia.\nThe British and Russian rivalry led to the unfolding of the Great Game in three different\nphases. The Russian Tsar had an expansionist outlook but was also concerned about\nsimilarly aggressive British expansion in India. In order to keep the British influence in\ncheck, the Russian Tsar occupied Tashkent and Khantes. This alarmed the British as to the\nTsar’s intentions to expand to India, which led them to fight the Anglo Afghan wars. Thus,\nthe first phase of the Great Game oversees the formation of a buffer zone.\n\nThe second phase of the Great Game began from 1907 and continued till 1917. This\nwas the time when the buffer areas became grounds for espionage. Agents of Britain and\nRussia resorted to spying on each other’s territories to keep the adversary in check. In the\nthird phase, or the period after 1917, the Russians established a firm control over CA,\nwhich gave them access to the vast cotton lands of CA. This land was aggressively used\nby Russia for sustaining industrial revolution back home. An important thing to note here\nis that since the time of Tsar of Russia, Russia had gradually come to exert a strong\ncultural influence in the region. Russians brought along their language while settling in the\nregion and by the advent of modern times, Russian language had become ingrained in\nCentral Asian culture. After the World War-II, Russia or USSR divided the CA region into\nfive states (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan) on the\n\nbasis of ethnicity, with Moscow controlling the foreign policy of the five states. The\nUSSR did provide India access to CA in the times of the Cold War. India continued to\nengage with CA through cultural interaction. Indian television and music remained\npopular in CA during the cold war; however, due to India’s non—alignment policy, a very\ndeep relation between India and the Central Asian nations could not evolve.\n\nCold War = Non alignment policy _\nand cultural interaction » Ancient times = Silk route\nEp » Medieval times = Mughal rule\nModern times = Great game «~\nFlow of religious values\nAs the Cold War ended, India evolved a concentric circle approach to foreign policy,\nwhereby it first prioritised engagement with its immediate neighbourhood. At the second\nlevel came the extended neighbourhood and last came the great powers. As far as CA was\nconcerned, in the foreign policy pattern, it fitted in the arena of its extended\n\nneighbourhood. Thus, CA can be deemed as India’s extended neighbour with which India\nhas enjoyed historical and cultural ties.\n\nAs the Cold War ended, the five CA Republics gained independence from Russia,\ngiving them the needed strategic and autonomic space to explore relationships with other\ncountries independent of the Russian yoke. India, on the basis of its historical and cultural\nproximity to CA, now began making overtures again unlock potential alliances. India\nconcluded fresh diplomatic treaties with all the five CA Republics. During the Cold War,\nthe foreign policy of India in CA had been completely directed through the prism of\nUSSR. Finally, at the end of the Cold War, India found the opportunity to engage with the\nregional states one on one. Domestically, India made a transition from closed to open\neconomy, and also began to feel the need of acquiring resources for sustaining its own\neconomic growth. Thus, CA became all the more significant for India as the region was a\nhighly resource rich one.\n\nBut as the CA Republics had just gained independence, one of the foremost concern\nfor India was to ensure that the region should not get engulfed in any form of religious\nextremism. The threat of religious extremism in CA was very high. During the Cold War\nperiod, the USSR and the USA were both engaged in Afghanistan. The territory of\nAfghanistan saw rise of jihadi elements which were directed against the USSR to contain\ncommunism. As the USSR disintegrated, the monetary and arms support to jihadist\nelements was stopped. There was a high possibility of a spill over of these extremist\nelements into CA as a majority of the Central Asian states were Islamic. India feared that\nif CA were to be engulfed by this extremism, it would give Pakistan an edge in\nmaintaining strategic depth against India. Thus, India realised that not only it needed to\nrevive its relations with CA on the basis of historical and cultural linkages but also needed\nto ensure that the region did not become a security concern for India. India began to\nrealize that its own democracy, secular outlook, and its own multicultural polity are its\nassets which India can use for promotion in CA as the newly independent Central Asians\nwould look for some role models to emulate. Since CA was a cultural and a religious\nmosaic of multiple groups, India could use the modalities of democracy, secularism and\nmulticulturalism as core ideals for CA to take lessons from. In 1995, P V Narismha Rao\n\nvisited Turkmenistan and reiterated the common cultural legacy of the two nations to re-\nestablish relationships. In his visit to Turkmenistan, Rao unveiled India’s Look North\n\npolicy.\n\nMulticultural polity Secularism\n\nLook North\n\nPolicy Democracy\n\nIf India were to be able to promote these three goals, not only would it be able to\nreassert its cultural legacy and re-established its relationship with the Central Asian\nregion, but it would also be able to achieve three core goals.\n\ntd -» Get access to resources of the region\nRevive relations on the basis _\nof historical and cultural past =>\n™ Prevent the region to slip into extremism\n\nAs time progressed, the security situation in the CA region deteriorated. Afghanistan\nfell into the hands of the Taliban in 1996. Indian fears were exacerbated as Pakistan\nrecognised Taliban rule in Afghanistan. The extremism from Afghanistan also spilled over\ninto Tajikistan, which saw a civil war take place. From the Pakistani side, there was an\naggressive attempt to revive militancy in Kashmir in 1990s. Due to this instability, the\nimmediate neighbours in the region were adversely affected. As the Taliban took control\nof Afghanistan, India, Russia and Iran supported a group called the Northern Alliance.\nIndia built a hospital near the airbase of Farkhor in Tajikistan. The military hospital\nprovided medical assistance to the Northern Alliance. India also used the Ayni air base for\nthe purpose of providing humanitarian assistance and aid. In the process, India—Tajik\nsecurity co-operations strengthened over bilateral relations. However, as the region was in\nthe grip of extremist forces, assertion of Look North Policy goals became increasingly\ndifficult.\n\nIn 1999 India’s security vulnerabilities were woefully exposed when IC-814 was\nhijacked. The situation in the region changed after 9/11. The US invaded Afghanistan in\n2001 and Iraq in 2003. The US began to develop airbases and military logistic centres in\nCA for its global war on terror. India also realised the difficulty in the promotion of the\ngoals planned under the Look North Policy and began to understand that Look North\nPolicy could never be a successful policy to engage with CA. By this time, around 2000—\n2001, the Indian economy, which had made a transition from a closed to an open economy\na decade back had begun to bear fruit. India was in dire need of resources to propel its\neconomic growth. Thus began the search for Indian foreign policy tools which would help\nit look at CA in a different way."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The civil war in Tajikistan, the takeover of Afghanistan by Taliban, Pakistan\nsponsored militancy in Kashmir and support to Taliban were all noteworthy factors.\nHowever, many diplomats today agree, that apart from these reasons, India itself did\nnot aggressively prioritise this region at the end of the Cold War. When the Cold War\nended, the foremost priority of India was to improve relations with the US to fill the\nvacuum left by its past proximity to the erstwhile USSR. India also initiated the Look\nEast Policy where the majority of its focus was directed to its Eastern neighbours.\nIndia somehow not only neglected to give due attention to CA, but the deteriorating\nsecurity situation of CA also made India to think of CA from a purely security point\nof view than from the perspective of any economic significance. Thus, a mixture of\nall these factors made the implementation of Look North Policy weak.\n\nThe presence of US in the region had also changed the regional equalities. The\nTaliban was defeated by the US and extremism had at least been controlled to a great\nextent if not wiped out. India’s proximity to the US in mid 2000s opened up the way to the\nnuclear deal in 2005 and NSG-specific waiver for India in 2008 led to a new form of\nstrategic engagement. As the Indian economy began to show signs of growth, India’s\nhunger for resources also began to grow. For India, rebuilding a relationship with CA\nusing different parameters became important. India now realised that in order to get\nresources from CA, it needed a reorientation of its policy. The new policy had to be based\non economic diplomacy. As the region continued to remain fragile, however, India\nunderstood that the security component has to remain a part of the new engagement. India\nalso found that the space for economic engagement with CA was very limited by the pre-\nexisting inroads China had made into CA. China had been engaging with CA republics\neconomically since the end of Cold War. Thus, the challenge for India now was to chart\nout a balanced engagement in CA. In order to do this, the Indian Council of World Affairs\nundertook a Track-11 initiative called India-CA Dialogue. On 12th June, 2012, the\nMinister of State for External Affairs of India, during an address (at the first India-CA\nDialogue) in the city of Bishkek in Kyrgyz Republic, announced the Connect Central Asia\nPolicy (CCAP). The new policy has the following goals:\n\nImprove\nEngage with CA * conn nt\nfor energy security Components pene\nEngage with CA at . ~~\nthe level of securty ~ / 4 Component-s > Soosomically in CA\nProvide support at the\n\nlevel of education and skills\n,.

The\nmain thrust of the CCAP is to increase connectivity with CA for energy security. The\nInternational North- South Transit Corridor (INSTC) envisaged is a mega connectivity\n\ninitiative to improve connectivity with CA and assist them in their own growth. In this\nregard, there are multiple initiatives under CCAP. The first initiative at the civilian level\nenvisages youth exchange programmers and India providing training to the youth of CA in\nIT skills. The second initiative is at the level of military collaboration. There are also\nprovisions for joint exercises and counter terrorism exercises. At the bilateral level, as we\nshall see ahead, there is also a provision of regular intelligence sharing.

The prime strategic\ninterest of India during this time was to ensure that the region does not slip into religious\nextremism from deteriorating conditions in Afghanistan. Secondly, the other important\nthing that happened in the region to CA was the influence of China. As the influence of\nRussia in CA at the end of the Cold War declined, the Chinese stepped into the shoes of\nthe Russians. Since the Chinese economy had made a transition to an open economy under\nDeng Xiaoping, it had begun to expand and subsequently faced a crunch of resources.\nChina desperately needed resources to sustain the momentum and finally adopted a plan of\naction based on a long-term policy. Its policy was to first open up relations with CA and\nremove all irritants. It would then concentrate on integrating the Chinese economy with\n\nthat of CA. It would then take steps to ensure sustained resource supply from the region.\n\nWhile India was engaged with the Northern Alliance and trying to give effect to its\nLook North Policy, the Chinese began to resolve border issues with CA. As the borders\nhad acted as irritants, the Chinese not only resolved these issues, but also demilitarised its\nborders with CA. Next, it began to supply the weak CA economies with domestically\nmanufactured goods. In return, China began to take resources from CA. This cemented\nChinese presence in the region.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2010, India firstly continued to exercise its Look North Policy. As US\nwas unleashing its global war on terror and was curbing extremism and fundamentalism in\nthe region, all regional players like India, China, Russia, and the CA republics supported\nthe US in the endeavour since all of them were affected by extremism. India’s strategic\ninterests in the region began to evolve. With the launch of Operation Enduring Freedom\nby the US in Afghanistan, the US succeeded in removing Taliban. In Afghanistan, a\ndemocratic polity was established and Hamid Karzai became the first democratically\nelected President of Afghanistan.

The core interest of India is to\nensure that CA does not become a part of the Islamic belt spreading radicalism.

The USA has had two-fold interests in CA. Firstly, when\nCA became independent of Russian control at the end of the Cold War, the USA had\nhelped integrate CA to Europe. The US thought was dominated by the fact that CA can be\nan effective route to bypass the gas pipelines in Russia. The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC)\npipeline is one such manifestation. Secondly, after 9/11, US has used the geopolitical\nlocation of CA to curb extremism by establishing air bases and military logistic bases in\nthe region. The Bush administration favoured strong relations with CA as the region\nprovided the needed access to the US to Afghanistan. The US signed security frameworks\nwith states of CA and also aggressively pushed for domestic political reforms. Though the\nUS has tried to export democracy in the region, it has met with tremendous resistance as\nwitnessed in the Andijon violence in Uzbekistan in 2005 and Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyz\nRepublic. The resentment to interference of USA in domestic issue of CA states led to\n\neviction of US from the Karshi-Khanabad (K2) base. The US learned a lesson that if it\nwanted to stay in CA, it had to accept the local rules of CA. The CA states want to\npreserve their authoritarian regimes. They don’t want any power to challenge their\ndomestic power structure. China and Russia too are both comfortable in dealing with such\nauthoritarian regimes and they too would not prefer democracy in CA. Since 2008, the US\npolicy has been not to advice CA states on political matters but continue the security\nengagement. The opening up of the Northern Distribution Networks (NDN) for\nwithdrawal from Afghanistan has led scholars (Fredrick Starr calls it the Greater Central\nAsia Project-GCAP of USA) to assert that doing so would be akin to transform the region\nby reviving the ancient silk road to access Afghanistan. The basic interest of the US is to\nreduce the influence of China and Russia in CA but it has shown no real interest to assert\nhegemony in the region. US prefers to engage with India as engaging with India allows\nUS to balance Russia and China.\n\nRussia’s Quest for a Privileged Role and Structural Challenges\n\nThe Russian interest in the region can be studied through the prism of the Cold War and a\nvast network of pipelines to supply oil and gas to Europe. For almost a decade after the\nCold War ended, Russia remained mired in its own domestic concerns. The absence of a\nmajor power player in the region gave China an opportunity to step into the shoes of the\nRussians during this period. Russia re-emerged as a player after the coming of Vladimir\nPutin as he began to re-assert authority and aura in the post-Soviet space. After the 9/11,\nRussia decided to cooperate with USA in the GWOT. Doing so provided Russia an\nopportunity to enhance its international image in the post-Cold War period. Russia also\nrealized that if USA would knock down Taliban, it would indirectly benefit Russia, as\ndoing so would weaken the terrorists who could create trouble for Russia in Caucasus.\nDespite a favourable public opinion in Russia about cooperation with USA, the relations\nbegan to take a dip when USA began to assert unilateralism (visible in unilateral decisions\nof the US to initiate the Iraq war and its decision in 2002 to withdraw unilaterally from\nABM Treaty) compelling Russia to perceive US as a competitor in the post-Soviet space.\nRussia, responded to the new competitor through the Collective Security Treaty\nOrganisation (CSTO), with Russia, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and\nBelarus being its current members and Afghanistan and Serbia being observer states. The\nCSTO was positioned by Russia as a challenger to the NATO. The economic arm of the\nCSTO is the Eurasian Economic Community modelled on the lines of EU. The Shanghai\nCooperation Organisation (SCO) also provides a similar platform to Russia along with\nChina to keep a check on US influence in CA. Russia certainly does not want US\nhegemony or interference in CA. After the Andijon Violence in Uzbekistan in 2005,\nRussia and Uzbekistan concluded a treaty where Russia would provide assistance to\nUzbekistan if there were any military aggressions by a third party. This treaty clearly\nsupports the arguments we have evolved for Russian interest in CA. Russia is not\ninterested in reviving its Cold War type rule in CA nor is interested in emulating the\nFrench colonial pattern of engagement with Africa but prefers to establish a policy to\nlegalize its regional primacy through CSTO and Eurasian Economic Community. Russia\nhas allowed the states of CA to engage with external powers but is simultaneously\ncementing its own presence in the region through new blocks. Russia however witnesses a\nbigger challenge from China than the US in CA. Though initially Russia and China both\n\ndecided to cooperate in CA to keep US under check, but Russia was alarmed to see how\nChina flexed its economic muscles to engulf CA into its orbit completely. The rising\ninternational profile of the SCO is also frustrating the Russians. A scholar named Stephen\nKotkin of Princeton University has asserted that as China is making no compromises in\nthe economic and security agendas of its engagement with CA, there could be a possibility\nthat Russia could emerge as a junior partner of China in the near future. Russia would\ncertainly not like to envisage such a future.\n\nChina’s Great Leap Westward, Defining a Regional Security Agenda and\nSplittism Policy\n\nThe Chinese follow a very resource-centric policy in CA. However, China also knows that\nCA is a background for Russian activities, and it therefore cannot assert any hegemony in\nCA as this may upset Russia. China cooperates with Russia in CA to ensure that Russia is\nnot antagonised. Just as China takes resources from CA, it also does the same from\nRussia. In 2014, Russia and China signed a long-term gas supply deal. However, the\nChinese also have another interest in CA. Way back in 1759, China took over the region of\nXinjiang, consisting majorly of ethnic Muslims, and made it a part of China. Since 1759,\nthe ethnic Muslims of Xinjiang, called Uyghur, have resisted Chinese hegemony. In the\nInter-War period, the Xinjiang region was called as the East Turkestan Republic (ETR). In\n1934, ETR was absorbed by China. The Northern part of the ETR, from 1945-1949 was a\nsatellite area of the Soviets. In 1949, this region too was brought under China and since\nthen China has controlled the region as XAR by following the official doctrine of three\ninseparable ties. Under the doctrine, China asserts that one minority group cannot live\nwithout the other like Han Chinese cannot live without the minorities while minorities\ncannot live without the Han Chinese. The Chinese government has deliberately increased\nthe population of the Han Chinese in the XAR while using force (the biggest operation\nbeing in 1998 under the Strike Hard Campaign) to suppress the East Turkestan Islamic\nMovement, East Turkestan Liberation Organisation, and Uighur Liberation Organisation.\nPost-1950s, the Chinese government deliberately increased the presence of ethnic Han\nChinese in Xinjiang. This was done to make Han Chinese a majority and Uyghur a\nminority. This move again met serious resistance from the Uyghurs. After 1979, with the\nrise of Mujahedeen activity in Afghanistan, the Uyghur resorted to establishing linkages\nwith extremist forces and began to increase violent attacks against Chinese presence in the\nregion. Today, Uyghur militancy remains under control through cooperation with Central\nAsian states. Xinjiang province is strategically very important for China because it is a\ntesting site for Chinese nuclear weapons. There is an underground nuclear testing facility\nin Lop Nor. China has also established a base for its nuclear ballistics in Xinjiang. Recent\ngeological surveys have confirmed the presence of oil deposits in the region, making it all\nthe more important for China in the future.\n\nChina wants a stable and peaceful CA since it faces trouble in Xinjiang province. The\nXinjiang Autonomous Region (XAR) of China borders Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and\nTajikistan. The XAR is a multi-ethnic region having not only the Uighurs but also 55 other\nethnic groups. Uyghur militancy in China is a form of Islamic extremism. China\nunderstands that an unstable CA can cause a stir in the Uyghur militancy, which will, in\nturn, destabilize China. Thus, China seeks to neutralise these threats under the umbrella of\n\nSCO. China has also initiated a Go West campaign also known as the Great West\nDevelopment Programme to modernize XAR. The states of CA remain crucial in the Go\nWest campaign and to contain the three evils. CA, post 2005, once again emerged as a\nzone of competition. China also is not comfortable in directly working with the West in\nAfghanistan and has adopted a hedging strategy. China has developed proximity with ISI\nof Pakistan and through ISI is in indirect touch with the Taliban. This indirect route to\nreach Taliban gives China a security guarantee of its investments in Afghanistan and a tool\nto prevent Taliban to play mischief in XAR. CA has emerged as an area of the new Great\nGame. Publicly US asserts that CA is not the zone of influence of Russia but behind the\nscene, it has acknowledged to Russia that Russia has ambitions in CA. China has publicly\nstated that CA is the special sphere of influence of Russia but, on the ground it has created\nits own rules on security and economic engagement. If CA is the backyard of Russia, the\nChinese have started to redraw the fences in the backyard.\n\nExtremism\n\nSeparatism Three evils\n\nfor China\n\nTerrorism"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The discussions in the group were fruitful enough leading to the group to\nannounce, in 2000, to enhance the discussions beyond border issues to include issues\nrelated to separatism and extremism. This lead to a new dialogue on multiple security\ncentric issues under a new rubric called the SCO (established on 15th June, 2001).\nSCO works on the principle of credit attribution as a tool for self-promotion of the\nimage of the organisation. The 9/11 was a game changer for the SCO and China\nseeing the new norms established by the GWOT, China conflated the agenda of\nUighurs (in XAR) and ETIM with Al-Qaeda. This allowed China to cooperate with\nUSA to make a sovereign issue of Uighurs in Xinjiang a frontline in USA’s GWOT.\nBut, China also became fearful of rising USA’s presence in CA as it felt that a strong\nUSA in CA could choke off energy supplies to CA. China began to believe that US\npresence in CA could be permanent and it could be used by the US as a springboard\nto destabilise XAR. China thought that strong US presence in CA is a tool of US to\nkeep a check on China (through XAR). China responded to US game plan in June\n2001 by institutionalising the Shanghai-5 to SCO. In June 2002 annual summit,\nChina proposed the creation of Regional Anti-Terrorism Structure (RATS) and made\nit a provision in the charter of the SCO. To ensure that US does not use unilateralism\nin CA, China, through the Article-2 of the SCO charter asserted that none of the\nmember states of SCO will accept any unilateral interference in internal issues of CA\nby any external power. In 2005, when Askar Akayev of Kyrgyzstan was ousted by\nthe Tulip revolution, Russia and China perceived such a regime change a handiwork\nof the CIA of the USA. China perceived that such external sponsored regime changes\n\nand attempts for democratization could act fuel troubles in areas in China witnessing\npolitical dissent (namely XAR). The Chinese government even despatched\nresearchers to Kyrgyzstan to study the causes of the Tulip revolution. The 2005\nAstana summit of the SCO saw Uzbekistan to evict US from the K2 base (decision\ntaken by Uzbeks on pressure from Russia and China).

Recollection of these developments compelled K M Panikkar to advance the idea\nof collective security. Panikkar asserted that India should strive for establishing\ninterdependence with SEA to ensure that it forms a sphere of co-prosperity with India at\nthe centre of that sphere. Nehru always believed that India’s geographical location and its\npower could transform it into the pivot of Asia. When India became independent, a core\nelement of its foreign policy was promotion of decolonisation. India always believed that\nimperialism not only facilitated economic-cum-political exploitation, but also promoted\nmyriad forms of racism. India also opposed imperialism for strategic reasons. It believed\nthat strategic autonomy can only be preserved if India dealt with states which were\ndecolonised. Only decolonised states would give Indian an option to preserve autonomy of\naction in global affairs. India was concerned that even after the World War-II, colonial\ntule in Asia might continue as before, in which case, India’s quest for autonomy of action\nwould not materialise. Thus, after India’s independence, it became a strong advocate of\ndecolonisation.\n\nWhen Japan surrendered the control of Indonesia in 1945, the Dutch attempted to\ncolonise Indonesia. India, along with Australia, took the question of Indonesia to the\nUnited Nations (UN) and after four years of intense diplomatic negotiations, the Dutch\nfailed in their efforts. In January 1949, New Delhi organised the conference on Indonesia\nand forwarded the idea of an independent Indonesia. In February 1949, the UNSC too\npassed the final resolution for an independent Indonesia, thereby paving the way for the\nousting of the Dutch. The issue not only brought India and Indonesia closer, but the two\nsides developed defence relations, with India beginning to train Indonesian army officers.\n\nSimultaneously, India tried to materialise its decolonisation policy strategically in cases of\nstates neighbouring Indo-China. As per the Geneva Accord on Indo-China, three\ninternational commissions of supervision and control with an Indian chairman for each\nwere created for Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. India used its decolonisation policy to\nseek independence for Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.\n\nIndia also used its policy of non-alignment to build up relations with SEA. Burma\nand Indonesia were two states that also supported the non-alignment to ensure their stable\nexistence. The British India had had SEA as its third largest trading partner. When India\nbecame independent, it had a decent trade with SEA. India, after independence, adopted\nan autarkic economic model. As India began to look inward, the South East Asian states\nbegan to adopt an export-led growth model. The SEA states began to seek support for\nindustrialisation from the west and the USSR. Thus, due to different economic models,\ntrade between India and SEA began to decline and all complementarities were lost.\n\nAs India was a British colony, the British from India took a lot of workers to work in\ntheir other colonies. The British had colonised Burma and had taken Indians from South\nIndia belonging to Chettiar community to work in rice fields in Burma. The Chettiars\nconstituted a large chunk of Indian immigrants to Burma. Burma, after independence from\nthe British, initiated land reform policy (Burma for Burmans) and passed the Land\nAlienation Act of 1948. This policy of Burma affected the Indian immigrants and they\nlooked up for support from India. Nehru took up the issue with Burmese PM U Nu at a\nnon-official level. The concerns of the Chettiar community people could not be resolved.\nAs a result, a lot of Chettiars began to return to India. Nehru did not take up the matter\nofficially with the Burmese leadership as he feared losing Burmese support to non-\nalignment. He thought that if he took up the matter with Burma, it might perceive this as\nan interference by India in its internal affairs, which, in turn, would have repercussions on\nBurma’s continuance of support to non-alignment. Thus, for India, the strategic concern of\nBurmese support for non-alignment emerged as more important than the concerns of the\nIndian immigrant community. A similar issue had erupted in Malaya where a sizeable\nchunk of Indian community resided. After the independence of Malaya, their government\npassed multiple legislations that led to discrimination against the Indians. Nehru urged the\nIndians to display loyalty to their local governments and urged them to integrate with the\nlocal masses than raising their voices. He wanted India to be the light of Asia and an\ninterlocutor between the West and Asia. This idea was not received well by the SEA states\nwho felt that end of imperial control by Europe could lead to rise of neoliberalism by\nIndia. Nehru’s self-proclaimed leadership role in SEA created enormous suspicion\namongst SEA states and some smaller states even began to feel that India might try and\ncolonise them.\n\nDue to the adoption of a closed economic model, India was unable to provide any\nsupport for the economic growth of Asia. In 1962, after the Sino-India conflict, the SEA\nbegan to perceive that India might not be able to provide military security to any of the\ndecolonised states either. Post 1962, India came to be perceived as a marginal player in the\nregion till the end of Cold War. The 1960s saw a further deterioration of ties. In 1965,\nwhen India and Pakistan engaged in a conflict, Indonesia supported Pakistan. The alliance\nof Indonesia with Pakistan came as a big blow to India. In 1964, USA—Vietnam war began\nand India began to support Vietnam. India criticised USA presence, which was not well\n\nreceived by SEA states. The states of SEA began to perceive India’s hostility towards USA\nas a part of its alliance with the USSR. In 1971, when India—USSR signed a Treaty of\nFriendship and Cooperation, the SEA fears got intensified further. As India picked up an\nanti-West fault line, it was completely isolated in 1967 when the ASEAN was created. The\nASEAN was made to promote economic integration and has a pro-West tilt. After the\n1971 war between India and Pakistan, Iran threatened India that any future attack on\nPakistan would lead to retaliation by Iran on India as such an attack on Pakistan would be\nperceived as an attack on Iran as well. The SEA states began to feel that India was too\nfixated with war to be a potential player for engagement. In the subsequent period of 1971,\nwhen India resorted to military modernisation, it was perceived suspiciously by SEA\nstates. The Indian response to Sri Lanka in 1980s on issue of Tamil minorities and its\nsubsequent military intervention in Sri Lanka heightened the concerns of SEA states that\nbegan to feel that if ethnic Indians are mistreated, India may resort to military use. The\nPM of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, was a friend of Nehru and always favoured a deeper\nengagement with India and a larger role for India in Asia. He even urged India to test a\nnuclear weapon to balance China after China tested a weapon in 1964. When Singapore\nwas created in 1965, Lee urged India to train the military officials of Singapore. He\nwanted India to not only have an Asian Monroe doctrine but favoured a deeper naval\nengagement of India in the region. However, a struggling India, defeated in 1962 and\ndevastated in a conflict with Pakistan in 1965 (devastated due to domestic problems), had\nneither the material capabilities nor a strategic vision to achieve the dream envisaged by\nLee Kuan Yew.\n\nManmohini Kaul aptly summed up India’s relation with SEA and the ASEAN states\nby stating that India’s relations during the Cold War were a slew of missed opportunities,\nmistrust, misperception and bungling diplomacy. As the Cold War ended, India began to\nforge a closer relationship with the USA and began to improve relations with states which\nwere allies and partners of the USA. As India embarked upon a path of open economy and\nliberalisation, the SEA stated emerged a natural choice for India for partnerships. In the\nlate 1980s, China was becoming militarily assertive in the region and its military assertion\non Paracel and Spratly islands had created a new sense of fear amongst the states of SEA.\nChina was also exerting a strong influence on the ASEAN and many SEA states perceived\nit an attempt to dominate the ASEAN. The SEA states and ASEAN members initiated a\nLook West Policy to engage with India as a potential regional balancer. India responded\npositively and in 1991-92 announced a Look East Policy to engage with SEA at the\npolitico-military level. India also began to integrate economically with ASEAN.\n\nIndia-Singapore strategic . 4 India—Singapore Lion King\ndialogue 2008 wartare exercise, 1993\nIndia-Singapore defence _ , India~Myanmar MoU\non Detense, 1993\n\nIndia-Vietnam Detense / \\, Defense engagements with Thailand\n\nprotocol (1994-95) (1993) and Rangoon (1993)\n2010-2014 Incia-ASEAN FTA in Services, «1992 Sectoral dalogue partner\n\n2008-2010 India-AEAN FTA in Goods . ++ 1995 Full dialogue partner\n\n2005 India joins East Asia joins East Asia summit ~ 1996 ASEAN regional forum member\n2003 Indian-ASEAN troaty of Amity * *2002 Summit level partner\n\npore pa: Arrentero_g\n\nAs India opened up its economy and began to economically integrate with SEA,\nenergy security became the core concern for India. To feed its rapidly growing economy,\nIndian began to explore options to import energy from Myanmar. India’s OVL began to\nexplore offshore gas fields in Vietnam (the chapter on India—Vietnam relations ahead will\nelaborate on this). To promote development of India’s North East and maintain peace and\nstability, India has cooperated with both Myanmar and Bangladesh. During the recent visit\nof Sheikh Hasina in April 2017 to India, the two sides evolved a security-cum-defence\npartnership. Myanmar and India also cooperated with each other to carry out a surgical\nstrike in 2015. Not only had PM Rao initiated the Look East Policy, but Gujaral also tried\nto bring India at a centre-stage in the region of Asia—Pacific with his Gujaral Doctrine.\nUnder Gujaral Doctrine, India decided not to insist upon reciprocity in affairs with smaller\nstates in the neighbourhood. The recent attempts to deepen ties with SEA and EA have\ntaken an aggressive push with India’s Act East Policy.\n\nIn conclusion, we may say that during much of the Cold War era, Indian\npolicymakers ignored SEA. There were many reasons for the failure of India to establish\nties with SEA. Initially, the Nehruvian idea to consolidate and establish Asia solidarity\nfailed to take off. As majority of the SEA states feared communism, they showed faith in\nthe ideology of the US. At the end of the Cold War, India’s Look East Policy was designed\nto attract investments from SEA and boost trade through market access. India also began\nintegration with the ASEAN. During the Vajpayee regime, the Look East Policy II brought\nin a security dimension along with trade. Finally, during the Manmohan Singh era, an FTA\nwas put in place for goods and services. The Modi government has renamed the Look East\nPolicy as the Act East Policy with an intention to seek investments and keep a check on\nChina. To achieve this, there has been a thrust towards deepening defence ties with\nVietnam, Japan, Singapore, and Australia with focus on infrastructure creation in\nMyanmar."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Apart from\nIndia’s own protectionist policies, Myanmar was a closed economy and Bangladesh did\nnot provide the needed transit. Ideologically too, India differed from SEA. Thus, due to\ndiffering priorities, India could not leverage its cultural ties with SEA. Things began to\nchange at the end of the Cold War as ASEAN states adopted a Look West Policy to\ncounterbalance the dominance of China. As India began to look towards the East it\nrealised that its diaspora in SEA is very different from the Chinese diaspora. The\neconomic profile of the Indian Diaspora in SEA was very low compared to the\neconomically vibrant Chinese diaspora and migrants.\n\nIndia’s economic crisis in 1991 and the end of the Cold War led P V Narasimha Rao\nto give a strategic push to India’s engagement with SEA. An all-party consensus too began\nto emerge to improve ties with SEA based up cultural and spiritual affinities while\neconomically integrating India into the region. Without wasting much time, India decided\nto recover the loss of the USSR by building up a relationship with the USA and allies of\nUSA in SEA. As India adopted an open economy, India decided to learn the models from\nSEA. The Rao government officially launched the LEP in 1994 when Rao delivered a\nlecture during his visit to Singapore.

We\nwill try to build upon the knowledge from the previous sections of the chapter to broaden\nour understanding.\n\nTheme 1: Challenges and hurdles in India’s integration with SEA and EA\n\nWay back in 1946, in a memorandum to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) in India,\nNehru asserted that India lies at the centre of security in Asia and shall play a larger role in\nsecurity of SEA. This vision was reiterated later by Lee Kuan Yew, who wanted India to\nbe a balancer of forces in the region. India did take certain policy steps to promote and\ndeepen ties with the region, but the ground reality is that there is a huge gap between what\nis promised and what is achieved on the ground. The Modi government’s shift to the AEP\nwas undertaken with an intention to remedy the existing deficiencies but it also will\nrequire some major changes in the policy to get things moving.\n\nIn the initial years of the British rule, there was a great enthusiasm amongst the\nnationalist scholars to establish cultural colonies in SEA as they perceived that the region\nhad once functioned as a cultural progeny of India. Nehru too dreamt of organising a new\nforum to assert India as a lynchpin in affairs of SEA. Nehruvian diplomacy in Burma,\nIndo-China, Indonesia, Korean crisis and Vietnam were steps to assert the same, but, all\nstrategies failed to achieve this ambitious pan-Asianism. The LEP and later the AEP are\ninitiatives that have helped regain some of the lost space. India is now negotiating\nRegional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) to establish the largest free trade\nbloc in the world. Yet India’s economic interaction with the region has not yielded results\nbecause of its stunted domestic growth. The FDI in retail has always met with stiff\nresistance in this regard. A deeper economic integration with SEA and EA is impacted due\nto a fragmented internal market of India. The new government in Delhi since 2014 has\npushed for domestic reforms. ‘Make in India’ and GST are landmark achievements. Steps\nto boost up port infrastructure through the Sagarmala initiative have been launched.\nIndia’s bureaucratic hurdles and its officials’ discomfort with equity from foreign shores\nhas demotivated SEA states. For example, in 1994, Singaporean PM Goh Chok Tong\nenvisaged an alliance between Tata and Singapore Airlines, which could only materialise\nin January, 2015 with the launch of Air Vistara. The lack of progress in BIMSTEC and\nMakong-Ganga cooperation have caused much inconvenience. The major reason for lack\nof progress in the two organisations has been reluctance of India to develop its North-\nEastern region. Though the AEP has raised the pitch, progress on the ground is still\nawaited. At the security level, India’s defence bureaucracy has failed to evolve plans to\ngarner resources for the growth of the country. India’s oil exploration forays in SEA and\nmineral trade at foreign policy levels have not been synced with proper security for the sea\nlanes of communication.\n\nTheme 2: Counter-terrorism Operations between India and ASEAN\n\nThe ASEAN, through mechanisms like ASEAN Plus Three (APT), East Asia Summit\n(EAS) and ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), divides the great powers of the platform for\ndialogue to ensure stability. Apart from other areas of engagement, India and the ASEAN\ntoday are cooperating with each other in counter-terrorism. In the period prior to 9/11,\nterrorism was also an agenda for discussion at a regional forum like ASEAN but only as a\npriority to be tackled at the national level. The ASEAN states ensured that they refrained\nfrom intervening in national strategies of member states. Post 9/11, the ASEAN faced the\nchallenge of unifying all different approaches followed by member state to combat\nterrorism. On the side-lines of the 7\" ASEAN summit in 2011 in Brunei, the ASEAN\nstates adopted a declaration on Joint Action to counter terrorism. Subsequently, in 2011,\nthe ASEAN Convention on Counter Terrorism (ACCT) was adopted. The ACCT delinked\nterrorism and religion and displayed sensitivities about the dangers posed by terrorism to\nglobal peace and security and the development of the region. The ACCT recognises that\nthe ASEAN’s existence is not threatened by terrorism but terrorism may impact the long-\nterm goals of the ASEAN. The ACCT also asserts that each sovereign member state may\nevolve their own laws to tackle terrorism and re-affirms a non-interventionist approach.\nThe ASEAN has scrutinised terrorism as a transnational crime while allowing member\nstates to implement their own approaches. It has limited interaction between the member\nstates on political basis but has facilitated legal and technical cooperation. The member\n\nstates meet to strengthen the ACCT while allowing operational parts to be resolved by\nstates. India and the ASEAN signed a Joint Declaration for co-operation to combat\ninternational terrorism in Bali in 2003. India, since 2009, has agreed to the ASEAN\nRegional Forum (ARF) work plan on counter terrorism and transnational crime.\n\nLaw enforcement cooperation . . Capacity building\nStrengthen cooperation in immigration ~ Training and consuttations\nand transport sector *\n» Seminars and conferences\nIntelligence cooperation .\n\\* Official exchanges\n\\, Strengthen customs and quarantine\ninspections\n\nIn 2014, the ASEAN had already asserted that the ISIS was a threat not just to the\nMiddle East but to the rest of the world. The future of Indo—-ASEAN cooperation lies in\nhow the two sides develop a plan to counter ISIS that affects the stability of both the\nASEAN states and India.\n\nTheme 3: Trade Potential between India and ASEAN\n\nIndia, under its AEP, has asserted that it aims to enhance commercial relations with the\nASEAN region. During the Cold War, the main barriers to trade with the ASEAN included\nIndia’s inward-looking policies and lack of connectivity to promote land trade with\nBangladesh and Myanmar. The slow pace of development in West Bengal and Northeast\nalso acted as hindering factors. Thus, lack of infrastructure, connectivity and development\nat the borders hindered cross-border trade. Though India signed an FTA in services with\nASEAN, the situation as of 2017 is that not all ASEAN states have ratified the FTA. It is\nunderstood that India could rectify its trade deficit with ASEAN in goods if the agreement\non services is ratified by all states as India could capitalise on areas of its comparative\nadvantage (that range from IT to higher education to medical tourism). To take maximum\nadvantage of the trade with ASEAN, India needs to work upon its infrastructure and\ninstitutions of governance. To foster trade, India has been extending lines of credit as well.\nThe poor rank of India in the ‘ease of doing businesses’ too had been a big hurdle to\nrealise its potential—a situation that is now being addressed to redress the mechanisms\ninvolved.\n\nDepressed economies of NE states ,, « Non-tarilt barriers\nAbsence of border customs infrastructure < » Absence of infrastructure\nLack of a vision and no Trade East Policy “Lingering border disputes\n\nBureaucratic delays\n\nTheme-4: ASEAN celebrates its 50“ birthday in 2017—An assessment\n\nIn 2017 ASEAN completed 50 years of Asian regionalism. When ASEAN was born in\n1967, many believed that the organization will not be able to survive, yet it succeeded due\nto multiple reasons. Firstly, the most powerful binder was the anti-communism policy in\nthe grouping. The five founding members (Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia\nand Thailand) of ASEAN were open economies and used open economy as a tool to\nachieve economic integration. At the end of the Cold War, the erstwhile communist states\nof Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam and Brunei made a transition to an open economy\nand entered ASEAN. ASEAN received a lot of flak from the West when it engaged with\n\nMyanmar as Myanmar was under a military rule. ASEAN however continued to engage\nwith Myanmar as the core value of ASEAN was that trade and economic integration are\ngood confidence building measures than isolation. It is due to this value of ASEAN that\nMyanmar was finally able to transition to a democracy. In contrast, the West has isolated\nSyria and Syria is unlikely to witness such a transformation. Today ASEAN has emerged\nas a reliable platform for geopolitical engagement in Asia. The success is rooted in\nMasyawarah and Mufakat (consultation and consensus) culture which has been\nchampioned by ASEAN. Today ASEAN has emerged as an integrated single market due\nto two key things:\n\n1. Legal charter envisaging free movement of goods, services, capital and skilled\nlabor (in 2007).\n2. ASEAN Economic Community (in 2015).\n\nIn September 2017, a Parliamentary Standing Committee in India headed by\nBhupendra Yadav has suggested 69 ways to improve India~-ASEAN trade diplomacy. The\nreport asserts that India should allow ASEAN to access Indian markets in leather,\npharmacy and textiles. A core recommendation was to increase the economic interaction\nso that ASEAN can play a major role in enhancing manufacturing sector of India. The\ncommittee has asserted that India needs to focus on creating corridor of connectivity and\ncorridor of trade with ASEAN."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

In 2012, the Thai\nPM Yingluck Shinawatra was also the chief guest for the Republic Day celebrations in\nIndia. For Thailand, India is strategically located as a gateway to South Asia and the core\nof Thailand’s Look West Policy. Indo—Thai relations go back to the ancient times when\nAshoka sent a mission to Swarnabhumi to spread Buddhism. This led to a rise of cultural\nexchanges between India and Thailand. In 1947, the two states established diplomatic ties\nand Thailand became an integral part of India’s Look East Policy. A key regional binder\nfor India and Thailand is the BIMSTEC. The relations have been deep at the economic\nlevel between the two states as they signed an Early Harvest Scheme in 2003 that\nultimately culminated into an FTA.\n\nThe rise of China in the region has altered the security dynamics of the region. The\nChinese assertions in the South China Sea and its hegemonic ambitions have become a\ncause of concern. What is also important is that none of the states wishes to live in a\nChinese dominated system as both prefer more freedom and autonomy. For Thailand,\nChina has been a security threat since the World War-II and during the Cold War. In the\npost-Cold War times, Thailand and China concluded an agreement for strategic co-\noperation in 2007. The support of China to Thailand in the aftermath of the financial crisis\nhad caused a shift toward strategic cooperation. Since 2007, Thailand has come to\nrecognise the importance of China for the Thai economy. However, the recent Chinese\nassertion in South China Sea has opened up a new space of co-operation for India and\nThailand. Both sides have now explored defence as a hedge against regional uncertainties.\nIn 2012, India and Thailand concluded an MoU on defence co-operation.\n\nArmy based anti-insurgency exercises ».

India has not used its LEP to bolster\nsecurity and defence relations as it has preferred a lesser engagement in the security realm.\nAs China and its assertiveness increases in the area, the SEA and EA states expect India to\nbe able to provide security through strategic engagements with the players in the region.\nThe Japanese and Koreans too see India as a net security provider in the region. It is in this\ncontext that Indian began to assert its role as a net security provider since 2012 by\nbeginning to use the Indian Ocean as a region to demonstrate its capabilities. As India\nbelieves East Asia is also a part of its extended neighbourhood, it has begun using a\nmixture of soft and hard power along with sustained political, security and economic\ninteraction within the region under its Act East Policy. Under the AEP, India intends to use\nthe existing institutional architecture to deepen ties with the region. The recent AEP\nsignifies India’s strategic interest in injecting the strategic dimension into the relationship.\nIndia has already enhanced strategic control of its relation with Vietnam, Japan, Singapore\nand South Korea. Thailand has emerged as the next destination, along with Indonesia,\nwhere relations can be taken to a strategic level. India has emerged as a security partner of\nthe region and the AEP will give India a further push to the process as it now possesses a\nvision and the leadership qualities necessary for network building.\n\nEstablish multicultural presence , « Platform for maritime security\n\nPeacekeeping forces « —» Forum to fight terrorism\nDisaster roliet * 4 Establish confidence building\n\nmeasures\nHumanitarian assistance\nBuild capacities of SEA and Boost bilateral security and\nEA states /* defense ties with ASEAN\n\nUp gradation of presence in ’\\, Establishing a communication\nmultilateral forums approach on regional conflicts,\n\nSurvey of Future of India-Taiwan Relations\n\nIn 1949, India recognised the People’s Republic of China (PRC) but not the Republic of\nChina (ROC) {For detailed analysis, refer to the chapter of India and China relationship}.\nIt is not that India offered any position on the issue of Formossa. India believed that it was\nimportant to recognise the fact that the PRC had been established. Thus, Nehru recognised\nPRC and also that Formossa is Chinese territory. As neither PRC nor ROC favoured any\ninternational mediation, Nehru also designed Indian policy appropriately and maintained\nthat the civil war of China would end soon and the will of the Chinese people would be\nabiding. India refrained from playing any conciliatory role in ROC-PRC issue.\n\nPossibility of a future autonomy «Not to offer conciliation\n\nwas envisaged for Taiwan *\nFormossa has a distinct,“ \\\\, Formossa historically is a\nindividuality part of China\n\nDuring the initial years, as Nehru maintained this policy, leaders of the Hindu\nMahasabha, namely N B Khare, and Jan Sangh’s Madhok, felt that India had adopted a\npolicy of double standards by not accepting a nationalist Taiwan while accepting a\ncommunist China. Post the 1962 Sino-Indian conflict, India and Taiwan began to witness\na rise in military and media exchange which today manifests as rising parliamentary\nexchanges. But in the last 30 years, Taiwan—China relations have improved. A unique\nfeature is that this improvement has not been driven by forces from top down but from\nbottom up. The Taiwanese businesses have invested heavily in China and as a result, the\npeople-to-people ties have flourished. China has remained adamant on the One-China\npolicy and has maintained that Taiwan is part of China as ROC does not exist anymore.\n\nIndia does engage with Taiwan, but, under a different nomenclature. In 1995, India\nestablished an India—Taipei Association in Taiwan while Taiwan established the Taipei\nEconomic and Cultural Centre (TECC) in India. The two sides don’t have diplomatic\nrelations and thus lack an institutional architecture. Today, the bilateral trade stands to be\n$8 billion as of 2016. India has received FDI from Taiwan. Taiwan has, however, faced\ndifficulties in bringing FDI to India as in the official documents of India, Taiwan is\nmentioned as Chinese Taipei and the existing Indian rules that apply to China also apply to\nTaiwan, with no exception applicable. The continental engineering corporation of Taiwan\nhas been working with the Delhi metro. It has often complained about the repeated RBI\nclearance it had to get for bringing investments to India. Taiwan somehow receives less\nsupport from the Indian political elites and its foreign bureaucracy. It is important for India\nto rectify this imbalance and boost ties with Taiwan.\n\nIn 2014, during the swearing in of Indian PM Modi, the representatives from the\nTECC were invited. Later in the year, as India initiated its AEP, the two states seem to\nhave developed more potential to enhance ties. Taiwan can become a frontier state of\nIndia’s AEP. In 2015, the two sides celebrated their 20\" anniversary of their relations.\n\n~ Convergence in foreign policy\n\nFactors\n\nCen een” bringing India\n7 '\\, Urge to establish a new\nregional economic link\nThink tank level cooperation ,_ «Conclusion of DTAA\n/ \\\nEducation ties * “Technology cooperation\n\nTaiwan has initiated a Go South Policy and under which it intends to establish\nrepresentative offices in the states of SEA for economic engagement. The Go South Policy\nintends to use economic diplomacy to boost political relation. The new leadership of\nTaiwan under Tsai Ing-wen favours deeper economic ties with India. It is under the AEP,\nthat India should try to create an institutional framework that will bolster cooperation with\n\nTaiwan. Under its AEP, India can do great fine balancing of enhancing ties in education,\nscience and economy without upsetting China.\n\n‘Seeks FDI and\nIndia isa\nsupport for Make < >\nin India @Q priority partner\nY y\nUsesAct >. _/ Uses go South Policy announced\nEast Policy in 1994 to promote investments\nin Asia\nMaritime cooperation « ES » Enhance economic collaboration\nx 4\n‘Space cooperation Build economic and cultural ties\n\nIn June, 2016, an Indian delegation landed in Taiwan and concluded an MoU on Air\nServices Agreement and agricultural cooperation.

In February, 2017, a Parliamentary\ndelegation from Taiwan, comprising of three women members of Parliament led by Kuan\nBi Lang, visited India. The delegation supported Make in India and cooperation for smart\ncities. Taiwan pledged support to boost tourism and people to people ties with India. There\nwere protest from China in 2017 over the visit by Taiwan’s delegation but India dismissed\nthe Chinese protests by asserting that the visits had nothing unusual and had no political\nmeanings attached as such informal interactions are a part Indo-Taiwan engagement.\n\nSurvey of Sixty years of India—Malaysia Diplomatic Relationship, 2017\n\nIndia and Malaysia have historic and civilizational ties. The two sides established\ndiplomatic relations in 1957. In 1993, the two sides concluded an MoU on defence\ncooperation. Apart from the regular meetings of the defence secretaries of the two\ncountries, the two sides have conducted regular air level and naval exercises. In 2010, the\ntwo sides concluded a comprehensive economic cooperation agreement (CECA). As\nMalaysia is a member of the ASEAN, the two sides also benefit commercially due to the\nIndia—ASEAN FTA. The FDI from Malaysia to India is directed primarily in telecom, oil\nand gas and power plants.\n\nIn April, 2017, the Malaysian PM Dato Seri Mohmad Najib Bin Tun Abdula Razak\nvisited India. He addressed a conference of Indo—Malaysia CEO forum. The two sides\ndecided to deepen cooperation in infrastructure, textiles, pharmacy, IT, healthcare, and\nhelp in manpower development, data mining, traditional medicine, education, MSME,\ncivil aviation and tourism.

Cholas named the island\n\nSingapore and established a settlement there. In the modern times, the East India\nCompany used to carry cargo via Singapore to India and it was an important transit route\nfor the British. Singapore was later colonized by the British and governed from Calcutta.\nSingapore became independent from the British in 1965. In the same year, India\nconcluded a diplomatic treaty with Singapore. India Singapore relations paced up since the\nend of the Cold War and in 2005 the two sides concluded a C.E.C.A. In 2015, India and\nSingapore celebrated 50 years of diplomatic relations. In the same year, Indian Prime\nMinister also attended the funeral of Lee Kuan Yew. The foundation of the economic\nrelationship between the two is the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA)\nsigned in 1994 (with protocols signed in 2011). India exports light oils, nickel and\ndiamonds while it imports styrene, digital processing units and toluene. Singapore is the\nsecond largest FDI provider to India. In 2003, the two sides concluded India-Singapore\nDefense Cooperation Agreement and established a Joint Working Group on intelligence\ncooperation. Today, the two sides cooperate in defense at the level of maritime security\nand defense technologies. There have been frequent bilateral army and naval exercises\nunder MILAN and SIMBEX formats. At the economic level, to enhance commercial\ndiplomacy with India, Singapore follows a three-point strategy. Firstly, it encourages\nprivate investment to India. Secondly, it collaborates with countries like Japan and South\nKorea to invest in India and thirdly, India and Singapore jointly explore possibilities of\ninvesting together in other countries (mainly Africa, Latin America, and Central Asia).\nSingapore has complained about bureaucratic hurdles, procedural hassles and lack of\ntransparency as some of the hurdles in commercial diplomacy. In the recent times, under\nthe leadership of Narendra Modi, India has decided to attract global investment to make\nIndia a manufacturing hub of the world. Just like China has used Hong Kong as a\ncollaborator to access international investment community, India has decided to use\nSingapore in the same way to access global finances. India is taking steps to integrate to\nthe global economy by integrating the India Rupee through Singapore to make it an\ninternational currency. The RBI has allowed Indian firms to raise Rupee bonds abroad.\nSuch bonds are raised in the local currency and can be settled in US Dollars. Singapore\ncan play an important role to allow India to internationalize the Rupee. This will\nstrengthen the bilateral India-Singapore commercial diplomacy."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

As the US—Vietnam war broke out, India\nshowed support and solidarity with Vietnam and condemned US presence in Vietnam.\nSlogans like, “Amar nam, Tomar Nam Vietnam, Vietnam,” were a testimony to Indian\nsolidarity during US—Vietnam war. In June, 1966, India advocated an end of bombing by\nthe US in Vietnamese territory and favoured conflict resolution through the Geneva\nAccords. The US—Vietnam War finally ended in 1972 with the conclusion of the Paris\nAccords. India expressed happiness and satisfaction on the conclusion of US—Vietnam\nconflict by making positive statements on the floor of the house of the Indian Parliament.\nIn 1972, India and Vietnam established ambassador-level relations and opened up\ndiplomatic ties. Post-unification of Vietnam in 1975, India even supported the Vietnamese\nCambodian invasion. It also supported the Vietnamese in their War with China in 1979.\nBoth nations signed a bilateral trade agreement in 1978 and the Bilateral Investment\nPromotion and Protection Agreement (BIPPA) on March 8, 1997. During the Cold War\nperiod, India and Vietnam remained committed to each other bound by a common\nideology of non-alignment. However, they also had their adverse attitude towards the US\nas another commonality during the Cold War.\n\nAs the Cold War ended, India initiated a new policy paradigm at the economic and\nforeign policy level. India also made an internal economic transition of open economy. At\nthe foreign policy level, in 1991, India initiated the Look East Policy (LEP). Under the\nLook East Policy, India decided to integrate itself with South East Asian states.\n\nLEP = South East Asia + Economy\n\nVietnam was not only an important South East Asian economy but also became a\nmember of the ASEAN. As under the Look East Policy, India began to initiate a dialogue\nwith the ASEAN, and began to use it as a platform to economically engage with Vietnam.\nIn the Ministry of External Affairs of India, a separate division was created for CLMV\ncountries (Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam), which provided the needed impetus\nto propel Indo—Vietnam relations. As India and Vietnam began to explore the commercial\ndimension in their bilateral diplomacy, a new feature that came up into the Vietnamese\nforeign policy was its gradual rapprochement with the US. Due to an increasingly\npowerful Chinese presence, the US have realised the strategic significance of Vietnam in\nkeeping an eye on China. As the US initiated the rebalancing of Asia—Pacific through its\nPivot to Asia Policy, Vietnam found its presence in the new strategic calculus. Vietnam is\nnot only a part of the USA’s Pivot to Asia, but is also one of the twelve Trans-Pacific\nPartnership states. Since the end of Cold War, India-US ties have also improved and the\ntwo have even explored a strategic dimension in their bilateral diplomacy. In the context\nof India and Vietnam, the strategic dimension signifies a strong defence partnership.\n\nIf India and Vietnam are developing proximity at the strategic level today, then apart\nfrom India’s Act East Policy, a common factor has been the US need to contain China.\nThus, India and Vietnam relations have transformed over a period of time from being\nideological in nature to economic-cum-strategic in nature today. The diagram below\ncaptures the shift in Indo—Vietnam diplomatic ties. India’s Act East Policy and Vietnamese\nLook West Policy seem to be converging at the right point to reshape the Asian Balance of\n\nPower.\n\nY ’ Y\nIndia-Vietnam had India-Vietnam explored India-Vietnam ties are\n\nideological ties due to NAM economic diplomacy and economic cum strategic in\nand solidarity to gain Look East Policy was the key nature today and Act East\n\nindependence from French Griver at the end of cold war Policy is the key driver today"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The end of the Cold War ushered in a\nresurgent commercial dimension. India and Vietnam almost undertook economic\nliberalisation simultaneously. This opening up of the economy in Vietnam was called the\nD6i Méi. A unique shared feature between India and Vietnam is that both the countries in\nthe post-Cold War era have adopted a socialist economy with a tilt towards capitalism.\nVietnam cited lack of finance as a reason that hindered bilateral trade with India. As\nfinance became a hindering factor, India decided to assist Vietnam. When a country needs\nto boost trade, it can use two instruments, that of a loan or a line of credit. Let us take a\nhypothetical example. Let’s say India decides to give Vietnam a loan of 100 Rupees. In\ncase of a loan, the purpose once defined cannot be changed. Thus, loan at times becomes a\nrigid instrument. It cannot use the unused amount for any purpose other than the stated\npurpose. But when it comes to the interest repayment, Vietnam shall pay an interest to\nIndia on the entire 100 Rupees even if it hasn’t used or been able to use the entire amount.\nThus, loan becomes a commerce-centric instrument. That is why another instrument used\nfor promoting trade ties is the line of credit. Now, the nation receiving the LOC has the\nflexibility to use the money for whatever purpose they want. The nation extending the\nLOC can recommend to the recipient nation on the potential use of the money but the\nrecipient nation has the freedom to use the money for any purpose. Let’s assume Vietnam\nused the 100 Rupees LOC to buy a machine for the same purpose as stated above. Let’s\nsay, that the machine costs 80 Rupees. Now if 20 Rupees is the unutilised amount,\nVietnam has the flexibility to use it for any purpose, which isn’t true in case of a loan. In a\nLOC, the interest is always paid on the amount utilised by the recipient state (that is on 80\nRupees). The LOC is a very flexible instrument because if the recipient nation feels that it\ncannot utilise the entire amount, it has the flexibility to give back the unutilised amount\nback without the interest. If Vietnam feels that it cannot use the remaining 20 Rupees at\nall, it can return 20 Rupees back to India without an interest on the same. Since India had\nthe option of extending a loan or an LOC to Vietnam, India chose to grant Vietnam an\n\nLOC. India since the end of the Cold War has given 20 lines of credit to Vietnam. It is due\nto these lines of credits that the bilateral Indo—Vietnam trade is approximately 8.3 billion\ndollars. India imports machines, phone components, computers, electronic hardware,\ntubber, chemicals and coffee while it exports meat, fish, corn, cotton and pharmacy\nproducts. India has 93 projects going on in Vietnam totalling about one billion dollars. In\n1982, India also extended the ‘Most Favoured Nation’ status to Vietnam. Tata Power is\ninvesting 1.8 billion dollars in a 1320 mega war power project in Nha Trang Province. At\nthe level of capacity building, India, in 2007, established a centre for English language\ntraining in Technical University in Nha Trang and a centre for Software development in\nHo Chi Minh City. India has been taking FDI to Vietnam primarily in the oil, tea and sugar\nindustries. As India and the ASEAN have a FTA, this forum is also utilised by both India\nand Vietnam to deepen their engagement at the commercial level."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

As per United Nations Convention on the Laws of the High\nSeas (UNCLOS), countries in their EEZ can explore oil, mineral resources, living and\nnon-living natural resources including resources under the sea, seabed and subsoil.\nVietnam says that by inviting India to explore oil in its EEZ, it has not done anything\nillegal.

The Spratly Islands are\nclaimed by China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Brunei and Philippines. The Scarborough Shoal is\nclaimed by Philippines, China and Taiwan.\n\nChina, since 1953, has been claiming South China Sea through its mine-dash line. In\n\nfact, in September 2015, Rear Admiral Yuan Yubai of the Chinese Navy stated that the\nSouth China Sea also belongs to China as the name itself has ‘China’ embedded in it.\nChina has changed its tactics completely and has become extremely assertive in South\nChina Sea. It has made a shift from its earlier strategy of invasions to creation of new facts\nby confounding, bullying and bribing its adversaries. In 2010, China said that Tibet,\nXinjiang province and South China Sea are part of ‘Core National Interests’ of China.\nChina has clarified that Core National Interest signifies that the issue will be significant\nenough for China to go to war. Despite the fact that China, in 2002, in the 8th ASEAN\nSummit, agreed upon a Declaration of Conduct to solve issues in South China Sea\npeacefully with no use of force, its strategy to distort facts continues. Since 2010, China\nhas been converting uninhabited islets into artificial islets to bring it under UNCLOS\n(examples would include Haven Reef, Johnson South Reef and Fiery Cross Reef). China\nhas been changing the size and structure of the reefs by modifying their physical land\nfeatures.

Historically, Vietnam, due to its location, has always been of\nmaritime significance. The western part of Vietnam is hilly, meaning that the people of\nVietnam have to majorly look towards east for economic development. The east of\nVietnam has access to the sea. Out of 64 provinces in Vietnam, 28 are coastal provinces.\nAs the Vietnamese depend heavily on the sea for oil and resources, the countrymen are\nvery susceptible to the dominance of the sea by foreign powers. Vietnam opened up its\neconomy in 1991 and decided to go for economic modernisation through the\nestablishment of a marine-based economy in 1997. Since 1997, maritime thinking has\ndominated Vietnam. In 2007, the Vietnamese government adopted Vietnamese maritime\nstrategy 2020. Vietnam has a modest defence budget of 3.6 billion dollars but in 2007, it\nsurprised the world by announcing a 1.8 billion dollar submarine contract (to purchase 6\nkilo class submarines) with Russia. This landmark deal led the scholars of IR to analyse\nthe reasons behind the Russia—Vietnam deal. One of the easiest conclusions that the\nscholars reached was that the deal is due to the fear of Chinese dominance in South China\nSea. China, however, is not the only factor that prompted the deal.\n\n‘Atract foreign investment » Maritime research\n> Vietnam be established as a strong maritime economy\n® Establishment of a marine based economy\n* Intograte economic development and defense:\n~* Integrate economic development and detense\n\nProtect national sovereignty «\n\nProtect the territorial integrity «-\n\n'\nExplore marine resources\n\nAs it is clear from Vietnamese maritime strategy that Vietnam wants to achieve a\nperfect blend of economic and defence development, as each component is deemed crucial\nto achieve growth in the other. The government of Vietnam adopted a white paper on\ndefence in 2009 where it has identified certain hotspots in Asian Security.\n\nPossibili\nmm icant Sea * _* Possibility of conflicts at territorial level\n» Tremendous resource competition in future\nPossibility of disputes\nfelated to sovereign rights\n\n“ New non-traditional security threats to rise\n\nThis understanding of hotspots in Asian security in future has compelled Vietnam to\nundertake a shift.\n\n» To do rescue operations\nta al ae » To do search operations\n* Protect territorial sovereignty\n\nAlipast wars Al future wars\n» No miltary alliance formations\n> No establishment of foreign bases on sot of Vietnam\n* No military cooporation against a third country\n\nare fought here are Bkely here\n\nThus, Vietnam has clarified that its naval modernisation is linked to its domestic\neconomic development. It does not favour any arms race and has no desire or ambition to\ndevelop its navy against any third country. It has, however, kept the option open to\ncooperate with Russia, Japan, the US, India and Australia to assist in its defence\nmodernisation. It is in this context that India has opened up defence diplomacy with\nVietnam. In December, 2016, India and Vietnam agreed on Cooperation in Defence and\nCooperation in Peaceful use of Atomic Energy. The India—Vietnam Defence Cooperation\n\nis likely to establish a new Asian Balance of Power. We have also witnessed rising India—\nJapan—Vietnam cooperation. Japan and Vietnam are cooperating at the levels of cyber\nsecurity, space and naval modernisation. The security factor pushing the three to cooperate\nis China. Since 2011, India has faced around 400 incursions from China. There is rising\nChinese presence in the Indian Ocean, be it through submarine exports to Pakistan and\nBangladesh or sighting of Chinese submarines in the Indian Ocean.\n\nChina has also rejected the PCA’s 2016 verdict on the South China Sea. The rising\nChinese assertiveness in South China Sea is based on Chinese military power. Since 2000,\nChina has acquired 42 submarines while the US has acquired only 13. Though the US\nPresident Donald Trump has stated that the number of warships of the US are going to rise\nin future from 276 to 350, whether this increase will, in any way, help deter Chinese\nassertiveness is a matter of conjecture. In this situation, if Japan—India—Vietnam cooperate\nwith each other, such cooperation is likely to have a viable potential for the order of Asian\nsecurity. If China should further increase its assertiveness in South China Sea, Vietnam\nwill get top priority due to its strategic location in the sea. Vietnam is also a strong-willed\nstate as it has defeated France in 1954, the US in 1973 and China in 1979. Vietnam has\nbuilt up an image of being a grave of big powers. Vietnam also has a capability for\nexhibiting proportional responses on any provocation. (For instance, Chinese ships in\n2016 rammed into Vietnamese ships, and Vietnam immediately reciprocated by counter\nramming Chinese ships). The future Asian security order is therefore likely to differ from\nold Asian security order.\n\nUS-Japan\n~» US-Australia\n~—» US-South Korea\n\nOld\nUS-Centric\nAsian order\n\nUS-Philippines «—\n\nThe old system was based on the US centric alliances but over a period of time the\nbilateral alliances have not flourished. This means that, despite the US being a common\nally to South Korea, Australia, Japan and Vietnam, it has not yielded much cooperation\nbetween these countries. One factor for the absence of such security cooperation is a lack\nof US resources to tackle problems in the region.\n\nThus, with changing ground realities, new alliances have to be built up. These new\nalliances are emerging as mini-lateral security networks which may culminate as a\nfuturistic collective security centric system.\n\nJapan India\n\nAustralia\n\nSouth Korea\n\nVietnam\n\nThus, a new mini-lateral India—Vietnam alliance at defence level is on the rise in\nfuture.\nIndia to train crew for Kilo class submarines\n\nProposal to sell drones with range\nup to 2.5 kilometres and aircraft Pilot training to Vietnamese\n\nIndia is likely to supply Brahmos\nmissiles and Akash missiles along with\nanti-submarine torpedos, Varunsutra"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The connecting factor between India and ROK has\nalways been Buddhism. Buddhism reached Korea in the fourth century AD. Buddhism\nwas recognised in Korea in the reign of Kim Sosurim. Due to the spread of Buddhism in\nKorea, Indian and Korean interactions increased. The relations received an impetus in the\ntimes of Asoka, the Indian emperor who patronized Buddhism. Asoka is known to have\nsent iron and gold from India to Korea to establish Buddhist statues there. The interaction\ndeclined during the medieval times. With the advent of modern times came colonial rule.\nJapan colonised Korea and the British colonised India. The relations, hence, could not\nflourish due to colonial presences in both nations. As the national movement progressed in\nIndia against the British, a similar movement in 1920s began in Korea. It was in 1929\nwhen Tagore reached Japan that he penned the lines above. In 1947, the UN Temporary\nCommission on Korea consisting of nine member states was established to hold elections\nin Korea in May 1948, with India as the Chairman of the Korean Commission.\n\nConsulate level - ,, Ambassador\nrelations Sj ., level relations\n/\n\\ .

India’s\n\ndiplomacy in 1954 Geneva conference that officially ended the Korean crises was highly\nappreciated. As the Cold War entered Asian theatre in the 1950s India, announced non-\nalignment while ROK chose an alliance with the US and in 1953 signed a Mutual Defence\ntreaty with US under the leadership of Rhee Syngh Man.\n\nIn 1974, India and ROK concluded an agreement on trade, promotion and economic\ncooperation but the treaty did bear fruit as the two countries differed ideologically during\nthe Cold War. India liberalised its economy during the Rajiv Gandhi era, which finally\npaved the way for India to enhance engagement with ROK. It was also way back in 1988\nthat India and ROK signed a Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA). In 1993, P\nV Narasimha Rao became the first Indian PM to visit South Korea. In 1996, the South\nKorean President Kim Young Sam visited India and established a joint commission at the\nForeign Ministries level to boost bilateral cooperation. During the 1997 Asian crisis,\nSouth Korea was affected but after its economy was stabilised in 1999, the then Prime\nMinister of South Korea, Kin Jong Pil, visited India. The visit was significant as it opened\nup space cooperation. It was in 1999 that India, through a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle\n(PSLV) launch, also put Unibyol or the Korean satellite KITSAT- 3 in a geostationary\norbit. In 2004, then-President Roh Moo Hyun visited again and announced long term\ncooperative partnership for peace and prosperity. The first ever Foreign Policy and\nSecurity dialogue envisaging long term cooperative partnership was held and matters\nrelated to defence and terrorism and so forth were discussed. To enhance economic\ncooperation, a joint study group (JSG) was established in 2006. The JSG began to explain\nthe potential of a future Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA)\nbetween India and ROK. As the negotiations went on, the two diversified into trade,\nscience and technology, IT and infrastructure. Gradually textiles, oil and gas also came up\nin energy negotiations and economic cooperation. ROK recognised that India has ready\navailability of cheap and skilled labour. The ROK began to envisage India as an emerging\nas a destination where the ROK can invest, manufacture and boost exports to the rest of\nthe world. ROK identified, as per the Indian skill set, automobiles and ship building to\nwork upon. In 2005, POSCO steel company concluded an MoU with the government of\nOdisha for establishing a 12 billion dollar steel plant. This was touted as the biggest ever\nFDI to India in its history. In 2005, India and the ROK also concluded an MoU on defence\ncooperation and logistics. In 2009, finally the two concluded the CEPA\n\nIn order to increase cultural contact, both have often signed mechanisms to promote\ncultural cooperation. The India week in ROK and the Korea week in India are organised at\nthe cultural level with unfailing regularity. In 1999, Kimhae city and Ayodhya were\ndeclared sister cities. In recent times, the US rebalancing of the Asia—Pacific have got\nIndia and Korea closer. Another area of security cooperation between India and the ROK\nis at the level of nuclear power. North Korea and its clandestine activities have ensured\nthat and India and the ROK will have to intensify cooperation to maintain the balance of\npower in this context. Keeping this in mind, both India and the ROK have resorted to\nregular military interactions. South Korea is a pioneer in missiles and class destroyers,\nwhich is a new area of cooperation. The economic interaction is increasingly linked to\nstrategic relations."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Since 2007, India and the EU have been negotiating\na Bilateral Trade and Investment Agreement (BTIA) or the FTA. However, the BTIA/FTA\nnegotiations have not yet delivered the results as of now.

The origin goes\n\nback to 1958, when Germany assisted India with the development of IIT Madras. India is\nalso a participant in International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project (to\nbe discussed in the subsequent chapters). Under the Joint Action Plan, a Centre for\nEuropean Studies has also been opened in India. India has also opened Institutions for\ncontemporary Indian Studies in Europe. The level of academic collaboration is also high\ndue to the EU support to India under an initiative for the development and integration of\nIndian and European research since 2009. The most robust science-based partnership India\nhas is with Germany. A lot of German institutions have academic cooperation with Indian\ninstitutions, with Germany also offering vocational training to Indians.\n\nand\n\nIndia and the EU also have a development partnership where many of the EU nations\nhave been providing aid to India to assist in developmental initiatives. Germany, for\ninstance, has been giving developmental aid to India for energy efficiency and renewable\nenergy while UK, post-2015, has focussed more in technological collaboration. More so,\nat a macro level, the EU supports India to help it achieve the millennium development\ngoals and at a sectoral level, advances support in health and education sectors.\n\nTerrorism and security are two areas again where India and the EU have tremendous\nconvergence. Both sides want that terrorism, at the international level, be tackled within\nthe larger framework of the UN. India has been a victim of terrorism for a while, and the\nresurgence of the ISIS in the recent times has led to Europe becoming its latest victim. In\n2016 itself, attacks in Paris, Nice, Brussels, and London have made Europe extremely\nvulnerable to attacks. The European security strategy document clearly outlines the threat\nIndia and the EU face at both global and regional levels. At the bilateral level too, India’s\ndefence relations with France, the UK, and Germany have improved while Russia remains\nthe top most players for arms supply. Both India and the EU undertakes use of multiple\ninstruments to promote democracy and human rights, ranging from conditionalities in the\nOfficial Development Assistance (ODA) to election observer missions, both of which\nIndia refrain to use at the international level.\n\nSimilarly, at the level of global governance and multilateralism, both India and EU do\nhave convergence in acceptance of an idea of a multipolar world, but have different\napproaches to engagement with other states. While India emphasises national sovereignty,\nEU on the other hand is in favour of a rule based multilateralism model.

In 1966, the French withdrew from the\n\nmilitary command of NATO. In 1966, de Gaulle also visited Cambodia. His visit to\nCambodia came at a time when the US was busy fighting the Vietnam War. While in\nCambodia, de Gaulle asserted that a military solution is not a long-term solution in\nAsia and Asians in no way would submit to Pacific powers. In all the instances\nabove, we see an aggressive assertion of the national independence of France based\non the nationalistic feelings of the French. However, certain historians have\nmaintained that French wanted to maintain a strategic autonomy from the west as the\nFrench felt insulted on not being invited to Yalta Conference. This approach of\nstrategic autonomy by France resonated well between Nehru and de Gaulle.\nHowever, an initial hiccup in the Indo—French relationship came in 1956 Suez Canal\ncrisis when the French, along with the British, resorted to joining Israeli-sponsored\n\nplanned hostility on Egypt (for details, refer Section H, Chapter 1 in the book). India,\nduring the Suez Canal crisis, stood in opposition to the French for the first time.\n\nAfter India became independent, one area of Indo—French cooperation that began on\na positive note was nuclear research. In 1948, the Department of Atomic Energy in India\nwas established. Home J. Bhabha decided to look for foreign cooperation. Amongst the\nforeign players, France was the first with which India opened up cooperation. In 1951,\nNehru went to France. This visit was also important as it was a step towards strengthening\nnuclear cooperation. In 1960s, France helped India establish a heavy water production unit\nin Baroda. In 1979, the French again helped India with the establishment of a Fast Breeder\nReactor at Kalapakkam. After India’s peaceful nuclear test in 1974, when other nations\nsuspended nuclear commerce with India, French continued to supply India with fuel for\nthe Tarapur plant and continued the supply till 1992. The 1962 Indo-China conflict saw\nthe French condemning China for its military moves along the border as they chose to side\nwith India. Indira Gandhi, during her tenure as Prime Minister of India, also visited\nFrance. Despite the bilateral level visits, the relationship maintained a low profile in the\ninitial years. The breakthrough occurred for the first time in 1980. In 1980, the French\nPresident Valéry Giscard d’Estaing saw India as a future potential power and in 1981,\nGiscard’s successor, President Francois Mitterrand, laid the foundation of a successful\nfuture relationship during the state visit of Indira Gandhi to Paris.\n\nIn 1982, Mitterrand himself visited India, leading to the opening up of a new\npartnership. Mitterrand encouraged French firms to do business with India but the French\nfirms had an image of Indian markets being based on excessive regulation and state\ncontrol. The French firms found India a difficult place to do business and thus the\ngovernments of both countries began to undertake cultural promotion to gradually ease the\nprocess. It was decided that India would promote its culture in France, enabling the French\npeople to know more about India, which would, in turn, open up business collaboration.\nThe era of Rajiv Gandhi in India saw some steps towards the liberalisation of the Indian\neconomy which was viewed very positively by the French businesses. Many French firms\nbegan establishing offices in India to prepare themselves for the future. In 1989,\nMitterrand visited India again. In order to encourage French businessmen to enter Indian\nmarkets, a host of cultural interactions were envisaged.

The EU, as previously discussed, favours deep\neconomic cooperation with India and since 2005, India and the EU have been\nstrategic partners. But what is to be remembered here is that the strategic Partnership\nbetween India and the EU does not mention anything about nuclear commerce. This\nis due to internal issues in the EU itself. Within the EU, at the strategic level, there is\nan absence of consensus which is not in the case of interactions at the economic\nlevel. At the strategic level, due to power differences between players of the EU, they\nare unable to forge consensus although it is about something that, unlike economic\ntrade, that may touch all of them. It is due to this dichotomy that leveraging strategic\nautonomy and defining strategic relations with India is tricky. It is in this context that\nthe French, in 2006, envisaged strategic nuclear cooperation with India while the EU\nin its strategic partnership in 2005 did not.\n\nIn fact, Chirac had visited India in 1998, after the nuclear tests and went on to\nestablish a strategic partnership with India. An important dimension that emerged in the\nstrategic partnership agreement was of defence dialogue and defence cooperation.

In 1936, Nehru had visited Nazi\nGermany. In 1938, he visited Spain, which had also been badly affected by war. After\nboth visits, Nehru understood that if fascism and imperialism were to continue, they\nwill pose grave threat to international peace. This made Nehru sympathise with the\nFRG. He almost perceived the division of Germany as another act of partition, the\nway it had transpired in case of India and Pakistan, and had sympathy for Germans\ndue to its tremendous impact on their. India and the FRG also had a similar challenge\n—that of nation building in a democratic state in times of the Cold War. Initially,\nthese were the factors that shaped India’s German policy. East Berlin, which was\nunder communist control, was a place where that Soviets had essentially established a\npuppet rule. Since this puppet rule imposed by the Soviet in the GDR was against the\npolicy doctrine of self-determination that India held ideologically close, Nehru\ndecided not to recognise the GDR.\n\nThings began to take a different turn from 1955. The FRG joined the NATO\nalliance of USA. In contrast, the GDR joined the Russian Warsaw Pact. India did not\nappreciate these moves. Nehru, in 1956, had delivered a speech in University of\nHamburg, where he hinted India’s growing discomfort over military alliance and\nasserted that joining such alliances would, in all likelihood, prevent any possible\nfuture unification for the two sides of Germany.\n\nAfter independence, India was economically weak, but the FGR witnessed\ntremendous growth due to immense support of the West. India wanted to take assistance\nfrom the FRG for economic rebuilding of India and asked the FRG for support. Many\neconomic firms from the FRG began to assist India in the infrastructures sector. The FRG\nfirms played an important role in trucks, road construction and heavy industry.

India has\nhistorical ties with WA going back to the tie of Indus Valley civilization, when trade in\nturquoise, copper and spices were common. Indian merchants were present in WA even\nbefore the coming of Islam and the Indian merchants had trade with Mecca. Since 6*\ncentury BCE, Indians also undertook trade with Jews, who were the only community to\ntrade along India’s west coast. The coming of the British added a new geo-strategic\noutlook to the Indo—West Asia trade. For the British, West Asia acted as a land bridge to\nAsia, Afghanistan, Europe and was strategically located with links to the Mediterranean\nSea, Red Sea and access to Arabian Sea. The WA politics was influenced by Nationalism\nin the Arab world, western imperialism and the Zionist movement.\n\nAs Zionism emerged, Indian national leaders showed a negative attitude towards the\nsame as they perceived Zionism as an attempt by the Jewish people to colonise the lands\nof Palestine. As Indians were fighting a nationalist movement against the British, they\nsupported the people of Palestine. Indian nationalists provided support to the Arabs in\nPalestine who began to organise themselves to fight British imperialism. Nehru believed\nthat India should support Arab Palestinians because the British were exploiting Jews and\nArabs by playing the traditional card of divide and rule. On 27\" September 1936, a\nPalestinian day was also observed by the Indian National Congress (INC). Even as all\nthese events were unfolding, the maritime relations between India and WA continued. The\nEast India Company controlled India and the West Asian region through the Persian Gulf\nResidency (PGR). The PGR, till 1857, remained as subdivision of East Indian Company.\nAfter the 1857 revolt in India, the British crown assumed all responsibilities. The British\nIndian empire subsequently built outposts in the Gulf to safeguard marine trade. The\nBritish also supported the Jews as their intention was to continue dominance. The British\n\nused the Indian Rupee in Qatar, Kuwait, Oman and Bahrain. The RBI continued to use the\nRupee in the above states till 1959.\n\nUnder the Balfour Declaration, the British accepted the demand of the Jews to have a\nseparate state. During the World War-I, the British and the French had concluded a\nSykes—Picot Agreement, also known as the Asia Minor Agreement, in 1916 whereby they\ndecided to divide the areas of the Middle East amongst themselves after the war. After the\nWorld War-I, under the post war settlement agreements, the mandate system was\nestablished. The British got the mandate of Iraq, Palestine and Transjordan, while the\nFrench got the mandates of Syria and Lebanon. The British handed over their mandate of\nPalestine to the UN after the end of World War-Il. India, at the UN, during the\ndeliberations of UN special commission on Palestine (UNSCOP), opposed the idea of\npartitioning Palestine and supported the minority plan. India favoured a unified Federal\nArab Palestine with Jews remaining under Arab control. As Palestine was finally\npartitioned, a separate area for the Jews was envisaged. In May 1948, in the area\ndesignated for the Jews, the state of Israel was born.\n\nAfter India became independent, India followed a two-point policy in WA. It\npolitically supported the Arabs and enhanced support to their leaders who focused on\nsecularism and socialism. During this period, India would often criticise Israel and censure\nit for aggression in the Middle East. India’s non-alignment emerged as the foundation of\nIndo—Arab friendship. The leaders of Ba’ath party in Iraq and Nasser of Egypt supported\nNon-Aligned Movement. India also used NAM to support peaceful resolution of Israel-\nArab conflicts. India used multiple NAM conferences to support peaceful resolution of the\nPalestine issue. India supported the Arabs and in 1975 supported a resolution to brand\nZionism as racism. After 1967, the Nasser’s idea of Pan Arabism began to fail and it gave\nrise to religious extremism in WA. This gave Pakistan an opportunity to expand its\ninfluence in the region. India, however, continued to support anti-colonial and anti-\nimperial struggles. India’s basic purpose was to not only get access to oil from the Gulf,\nbut also reduce the influence of Pakistan in the region. The 1973 oil crisis lead to a\nsubsequent oil boom in WA. This led to the rise of pro-West monarchs like Saudi Arabia,\nwith exceptions remaining. The oil boom witnessed a rise in the migration of unskilled\nand semi-skilled worker to the Gulf. This allowed India to sustain its relations with Gulf\nstates during the rest of the Cold War.\n\nReduce Pakistani influence\n\ngaa abe pir yep No policy to influence regional dynamics\n» Anti-colonialism\n, ii\n™ Anti-imperialism\nto the Arab\nSonate Seay * Opposition to Cold War politics\ni\n‘Support to pan\nArabism and secular Arab states\n\nThroughout the Cold War, India continued its anti- Israel rhetoric while supporting\nthe Arabs. India wanted to support Iraq even during the Iran— Iraq war in 1980s and\nshowed reluctance in condemning Saddam Husain (due to a deep oil based relationship) in\n1990s during Iraqi annexation of Kuwait. India always adopted a cautious approach of not\nbecoming overtly judgmental about any nation or any event in the region. It preferred to\n\nsupport regional and international consensuses on issues rather than taking up any\nleadership role.\n\nAt the end of the Cold War, India realised the significance of remittances from the its\ndiaspora in the Gulf. As India embraced globalisation at the end of the Cold War, the\nIndian Diaspora began to witness a shift. The earlier unskilled diaspora now began to be\ncomplemented by a new while collar diaspora that specialised in IT and the services\nsector. In the post-Cold War era, many Indian firms have established a presence in the\nGulf. The Indians offer consultancy services, management services and services in IT and\npharmaceutical sectors. As the Indian economy had begun to grow, and India had started\nbuying more oil from the Gulf. Indian had also realised that the Gulf states were very\nstrategic for India’s security needs.\n\nAs India looked towards the Gulf for energy security, the Gulf states looked towards\nIndia for food security. Initially, after the end of the Cold War, India looked towards the\nGCC states for trade and business. The subsequent chapters in this section will\ndemonstrate how, at present, India is seeking defense, strategic, political and security ties\nwith the region. As the rising numbers of expats from Gulf are sending remittances to\nIndia, the Gulf has emerged as a region of key priority. Today, India has recognised that\nkeeping the Indian diaspora in the Gulf sector is a core policy initiative, especially since\n2011, the Arab states are undergoing transformation as the part of Arab Spring movement.\n\nand defense ~ _, Protect Indian diaspora\nUse culture and sot power ~ + Build energy-economic growth link\nProtect the sea lanes of ., Boost relationship to faciitate\n‘communications ~ trade and investments\nProvent piracy « * Enhance strategic prosance in tha region\nPrevent money laundering and ME watery 2\n\nIn 2005, Dr Manmohan Singh announced a Look West Policy (LWP) and stated that\nWest Asia is a part of India’s extended neighbourhood. He advanced the idea of pursuing\neconomic relations with the Gulf. The subsequent chapters will show that the period post-\nLWP had India signing a strategic partnership agreement with Saudi Arabia and United\nArab Emirates. India also concluded a contract for LNG supply with Qatar and established\nan investment fund with Oman and an infrastructure fund with UAE.\n\nAnother unique feature of India’s engagement with the WA in the post-Cold War era\nis that it has shed-off the anti-Israel rhetoric and has enhanced ties with Israel. At one\ntime, India had even supported the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) and was one\nof the non-Arab states in the world to recognize PLO. After the end of Cold War, in 1993,\nthe USA organised a peace conference between the PLO and Israel at Oslo. As per the\nOslo Accords, the PLO and Israel signed a peace deal. As PLO shed off its hostility\ntowards Israel, and India rapidly took this opportunity and enhanced ties with Israel. India\nwas therefore able to initiate enhanced engagement with Israel without diluting its\nPalestinian cause. India continues to support the Palestinian cause while maintaining ties\nwith Israel. India has realised that West Asia is not a region to display power but to\naugment power."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

As a US-dominated global order emerged, PV Narasimha Rao got\nIndia to shift its politics. In 1992, Rao signalled the establishment of diplomatic relations\nwith Israel.

He asserts that the rise of Al-Nahda in Tunisia and the Muslim\nBrotherhood in Egypt firstly proves that hardcore Islamist parties have understood that\ndemocracy is the only factor that can ensure their survival. They have understood also that\nonly the participation of the people in governance can give them the mandate to survive.\nHowever, the experience of Muslim Brotherhood and Al-Nahda has proven that they lack\nthe experience in governing their countries. As the Islamists have risen to power, they\nhave adopted a moderate version of Islam and this, in future, could lead to a separation of\nreligion from civil institutions. At the same time, a strong competition is visible between\nthe Brotherhood, Salafis and Ulemas, ensuring none has monopoly. The Salafi trend,\nthough not well established, poses the additional threat, along with the radicals, of a strong\ncommitment to establish Sharia and the Caliphate. Scholar Abdul Moneim says that when\ndictators ruled West Asia, the Salafis remained committed to religion. Post-Arab Spring,\nas a weak state emerged, in some areas (like in Egypt there are 3 to 5 million Salafis), the\nSalafis started using political parties to fight election to garner power and then discarded\ndemocracy once in power."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

It has\nfourteen major exporters of oil it was founded in Baghdad but the headquarters are in\nVienna, Austria. OPEC is an international cartel that coordinates petroleum policies\nof the 14 states to stabilize the oil prices and ensure supply to the consumers. India\nhas been an old buyer of oil from OPEC states. In the recent times, US discovered\nshale gas. The discovery of shale was perceived by the OPEC as a threat to oil trade.\nIn 2014, oil minister of Saudi Arabia Ali Al-Naimi advised the OPEC states to take\nsteps to pre-empt US to use shale to grab OPEC markets of oil. So, in 2014, OPEC\ndecided to increase production of oil. As the production of oil increased, the prices of\noil began to decrease. as the prices decreased, the OPEC began to offer to its clients\nhuge discounts. Since 2014, India too witnessed benefits out of the OPEC policy. For\nIndia, the oil import became cheaper and India was able to save a lot of foreign\nexchange in oil imports. Such discounts in oil prices by OPEC affected the export\nrevenues of OPEC states. The OPEC government states began to pump money to\ncompensate export revenue losses. This policy of OPEC even hurt the shale industry\nas the decrease in the oil prices affected the fracking process. In May-2016, Naimi\nwas succeeded by Khalid Al-Falih as the new oil minister of Saudi Arabia. Khalid\ndecided to reverse the policy of Naimi and decided to cut the oil output with an\nintention to increase the oil prices. But the policy of Kalded was short lived as\nRussia, an important negotiator, increased oil production. As Russia did not cut the\noil production, it succeeded in displacing Saudi Arabia as a core exporter of oil to\nChina. The overall effect of the policy of Khalid did increase the oil prices slightly.\nThis led to rise in US oil production and US began to emerge as an exporter of oil\nonce again. Though Trump visited in Saudi Arabia in 2017 but Saudi Arabia is not\nhappy with US conquering markets of Saudi Arabia. In 2017, Saudi Arabia and\nRussia have decided to cooperate and continue to production cuts till 2018 to push up\nthe oil prices to take them to around 50 USD per barrel. To achieve this, both have\ndecided to follow ‘pump at will’ policy. US traders have followed a policy of using\ncapital markets to raise money. US traders have decided to resort to future and\noptions markets to hedge against low oil prices. In this price war, Saudi Arabia and\nOPEC did not realize that fracking (the method of hydraulic fracturing to produce\nshale) is a more predictable method than the Wildcatter model of drilling oil (a\nmethod of pumping money on the ground to gush out oil). But the bigger issue is that\n\nall such measures are short term only. Does OPEC have a long term plan as states are\ntrying to switch over to cleaner fuels (by 2040, four European states have decided to\nban sales of gasoline cars). India picked up the issue of Asian Premium (Charged by\nOPEC to poorer importers of Asian states) in 2017 during the Vienna meeting. India\nhas asserted for the first time that if security of supplies is not maintained, India can\nlook at new avenues US, Iran and Canada. By 2040, India’s oil demand will rise by\n150 % and global share will rise from 4 to 9 %. India has started oil imports (shale)\nfrom US. This will rectify the Indo-US trade imbalance.

The Harappans in India\ninteracted with the people of the region. In modern times, the relations between India and\nQatar emerged due to the establishment of the British colonial rule in India. When the\nBritish were establishing their base in India, they undertook trade with Qatar through the\nports of Al Bida and Zubra. As the Indian merchants began settling in Qatar, the then\nSheik of Qatar, Sheikh Jassim, began to feel alarmed by the rising Indian presence. He felt\nthat the Indians in Qatar were being encouraged by the British and that the entry of\nIndians in Qatar was a strategic move of the British to conquer the territory of Qatar. As\nthe insecurity of the Sheikh grew, he began ordering the killing of Indian merchants in\nQatar. As a result of this, many Indians who escaped the Sheikh left Qatar and for almost\nhalf a century ahead, there was no more trade between India and Qatar.\n\nThe relations between India and Qatar finally resumed from 1971. Since 1971, Qatar\nhas been under the control of Al Thani family. It is the number three player in the world\nfor natural gas. In contrast to other states in the Arab world, Qatar fares relatively better in\nthe Human Development Index. Since 1971, India and Qatar have had very cordial and\ndeep relations. There are two reasons for it. Firstly, in Qatar, there is a sizeable Indian\ndiaspora that acts as a bridge in the relations. Secondly, the political leaders of both states\nenjoy commonality of views on multiple matters of regional and global significance,\nensuring a natural convergence. Due to large diaspora, there is a deep presence of Indian\nculture in Qatar. Qatar has a foreign policy whereby it intends to influence middle eastern\npolitics through assertion of its power to emerge as a regional leader.

As per the deal, Qatar would supply 7. 5\nmillion tonnes of LNG per year from 2003 to 2028. Qatar has the third largest natural gas\nreserves in the world and these reserves are called non-associated reserves. This means\nthat these reserves have natural gas which is independent of oil. The 2003 deal sealed a\nlong term of 25 years’ worth LNG supply for India. Subsequently, the government\nestablished a joint venture in India called Petronet to execute the deal with Ras Gas of\n\nQatar.\n=< > - —\n\n(75 MaT LNG suppiyiyear)\n\nPetronet hired three cryogenic ships to bring this LNG from Qatar. LNG is always\nbrought in a sub-zero temperature in a special vessel. The gas is first transformed into a\ncryogenic state; it is then exported through a specially designed vessel. Once it reaches the\ndestination, it is regassified. Petronet decided to bring in LNG and regassify it in Dahej,\nGujarat.\n\nPower Generation  @&. Fertilizers\n\nUnder the Petronet-Ras Gas deal, the contract was based on take-or-pay clause. This\nmeans that even if India does not take above 90% of the gas from Qatar, it has to pay for\nthe full contract amount. Due to the ongoing global meltdown, the prices of LNG have\nglobally declined. However, the price of LNG supplied by Qatar remained same. This\nLNG price of Qatar was over and above the global prices. Thus, the domestic users of\nLNG in India, which primarily included the power and fertilizer industries, began to move\ntowards cheaper alternatives like naphtha and fuel oil. At the 6\" OPEC International\nSummit in Vienna in June 2015, India urged Qatar to reduce LNG prices for India in\nkeeping with global prices. As per the demand made by India, in December 2015, after\nintense negotiations, Ras Gas revised the price contracts and concluded a new agreement\nwith Petronet to supply LNG to India at a lower price. Earlier India was paying 12-13\nUSD per MMBtu which is now reduced to 6-7 USD per MMBtu. Due to the shift to\ncheaper alternatives by domestic players in India, the Indian offtake of LNG slid below\nthe 90% thus violating the take or pay clause. Qatar imposed a penalty of 1 billion US\nDollars on India as India’s actual offtake was just 68% of 7. 5 Million Tonnes per annum.\nHowever, in December 2015, at the time of the announcement of new pricing formula,\nQatar also waived off this penalty. In February, 2016, India concluded a new pact with Ras\nGas which is a new sale and purchase agreement. As per the agreement, starting from\n2016, Ras Gas will give one million tonne per annum extra LNG to India to IOC, BPCL,\nGAIL and Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation. This additional 1 million tonne per\nannum is given to the four players for onward sale for the remaining period till 2028."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The domestic change in its economic paradigm to include a\nmodel of globalisation made India more proximate to the US. Due to its overt focus\non South East and the US for almost a decade, the neglect of West Asia and\nspecifically the UAE was natural as the energies were focussed on a particular region.\nAnother important factor is that with the change in the economic paradigm at home\nto an open economy, the Indian foreign policy establishment looked at West Asia\nonly as an oil supplier and not as a strategic partner.

However, both are constrained by regional impediments.\nIn the modern times, Saudi Arabia has been able to stand for the ideological power of\nreligion. One major reason for its success in the same is that Mecca and Medina, the two\nholiest sites in Islam, are located in Saudi Arabia. India has a large Muslim population and\nin this context, Saudi becomes important in India’s strategic calculus.\n\nIndia and Saudi Arabia established diplomatic relations in 1948. However, the\nrelations with Saudi Arabia have not been very smooth during the Cold War. In the\naftermath of independence, India and Pakistan had a war in 1948. Pakistan was able to\ngarner Saudi support owing to its religious foundation and its emergence as an Islamic\nstate. In 1953, Saudi king Al-Saud visited Pakistan and supported Pakistan on the Kashmir\nissue. However, Saudi—Pakistan relations deteriorated when, in 1955, Pakistan joined the\nUS alliance brokered by the Central Treaty Organisation or the Baghdad pact. Saudi then\nused this opportunity to cultivate relations with India. In 1955, Saudi Prince Faisal visited\nIndia and later, King Saud also visited the state. In 1956, Nehru paid a state visit to Saudi\nArabia. Again, this bonhomie was not long lasting as in 1957, Saudi itself announced a\npro-west alliance. Saudi Arabia used its alliance with the US to assert hegemony in the\nregion.\n\nDuring the early decades of the Cold War, Egypt had propounded an idea of Pan\nArabism and Arab unity. However, Saudi began to weaken the influence of Egypt and\nSyria in the Middle East by using Pan Islamism as a tool. As India was pro-Egypt, a\nweaker Egypt also meant weaker Indian influence in the middle east. As Saudi succeeded\nin tilting the balance of power of the Middle East in its favour, it gave Pakistan an\nincreased leverage to side with Saudi Arabia. In 1965, in the Indo-Pak war, Saudi\nsupported Pakistan as Egypt supported India. Even in the 1971 war with Pakistan, the\nSaudis continued to support Pakistan. Saudi even refused to give diplomatic recognition to\n\nBangladesh after its creation in 1971. After the 1973 oil embargo, as more money flowed\ninto Saudi Arabia, it gave Saudi the option to undertake aggressive arms race with others.\nHowever, three events in late 1970s and 1980s drastically changed the landscape of the\nMiddle East. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the Islamic revolution in Iran and\nbeginning of Iran-Iraq war were defining moments of the time.\n\nAs Ayatollah Khomeini rose in Iran, it increased the insecurity of Saudi Arabia. The\nconcern of Saudi got further compounded when Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982. India\nused the opportunity again to patch up with Saudi. In 1982, Indira Gandhi visited Saudi\nArabia. But, as the Cold War ended, India’s aggressive counter military response to\nPakistani-funded extremism in Kashmir in 1990s and the demolition of the Babri Masjid\nin 1992 kept the strain in Indo—Saudi relations alive."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Tectonic events in\nthe post-Cold War era brought India and Saudi Arabia closer again. The first event of\nconsiderable impact was the 9/11 in the US.

During the Cold War period, India was dependent\nupon oil imports from West Asia. As the Cold War ended, the West Asian region\nwitnessed internal disturbances and slid into chaos. The Gulf War-I and the Gulf War-II\nseverely affected India’s oil supply. Furthermore, as the Indian economy made a transition\nto an open economy, the domestic energy consumption began to increase. As India\ndomestically lacked the supply base itself, it resorted to more oil imports. But as West\nAsia was already in crisis, and there was an immediate hunger domestically to sustain the\ngrowth momentum, India resorted to diversification of its oil import basket. As India\ndecided to diversify its oil imports, its Latin American friend Venezuela entered the\npicture. India did initiate oil imports from Venezuela in the period from 2000 to 2010 but\nVenezuela could not emerge as a mega supplier. It’s not that Venezuela did not possess oil,\nbut being in the strategic background of the US, Venezuela was left very little surplus after\nheavy oil imports from the USA. But in the period after 2010, as the US began the\ndiscovery of shale, its dependence in Venezuela oil has declined. This situation has\nfavoured India.\n\nNow Venezuela possesses surplus oil. Thus, as India had already executed its policy\n\ndiversification, it has an opportunity to buy more oil from Venezuela. Today, Venezuela is\nour third largest oil supplier after Saudi Arabia and Iraq.\n\nThe basic framework for hydrocarbon diplomacy was laid down during the 2005 visit\nof Hugo Chavez to India.

The\norigin of the term, however, in the modern context, goes back to the World War-I. The\ninitial mention of the terminology is visible in the Paris Peace Conference and the League\nof Nations with respect to allocation of seats in the League. But the actual usage of the\nterm happened during the creation of the UN after the World War-II. During this period,\nwe see the application of this term to some countries like Canada, Australia, and so on.\nThey used the term middle powers to distinguish themselves from other foreign powers\nthat were relatively small in power and in influence. The application of the term by\nAustralia and Canada was done at the UN level to assert that they would exercise more\ninfluence than smaller players in world politics. Although they demanded extra privileges,\nthe great powers refused to grant exclusivity to the middle powers. The term did become\npopular in the discourse of international governance, but could not come to stand for more\nassertion vis-a-vis the great powers.\n\nThe subsequent period of the Cold War saw some change. The middle powers now\nbegan to play a different role and their recognition was based on the ability of a middle\npower states to mediate on international disputes, their military power, the size of\nterritories and populations they possessed, and so on. Thus, during the era of bipolarity,\nthe middle powers resorted to differentiate themselves from the other two big powers\nbased on the points mentioned above. When the Cold War ended, the term came to be used\nto signify how a country undertakes diplomacy on soft issues. In the post-Cold War\nperiod, human rights, environment, and conflict management have emerged as new\nconcerns. Today, the middle powers use their diplomacy to advocate on these soft issues\nand the way they address themselves gives them the leverage to distinguish themselves\nfrom other powers. Thus, today, we broadly see that middle powers are those that do not\nposses substantial military power but are still powerful enough to exercise influence in the\nworld using persuasion and cooperation.

The reason\nfor economic neglect was attributed by the leaders of the national movement to the British\ncolonial rule. After independence, another factor that came up was India’s assertion for\nautonomy in decision-making. This was done to ensure that no ambitious imperial power\ntakes Indian sovereignty hostage again. However, during the national movement, as senior\nCongress leaders interacted often with the British political class, the negotiations for the\ntransfer of power had led to the establishment of personal contacts between Indians and\nthe British, which became an important link in the post independence phase of our\nrelations. The most important issue that came up was India joining the Commonwealth.\nWhen India decided to join the British Commonwealth, there was a strong reaction from\n\nthe opposition in India. The opposition asserted that doing so would contradict India’s\nnon-alignment policy. However, Nehru clarified that India was, firstly, joining the\nCommonwealth as an independent nation. Secondly, it was not going to accept the British\nmonarch as its head of state but would join the body as an independent Republic. Thirdly,\nNehru clarified that India, even after joining the Commonwealth, would continue to\nmaintain its own strategic autonomy in decision-making. Indian diplomats worked\ntirelessly to change the rules of the game in the British Commonwealth. India ratified the\nCommonwealth Agreement in 1949 and joined it as a representative after 26th January,\n1950.\n\nIn the first phase, the next important issue was the linking of economies. Since the\n1940s, the British and Indian economies were linked financially. The British had agreed\nthat after the World War-II ends, it would reimburse the money spent by the Indian\ngovernment in — the war. The amount was about 13 million Pounds, and an agreement was\nmade that the British would return the money from 1947 to 1957. The businesses run by\nBritish firms also had to adopt to the new policies of the Indian government. The British\nfirms and their subsidiaries that preferred to stay back faced severe competition from\nIndian firms and Indian PSUs. The British also continued to provide aid to India, both at\nthe bilateral level and also through the Colombo Plan. The British also provided financial\nhelp to India to execute its Five Year Plans. They insisted, however, that India undertake\npurchases from British firms in lieu of the aid it received. One concern on the foreign\npolicy front that emerged was the question of Pakistan and Kashmir. The British approach\nwas to maintain good relations with both nations and go for UN-based mediation but India\nwas visibly upset with the British for not supporting India. A balance gradually emerged\nas the British helped India to establish proximity to the Americans."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

India, which has become upset over\nIran’s arguments pertaining to the development rights related to the Farzad-B field, has cut\ndown its oil imports from Iran in 2017. India is upset that Iran wishes to auction the\nFarzad-B field even when India has asserted in 2017 that it is willing to put in 6 Billion\nDollars for gas field development and 5 Billion Dollars for establishing a LNG export\nterminal. India asserts that it expects preferential treatment in the Farzad-B field as Indian\nfirms in 2008 had discovered gas in the field. Iran has rejected the arguments for\npreferential treatment to India. This is due to the fact that Iranian sanctions have been\nremoved by US. Iran has almost ended its global isolation and is integrating with the\nworld. This gives Iran a flexible muscle to seek highest bidder for the gas field. Russian\nGazprom and Chinese National Petroleum Corporation have emerged as new potential\nplayers. Iran has been visibly upset with India which allied with US during the sanction\nperiod and reduced oil imports from Iran. India has committed 11 Billion Dollars for the\ndevelopment of the Farzad-B field. As per the Indian policy, today only Indian carriers can\nimport oil from foreign countries. India is going to amend the policy to allow a foreign\nshipping container firm to import oil. India, at the energy security level, is making a shift\nto gas resources and in the process is planning to hire Very Large Container Carriers\n(VLCC) from Japan to import gas from Australia, Russia, Iran and Mozambique. Iran is\nan irreplaceable supply partner for gas. India has also initiated a diplomatic dialogue with\nIran to discuss the possibility of Iran-Oman-India pipeline in the future."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Since the end of the\nCold War, Chabahar port is a component of India’s Grand Strategy. After 1991, the core\nobjective of Indian Foreign Policy was to seek foreign support for economic development\nof India, engage with middle and great powers, normalize India’s engagement in the\nneighborhood and raise India’s profile in external neighborhood (this is the point where\nIran’s Chabahar port comes into play) and finally to improve India’s international\nstanding. The idea of Chabahar port came up in 2003 when Iranian President Khatami\nvisited India and a deal was signed between the two states. For India, Chabahar port\nremains the most important tool that can alter the hostile regional geography that India has\ninherited post partition of India and Pakistan. Post 1947, the partition has deprived India\nof a physical access to Afghanistan and Central Asia. India and Iran developed an interest\nin Afghanistan in 1996 when both opposed Taliban and supported the Northern Alliance.\nPost 2001, India and Iran continued to cement their bilateral relations to reach out to\nCentral Asia and Afghanistan while US encouraged India to reach Central Asia via\nPakistan. As Pakistan continued to deny India overland transit access to Central Asia and\n\nAfghanistan, India decided to make a move with Iran. The significance of the Chabahar\nport for India has gained higher importance after the Chinese announced the China-\nPakistan Economic Corridor under the Belt and Road initiative, Chabahar port allows\nIndia to bypass the geographical limitations imposed by the partition. In 2016, India-\nAfghanistan and Iran concluded the Trilateral Transit and Transport Corridor Treaty.\nUnder the treaty, India has committed 500 Million Dollars to develop the Chabahar port\nand establish railway line infrastructure. The treaty will allow India to access Central Asia\nand will give a boost to the idea of regional connectivity. Iran also favors India’s inclusion\ninto the Ashgabat Agreement. Under the Ashgabat Agreement (Concluded in 2016\nbetween Iran, Turkmenistan, Oman and Uzbekistan), the Persian Gulf will be connected to\nCentral Asia through a direct corridor. Chabahar port for India is not just about access to\nenergy markets of Central Asia but also access to fast growing economies of the Eurasian\nregion and a gambit against history. India may witness some challenges in the endeavor of\ndeveloping the Chabahar port. Firstly, India has to convince private players to use Iran as a\ntransit route to reach Central Asia than China which is the presently used route. Secondly,\nto access the future markets of Central Asia and Eurasian region, Indian exports need to\nbecome more competitive."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

During the era of the ancient Silk Route, Buddhism spread to China\nfrom India. From China, Buddhism also spread to Korea and Japan. There was a dip in\nIndo—Japan relations during medieval times. Yet, the cultural engagement at the level of\nBuddhism continued.\n\nA proper analysis of Indo—Japan relations can be clearly outlined in the period\npreceding and following India’s independence. During the WW-II, Subhash Chandra\nBose formed close ties with the Japanese in his bid to wage a war on the British army.\nBose’s Indian National Army (INA) was the brainchild of Japanese Major (and post-war\nLieutenant-General) Iwaichi Fujiwara, head the Japanese intelligence unit Fujiwara Kikan\nand had its origins, first in the meetings between Fujiwara and the president of the\nBangkok chapter of the Indian Independence League, Pritam Singh Dhillon. Through\nPritam Singh’s network, the recruitment by Fujiwara of a captured British Indian army\ncaptain, Mohan Singh on the western Malayan peninsula in December 1941 also\ncontributed to the cause as Fujiwara’s mission was “to raise an army which would fight\nalongside the Japanese army.” After the initial proposal by Fujiwara the Indian National\nArmy was formed as a result of discussion between Fujiwara and Mohan Singh in the\nsecond half of December 1941, and the name chosen jointly by them in the first week of\nJanuary 1942.\n\nThe INA’s first commitment during the WW-II was in the Japanese thrust towards\nEastern Indian frontiers of Manipur. INA’s special forces, the Bahadur Group, were\nextensively involved in operations behind enemy lines both during the diversionary\nattacks in Arakan, as well as the Japanese thrust towards Imphal and Kohima, along with\nthe Burmese National Army led by Ba Maw and Aung San. The Japanese also took\n\npossession of Andaman and Nicobar Islands in 1942 and a year later, the Provisional\nGovernment and the INA were established in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands with AD\nLoganathan appointed its Governor General. The islands were renamed Shaheed and\nSwaraj. However, the Japanese Navy remained in essential control of the island’s\nadministration. However, Japan’s funding for the INA gradually dwindled and the army\nwas forced to pull back, being defeated and crucial battles and finally capitulating to the\nBritish army. This was followed by Japan’s defeat and eventual capitulation in the World\nWar-Il after the US dropped nuclear bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nPost-independence, it was in the year 1952 that India and Japan concluded a Treaty\nof Peace and Friendship, laying the foundation of India’s new diplomatic relations with\nJapan. However, we need to remember that relations between the two during the Cold War\nwere not warm. One of the key reasons was the ideological difference which separated the\ntwo. India, during the Cold War, was an advocate of Non—Alignment. Japan, on the other\nhand, after the World War-II, concluded the Treaty of San Francisco with USA and tilted\ntowards the capitalist orientation as Japan was economically weak and was undertaking\neconomic reconstruction after the war. India supported Japan with the supply of iron ore.\nIn return, India regularly got economic aid from Japan in the form of ODA (Overseas\nDevelopmental Assistance, also at times called Official Developmental Assistance). In\nfact, by 1986, Japan emerged as the largest economic aid donor to India.\n\nDuring the Cold War, when India faced conflicts with China in 1962 and Pakistan in\n1965 and 1971, the foreign policy stance of Japan towards India remained very neutral.\nThe Japanese never supported India, nor supported its opponents, and chose to not take\nsides. But somehow, Japan being a follower of the US camp in the Cold War, was always\nuncomfortable with India’s tilt to the USSR post-1971. Due to the domestic ferment and\nproblems India had during the Cold War, Japan always perceived India as a chaotic and\ndesperately poor nation, having no potential to be a partner in the near times. Due to\nsuccessive conflicts between India and its neighbours between 1962 and 1971, South East\nand East Asian States branded India as needlessly aggressive. In 1967, when South East\nAsians created the ASEAN (Association of South East Asian Nations), they did not India\nto be a part of the group, which also contributed to India’s larger exclusion from that part\nof the world.\n\nHowever, things did improve between India and Japan after the end of the Cold War.\nThe ending of the Cold War brought about a radical shift in the world policy as also Indian\nForeign Policy. India began to improve its relations with the USA. This also led India to\nimprove its relations with other allies of the USA, including its most important partner in\nthe East, Japan. In the first few years in the post-Cold War period, India began improving\nits relations with Japan but the progress was short lived as in 1998, India carried out\nanother nuclear test and positioned itself as a nuclear weapon state. After the test, Japan\nbecame a vocal critique of India at the regional and international level. Japan even went\non to cut its economic aid to India. It was natural for Japan to condemn such foreign\npolicy behaviour as it had been the only nation in the world to have witnessed the horror\nof an atomic bomb attack first-hand. Post-World War-II, Japan has become a very\npeaceful nation with an acute abhorrence of atomic and nuclear bombs. It perceived the\nIndian nuclear test as an insult to the growing relationship."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

China has\ngradually become powerful at the economic level. A strong Chinese economy has given\nChina a muscle to exercise at the level of military. This economic-cum-military strength of\nChina, which has transformed it to a regional hegemony in Asia, has caused some\nuneasiness in US and its allies in South East and East Asia.\n\nThe USA also has witnessed the rise of China in the Asian continent, and now\nperceives it as a threat to its own global hegemony. Thus, over a period of time, the USA\nhas come to feel the need to contain a rising China by outlining a new vision for Asia. The\nUS perceives Asia as a continent of opportunities. The US has an interest in synchronizing\nitself with Asia for the purpose of its own domestic growth. But at the same time, it\nexpresses concern for its allies who, it feels, are bullied by a rising China. So, the US also\nfeels the need to support its alliance partners through its Pivot to Asia, which uses a\njudicious combination of the USA’s economic, military, strategic and ideological footprint\nin the region. A rough design is provided below:\n\nInternational System\n\nL\n\nThe USA has therefore kept those alliance partners in the ambit which it feels are\nthreatened by China’s power. These nations also individually lack the capacity to tackle\nChina. The USA, under Pivot to Asia, undertakes the responsibility of providing this\n“capacity” (in terms of economic, military, strategic and ideological support) to its allies to\ncontain a rising China. Thus, by virtue of this policy, the US encourages its allies in Asia\nto collectively come together to nullify a strong China.\n\n\nCollective effort after capacity to each actor by US to counter China\n\n<> <>\n=>\n\\ \\ P, |\n\\ a ee A\n\\ ee al /\n% = /\n\nThe US provides capacity to the state actors and encourages them to improve and\ndeepen relationships.

The US and Japan have been closely associated since the Treaty of San\nFrancisco; the US and South Korea have a mutual Defence Treaty; the US and Australia\nare NATO allies and the US has also increased its economic and strategic imprint in India\npost the Indo-US 2008 civilian nuclear deal. All these nations, in some or the other way,\ndirectly or indirectly, are close to the US. Thus, today at the systemic level, if India and\nJapan come closer, it is due to the Pivot to Asia policy. However, it would be wrong to\nconclude that Pivot to Asia is merely a deliberate attempt on the part of the US to contain\nChina. The US has decided to take advantage of a rising Asia and is investing in new\npartnership in Asia for its own economic growth. We may conclude that the Pivot to Asia\nhas, at least, made India a partner, if not an ally, of the US but the policy certainly benefits\nthe US more than any individual state actor in Asia.\n\nRole of Personality Politics in India-Japan\n\nThat the US is a key factor in India—Japan relations is clearly reflected in the interaction of\nthe heads of state of the two sides when they meet. Foreign policy experts have\ncommented that India—Japan relations area classic example of Prime Minister-driven\nrelationship.

As the Indian defence market opens up, Japanese defence\nplayers will see rising presence in India.\n\nIndia has declared Japan as a privileged market partner in Make in India programme.\nShinzo Abe has also proposed a ‘Democratic Security Diamond’ involving Japan, India,\nthe US and Australia. The Diamond shall be the guardian of maritime security from the\nIndian Ocean to western Pacific. One of the reasons why Japan has proposed the Diamond\nis because of declining US power in the region. As China becomes assertive and the US\nwitnesses a gradual decline in its power in Asia, Japan intends to fill the void with a\npartnership with other democratic Asian states. The National Security strategy of Japan\nannounced in 2013 has also included India as a primary driver in maintaining the balance\nof power in Asia disturbed by a rising China. Japanese scholar Dr Satoru Nagao has\nstressed that countries in the Indo-Pacific region are in the midst of a security dilemma\nregarding their maritime projection and are countering this by up scaling production of\nsubmarines, which are considered symbols of tackling statist threats. He emphasised that\nthe coastal countries around the East China Sea have increased the number of submarines\n\nin their naval arsenal in the light of the changing power balance between the US and\nChina. Speaking at the conference on ‘India-Japan Partnership in the Changing Asian\nStrategic Scenario’, organised on March 18, 2016, he further asserted that to mitigate the\nthreat of assertiveness China, Japan should cooperate at the defence level with India,\nwhich is also another rising power in Asia.\n\nOne of the key areas of identified cooperation is at the maritime level. India has\ndecided to buy 12 US-2 Amphibian aircrafts from Japan. The defence cooperation, while\nbeing on the rise, has also brought some concerns. Japan is concerned about its intellectual\nproperty in defence technology transfers. India has convinced Japan of its stellar\nreputation in preventing breaches of intellectual property. Though the US will remain the\nnucleus of Japan’s security policy, India has emerged in the ambit of Japan as a crucial\nplayer for Asian security. Japan mostly follows the USA’s footsteps in its engagement with\nIndia. As India and the USA have signed a LEMOA, it is this which is likely to emerge as\nthe next step in Japan—India defence diplomacy.\n\nDetence Policy Dialogue ~. © 2plus 2 dialogue\n+ Military to Miltary talks\n\nJoint development and 4\n\nDetence technology transter ~,.

Sushma Swaraj, India’s Foreign Minister, rightly\nasserted in 2015 in New York during the first India~Japan—-US trilateral meeting that Japan\nis the very core of India’s Act East Policy and a partner of India’s growth in East Asia.\nIndia initiated its Look East Policy in 1990s to engage with the tiger economies of the\nASEAN. At the end of the Cold War, as the ASEAN expanded and added Cambodia,\nLaos, Myanmar and Vietnam and Thailand, it’s brought the ASEAN at India’s doorsteps.\nIndia began to use this opportunity to cement economic ties in the region. India’s Look\nEast Policy has continued to remain one of the most decorated components of its foreign\n\npolicy.\nSix months after taking office in May, 2014, the Indian PM Narendra Modi, while\naddressing the East Asian Summit in Myanmar, announced India’s Act East Policy, with\n\nan emphasis upon connectivity, culture and commerce. India seeks to move beyond its\nASEAN-centric policy and intends to assert dominance in the Indian and Pacific Oceans.\nIn ordered to achieve this, Japan has assumed a hegemonic position in India’s Act East\nPolicy. Japan too has welcomed India in East Asia and has used multiple instruments to\ndeepen ties with India.\n\nq (US, Japan, Australia, India)\n== __\n7 (Gormany, Japan, Brazil, India)\n\nJapan has effectively used multiple ‘mini-lateral’ forums (as visible in the diagram\nabove) to boost its ties with India. The Quad of G4 has been used to collectively seek a\nUN Security Council Seat. Similarly, the Triangular Ministerial Dialogue was used as a\nmechanism not only to promote public opinion and dialogue but also to foster maritime\ncooperation. The reinterpretation of Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution allows Japan to\nboost strategic cooperation with India. The amended Article 9 (since September 2015)\nallows Japan to send military aid to friendly states (that includes India) if they come under\nattack from another state. This amendment has opened up new avenues of strategic\ndiplomacy between India and Japan. The strengthened Indo—Japan relationship in the\nbackdrop of the Act East Policy is also driven by Chinese assertiveness. Both India and\nJapan want to ensure that Asian decision making is not hijacked by China but remains\ncommitted on the principles of consensus building.

The Japanese PM officially launched Asia-Africa Growth\nCorridor and inaugurated the Mumbai-Ahmedabad High Speed Rail (MAHSR) project.\nThe project heralds a new era of safety, speed and service and will help the Indian\nrailways craft a pathway to becoming a global leader in scale, technology and skill. The\nMAHSR works on an attractive low cost long term financing model. Japan will be\nproviding a soft loan of 90,000 crore Rupees to India at an interest rate of 0.1 percent over\n\n50 years. The re-payment of the loan is to begin after 15 years of receiving the loan. There\nhave been criticisms that such a high speed train in a poverty stricken India is elitist and\nIndia can do without it. Such criticism were there even in 1969 when the first ever\nRajdhani Express train was launched from Howrah to Delhi. However, leapfrogging\ntechnology and development with elitism is unwarranted at this stage. The Japanese PM\nvisited India after the operationalization of the Indo—Japan Nuclear deal. India and Japan\nenvisaged cooperation in the areas of space program. TeamIndus, an Indian aerospace firm\n(backed by Ratan Tata, Nandan Nilekani and Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw), has joined hands\nwith Japan to launch India’s first private satellite in March 2018. The PSLV-XL launch\nwill happen from Sriharikota and will carry a Japanese rover Sorato and Indian rover\nECA. The main engines are sourced from Japan’s IHI Aerospace and Sorato rover is\ndeveloped by iSpace Tokyo. The PSLV of ISRO will inject the spacecraft into an orbit 800\nKM above the surface of the earth and from there, the spacecraft woll set course to the\nmoon by switching on its own engines. When the spacecraft lands on the lunar surface\n(Mare Imbrium), the rovers would be deployed. The visit of the Japanese PM clearly saw\nthe two sides exploring opportunities in areas where both have complimentary strengths.\nThe space partnership will serve as another plank in the effort to present a counter to\nBeijing while for New Delhi, it will be a spring board for a bigger role in the global arena.\nThe two sides exchanged a Record of Discussion(ROD) on cooperation with respect to\nopen skies (enabling the two states to mount unlimited flights to each other’s countries).\nMaritime cooperation has emerged as a new area between the two. Historically India has\nalways perceived the Indian Ocean as its exclusive sphere of influence (which China has\nnever accepted) and India believed that no power could challenge its position in the Indian\nocean. However, China, due to its aggressive economic growth in the recent decades, has\ndeveloped a might to challenge the Indian influence amongst the maritime neighbors of\nIndia like Pakistan (through the CPEC), Djibouti (the first Chinese naval base in Indian\nOcean) and Sri Lanka (as visible in Hambantota port). India desperately needs to counter\nthese but doesn’t really have the economic bandwidth to match the geopolitical needs.\nThis is where Japan steps in to assist India (as it gives Japan an opportunity to expand is\nown influence in the Indian Ocean)."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

It has undergone a tremendous transformation, to understand which, an analysis of\ntheir relations during the Cold War is necessary. We begin our study from World War-II\nera. For the US, in the interwar period, India did not have any economic or strategic\nsignificance. As India was then a British colony, the communication between India and the\nUS at an independent level was impossible. It was F D Roosevelt who realised that India\ncan play an important role in the World War-II. According to Roosevelt, India could act as\na block to resist Japanese aggression in South Asia and provide the needed resistance for\nwar efforts. In order to ensure that India participates in the World War-II, the nationalist\nleaders of India were to be taken into confidence. The nationalists stuck to one particular\npoint—that India would support war efforts provided the British give them independence\nin return. Roosevelt, for that matter, took up the Indian issue with Churchill. The British\ndid not appreciate the US prodding their affairs, which resulted in some tension in the US—\nBritish alliance. As far as the US was concerned, it was of the opinion that as the allied\npowers are fighting for independence and right to self-determination (RTSD), they should\nalso in turn liberate their colonies, who were fighting imperialism for the same reasons.\n\nIn fact, the fundamental disagreement over India can be best elaborated if we look at\nhow the US and the British viewed the Atlantic Charter (AC), which was a pivotal policy\nstatement issued during World War-II on 14 August 1941, which defined the Allied goals\nfor the post-war world. The leaders of the United Kingdom and the United States drafted\nthe work and all the Allies later ratified it. The Charter stated the ideal goals of the war—\nNo territorial aggrandisement; no territorial changes made against the wishes of the people;\nself-determination; restoration of self-government to those deprived of it; reduction of\ntrade restrictions; global cooperation to secure better economic and social conditions for\nall; freedom from fear and want; freedom of the seas; and abandonment of the use of\nforce, as well as disarmament of aggressor nations.

Firstly, some Indian students who used to visit the US\nbegan to popularise the cause of national movement. Secondly, eminent personalities\nfrom India, such as Rabindranath Tagore and Swami Vivekananda, also visited US,\nwhich created an awareness about this faraway colonial space in the consciousness of\nUS citizens. However, this was also the time when the US was very favourably\ninclined to the British and did not take the Indian national movement very seriously.\nAn important role in popularisation of the national movement was played by\nAmerican missionaries. A lot of missionaries had over a period of time come to India.\nThey prepared reports on the national movement. They also wrote extensively about\nthe dissent that the Indian people had developed against the British government. This\n\nhelped in taking the national movement to the educated masses of the US.\n\nAs India became independent, a new irritant that emerged between India and the US\nwas the issue of Kashmir. Difference also arose over the question of national priorities.\nThe US advocated military buildup to contain the Soviets while India refrained from the\nlogic of containment with a focus on economy and a stable international order.\n\nKashmir was the more pressing issue. Kashmir was given an option to join India or\nPakistan. It was ruled by Hari Singh, who initially showed reluctance to join either India\nor Pakistan and began to negotiate a standstill agreement with both. India rejected any\nstandstill agreement while Pakistan accepted the idea of standstill agreement. The\nacceptance of Pakistan was based on the assumption that a standstill agreement meant that\ninitially, rail, postal, telegraph areas would be with Hari Singh but defence and foreign\npolicy decisions would lie with Pakistan. Pakistan thought that this arrangement would\npave way for the accession of Kashmir with them. Hari Singh was not comfortable with\nPakistani interference and began to stall the standstill agreement. Pakistan thought Hari\nSingh was secretly negotiating with India and was therefore beginning to stall the\nstandstill agreement. While all this was underway, communal riots broke out in Jammu.\nPakistan thought India would take advantage of the riots and send in security forces and\nresponded with a pre-emptive attack by sending soldiers disguised as tribesmen in\nKashmir and began an invasion. As the rebellion of tribals erupted, Hari Singh appealed to\nIndia for help, to which Nehru responded and on 26th October, 1947, sent in Indian troops\nto take charge of Kashmir.\n\nUpon the insistence of the US, India took the matter to the UN. India opined that the\nUN would urge Pakistan to halt aggression and withdraw forces. In the meantime, India\nsent an extensive combat operation in Kashmir. By the time Indian troops entered\nKashmir, Pakistan had occupied two-thirds of Kashmir. India continued to advocate a\ndiplomatic solution through the UN. The British certainly did not favour escalation and\nthey tilted to support Pakistan out of its own interest. The British, at the end of World\nWar-II, had handed over the Mandate of Palestine to the UN, which had upset the Arabs.\nThe British thought that if they also alienate Kashmir, it would upset equations in the\nMiddle East as Pakistan had just emerged as an Islamic state. Though the British wanted a\npeaceful and acceptable solution to the Kashmir dispute, they were reluctant to drag the\nissue further. The British decided to seek US assistance. The US itself was not keen on\nmeddling into Asian affairs and was initially reluctant. However, to respect its alliance\nwith the British, the US began to develop a position similar to the British position on the\nmatter. They also advocated a plebiscite and a political solution. The US even warned\nIndia that if India did not cooperate, it could have consequences for the Indo-US relations.\nIndia, in contrast, insisted that it did not need goodwill of any nation and it could anyway\ndevelop proximity to the Soviets. India resented the Anglo-American axis and perceived\nthe US policy on Kashmir as an extension of the colonial legacy. As the Cold War\ndeepened, the US came to appreciate the fact that the India way was a democratic one and\nthey shared this value with India. They also realised that India is geographically proximate\nto communist China. The US began to give economic aid to India to target communist\nChina. In the process, when in 1962, the Indo-China conflict took place, the US supported\nIndia and even decided at one time to supply military equipment and weapons. However,\nas China declared a unilateral ceasefire, the delivery of US weapons was not necessitated.\n\nIndia did appreciate US support but made it clear that it would not support either the US or\nthe USSR and would continue with its non-alignment policy.\n\nHowever, it is noteworthy that India, under NAM, was not particularly neutral in\npractice, but was actually anti-US, with a tilt towards the Soviet camp. There were two\nreasons why India preferred the Soviet Union over the US. Firstly, India was deeply\naffected due to colonialism. The Indian psyche was so severely affected, that colonialism\nwas not something it would ever admire or condone. When India analysed the past, it\nestablished an understanding that the USSR was better than the western imperial powers\nand their ally, the US, as it lacked any colonial history. Secondly, India appreciated the\nSoviet model of industrialisation and was favourably inclined to a state-led model as\ncontrast to the free market model of the US. India was, at this point, yet to understand the\nunderside of the kind of oppressive communism practised by Stalin or the conditions to\nwhich the satellite states of the USSR were being subjected under the communist regime.\n\nAmerican fears got further exacerbated post-1971. At the strategic level, after the\ntreaty with the Soviet Union in 1971, the USSR extended its security blanket to India\nagainst any future military threat. The USSR also continued to give arms to India. During\nthe period of the Cold War, as India adopted a closed economy, it held little appeal for the\nUS. The US could not take up any serious economic engagement due to the different\neconomic model adopted by India. As Indian economy was relatively weak, it could not\nestablish a strong military. The absence of a strong military meant that India did not pose a\ndirect challenge to any interest of the US in Asia. Another factor that added to the neglect\nof Indo-US relations was Pakistan. Pakistan became an ally of the US (through SEATO-\n1954 and CENTO-1955). Pakistani territory was used by the US as a military base for the\ncontainment of the USSR. The US—Pakistan axis contributed significantly in reducing the\nscope of India-US. India’s worst apprehensions came true in 1971 when Nixon heavily\ntilted to help Pakistan in the East Pakistan crisis by sending in the USS Enterprise. For\nmany decades, India established a negative perception of the US as it had been an Indian\nenemy in war. The testing of nuclear weapon in 1974 by India took Indo-US relations to a\nnew low and the two could not evolve consensus on nuclear non-proliferation. The period\nof the Cold War subsequently remained a low phase in Indo—US engagement."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

In\n1991, the US army Chief Claude Kicklighter visited India and presented the famous\nKicklighter proposals. As per the proposals, defence cooperation between the US and the\nIndian army was envisaged and an executive steering group for navy (in 1992) and Air\nForce (in 1993) was to be undertaken. This was followed by Malabar I, Malabar II, and\nMalabar III naval exercises. In 1995, agreed minutes for the expansion of defence\ncooperation between the US and Indian defence departments and service-to-service\nmilitary exchanges were undertaken. In 2005, it evolved into a new framework for Indo—\nUS defence trade, amounting, in recent times to over 9 billion dollars. In 2010, the Indo—\nUS counter terrorism cooperation initiative was launched. It has focus areas like capacity\nbuilding, mega city policing, cyber security and so forth. In 2013, the Joint Principles for\nDefence Cooperation was agreed upon to ensure technology transfers and defence trade. A\n\ndefence policy group had been established which acts as a guide for defence cooperation\nbetween India and the US.\n\nIndia has purchased eight Boeing P-8-I multi-mission marine aircrafts from the US.\nIn April, 2016, the US Defence Secretary Ashton Carter visited India to boost defence\ncooperation. The US and India agreed on two pathfinder projects. They will jointly\nestablish the Digital Helmet mounted display and joint biological tactical detection\nsystem. There is cooperation on next generation protective ensemble suit for soldiers to be\nused in nuclear and chemical warfare. The two will also cooperate on mobile electronic\nhybrid power sources and launch micro drones for surveillance in battlefield. Since 2012,\nthere was a Defence Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI) in place and in 2014 came\nthe Indo-US Declaration on Defence Cooperation. During Obama’s 2015 visit to India, a\nDefence Framework for India-US—which had been argued for 10 years, and a joint\nstrategic vision for the Asia—Pacific and the Indian Ocean region—was concluded. The\ncore components of DTTI are Defence Cooperation, R&D, Defence Trade and Co-\ndevelopment of equipments.\n\nIn January 2015, the Pentagon established an India Rapid Reaction cell as a country-\nspecific cell for bilateral cooperation with India. The aim is to move beyond the buyer—\nseller dynamics and go for technology transfers. In March 2016, the US-India Defence\nTechnology and Partnership Act was introduced in the US. This will institutionalise the\nDTTI and India Rapid Reaction Cell. During the visit of Ashton Carter, the principles of\nunderstanding were laid for a Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA).\nThe LEMOA was finally concluded during John Kerry’s visit to India on 30th August,\n2016, which coincided with the Indian Defence Minister’s visit to the US.\n\nIn-depth Analysis\n\nThe origin of security cooperation between India and US in the modern times owes its\norigin to the Indian Ocean Tsunami of 2004. As the Tsunami struck Sri Lanka, Indonesia,\nMaldives, and other areas, the Indian Navy immediately launched a mega disaster relief\noperation. This humanitarianism intervention of the Indian Navy received support from\nthe US Navy as well. The two decided to work together to provide immediate post-disaster\nrelief. The joint experience gave rise to an emerging bilateral security cooperation which\nhad never been witnessed before. The US appreciated the Indian Navy’s swiftness while\nIndia appreciated the American Navy’s professionalism and logistics. This led the two\nsides to establish cooperation at the dimension of naval diplomacy with humanitarian\napplications. The consolidation of this security cooperation is still an ongoing process and\nthe conclusion of the Logistical Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) in 2016\nis a step in the same direction. However, we shall also figure out reasons why security\nremains a weak dimension in the Indo-US bilateral ties. One reason for security being an\narea of disconnect is how both perceive their global roles. The US, since the end of the\nWW-II, favours a system where its friend and allies collectively defend freedom and work\ncooperatively on dimensions of strategic interest. However, India’s global aspirations are\npremised upon its historic greatness and its quest for maintaining strategic autonomy. At\nthe philosophical level, the US favours aggressive changes to strategic situations.\n\n» India-US Defense Framework\nIndia-US Delence Agreements ~ ED\n™ India-US Defense sales\n\nLet us now consider the India-US Defence Framework. The first ever step towards\ndefense diplomacy between India and US was seen in 1962 when India had a conflict with\nChina. At that time Nehru, in a letter to John F Kennedy, had sought US military help. The\nthen Foreign Secretary General of India, M J Desai, had conveyed categorically to the\nthen US ambassador to India, John Kenneth Galbraith, that India would seek military aid\nfrom the US provided that the US does not insist on alliance formation. The US had\nagreed to immediately order military supply to be airlifted to India. However, this initial\ncooperation was perceived by the two sides very differently. The US saw the Sino—Indian\nconflict as an exercise that would allow the US to explore a common working ground with\nIndia. For the Indians, it was limited assistance and much lesser than what they expected,\nwhich also eventually was stopped in 1965 when war with Pakistan broke out. For India,\nthe cooperation was insignificant in contrast to Indian cooperation with the USSR. Since\nthe end of the Cold War, both India and the US have steadily improved their security\ncooperation. However, the difference in the structure of defence establishments in India\nand the US often create different worldviews, thereby, at times, causing friction in the\nprocess of security cooperation. In India, the civilian bureaucrats, often with no experience\nin national security, have an upper hand while in the US, it’s the military officials who\nhave an upper hand in military diplomacy. In 1991, the commander of US Army Pacific,\nClaude Kicklighter, sent a proposal to the chief of Indian Army General Sunith Francis\nRodriguez. These proposals were known as the Kicklighter proposals and envisaged\nbilateral visits, training and conferences between India and the US. An important\ndimension also was the participation of India in regional conferences sponsored by the\nUS. A new Defence Policy Group was also established. The approval for the Kicklighter\nproposals had to come from Indian Ministry of Defence. The clearances came very slowly\nand painfully. This highlighted to the US, the difference in the Indian approach at the\ndefence level. The next level of defence cooperation came up in 1995 when the two sides\nconcluded an agreement called the Agreement Minute on Defence Relations. This marked\na new dimension of strategic cooperation between India and the US. The US officials were\nagain puzzled in 1995 as this deal too was negotiated by the civilian bureaucracy and was\nagain slow in process. After delays in drafting the document, in 1995 finally just a month\nbefore the visit of Secretary Perry from the US to India, the document was prepared. It\nenvisaged three broad dimensions for cooperation.\n\nJoint exercises Civilian to civilian bilateral cooperation\nBaateral defense visits ~ ~ Military to mittary bilateral cooperation\nBilateral detense exercises ~ Cooperation in detense production and research\n\nThough a framework had been established, at the time of implementation there was a\nperceived gap in the objectives that each side intended to achieve. For the Indian civilian\nbureaucracy, technology access was the core objective while the Indian military envisaged\naccess to specialised courses and equipment. On the other hand, the US officials wanted\nmilitary contacts with future interoperability as the objective. The defence relations were\n\nfurther enhanced in 2005 when the two sides concluded a framework agreement where\nboth, for the first time, accepted common interests and shared beliefs in values like\nfreedom, democracy and the rule of law. There was a decision taken to give a public\ncharacter to the emerging bilateral relationship. The 2005 agreement identified thirteen\nbroad activities that both sides decided to envisage bilaterally. A dimension of cooperation\nin missile defence was added in the 2005 agreement.\n\nBoth sides to exchange gr Wayonragenen\n\nbitateral experiences =~\nor Focuses on technology transfers\n\nBoth sides to focus on “ « ‘Mentions coproduction projects in defense:\nsharing practices in ~ *\ndotense piattorms Joint strategic vision for the Indian Ocean\n\nCore thrust on interoperability\nWith the coming of the Modi government in 2014, India and the US concluded a ten-\nyear framework agreement for defence cooperation in 2015.

In 2013, the US Deputy Secretary of Defence, Ashton Carter envisaged a\nDTI with India. India perceived the DTI as majorly a Defence Technology Initiative while\nfor the US, it was more a Defence Trade Initiative. The initiative was finally called the\nDTTI or Defence Technology and Trade Initiative.\n\nEnhances india's operational capabilites\nnaa ores ~ Cooperation on Aitcrat carriers\n= Cooperation in Jet Engine Technology\n\nFocus is on co-production, joint\nresearch and co-development\n\nCooperative R&D in delense\nExpansion of bilateral business ties + ™ Support to Make in incia\n\n™ India be designated as a major defense\npartner (on par with other NATO states)\n\nFrom the Indian perspective, the core goal of defence engagement with the US is\nbased on transfer of sophisticated military technology from the US to India for supporting\ndomestic development of defence equipments. India believes that any military diplomacy\nwith a foreign state should assist the Indian defence industry to undertake production of\ntechnology in India. For India, the maintenance of a credible strategic autonomy is\npossible only if India develops a capable defence industry domestically. For the US, its\ndefence diplomacy with India is to establish a long-term relationship that would allow\nboth India and the US to jointly address contingencies in the region that may arise in the\nfuture. For the US, if India purchases defence products from them and uses their\n\nequipments, then interoperability gets drastically enhanced. For this, the US favours more\nbilateral military exercises to establish technical interoperability.\n\nSome Indian officials do not share this point of view. India, in recent times, has\nstarted positioning itself as a net security provider in the Indian Ocean region as an\nextension to India’s quest of regional supremacy. Indian officials believe that any\ninteroperability with the US will be an unwanted intrusion into sovereign Indian space.\nIndians favour a one-time transaction over establishing a partnership with the US as they\nstill perceive the US as an unreliable supplier. This is because, as per US laws, the US\nCongress, even before the transaction is consummated, can block or amend a sale\nagreement through legislation. A precedent can be cited in the way, after the 1974 nuclear\ntest by India, the US halted fuel supply to the Tarapur Plant despite a thirty-year supply\nagreement. Though the bilateral Indo-US Defence Trade does not require licensing\nanywhere, there is a perception amongst the Indian side that the US Arms Export Control\nAct will act as a burden on defence purchases made by India.\n\nUS export contro! system is - ». Tag of being an\nrigged, as perceived by India unretiable supplier\n\nFor India, any procurement it makes should have the following:\n\n_e Technology transfers\nNo corruption ~_\n» Defense sales as per norms\n\n“> Joint defense production\nNo deviation from\nthe procedural norms ~*~\n\nOftsets\n\nThe US officials also face difficulty in negotiating prices with Indians. Indian\nDefence Procurement Policies have no concept related to life-cycle costs. The US\nequipment is costly. While the pre-bid phase of acquiring technology is on, India favour\ndeals on the basis of fixed costs. The US suppliers, on the other hand, assert that they do\noffer expensive equipment but later, the costs can come down when it comes to contracts\nfor long-term maintenance as they see a product through its complete life cycle. Thus, the\nUS suppliers favour ‘life cycle costs’-based bidding while the Indians are sceptical about\nsuch moves. Furthermore, India favours more customisation of equipment owing to the\nbroad variety of conditions in which the Indian military operates. The Israeli and French\nbidders excel in coordination over their US counterparts. India is also very particular in\nensuring that bidders meet all specifications at the evaluation stage—even if one\nspecification is not complied with, India rejects the bidder. The coming of Ashton Carter\nhelped in making the US defence system more user-friendly for India. India was brought\nunder the Strategic Trade Authorisation Group of countries, enabling defence trade with\nno license for a few products. He focused on coproduction at maritime and air levels,\nwhich was highly appreciated by India. In conclusion, few broad themes can be outlined\nhere.\n\nIndia focuses on sovereignty\n‘Support by the foreign player in we and not alliances\naes .> India favors the rule book\n\nPolitical loadershi role\nIndia aims for joint production ee Seu eee\n\n| Cold war suspicion of US\ncontinues as a hangover\n\nIndia wants technology transfers"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The deal signifies a quantum leap in the\nrelations from suspicion during the Cold War to strategic partnership in the 21st century.\nThe subsequent approval of the deal by the US Congress clearly signifies that the new\nIndia-US partnership enjoys a broad spectrum of approval within the US. All these\ndevelopments have happened despite India sticking to its stand of not signing the\ndiscriminatory NPT. The kind of aggression showed by Bush somehow has not been\n\ncarried forward by Obama. The Obama regime took up traditional issues related to global\nnon-proliferation around the NPT. However, the Nuclear Security Summits under The\nPrague Initiative of Obama, along with a new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with\nRussia and new Nuclear Posture Review, had created some discomfort in India not\nbecause they are steps for a strong global non-proliferation regime but because they were\ncentred around the NPT and the CTBT which India refuses to ratify.\n\nAt a broader level, we need to understand the changing dynamics in Asia. Since the\nend of Cold War, China has gradually acquired economic and military strength and has\nresorted to incursions along the Line of Actual Control between India and China. This has\nincreased bilateral tensions. The Indian psyche still is affected with the defeat of 1962 and\nsuspicions about China’s intentions remains high. The growing proximity of India and the\nUS is something China is uncomfortable with as the proximity is designed to contain its\ngrowth potential. This is not completely wrong as both India and US certainly favour an\nopen Asian order which is not threatened by any regional hegemony. Any country which\nwould prevent any Asian player to access productive gains from other Asian states would\nnot be appreciated either by India or the US. Keeping this in mind, the Indo-US nuclear\ndeal and rising strategic convergence between India and the US would seek to ensure that\nChina does not single handedly dominate the Asia—Pacific and that the region remains free\nfrom dominance by any one nation.\n\nIn-depth Analysis\n\nOne of the key structural determinants of the US-India Entente has been the economic\nregeneration of India since the end of the Cold War. However, the limitations on a deeper\ncooperation were placed due to the reluctance of the US to reconcile the nuclear status of\nIndia. The 1998 nuclear test by India was a serious jolt to the ongoing regeneration of the\nrelationship. The US did not envisage any comprehensive alternative to the goal of nuclear\nnon-proliferation yet wanted to improve relations with India. The subsequent Jaswant\nSingh and Strobe Talbot talks set in motion a new phase of bilateral engagement between\nthe two states. As the ties witnessed an upswing, the announcement of Next Steps in\nStrategic Partnership in 2004 harbingered a new foundation in the relationship. The\nrelationship has flourished in all directions ranging from commercial trade to naval\nexercises to the recently concluded logistical agreement.\n\na Strong Indo-US alliance\n- = Against arc of Islamic instability trom Middle East to Asia\nS To create a greater balance in Asia\n\nThe Bush administration, through the Indo-US nuclear deal, resolved the\nfundamental obstacle in the transfer of nuclear and high-end technology, thereby enabling\nIndia and the US to reach the full potential of their bilateral ties. The international realities\nhave changed since the end of the Cold War. As the US policed the region of Asia and the\nworld, China used the opportunity to undertake economic development. At the theoretical\nlevel, there is no consensus amongst scholars on the question of the political supremacy of\nthe US. Scholars do believe that the US is a dominant power but for how long this\ndominance would last is a concern.\n\nInternational system is\n\n# anarchy\n- Material capabilites:\ndefine power\nMulti polar ati are States in the international\ninheronty unstable ‘System strive to maintain\n‘thew power\n\nBased on the realist’s explanation of the international order, it is believed that the\npost-Cold War period is likely to be of unstable international order.\n\nUS to maintain its power\nmay “_. awar\n\nChina ied a rising power is\n:\nBoth US and China may maximise\npower against each other\n\n\\ikly to initiate war\n* Unstable International order\n\nAs a confrontation between the US and China will destabilise the Asia—Pacific, both\nsides have resorted to expand their influence. The Pivot to Asia of the US is being\nmatched with the One Belt and One Road initiative of China. The change in the balance of\npower in the region compelled Bush administration to accept the ground realities and\ninitiate strategic recalibration. The strategy of the US, as visible under Pivot to Asia, is to\ncontinue to engage with China and also increase the power of the states in the periphery of\nChina. It is in this context that the US has also decided to reach out to new partners like\nIndia in a way never previously envisioned. The US has also always held Japan as a key\npartner in Asia. As China rises, the proximity of the US, India and Japan is likely to fuel\nmore tensions in the region. The recently concluded India~Japan nuclear deal (2016) is\nlikely to further enhance Japanese position in Asia. The goal that India and Japan are\ntrying to achieve through their cooperation is to ensure that China becomes more\ncooperative as both view China as a military threat. The recent assertion of China in South\nChina Sea and China defining territorial waters as its core national interest has further\nincreased the fears of the regional states. After China’s reluctance to accept the verdict of\nthe Permanent Court of Arbitration in 2016, the regional states feel that China may block\nthe economic lifeline of the states that have maritime passages. China has also refused to\nallow India membership to the Nuclear Supplier Group. China’s increasing influence in\nPakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Myanmar are attempts to prevent the rise of India as an\nimportant regional and global player.\n\n.~ US may maintain its power\n\nTo tackle this challenge, India has decided to adopt a new approach towards the US.\nThe Bush administration, by giving India the nuclear deal, has successfully incorporated\nIndia into the global nuclear order and has encouraged India to emerge as a great power in\nthe future. Thus, shifts in the global balance of power have encouraged the US and India\n\nto reorient their foreign policies and the nuclear deal is the most important symbol of this\nnew partnership. Earlier, the visit of Bill Clinton to India in the 1990s had provided a new\nimpetus to the relationship where Clinton and Vajpayee adopted a new vision for the 21st\ncentury. A purposeful direction in the Indo-US ties was introduced by the subsequent\nBush administration, which began to view India as a strategic ally and refused to look to\nIndia solely through the lens of non-proliferation.\n\nIn 2005, Condoleezza Rice visited India to push for an unprecedented framework of\ncooperation with India. This took India by surprise but the Bush administration eventually\nannounced civilian nuclear cooperation with India to help India emerge as a world power.\nAfter 9/11, Bush redefined how the US saw non-proliferation. The idea was that some\nstates could not be trusted with nuclear weapons due to their unstable political regime\ndomestically, while states like India, which have an impeccable non-proliferation policy to\nrestore readability at the level of global non-proliferation norms, could be allowed nuclear\naccess. The announcement of NSSP is deemed to be the game changer.\n\n_or Defense cooperation\nTechnology transfers ._ _y Bilateral cooperation\nDual use technology <___\n\n“~* Commercial ties\n\nBasis of the nuclear deal ~\n* Space cooperation\n\nvy\nCivil Nuclear Cooperation\n\nBush realised that marginalising India would not benefit the nuclear non-proliferation\norder as he believed that the character of the regime was a more important determinant\nthan a stand on a treaty to decide nuclear technology transfers. A nuclear deal successfully\nde-hyphenated India and Pakistan and gave India the de facto status of a nuclear weapon\nstate. The change of the administration from Bush to Obama created some uneasiness\namongst the Indian establishment. Bush looked at India as a new strategic landscape,\nwhile Obama, in his Pivot to Asia, did not look at India as a strategic player. What upset\nIndia further was Obama’s toying with the idea of G—2 consisting of the US and China,\nallowing China the leverage to manage its dominance over the Asia—Pacific. What\naggravated tensions further was the fact that, during Obama’s visit to China, he made a\nreference to giving Beijing a lever in settling disputes between Pakistan and India.\n\nObama did, however, try to allay some fears by announcing support to India’s\ncandidature at the UN Security Council during his visit to India in November 2010.\n\nThe domestic groups\nin order to adopt —__ Proper management\nA ” favourable policies 2\ne apply pressure tactics\nPp\n\nTo satisfy domestic Lo\n= —> pressures, national joper management\ngovernments seek to\nmaximise their abilities\n\n“~* Absorb concerns of societal actors\n\n\\.“S Build coalitions at domestic level\n\nInternational level concerns\n\nAt the national level in India, the BJP criticised the deal by advocating that separation\nof civilian and military installations (as committed by India under the deal) would compel\nIndia to incur huge costs. The Left parties which were in a coalition with the government\nof the day criticised the deal for renunciation of India’s long held policy of nuclear\ndisarmament and of non-alignment.\n\nCooperation in high energy\nnuclear physics, plant design, Adherence to NSG and\noperation, satety and regulatior MTCR guidelines:\n¥. *\n\nUS and India to cooperate India would separate civilian and\non FMCT conclusion . - miltary installations\nUnilateral moratorium = = Separation would be done in a\n\non further testing phased manner\nri “Civitan facilites wal be placed under\n‘Stringent non proliferation t\nexport controls to continue ‘ Se eee ee\nSigning of Additional\nProtocols for civihan facilities\n\nThe starkest criticism of the deal came from the scientific community. The\ndepartment of atomic energy strongly resisted the putting of fast breeder programmes\nunder the civilian list. The government worked hard to remove and address the concerns\nof the scientific establishment. At the international level, India at the time of its deal, had\nto confront Iran. The US and Iran did not have a comfortable relationship as the US was\ndeeply concerned about the Iranian nuclear programme. India was, on the other hand,\nreluctant to undermine its relations with Iran although it could not jeopardise a growing\nstrategic partnership that had begun with the US in favour of Iran. India voted against Iran\nin 2006 at the IAEA voting. India clarified that when India had conducted a nuclear test in\n1998, Iran had favoured a UNSC resolution asking India to put a cap on its nuclear\ncapabilities and had urged India to sign the NPT and the CTBT. There are many things\nabout Iran which caused discomfiture to India. India, however, did not turn aggressive\ntowards Iran and maintained that Iran was a great friend to India, while pushing for\nresolving the Iranian nuclear issue through diplomacy. India used the IAEA and Iran’s\nprogramme to highlight the role of A Q Khan and of Pakistan as a proliferators state. India\nsponsored the US/EU-favoured resolution, recommending Iran to be examined as a case\nby the IAEA. India clarified that its vote was to prevent vitality in the Middle East and had\n\nno relation with Indo-US cooperation.\n\nTo place the Indian scientific community, the then Indian PM Manmohan Singh\ndeclared in the Indian Parliament that India’s Fast Breeder Reactor (FBR) would not be\nput under international inspections of the IAEA and the FBRs would not constitute\nelements under the civilian list. India succeeded in this hard bargain with US.\n\nUS will give India Fast Breeder Reactors (FBR)\nuninterrupted fuel supply ot to be under civilian lst\n© FBR not open for IAEA inspections\n\nIndia reserves explict nght to reprocess nuclear\n~ fuel in civilian facilities in a new facility\nsubject to IAEA safeguards\n\n»\n\n14 out of 22 reactors were »\n\ndesignated as civikan reactors India reserves the right to construct FBR and decide on\ninciusion of exctusion tor international inspections.\n\nWith the bargain successfully undertaken, India signed the agreement on 1st March,\n2006, achieving a judicious balance between the energy security and national interests.\nThe conclusion of the 123 agreement (based on section 123 of the US Atomic Energy Act)\nbecame the touchstone of Indo-US partnership. In the deal, India has not made mention of\nany provision related to the testing of a nuclear weapon which is likely to impact the deal,\nbut the US President, under the Atomic Energy Act, is bound to ask for a return of nuclear\ntechnology if India tests a nuclear weapon. As the deal went through within India, the\nCongress Party witnessed a lot of trouble in getting ratification due to stiff opposition by\nthe leftist parties who were a part of the ruling coalition government. The ruling Congress\nparty was able to garner support from the Samajwadi Party and was thus able to push the\ndeal ahead even after the leftist parties withdrew their support to the ruling coalition. The\ndeal survived but exposed the opposition that came from within the Congress coalition.\nMany in the US Congress, on the other hand, did not favour the idea of making an\nexception of India by providing it with nuclear technology despite it not being a signatory\nof the NPT. Many believed that a nuclear deal to India would convey to the world that the\nUS lacks commitment to its broad goals of non-proliferation.\n\nThe biggest concerns for the US Congress were that such an exception in case of\nIndia will open up other states’ demands to such technology and would adversely affect\nthe global safeguard of non-proliferation. Under the NPT, there is no such clause where an\nNPT signatory cannot sell nuclear technology to non-NPT signatories. The Central\nIntelligence Agency of the US was entrusted with the task of making an assessment of the\nnuclear programme of India. The National Intelligence Council also gave briefings to the\nUS Congress in the same regard. As the US tried to tackle the dissidents within, the\nhearing that happened in the US Congress on the issue of the nuclear pact revealed that a\nmajority of the members testified before the House International Relations Committee that\nsuch a pact would weaken the overall international non-proliferation regime that the US\nhad spent decades building. On the other hand, Ashley Tellis argued that the deal did\nstrengthen USA’s efforts on non-proliferation and a pact with India would enhance the\nnational security of US. The vocal criticism in the US Senate Foreign Relations\nCommittee was outlined by Senator Richard Lugar and he opened his statement by urging\nto the Senate that India does not have a very satisfying nuclear record. He also made\nreferences to Indian violation of bilateral pledges in 1974. He outlined a four-point\n\nbenchmark for the US Congress’s consent to the pact.\n\nThe impact of the pact on Iran, Wy is the nuciear pact important and\nNorth Korea and export ow does it strength Indo-US\npolicies of China, ete strategic cooperation?\n‘The impact on the NPT 4. In what way does the Joint Statement\nof the Indo-US pact addresses the concerns US has\n\nover Indian nuclear programme\n\nThe Bush administration, in its response to the Foreign Relations committee,\nadmitted that the US could not establish a clear cut link if CIRUS reactor had violated\nUS-India contract of 1956 on the use of heavy water. The administration asserted that\nderiving a conclusive answer to whether the plutonium generated by India happened from\nheavy water supplied by the US for the CIRUS reactor was not possible. The biggest\nreason for such criticism in the US Congress and the foreign policy bureaucracy was the\nreluctance of Bush to consult the two before embarking upon the nuclear deal with India.\nThe Bush administration understood that taking an incremental approach to the deal, in\nsync with the bureaucracy and the US Congress, would have knocked down the initiative.\nThis is the reason that Condoleezza Rice resorted to the ‘Big Bang’ announcement and\ncompared the deal with India at par with Nixon’s opening to China. However, all\nopposition was managed when the Republicans lost majority in the Congress and the\nSenate signed the nuclear deal, thereby culminating in the three-year process.\n\nThe US subsequently pressed for an India-specific waiver. The US was able to\nassuage the NSG members and succeeded in the NSG-specific waiver for India. On 8th\nOctober, 2008, the US President signed the US-India Nuclear Cooperation Approval and\nNon-Proliferation Enhancement Act. Great power politics and nuclear non-proliferation\nare the two competing imperatives of the US foreign policy that created such difficulty in\nthe negotiation of the Indo-US nuclear deal. Both India and the US perceived the deal\nvery differently. For the Bush administration, the deal was a bridge to establish a strategic\npartnership with India, while, for Indian establishment, it was a mechanism to reach the\nglobal nuclear mainstream and a step towards great power status. However, from our\nanalysis of the nuclear deal in this section, we can clearly infer that the Indo-US nuclear\ndeal is not just about nuclear technicalities but the emergence of a new global balance of\npower which highlights the strategic considerations of great powers related to nuclear non-\nproliferation. The Bush administration clearly perceived the nuclear deal as a means\ntowards helping India emerge as a global player and therefore, the institutional\nimperatives of the non-proliferation regime were once again trumped by the global\npolitical realities.\n\nThe major issue of disagreement on the Indian side was related to India’s nuclear\nweapon programme. Indian PM Manmohan Singh assured the Parliament that the Indo—\nUS deal in no way affects Indian deterrence potential. India made it clear that the core\nissues while negotiating the 123 agreement that had to be taken into consideration were as\nfollows:\n\nFreedom of India to reprocess the spent fuel\n\nConsequences of potential a\nnuclear test on the deal Autonomy of the nuclear\nweapons programme\nUS to satisty core issues raised by Maintaining intogrity of three stage\nIndia to allow India to gamer = - petiear progranwme\n‘domestic support for the deal muciear power\nr  Sateguarding indigenous research\nNo constraint on long term opton “ ba\nof Indian national security\n\nSateguarding Fast Brooder Reactors\n\nAs intensive negotiations happened on these core issues, the terms of 123 agreements\nwere finally accepted. The US agreed to assist India in the development of a strategic fuel\nreserve and ensure uninterrupted supply of nuclear fuel. India was allowed to establish a\nnew facility subject to the IAEA safeguards to reprocess the spent fuel from the civilian\nreactors. The US president, as per the Atomic Energy Act of the US, remains bound to\nseek complete return of nuclear material in case of any violation, but the Indo—US deal did\nnot make any reference as such for the same. However, the US would not hamper or create\nany hindrance in the growth of the nuclear weapons programme of India. In fact, India\nundertook aggressive diplomacy to ensure that if India tests a nuclear weapon, the US\nwould not suddenly stop supplies of fuel and technology and demand a return, but would\nanalyse the circumstances that led India to test the weapon. The plan to separate eight\nreactors for weapon or military use would now allow the use of domestic Uranium ore\nreserves for these separated reactors. This would allow the eight reactors to produce fissile\nmaterial needed for credible minimum deterrence. The nuclear deal was basically viewed\nas an instrument in reshaping the Asian balance of power rather than affecting non-\nproliferation architecture. However, since the nuclear weapons programme was brought\nunder the aegis of the [AEA, the nuclear deal has overall strengthened the global nuclear\nnon-proliferation order."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

As explained earlier, the NPT was adopted on\n1970 and stated that the states which had tested their nuclear weapons before 1st January,\n1967, would be called Nuclear Weapon States while the other states would be called as\nNon Nuclear Weapon States. As per the treaty, the NWS would not only retain their\narsenals but would not help NNWS to develop nuclear weapons. Also, the NNWS joining\nthe NPT shall agree to ‘full-scope safeguards’. The NNWS would not develop any nuclear\nweapons and would place before the IAEA all their nuclear material. The placing of such\nmaterial before the IAEA would act as a guarantee by the NNWS to keep their\ncommitment.\n\nInitially a High Technology cooperation group was established in the era of the\nGeorge W Bush Junior’s administration. The aim was to agree upon principles that would\nexpand exports from US industries. The group and the principles adopted were agreed\nupon after intense negotiations between the US under Secretary of Commerce, Kenneth\nJuster, and the Indian Foreign Secretary, Kanwal Sibal. The agreement spelled out\npossibilities of the export of dual-use technologies from the US to India. In 2003, during\n\nfurther negotiations, the US presented Next steps in Strategic Partnership to India.

India to establish a framework to\n\nNuclear deal ‘ensure no US exports are resold\n\nIn 2003, the tenure of Kanwal Sibal as the Foreign Secretary ended. General elections\nwere held in India. As a result of this, the NSSP negotiations witnessed a slowdown. India\nwas of the opinion that the US was ignoring deeper nuclear cooperation with India under\nthe NSSP. The coming of the UPA government in 2004 led to renewed push. J N Dixit was\nappointed the new National Security Advisor by PM Manmohan Singh. J N Dixit wanted\na complete transformation in the Indo-US relations. He picked three Indian Foreign\nServices officers to work with him at the task. They were Ronen Sen, IFS, S Jaishankar,\nIFS (now Foreign Secretary) and Raminder Jassal, IFS. The Indian side sent a list of thirty\nissues to the US to be considered. These issues represented an ambitious push from India.\nInitially, the US negotiators rejected the list and asserted that for them, the NSSP is the\nagreed framework. Dixit had instructed the Indian negotiations not to return until\nnegotiations on the list were initiated. Finally, in September, 2004, the US began to pick\nup issues from the list and began addressing them. This unfolded a new dimension in the\nIndo-US diplomatic negotiations. Taking advantage of the progress, in March, 2005, the\nUS Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice visited India and agreed to start nuclear\nnegotiations. On 25th March, 2005, the White House announced that the US is going to\nhelp India emerge as a major player in the twenty first century. Both sides decided to\nconclude the agreement by mid-July, 2005, during the visit of Manmohan Singh to the US.\n\nIndia appointed Shyam Saran and the US appointed Nicholas Burns as key\nnegotiators. Both sides initiated intense negotiations through an aggressive yet restrictive\ndiplomacy. During the visit of the Indian PM to the US in July, 2005, an announcement\nregarding nuclear cooperation was finally made. To resolve further issues, the Indian side\nresorted to an intense campaign of advocacy. Normally, the Indian MEA does not allow its\nofficials to undertake direct advocacy with parliamentarians of another country. But this\ntime, an exception was made by the MEA officials. More importantly, many officials even\nvisited constituencies of various members to establish a direct contact.\n\nDeep engagement between\n\nNo power disparity observed — Lv the two sides\n\nLeadership driven initiatives ~- ~» High level interaction\n\n‘Skilful diplomacy at the «~ ~ Strategic character of the\nmultilateral level Negotiations"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Subsequently, India prepared the Civil Liability of Nuclear Damages\nAct (CLNDA) in 2010. The aim of the CLNDA is to ensure that in case of a nuclear\naccident, the victims get quick compensation without having to prove negligence by\noperator or supplier. The liability was capped at 1500 crore rupees. However, there are\ntwo issues raised by equipment suppliers in CLNDA. The first issue of CLNDA is section\n17B, which states that in India, the plant operator in India, that is, NPCIL, under section\n17B, can claim compensation from the supplier of equipment if it claims that the nuclear\naccident that happened was due to faulty equipments or material supplied by the supplier.\nThe second issue is related to section 46. As per this section, the accident victims can sue\nboth operator and material supplier over and above the amount capped. Now equipment\nsuppliers, which are foreign players, say that these clauses (section 17B and section 46)\nput the supplier in a vulnerable situation and unnecessarily drag them into open-ended\ncriminal action and tort law compensation. The suppliers say that the operator and not the\nsupplier has to identify defects and get them rectified and in case of the failure of the\noperator to do so, the operator is to be held liable. The suppliers also say that India’s\nCLNDA violates the Paris Convention of 1960 and the Vienna Convention of 1963 as well\nas the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damages (CSC).\n\nThe government has tried to give some assurance to the suppliers by saying that as\nper section 7 of CLNDA, if the liability exceeds 1500 crore cap, the central government\nwill establish a nuclear liability fund to protect the suppliers from any claims made by the\noperator. However, suppliers have pointed out that section 7 of the CLNDA still does not\nprotect a supplier from claims made by accident victims under the law of torts. In 2015,\nthe US president Obama visited India. During the visit, the two sides finalised\nadministrative arrangements to execute the nuclear deal. This was built upon the India\nPM’s visit to US in 2014 when a contact group to implement the deal had been\nestablished. After the successful completion of negotiation in the contact group, India\nagreed to establish a nuclear insurance pool formed by General Insurance Corporation of\nIndia (GIC) and 4 different PSUs, which will contribute 750 crore out of a total of 1500\ncrore while the government will contribute the rest of the amount. The insurance pool will\nprovide cover to suppliers under section 17 of the CLNDA. Now under the pool, the\noperator and suppliers will become partners in risk management rather than eyeing each\nother as adversaries. The compensation amount is three hundred million in special\ndrawing rights (SDR) and CLNDA has capped maximum liability for an operator to 1500\ncrore rupees. In case if value of SDR increases and goes beyond 1500 crores, the\ngovernment would bridge the amount. On 12th June 2015, the General Insurance\nCompany of India has launched the Indian Nuclear Insurance Pool with a capacity of 1500\ncrore as envisaged under CLNDA."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

In 2005, the two established a\nTrade Policy Forum. It was a dedicated forum for economic and multilevel engagement.\nThe US exports nuclear reactors, precious stones and electric machines to India and\nimports pharmaceutical, pearls, precious metals and mineral fuels. At the services level,\nIndia exports business and consulting services and technical services. Multibillion dollar\nFDI comes from the US to India in terms of business to Microsoft, Dell, Oracle, IBM,\nHarley Davidson, Ford and so on. The US has complained repeatedly about selective\naccess available as in many sectors in India, FDI are not permissible. At the level of\npharmacy, IPR is a key issue. The US wants easy IPR access and data exclusivity\n(explained in the chapter on India—Switzerland relations) to which India is opposed.\n\nTo promote technical cooperation in 2003, an India-US High Technical Cooperation\ngroup was established. The US continues to assert that India lacks the requisite regulatory,\nlegislative and bureaucratic apparatus to ensure sensitive technology is not given to rogue\nnations. In 1974, the US had launched a generalised system of Preference Programme and\nIndia is a beneficiary developing country in the programme. The US feels that GSP\npreference to India should be removed as India no longer needs it. Since 2009, India has\nbeen advocating for a bilateral investment treaty as a step towards an FTA to gain\ninvestment. The FTA negotiations were delayed as both India and the US decided to\nupdate their model bilateral investment treaties (BITs). India has adopted a new version in\n2015 while the US replaced the 2004 model in 2012. In 2015, when Obama visited India,\nthe joint statements advocated renewal of negotiations for the FTA. When the Indian PM\nvisited US in September 2015, he again emphasised on an early conclusion of the BIT.\nThe problems related to delay also owes to differences between India and US BITs. In the\nUS, the BIT has a provision for most favoured nation (MEN) status which is missing in\nthe Indian BIT. This means that under the international law, if a US firm in India is\ndiscriminated against, it shall have no remedy available. Further, the Indian BIT excludes\ncompulsory licensing from the treaty. These issues are at the root cause of the delay.\n\nIn-depth Analysis\n\nFrom 1946 to 2012, India has received 16 billion dollars’ worth economic aid from the\nUS. More than 50% of this aid has been food aid. Yet, the aid relationship between India\n\nand the US had inauspicious beginnings. In 1949, Nehru paid his first state visit to the US.\nDomestically, at that time, India was suffering a famine and severe grain shortage. Instead\nof India directly asking for food aid from the US, Nehru dropped hints about the\nwillingness of India to accept an offer. The US awaited a proper request. Nothing came\nout of the visit. One of the peculiar behaviours of Indian foreign policy mandarins is that\nthey never ask for aids directly, which reflects a distaste for asking. However, with\nrepeated failures of monsoons and successive famines, in December, 1950, the Indian\nAmbassador to the US, Vijaylakshmi Pandit, requested the US to supply two million\ntonnes of wheat. The US conveyed to India that such a proposal would require\nCongressional approval. As the Congress was debating the matter, India conveyed to the\nUS that it needed assurance that no conditionality would be imposed on wheat supply and\nthe aid would not affect India’s foreign or domestic policy. Further, the US would not\ninterfere or influence the sovereign domains of India. The US, however, asserted that it\nwould observe the distribution of the wheat they would donate. On 11th June, 1951, a bill\nauthorising 190 million dollar was approved by the US Congress as a long-term loan to be\nreleased for India.\n\nThe next line of Indo-US offensive came up in 1965, when India witnessed a severe\nfamine and food shortage. India requested 10 million tonnes of food grains under the two-\nyear food aid programme. This time the US President Lyndon Johnson announced a ‘short\ntether policy’. As per the policy, Johnson stated that all food aid shipments to India would\nrequire his personal approval. India found the policy very offensive. The US began to\ninsist that India undertake aggressive agricultural reforms. To work out an agreement, the\nIndian Agriculture Minister, C Subramaniam, held meetings with his American\ncounterpart in Rome. India agreed to a very intrusive programme by November 1965, and\nbrought changes in its agricultural policy.\n\nIndia to FOI\nfo pas toric ~ India to expand chemical fertilizer usage\n\n_,. This shall cause productivity\n‘enhancement of Indian agriculture\n\n40% increase in budgetary. .\n‘expansion by India India to use high yield variety seeds\n\nThough Johnson was happy with the reforms that India made and subsequently eased\nout the wheat shipments, the experience of India to have gone through such intrusion was\nextremely taxing. Though Indira Gandhi had publicly thanked Americans for their aid and\nassistance, she categorically advised C Subrahmanium that India should ensure that it\nnever had to beg for food grains ever from the US. India learned through the food aid\nnegotiations that it is difficult to accept any foreign control over the usage of domestic\nresources.\n\nIn 2009, India and the US started negotiating a treaty to protect foreign investment\nthat flows from one state to the other. The negotiations were slow because both sides\nupdated their model BIT template in 2015, replacing the 2003 template. A BIT protects the\ninvestments of the investors by allowing them extra rights against unlawful actions of host\nstates and thereby boosts investors’ confidence, leading to more FDI. As per the 2003 BIT\nof India, the treaty offered investors fair and equitable treatment based on reasonability\n\nand due process. The 2015 treaty has replaced it with customary international law. Now\nthe investment by an investor shall not be subjected to any measures that violate existing\ncustomary international law. The Indian BIT of 2015 grants full security and protection to\nthe foreign investors and their investment. More importantly, the BIT clearly states that\nthe state will not discriminate the foreign investor from the nationals of the host state and\nshall not act in a discriminatory manner against foreign investors. The new BIT also talks\nabout the provisions related to expropriation. According to the provisions, any investment\nshall be done with adequate compensation and under due process in accordance to the\nlaws of the host states. The compensation shall be in freely convertible currency on the\nbasis of the market value.\n\nUnder the new BIT, for dispute resolution the investor needs to exhaust all local\nremedies available in the state upto five years. The investors get a choice to arbitrate\ndisputes either under International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)\narbitration rules or the additional facility rules of ICSID or the United Nations\nCommission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) arbitration rules. However, India\nnot being a party to ICSID convention, the ICSID arbitration rules mechanism shall not be\navailable to the investors. The new BIT does not mention the need for the ‘Most Favoured\nNation’ status tag for each other. There is no provision for an umbrella clause which\nmeans there is no requirement to observe contractual obligations by the parties. An\nabsence of the umbrella clause means that the domestic courts may not pursue claims as\nthere are no direct contractual obligations involved.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, India and the US have been negotiating a BIT since 2009. Due\nto delays, a lot of competitors have established their foothold in the Indian markets. The\nModi government at the centre has declared a need for 1 trillion dollars’ investment in the\ninfrastructure sector. If India and the US conclude a BIT, this is one area where US firms\nwill stand to have an edge over other competitors. A future BIT can also lead to a grand\ncollaboration between India and the US in retail and business services sector. The\nstringent environmental and labour concerns in the USBIT are irritants perceived by India.\nOne reason why India and the US have not been able to conclude a BIT till date is because\nof the issues related to investor—state arbitration. India’s emphasis in the new BIT, as\nstated earlier, is that the investor should first exhaust local remedies in the state upto five\nyears. The US firms are not very enthusiastic about this provision due to a fairly poor\nimage of Indian legal system as being overstretched.\n\nThe Indian BIT does not bring taxation within its purview. The US firms are of the\nview that an absence of such a provision enhances the tax leverage in the hands of the\nIndian authorities. Moreover, the Indian BIT has no mention of matters related to the\ninsurance of compulsory license (CL) and in the absence of the same, the US firms would\nnot get the power to sue an Indian firm for issuance of CLs or revocation of IPR.\n\nThe two nations have differing perceptions on IPR despite both being compliant to\nthe Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)\nagreement of WTO. The matter was aggravated in 2014 when the US trade representative\nput India under priority watch is under the ‘special 301’ report. The US stated India has\ninadequate IPR protection in IT, pharmacy and publishing industries. The US also alleged\nthat India is a major source of counterfeit drugs. India has not been pleased with this\n\nallegation since it is a generic drug exporter, and such an allegation could hurt the\ncountry’s global image. Since 2012, patent disputes have emerged as a sticky issue\nbecause India has refused the US firms the right to patent, due to firms resorting to\nevergreening. Evergreening means that the company makes a mirror amendment to its\nalready patented product and seeks to expand patent life further after a minor\nmodification. India has invoked section 3(d) of the Indian Patent Act often.\n\nNon-avaitability of Regulatory\nPoor enforcement of IPR Laws Dela Protection\nFor copyright infringement, .. Non-avaitability of Patent\nthe civil damages are absent tvatontnbion\nNon-compliance of indian « Inadequate Legislations regarding\nIPR laws with TRIPS.

As the negotiations progress, India should focus\non protection of its national interests. India needs to give some space to the principle of\neminent domain where, in public interest, the state can subordinate the IPR of private\nentities. The working groups should lay down a set of boundaries in case of ‘eminent\ndomain’ being used for health-related issues. In March 2017, the Indian Foreign Secretary\nvisited the US. During the visit, he raised issues related to the H1-B visa. He also spoke\nabout the safety of Indians in the US. During the visit, the Foreign Secretary emphasised\nupon an early conclusion of the BIT and assured that the resolution of IPR issues would be\ntaken up on priority."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

It is a non-immigrant visa for\ntemporary workers. It is given for select special occupations. The issue is that in the US, if\na company like an IT firm cannot find a skilled US worker, it can attract skilled workers\nunder the H-1B programme. The US population is sceptical about the majority of the jobs\nbeing given to outsiders as they allege that firms hire from abroad to cut costs as labour is\ncheaper if imported and this undermines the employment to US citizens. Indian citizens\nare one of the largest H-1B users in the US. In 2015, the US administration under Obama\nsigned the Consolidated Appropriation Act 2016. As per the law, the visa fee will be\nincreased and the rise in cash flow to government coffers will be used for financing\nObama’s healthcare and biometric tracking system. The hike in the fees is going to offset\nIT and BPO exports of India.\n\nWith the coming of Donald Trump as the new US president, India and the US have\nhad some irritants in their bilateral diplomacy. The H-1B visa issues have emerged as one\nof the greatest sources of friction between the two countries. An employer has to apply for\nan H-1B visa for the employee with the US immigration department. At the same time,\nthere is one L-1 visa category which is an inter-company transfer category where the\nforeign worker can be temporarily transferred to the US in an executive or marginal\nposition in the office of the same employer or its branch or subsidiary. Donald Trump has\nadvocated changing the immigration system of the US and has asserted to make it more\nmerit-based. The main logic of merit based immigration is to ensure that the immigrants\nentering the US are highly skilled and contribute to the American economy. The goal of\n\nthe new system is to have less low skilled immigrants.\n\nIn March 2017, the Trump administration decided that the government shall not\nundertake fast track processing of H-1B visa applications from 3rd April, 2017, for the\nnext six months so that the US immigration authorities can analyse the H-1B extension\napplications of visa holders whose visas are on the verge of expiry. India has been an\naggressive advocate of a fair and a rational approach to be adopted on visa related issues.\nIndia’s Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar had conveyed to the US lawmakers to treat the H-\n1B issue as a trade and service matter than treating it as an immigration issue. The private\nUS firms can pay a premium of 1225 US dollars per application. The payment of the\npremium ensures that the immigration department expedites the H-1B application and\nprocesses it in 15 days in contrast to the normal process of six months. The government of\nUS has now stopped this practice. Under the Obama administration, a new H4 visa\nprogramme was launched that enabled the spouse of the H-1B visa holders in the US to\nundertake jobs in US. Trump administration has signalled a roll back of H4 visa as well.\n\nThe Trump administration placed the High-Skilled Integrity and Fairness Act of 2017\nin front of the House of Representatives. The legislation has advocated for a market based\nallocation of visas. The legislation introduces mechanisms where companies can attract\nforeign talent by making it mandatory for a H-1B visa holder to have a minimum salary of\n1,30,000 USD. This figure is double of what existed since 1989, that is, 60,000 USD. The\nlegislation thus reduces the incentive to outsource jobs yet allowing an option to outsource\njobs if the company expresses a willingness to pay. The legislation intends to promote\nfairness in hiring skilled workers globally by removing the per country cap for immigrant\nvisa policy. To plug the loopholes in H-1B and L-1 visa programmes, the H-1B and L-1\nvisa reform acts were also envisaged.\n\nIn January 2017, the Protect and Grow American Jobs Act envisaged an increase in\nthe minimum salary of H-1B visa holders and removal of the master’s degree exemption.\n\nThe H-1B reforms will affect Infosys, TCS, Wipro, and so forth. More so with the\nhike in the minimum salary for visa holders, the smaller firms may find it difficult to incur\ncosts, thereby affecting their growth. The profitability of the Indian IT sector would be\naffected as profits were maintained on the off shoring model. India has officially conveyed\nits concerns without taking up the matter through diplomatic channels.

The first meeting happened in\nSeptember 2014 when the PM went to the UN General Assembly meeting. In September,\n2015, the PM visited the Silicon Valley in the US. In March 2016, the PM again visited to\nparticipate in the Nuclear Security Summit and in June 2016, there was a state visit. In the\nSeptember 2015 visit, the Strategic Dialogue between India and the US launched in 2009\nwas transformed into Strategic and Commercial Dialogue. The most significant factor of\nthe visit was to garner US investments for Make in India to have a revive the Indian\neconomy.\n\nOn the sidelines of economic diplomacy, as analysed above, defence cooperation was\nalso intensified. India has begun the import of sensitive defence technology. Both have\nused the bilateral meetings to assert Freedom of Navigation and Protection of Sea Lanes\nof Communication. New collaborations in energy, science, environment, space, education\nand counter-terrorism has opened up. The PM also used the visits to reconnect with the\nIndian diaspora.\n\nIndia and the US have moved beyond Joint Statements to announce Vision\nStatements. This has brought the needed octane to push the relations. On invitation of the\nUS Congress House Speaker, Paul Ryan, the PM addressed the US Congress in June,\n2016. To promote cooperation in sustainable development and clean energy, the two have\nagreed on establishing a Partnership to Advance Clean Energy (PACE). This will help\nenvisage cooperation in air quality, transport fuels, climate financing, and so on. To\nresolve IPR issues, a high level group on IPR has been formed, which will work with\nIndo-US Trade Policy Forum.\n\nAnalysis of Indian PM Visit to USA-2017 (Path to a Low Velocity and a\nHigh Inertia Relationship)\n\nIn June 2017, Modi visited USA. The Indian PM could have met Trump on the sidelines\nof G-20 Summit in Hamburg, Germany in July 2017 but the Indian establishment thought\nthat such a meet would have happened at a multilateral setting while Modi preferred to go\nfor a bilateral meeting. During the meeting, Modi tried to push the idea that in the era of\n\nAmerica First policy of Trump, India is the best opportunity for USA. Since the nuclear\ndeal between India and USA, USA has understood that India can be a testing lab for new\nideas where new partnership can be built without an alliance between the two states but\nmimicking some characteristics. The Indo-US ties have remained consistent and\npredictable with an upward swing. For Modi, the visit was to urge the same continuity and\nconsistency as under Trump, White House administration has been a little chaotic and\nassertive that no state should take old deals for granted in the future. At the end of the\nmeeting, there was a joint statement between the two leaders. For the first time, India and\nUSA have asserted that the two sides are working shoulder to shoulder against terrorism\nwith reference to cross border terrorism. The US has designated Hizbul Mujahedeen\nleader Syed Salahuddin as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT). The joint\nstatement mentions that Pakistani territory should not be used to launch terrorist strikes on\nother states. During the Obama administration, the two sides had come up with a Vision\nDocument for Asia-Pacific. In 2017, during the meeting of Modi with Trump, the two\nsides for the first time used the term called Indo-Pacific. The meaning both sides tried to\nconvey through the term Indo-Pacific was that India and USA are both democratic\nstalwarts and responsible stewards of the Indo-Pacific region. The joint statement also\nmade mentions of freedom of navigation in the seas and peaceful resolution of maritime\ndisputes as per international law. Though USA asserted in the joint statement that India\nwas a major defense partner, there was absence of support for Make in India and co-\nproduction (in sync with America First policy of Trump). The two sides decided to\nestablish a new format of 2+2 dialogue for enhancing the diplomatic relations. Under this\nnew 2+2 dialogue, foreign and defense minister’s of the two countries will carry out\ninteraction and place the strategic and security relationship on a new center-stage. The 2+2\ndialogue provides India and USA a new vehicle to discuss bilateral issues. Though India\nand USA have more than 60 bilateral institutions to discuss issues; US is concerned about\nthe chronic failure of India to use their potential. US asserts that bureaucratic inertia, legal\nissues, suspicion by India of motives of US and lack of clarity by India on what India\nseeks form the Indo-US strategic partnership limits the overall diplomatic interaction with\nIndia.

The people of Indus Valley civilisation have traded with the civilisations\nof Mesopotamia. There had also been practices of maritime trade since many centuries\n\nwhich led to the settlement of Indian communities in the Arab world. During the medieval\nperiod, the continuity of relations with West Asia was visible during Mughal rule in India.\nDuring this period, Jewish traders from the Middle East traded gold, silver, precious\nstones with India. The onset of European colonialism saw a rise in migration of Jews from\nthe Middle East to India. As the European powers began colonisation of Asia and the\nBritish commenced with the colonisation of India, Jewish immigrants began to move from\nIraq to Surat in Gujrat. Some Jews from Iraq also settled down in Bombay. These Jews\nfrom Iraq undertook manufacturing and commercial activities in Gujrat and Bombay.\nThus, India’s relations with West Asia are deeply rooted in its past, which is also\nindicative of the need of a strong future relationship with the entire block.\n\nAs the political control of the British became firmly established over India, the\nBritish rulers not only took up the Indian trade routes in West Asia, but also began to\nestablish British protectorates and buffers in West Asia to keep other competitor colonial\npowers at bay. The British viceroy in India was tasked with the responsibility of\ncontrolling the West Asia region. The first thing that the British did was to safeguard West\nAsia from the French, German and the Russians. In order to achieve this, the British\nassociated themselves with the affairs of the West Asians and also stationed British\nresidents in the region. The British initially had a simple goal—that of safeguarding the\nmaritime frontier of India. Consequently, they occupied Cyrus in 1878 and Egypt in 1882.\nAs the World War-I ended, the consolidation of colonial powers of West Asia was given\neffect through the Mandate system. The Mandates of Iraq and Palestine were to be\ngoverned by the British, who resorted to using administrators from India to run the affairs\nof the Mandates. In fact, to suppress any potential opposition to the British rule in the\nterritories, the British also used the Indian army in these areas.\n\nThe presence of the British in West Asia led to the British being involved in the\nOttoman empire—a fact that was exploited by the Indian National Movement to solidify\nits criticism of British interference. This also made the nationalists in India realise that the\npeople of West Asia also have a same common enemy. Thus, the period after World War-I\nled to Indian leaders considering the region anew, giving early roots of India’s West Asia\nPolicy. Moreover, the position of Nehru and Gandhi on the Palestinian question had\nconsiderable influence on India’s Israel policy after Indian Independence. Gandhi initially\ndeveloped his views about Jews and Zionism through his early interaction with Jews in\nSouth Africa, whereby he developed a substantial understanding of Jewish nationalism\nand their demand for a national home. Though he sympathised with the Jews for their\nhorrific persecution in Germany and other European nations, he did not find much\nlegitimacy in the demand of Jews to establish a national home.\n\nIn the initial years after the World War-I, Gandhi insisted that Palestine should not be\na Jewish state but should remain under Muslim control. There were two reasons for\nGandhi to espouse this view—first, Gandhi had kept domestic Indian Muslim community\nand their participation in the national movement in mind while forming his opinion; and\nsecond, Muslims had ruled Palestine for many centuries and it would have been a wrong\nstrategy on the part of the British to accede to Zionist demand for the creation of a\nhomeland in Palestine. He clarified that he believed Christians and Jews should freely go\nand worship in Palestine but should not acquire any sovereign jurisdiction over Palestine.\nBut after the dissolution of Ottoman Empire, Gandhi argued that Zionists should not nurse\n\nterritorial or political aspirations but rather, realise the Zionist ideas internally and\nspiritually. Gandhi also was very critical of Zionist cooperation with the British to achieve\ntheir demands of a national home as India was fighting British Imperialists. Indians began\nto perceive Zionist cooperation with British as Zionist intention to colonise Palestine.\nHowever, during this period, the Jewish Agency for Israel continued to work in close\nassociation with Gandhi and kept him abreast of the developments in Zionist political\nthought and goals.\n\nNehru, who became the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of India in the\nimmediate period after Indian independence, was also opposed to the idea of a national\nhome for Jews but did develop affinity with socialist Jewish leaders. The first reference by\nNehru to the issue of Palestine can be seen in 1933 when he wrote a letter on the issue\nfrom a prison to Indira. In the dialogue, Nehru appreciated Jewish achievements and their\ncontribution to the improvement of living standards of Palestinians through modern\nindustry. He did not, however, support the cause for a Jewish national home. He also did\nnot appreciate the Zionist cooperation with the British for a colonisation of Palestine as he\nheld forcible colonisation to be morally and ethically wrong. Nehru favoured the idea of a\nunited Palestine and not one divided by religion. Nehru articulated his views on the\nPalestine in a different manner. For Nehru, the Palestine issue was a fight by the Arabs\nagainst British imperialists. Nehru inferred that the Jewish issue was a deliberate creation\nof the British—similar to the divide and rule tactic of British in India—where the British\npitted Jews against Arabs in Palestine. Nehru was extremely moved by the plight of the\nJews in Germany and Eastern Europe, and after witnessing their persecution first hand\nduring his visit to Central Europe in 1938, he advocated asylum for Jews in India.\n\nThe unity in India over the Khilafat question gave India a lead to engage with the\nleadership of Egypt and Syria. India began to take positions on the Arab Palestine issue\nand criticised British interference in Ottoman territory after World War-I. The period of\nlate 1920s saw Congress taking a stand in public support of Arab nationalism. Broadly,\nIndia perceived the Palestine struggle as a larger Arab struggle against imperialism. In\n1937, when the Peel Commission report recommended the partition of Palestine, the INC,\nin its 1938 Haripura session, condemned the partition scheme and extended sympathy to\nthe Arab cause. The INC was sympathetic to Jewish persecution in Central Europe but did\nnot favour any partition or support for a separate home for Jews. It continued to perceive\nZionism as a deliberate British design, and an ideology largely sponsored by the West.\n\nIndia played a key role in supporting anti-imperial struggles in Syria, Egypt and\nPalestine and expressed solidarity with their nationalist struggles while refraining from\nquoting any Jewish organisations. India abstained from developing relations with any\nZionist movement as it intended to promote a secular outlook of nationalism.\n\nRowers eewreres See Swe Eee See eee wr ee oNowrnee\n\nReligion ~~ *_ To\n\n|\n\n> Secular Support\n\n!\n\nSupport Pro Islamic Support Secular Nationalist\n\nKhilafat Issue Movements in Arab World\nThe INC in India maintained a policy in favour of Arabs while the Muslim League\nhad severely criticised the Zionist movement. The aim of the INC was to show solidarity\nwith Palestine Arabs as also to reassure the Indian Muslims on which side they were.\nHowever, the INC and Muslim League differed in the sense that the INC was supportive\nto Arabs but was not hostile to Jews like the Muslim League was. The Muslim League\nvehemently opposed the creation of a Jewish Palestine and had also condemned the\nBalfour Declaration in 1917. Subsequently, when the Peel commission report came and\nadvocated partition of Palestine, India still resorted to showing solidarity with Arab\nPalestinians. The Muslim League again condemned the report of Peel Commission. The\npolicy of Muslim League on Palestine did exercise influence on the policy of the INC.\nDue to strong pro-Arab manoeuvring by the League, the INC also decided to align its\nviews. Both parties aimed to make their presence felt within the Muslim community of\nIndia. The INC also organised pro-Palestine demonstrations to establish its alliance to the\nPalestinian cause. The INC, through its policy, made it clear that division of Palestine on\n\nreligious grounds could not allowed.\n\nThe issues in West Asia and Palestine also gave India an opportunity to establish its\nalternative foreign policy views which were different from the British policy. Thus,\ninitially as we saw that INC followed pro-Arab, pro-Islamic policy up till Khilafat\nmovement but later, after riots and dismemberment of the Khilafat, began to advocate a\nsecular-nationalist Arab view."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The UN established the UNSCOP (UN Special Committee on Palestine), of\nwhich India was also a member. In 1947, New Delhi organised a conference of the Asian\nRelations Organisation called the Asian Relations Conference (ARC). In the conference,\nboth Arabs and Jewish delegations were invited. This was in sync with the earlier policy\nof the INC that had evolved support for Arab Palestinians, with conciliatory\naccommodation of Jews. A 10-member delegation of Jews headed by Samuel Hugo\nBergmann, also known as the Hebrew University delegation, participated in the\nconference. Ironically, the Arab states declined to participate owing to Jewish invitation\nand this gave an opportunity to the Jews to present their case to India. During the ARC,\nthe Jewish delegation again presented their idea of partitioning Palestine for\n\naccommodating Jews, which did not resonate well with the Indian leadership.\n\nThrough the ARC, India also undertook a fine foreign policy manoeuvre by\nmaintaining that Palestine belonged to Arabs, but simultaneously showing sympathy with\nthe Jews. When the British placed the Palestinian issue before the UN General Assembly,\nNehru appointed Asaf Ali as the Indian representative to the special session at the UN.\nAsaf Ali was instructed that he should not commit India to any situation that may affect\nIndia’s relations with other nations but ensure that India would support the termination of\nthe British Mandate of Palestine. Nehru asked Ali to play a cautious game as India wanted\nto support Arabs but not upset Jews as doing so would consequently affect India’s\nrelations with Western powers. The idea was to remain friendly to both the parties. The\nUNSCOP presented a final report in September 1947. The majority of members supported\npartition of Palestine but India, Iran and Yugoslavia advocated a Federal Palestine with\nboth Arabs and Jews as a part of the territory. Thus, India continued to stick to its pre-\npartition policy of supporting Arabs and accommodating the Jews.\n\nAs the partition plan won at the UNGA, it was clear that the partition of Palestine\nwas inevitable. The question before India was what to do once a Jewish state in Palestine\nwas born. On 14 May, 1947, Israel as a state was born and both the US and the USSR\nrecognised the existence of Israel. The task for Israel now was to seek diplomatic\nrecognition from the world. It decided to seek the same from India too. On 17 May, 1948,\nIsraeli foreign minister, Moshe Sharett, sent a letter to Nehru seeking diplomatic\nrecognition of Israel from India. The Indian established decided not to make any hurried\ndecision and adopted a wait-and-watch policy. In August 1948, H V Kamath enquired\nabout the Indian position on Israel in the Constitution Assembly debates where Nehru\nreiterated the wait-and-watch stance.\n\nThere were two important reasons for India to adopt a wait-and-watch policy. The\nfirst was that after Israel got created, hostilities broke out in the region and the situation\nturned rapidly volatile. Secondly, the Indian Muslims had gone through the traumatic\nexperience of partition and making a statement on Israel was not warranted at this stage.\nFurther, during this period Pakistan began to establish proximity with Arabs to ignite the\nidea of Pan Islamism which they could use against India in Kashmir. However, during this\nperiod, Indian diplomats all over the world kept interacting with Israeli diplomat. Israel\nhad become a reality in the international system and there was a growing pressure on India\nto recognise Israel. On 11th May 1949, UNGA decided to vote on the question of Israel\nbeing made the 54th member of UN. India voted positively on this question. India later,\nhowever, voted against the motion at the time of Israel’s admission to the UN. India\nclarified that State of Israel had not been formed by virtue of negotiations but by armed\nstruggle and the Indian stand was in sync with its earlier stand of support to Palestinians.\nBut when Israel got accepted as a UN member, it kindled a reconsideration of Israel by\nIndia. Nehru, during his visit to the US in 1949, had met with Israeli diplomats and also\nconveyed to them that as the UN has accepted Israel as a member, India is moving in the\ndirection to recognise Israel which as a question could no longer be postponed.\n\nBetween 1948 and 1950, Turkey and Iran too had recognised Israel. There was a\ndirect pressure on India to recognise Israel as it could no longer play the domestic Muslim\npopulation card. Nehru announced India’s recognition of Israel in February 1950 in a\n\nstatement made in the Parliament. But this declaration was verbal. Neither were there any\nofficial document that recognised Israel nor was any step taken to establish diplomatic\nties. Finally, on 17th September, 1950, a press communiqué was issued to recognise Israel\nafter 28 months of requests from Israel. India thus removed the main obstacle in the\nrecognition of Israel. The delay in Indian response was attributed to the diplomatic\nbacklash India may have had to face from the Arab states. India clarified that the\nrecognition to Israel in no way meant a change to Israel-Palestine policy of India and that\nit would continue to promote Arab cause.\n\nOther factors played a role in the diplomatic shift undertaken by India. India, through\nthe recognition of Israel, made it clear that its support to Arabs was not unconditional and\nthat India did expect reciprocity. India did not appreciate Egyptian vote at the UN against\nIndia on the issue of Hyderabad and its abstention at the UN vote on the Korean issue.\n\nEven though India had recognised Israel, it did not lead to the establishment of\ndiplomatic ties instantly. India made a distinction between legally recognising Israel and\nthe political act of establishing diplomatic relations. India made the right choice in\nmaintaining a balance in the diplomacy related to West Asia. In September 1951, a\nconsular office was opened in Bombay and F W Pollock was made honorary Consular\nAgent of Israel to India. Israel perceived all these steps to be important because it was\nsurrounded by countries which had declared war on it. Israel was isolated by its\nneighbours and the only option for Israel was to engage with the West.\n\nIn Asia, Israel perceived India as a springboard to the other part of the world.\nHowever, the subsequent Suez crisis of 1956 took the relations to a low point. India\ncondemned Israeli aggression, with Nehru branding the military operation of Israel on\nEgypt as a clear, naked act of aggression. India resorted to a recognition-but-no-\nrelationship policy with Israel in this period. This open-ended foreign policy to pursue\nrelations with both Arabs and Israel gave India the need to stay in touch with the region\nwithout complicating relations with anyone in the evolving strategic circumstances. An\nIndian Friends of Israeli society was formed and it continued to interact on various\noccasions. This was no doubt appreciated by Israel but the society had a limited influence\non foreign policy."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Israel realised\nthe need to improve relations with the West were more crucial than with Asia and India.\nIsrael did invite Nehru in 1960 but he declined the invitation as such a visit at this juncture\ncould complicate matters. In 1963, in the Parliament, India clarified that due to less\nconsular work between the two states, it is not appropriate to establish diplomatic missions\nwith Israel. After the death of Nehru in 1964, Shastri continued the Nehruvian legacy with\nregard to India’s Israel policy. In 1964, India accorded recognition to the Palestine\nLiberation Organisation (PLO). India continued cooperation with Israel in the field of\ntechnology and agriculture.\n\nDuring the 1962 Indo-China conflict, India asked for military assistance from Israel\n\nand it agreed, considering that this may provide an opportunity for Israel to put in place\ndiplomatic ties with India. In January 1963, top level officials of Israel and India had a\nmeeting and this became the first ever proper contact between the two forces. The coming\nof Indira Gandhi saw a resurgence of the hardcore pro-Arab policy. In March 1966, Israeli\nPresident Zalman Shazar, while on his way to Nepal, requested a 24-hour halt in India.\nThe MEA requested the halt to take place in Calcutta and somehow no official greeting of\nthe Israeli head of the state took place. This reflected the absence of depth in the relations.\n\nIn the Six-Days War in 1967, India blamed Israel for escalating conflict and showed\nsupport to Egypt and the Arab states. In the 1965 India-Pakistan conflict, Pakistan\nsucceeded in garnering the support of Arabs. The only Arab state standing with India was\nEgypt, which offered mediation in the Casablanca Summit of Arabs in September 1965.\nIndia had again requested for Israeli assistance for heavy mortar and ammunition. Israeli\nForeign Minister Golda Meir was non-committal, but Prime Minister Levi Eshkol sent\nshipments of ammunition to India. Despite the support, no steps were taken by Shastri\nregime for modifying Israel—India ties. However, the lack of Arab support during 1965\nwar for India and outright support to Pakistan led the opposition in India to heavily\ncriticise India’s West Asia Policy. In 1966-67, the Arab-Israel conflict began again, with\nthe situation becoming volatile along the Syria—Israel and Jordan-Israel border. India was\naffected when, in 1967, Egypt asked the UN Emergency Force (UNEF) to withdraw from\nEgypt controlled areas near the border. India was a significant contributor to the UNEF.\nBut due to Israeli aggression, many Indian UNEF officials and soldiers had died. India, at\nthat time, was a non-permanent member of UNSC and again condemned Israel for\nescalation of conflict and strongly objected to the pre-emptive attack of Israel on Egypt.\n\nThe opposition in India blamed the Indian government for supporting Arabs without\nreciprocity and stated that India should not favour Arab world as they supported Pakistan.\nThere was a gradual rise in India of this new orthodoxy which was not anti-Israeli but\nlacked assertion as they were out of the power structure. As Israel expanded its territory in\n1967, India advised that Israel should follow UN Resolution 242 and go back to pre-1967\nborders. However, the government toned down the anti-Israel rhetoric and began to\nattribute its pro-Arab policy to energy and economic considerations. India also began to\nuse UN Resolution-242 as a new benchmark for Indo-Israel rapprochement. After the\ncreation of R&AW in 1968, India opened up lines of communication with the Israeli\nMossad and thus began intelligence cooperation. The R&AW officers in Geneva acted in\ncollaboration with Mossad and collection of intelligence on Pakistan and thereby began a\nnew phase of cooperation, albeit low in tone.\n\nIn August 1969, the Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem witnessed a fire. The mosque is\nthe third holiest site in Islam after Mecca and Medina. The Arab states blamed Israel for\nlack of protection of Islamic sites and Saudi King Faisal called for the convening of an\nOrganisation of Islamic countries (OIC) Conference. The criteria was that only countries\nthat have Muslim majority population or a Muslim head of State would be able to\nparticipate. Pakistan long used the OIC as a forum to propagate anti-India feelings related\nto Kashmir. India decided to participate in the OIC meeting planned in Rabat in September\n1969. With no official invite coming despite an expression of interest by India, India\ninsinuated that the OIC had been neglecting the interests of Indian Muslims. India also\nlobbied with Egypt and Indonesia, who convinced Faisal to allow an Indian delegation to\n\nallow the representation of minority Muslims of India. Pakistani President Agha\nMuhammad Yahya Khan decided to walkout of the Summit on 23rd September since India\nhad garnered the support of Algeria, Egypt, Sudan and Libya. Morocco and Saudi Arabia\nconvinced Yahya Khan to attend the last session after it was agreed that India would not\nbe a part of last session. The final declaration by the Islamic Muslims condemned Israel\nfor its actions.\n\nThe issue caused public embarrassment for India but the government tried to justify\nits participation asserting the need to block Pakistan from using the OIC for its anti-India\npropaganda. The Arabs again stood by Pakistan in the 1971 conflict and showed\ninadequate appreciation of the refugee crisis India faced. In contrast, Israel supported\nIndia and recognised Bangladesh. In 1973, when the Yom Kippur war started with Egypt\nand Syria attacking Israel, India blamed it on Israel, citing its refusal to vacate territories\ncaptured in 1967 as a cause of Arab frustration, leading to aggression.\n\nThe period after 1967 saw lesser reliance of India on Egypt as a focal point of\nrelations in the Arab world. India shed off its past inhibitions and began to engage with\nboth Iran and Iraq. Both of them emerged as crucial suppliers of oil for India. India’s\nrelations with Iraq picked up at other bilateral levels also apart from oil. Economic and\nenergy interests ensured that India’s Israel policy did not veer completely away from UN\nResolution 242."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

In 1979, the Soviets invaded Afghanistan and all\nArabs condemned it. India did not condemn the Soviet invasion owing to proximate ties\nwith Soviets but to prevent ostracisation from Arabs, India immediately granted full\ndiplomatic status to the PLO and allowed it a mission in New Delhi. When Israel objected\nto Indian criticism of Israeli attack on Iraq in 1981 and Lebanon in 1982, the Israeli\ncounsel Yossef Hassin, who had criticised India, was expelled. This again took Indo—Israel\nrelations to their lowest point. However, in the second half of the 1980s, India witnessed a\nchange in political leadership as Rajiv Gandhi was elected as the Prime Minister of India\non 24 December 1984. Rajiv Gandhi, educated at Cambridge University, signalled a fresh\nIndian approach towards Israel and though unable to reverse the traditional Indian pro-\nArab foreign policy completely, initiated a number of moves in favour of Israel. He also\nheld a meeting with Shimon Peres, his Israeli counterpart, at a UN session in 1985.\n\nThe PLO was based in Lebanon. When Israel attacked Lebanon, the PLO’s\nheadquarters moved to Tunisia. In 1985, Israel bombarded the PLO offices in Tunisia.\nIndia condemned the Israeli attacks. In October 1985, the UNGA session began. The\nArabs sponsored a resolution for seeking the expulsion of Israel from UN. India abstained\nat the vote. Later, India allowed an Israeli vice counsel back in Mumbai. Rajiv, in 1987,\nallowed the Israeli Tennis team to play in India at the Davis cup. This event became a\ndiplomatic move much appreciated by Israelis who, since 1960s, had not been granted\nvisas by India to attend sports events. Later the government allowed the Israeli consulate\nto have jurisdiction over Kerala. However, events like the Palestinian Intifada and\ndomestic problems in late 1980s did not allow Rajiv Gandhi to manoeuvre the foreign\npolicy completely in favour of Israel.\n\nAfter the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, the Congress staged a comeback, with\nNarasimha Rao as Prime Minister. Rao formed the government in a coalition and was not\nconstrained by the Muslim vote bank politics of the Indian National Congress. In 1990-91,\nRao steered the Indian foreign policy based on regional and domestic developments. In\n1990-91, there were internal divisions in the Arab world related to the Gulf War. In the\nKuwait crisis, PLO supported Iraq while Arabs supported Kuwait. Saddam Hussein too\nsided with PLO to position himself as a leader of the Palestinian cause. The support of\nPLO to Iraq led to isolation of PLO in the Arab world. Domestically in India, the economy\nneeded a push and USA was the only country that could give India the needed financial\nmuscle. India understood that the US financial assistance is tied to India opening up its\nrelationship with Israel. The Madrid Conference and Oslo Accords at the end of Cold War\ncreated a ripe situation for India to bolster its ties with Israel. After the PLO brokered\nnegotiations with Israel at the Madrid conference, conjecturing the possibility of PLO-\nIsrael rapprochement, Rao invited Yasser Arafat, the head of PLO, to India. Since 1987,\nPakistan had been using the US trained Afghan Mujahedeens to create unrest in Kashmir.\nIndia began to suppress this externally sponsored insurgency in Kashmir, Pakistan\nsuccessfully used the OIC forum to internationalize the Kashmir conflict by highlighting\nthe human rights violation by India in Kashmir. OIC even decided to send a fact finding\nmission to Kashmir which was strongly protested by India. India asserted that Kashmir\nwas an internal conflict of India and OIC had no jurisdiction on an internal issue related to\nIndia. India felt that its pro-Arab policy during the entire Cold War did not serve any\nstrategic support to India for Kashmir. On 23rd January 1992, in a cabinet meeting,\ndiscussions on diplomatic relations with Israel were undertaken. In July 1992, India\nextended the consul relations to full diplomatic relations and Ephraim Duek presented his\ncredentials to Indian President as the first Israeli Ambassador to India. India asserted that\nthere was an economic logic to India’s improved ties with Israel. India wanted to use the\nscientific and technical expertise of Israel for its domestic development. The change\nhappened in 1992 because Narsimha Rao was convinced that a rehaul of our West Asian\nengagement was long due. The domestic political repercussions no longer guided our\npolicy now. The realisation that India can gain from security relations with Israel by\nengaging strategically, also acted as a factor.\n\nCore reasons that compelled India to make a shift in its Israel policy are:\n\n1. The stand of OIC on Kashmir issue.\n\n2. Internal divisions within the Arab world on the ongoing Gulf War.\n\n3. Jordan (Madrid Conference-1991) and Egypt (Camp David Accord-1978) had\nalready signed a peace treaty with Israel.\n\n4. PLO and Israel initiated peace talks in 1993 in Oslo leading to the tectonic Oslo\nAccords.\n\n5. Indian economy needed a push from USA which made financial assistance as a\nprecondition to rapprochement with Israel.\n\n6. India needed a defence partner (which USA eventually became) after the\ndisintegration of the Cold War and demise of the USSR.\n\n7. China too gave diplomatic recognition to Israel at the end of the Cold War prior to\nWest Asia peace talks, thereby making a shift in its own policy of Cold War."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Till today, R&AW and Mossad continue to enjoy a deep covert\nrelationship in different parts of the world.\n\nAfter 1991, as India adopted the policy of diversification in defence industry, it began\nto forge a new alliance with Israel. Israel not only had a large military-industrial complex\nbut through arms support in 1962, 1965 and 1971, had proven its mettle.

Stalin did not\nappreciate the non-aligned posturing of India and perceived Indian leaders as capitalist\nlackeys. Things did change after the death of Stalin in 1953, and there were two issues at\nthe global level where Soviets and Indians found space to converge. The first was Indian\nprotest at the UN about its decision to extend the Korean War north of the 38th parallel.\nThe second was Indian support for the People’s Republic of China to enter the UN.\nHowever, what actually acted as a factor compelling India to tilt towards the Soviets was\nthe US. In 1954, the US established the Southeast Asia Treaty Organisation (SEATO), an\nalliance initiated by the US for South Asia and South East Asia. In 1955 came the\nBaghdad Pact for West Asia. India began to perceive these two alliances as an attempt by\nthe US to encircle India. India also condemned American support to Pakistan with arms as\nit brought the Cold War at India’s doorstep. The situational changes in Asia also\ncompelled the Soviets to view India in a different light. After the death of Stalin in 1953,\nwith the coming of Nikita Khrushchev to power, Soviets began to view India favourably\nas a counter balance in East-West confrontation.

Nikita Khrushchev favoured the improvement of ties with the US while Mao tried\nto criticise it and tried to promote his own image as a sole representative of revolutionary\nmovements. This difference between the Soviets and China led to Soviets favouring India\nduring the 1959 Chinese aggression. After the 1962 war, the Soviets gave an aggressive\npush to defence ties with India.

To rectify this\ntilt, the Soviet Union, post the 1962 war, gave support of arms to India which helped a lot\nin the 1965 war. Gradually, in the early 1970s, the world again witnessed tectonic shifts,\nthe most important of which was the US tilt towards China. This was perceived by the\n\nUSSR as a threat to them. These events again led to mega regional shifts. In the 1970s, the\nUS explored options of undertaking rapprochements with China, India began to fear a\nBeijing—Washington-Islamabad axis. Henry Kissinger did not send positive vibes to India\nand tried to make it clear that an Indo-Pak conflict could also come to involve China.\nIndia acted hastily. Since 1969, India and the USSR were negotiating a diplomatic and\nstrategic engagement. India speeded up the negotiations and in 1971, concluded a twenty-\nyear India—Soviet Treaty of Peace and Friendship. The treaty gave India the needed\nstrategic support from Russia in any eventuality of conflict. Shipments of arms began to\narrive from Russia to India. After the creation of Bangladesh towards the end of 1971, the\nIndia—Russia treaty acted as a great strategic stabiliser for India and the region as it\ndeterred any Chinese or American intervention unfavourable to India.\n\nThe Soviets also vetoed the UN resolutions that advanced that India and Pakistan\nundertake a ceasefire. Soviet support successfully helped India to neutralise the external\nthreats and helped it safeguard its territory. After the 1971 war, when India conducted the\nnuclear test in 1974, the Soviets did not condemn it and, in fact, went on to support India\nwith the supply of heavy water for the nuclear programme which got halted when\nAmerican and Canadians took back their supplies. India, on the other hand, also showed\noutright support to the Soviet Union. In 1979, when the Soviets invaded Afghanistan,\nIndia at that time in the UN General Assembly abstained from voting which had\nadvocated that Soviets stop military intervention in Afghanistan. Domestically, within\nIndia, cutting across party lines, all parties had an understanding that relations with Russia\nwere serving the Indian national interest and thereby needed to continue.

In absolute terms, despite competition from Britain, France and the US, Russia\nremains the top defence supplier to India. The Indo—Russia defence ties have also\nwitnessed a transformation to a model of cooperative production on shared risk\npartnership from the erstwhile model of a supplier—-consumer relationship. Russia has, in\nfact, over a period of time, favoured more technology transfer to India to assist India in\n\naugmenting its capacities.\n,\n\nIn the 1990s and early 2000s, the Indian side placed multiple defence orders from\nRussia that ranged from Talwar class frigates under Project 11356 to MiG-29K shipborne\naircrafts. Indian demands spearheaded a culture of innovation in the Russian defence\nindustrial complex to cater to advanced needs. Indian requirements of defence products\nmade Russia technologically more productive as it enabled in creating a system of\ninnovation that pushed Russians to produce half a generation more advanced equipments.\nThere was an overall improvement in Russian aviation and missiles technology industries.\nThis development was taken positively even by Russian defence corporate houses as it\nenabled them to establish long-term strategies to meet Indian requirements. The Russian\ncorporate houses in the avionics industry used Indian orders as a springboard to spearhead\n\ninnovations in engines (thrust vector controls) and radars (phased m-array radars).\n\nThe Indian Navy ordered 45 MiG-29K shipborne fighters. As Russia began to meet\nIndian requirements, the Russian Navy too began to show a positive interest in next\ngeneration ship borne fighters, clearly proving that Indian requirements had a multiplier\neffect on Russian armed forces too. The Chinese too were not very far behind in importing\nRussian technology. However, the Chinese imports were not only lesser in value but also\nin quantity as China favoured to import only those technologies that it could clone in\nChina. Uniquely, the cooperation with India led to no possibility of creation of unlicensed\nclones whereas such possibility continues to remain high for transfers done to China. This\nIndo—Russian cooperation today sees its manifestation in the form of a newly emerging\ncooperative model where Russia intends to jointly work with India in production of\nmilitary hardware. The recent ongoing project of fifth generation fighter aircrafts and\nmilitary transport aircrafts is a testimony to the fact.\n\nIn recent times, the Indian establishment has undertaken a policy of diversification\nallowing other players in India defence industry as well. It has gained momentum in the\nrecent times. India, with its growing economic clout, has drifted towards the purchase of\nhigh priced niche products. The recently concluded Rafale deal (explained in the chapter\nof India—France Relations) proves the point. The US too has emerged as a serious\ncompetitor to Russia. In this context, for Russia to remain competitive, it has to explore\nnext generation weapon system market.\n\n“en i nla\n| |\n\nTheme 2: Analysis of Commercial Diplomacy\n\nAlthough defence and nuclear energy are two core dimensions of the diplomatic ties\nbetween India and Russia, economic cooperation has the potential to unleash a new era in\nthe bilateral relationship. The current bilateral commercial diplomacy is to the tune of 10\nbillion dollars, with a target of reaching 20 billion dollars by 2020. One of the core\nfeatures of Indo—Russia trade has been the presence of state enterprises mediating their\ninteractions in each other’s territories. This has had a positive effect because the Russians\nare more comfortable in dealing with Indian state officials due to such ties existing since\nthe Cold War era. Furthermore, it has led to India and Russia explore relations in various\ndimensions ranging from national security to investment intensive technologies. In the\npost-Soviet decade, not only have Indian companies evolved business interests in Russia,\nbut several Russian firms have also tied up with state governments in India to promote\njoint ventures.\n\nOne of the key barriers to India—Russia trade is geographical distance between the\ntwo nations and the lack of direct connectivity. Distance and logistics are not barriers in\nIndia—Europe or India—China trade relations, for that matter. Surprisingly, logistics and\ndistance barriers are eclipsed when it comes to items of national security (nuclear energy,\nspace and defence). Despite the barriers, India has been able to penetrate Russian markets\nfor exports of textiles, yarn, and food stuff and pharmaceuticals. Another hindering factor\nin the commercial relationships is lack of awareness about commercial opportunities in\neach other’s territory. At times, even sudden changes in legal regimes and taxation\nstructures have affected the firms. Sistema of Russia has faced such issues due to legal\nregime changes in India while India’s ONGC has faced issues due to taxation levies. The\nIntergovernmental Joint Commission as a forum has been used to raise such issues. India\nis paying attention to the Russian idea of establishing the Eurasian community. There is\nconsiderable progress in the recent times on development of the International North-South\nTransit Corridor (INSTC) which will facilitate connectivity between Indian ports and\nmainland Russia.\n\nA very peculiar feature thus observed in India-Russia trade relationship is that the\nrelation is more like old relatives who have warm feelings for each other in their hearts\nand not in actions and the moment either side receives a new relative, its the new relative\nwho gains more attention. Information vacuum stands to be one of the most crucial\nbarriers in these bilateral relationships, which can be easily mitigated with establishment\nof media outlets that would advertise the business potential in each other’s country. There\nis also a problem of lack of experts in the two countries to facilitate trade. During the Cold\nWar, the erstwhile USSR had trained experts who had business knowledge of individual\ncountries as good as the local businessmen of the concerned state. In the post-Cold War\nRussian Federation, this element is missing. Its impact is visible in the bilateral trade ties\nbetween India and Russia. Despite India having major influence in the field of IT, hardly\nany IT firms have presence in Russia. The same is true from the Russian side as well.\nDespite India being fourth largest consumer of energy globally and Russians being\npioneers in oil and gas, Russian energy firms are not that active in Indian markets. Custom\nbarriers play a very crucial role in acting as trade barriers. Russians have set price controls\nfor imported goods. Every good exported to Russia has to pay custom duty, leading to\nprice rise. The price rise happens over and above the minimum price set, thereby creating\ncomplications. Bureaucratic delays on both sides at times lead to financial losses for\nprivate contractors. Absence of support by banks in financing bilateral exports on both\nsides acts as a hurdle in bilateral trade cooperation.\n\nt '\n\nRussian investors have tremendous amount of capital to invest. India should cash\nupon this opportunity and promote Indian brands and products in Russia. India can, in\nfuture, explore joint business manufacturing in the Eurasian Union. Kazakhstan, for that\nmatter, offers a competitive environment which is investor friendly to manufactures.\nAttempts should be made to understand each other’s culture as it will facilitate trade. A\ndedicated investment fund can be created where Russia can use the fund to support Make\nin India and Smart City projects. Thus, India and Russia do have the potential to boost\ntheir economic cooperation and make it as strong as the political cooperation.\n\nTheme 3: Transport Connectivity—The Strategic Dimension\n\nBenefits of\n\nINSTC corridors\n\n*\n\nDefence, security, energy and technology are the core issues that dominate the discourse\nof India—Russia Strategic Partnership while issues related to connectivity and accessibility\nare yet to find mention. The INSTC is an attempt by Russia, Iran and India to boost\ntransport connectivity amongst themselves and the Central Asian states. The INSTC links\nthe Indian Ocean, Persian Gulf, and Caspian Sea to the Russian Federation. Studies by\nvarious transport experts have proven that the INSTC could provide multiple benefits to\nall players, especially to Russia and India.\n\nThe INSTC, which had been initially envisaged by Russia, Iran and India today has\neleven member states who also wish to reap economic benefits from the proposed\ncorridor. Strategically speaking, the INSTC has multiple benefits for India. The first is that\nthe corridor provides India with viable surface transport connectivity to the Eurasian\nregion. A study by the Iranian Ministry of Road Transport suggests that the corridor will\nreduce transport costs by 30% and shall provide a 40% shorter route as compared to the\nroute passing through China and Europe to reach Russia from India.\n\nWith the Sagarmala initiative of India and the India~Myanmar-—Thailand highway, the\ncorridor will connect Europe and Russia to the ASEAN states. From the Indian point of\nview, the INSTC and India~ Myanmar-Thailand highway could transform India into a\npotential transit hub. India also gains from the corridor strategically as it helps India\nbypass Pakistan and reach Europe via Iran (also helps reach Afghanistan via Iran) and\nmarket goods easily. Despite such a great potential, the ground reality is that the container\ntraffic from India through Astrakhan has not reached its full potential. There are lots of\nfactors that constrain the full utilisation of the corridor.\n\neazy\nr\n;"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

In the twenty first century, the two have become lethal nuclear rivals of each\nother. Peter. T. Coleman rightly pointed out that 95 per cent of the most serious disputes in\nthe world can be resolved, but India and Pakistan come under the irresoluble 5 per cent.\nThe relations have always been locked in a vicious cycle. They begin with much optimism\nand fanfare but soon get engulfed by uncertainties, generating complications that lead to\nthe suspension of dialogue, only for the cycle to continue again with a fresh round of\noptimism the next time. Though the acquisition of nuclear capabilities by both countries\nhave prevented a major conflict, small-scale conflicts like Kargil crisis of 1999 did take\nplace. General Monty Palit has rightly stated that, over a certain period of time, the Indo—\nPak relations have become, in a sense, a sort of communal riot disguised in armor. Both\nsides today have a perception that the other side sought to inflame the conflicts.\n\nIn the initial years after independence, in the 1950s, the death of Jinnah and Liaquat\nAli Khan led to the military strengthening its influence in Pakistan. Over a period of time,\nPakistan developed a semi-alliance with the USA by becoming part of the CENTO and the\nSEATO. Pakistan always wanted a western security guarantee for itself against India but\ncould not succeed in the same. During the 1950s, due to intense wariness of a communist\n\nChina and the Sino-Russian relationship, the USA also provided economic and military\naid to India to ensure that India does not fall into the Soviet trap. The commonality of\nhaving the USA in the region as an intermediary for both states paved an opportunity for\nIndia and Pakistan to work upon the Indus Water Treaty, 1960. The US’s support to India\nand India’s defeat at the hands of the Chinese in the Sino Indian conflict of 1962 were\ntwo factors that resulted in Pakistan deciding to instigate unrest in Kashmir in 1965. The\nUS, consequently, became disillusioned with both and suspended its aid of military\nhardware to both India and Pakistan. This allowed the Soviets to step into resolve the\nstalemate, leading to the Tashkent Declaration after the 1965 war.\n\nThings changed in 1971 when the East Pakistan war (Muktijuddho) broke out and\nIndia succeeded in helping slice away East Pakistan, thereafter known as Bangladesh.\nIndia’s R&AW played a very successful role in the covert operations carried out,\ndemonstrating the capability to create a new state. The USA supported Pakistan to the\nextent that it now decided to create trouble for the Indian army. The USA feared that the\nnewly victorious Indian army could attempt to invade West Pakistan, thereby depriving\nthe US of a base to contain the Soviets. The USA not only entered into a rapprochement\nwith China but ended up colluding with Chinese intelligence to create unrest in India. The\nUSA-Pakistan—China axis led to the birth of insurgency in India’s North-East and the\nKhalistan problem. This successfully diverted the attention of the strong Indian army to\ntwo different ends of the country. This, in the long run, ensured the survival of West\nPakistan.\n\nIn West Pakistan, which had, by then, become Pakistan, the dominant region was that\nof Punjab. The Punjab in Pakistan also had the largest share in the Pakistan army. This\naligned the centre of military power in Pakistan. Post-1971 till almost the end of the Cold\nWar, India never perceived Pakistan as a serious rival. But, from the 1990s, the situation\nchanged. As Pakistan began to sponsor unrest in Kashmir, India began to again perceive\nPakistan as a source of regional destabilisation. Matters got more complicated after both\nsides acquired nuclear capabilities. The two states have developed a repeatedly reinforced\nparanoia about each other. Pakistan is determined that even if it cannot win in Kashmir, it\nwould continue to support extremism in the valley to bleed Indian resources. In the recent\ntimes, India too has harboured a similar view with respect to support to Balochis to bleed\nPakistan. Over a period of time, certain views have evolved. Today, the Jamaat-i-Islami in\nPakistan believes that Pakistan has to emerge as the forerunner of an idea of Islamist\nawakening, and such an awakening would also absorb Indian Muslims. The Indian RSS\ncontinues to believe that Pakistan as an independent state is an unacceptable entity and a\ncivilisational challenge to the existence of India. There has never been a serious attempt to\nbuild up ideological and cultural ties between both states and due to the absence of\ngoodwill, and the two have not been able to promote intraregional integration in goods,\ncapital and ideas for the same reason.\n\nKrishna Kumar aptly states that the two sides have an iron curtain that prevents them\nfrom building a pool of common knowledge about each other. The two sides, since\nNehruvian times, have taken steps to normalise relations, only to have the talks hardly\nyield positive changes in the relations. During the 1990s, the foreign secretary level talks\nbegan but failed to achieve anything as the Kashmir problem became a precondition for\ndialogue. Vajpayee initiated the concept of composite dialogue, which also failed to yield\n\nresults despite the fact that the composite dialogue was to be on all subjects concerning the\ntwo, ranging from water issues to travel to Sir Creek. The composite dialogue got\nsuspended after the 26/11 Mumbai attacks in 2008, only to be revived again as a\n‘dialogues’ in 2011. The 2011 talks began without the precondition of any particular item\nbut still failed to achieve any breakthrough. The intense rivalry between the two today is\nvisible at the SAARC level and their interactions with the Islamic world. If Pakistan\nprevented India from joining the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) then India\nexcluded Pakistan from the BIMSTEC. Though, in the recent times, social networking\nplatforms have led to the people from the two states establishing a connect, this connect\nhas not yet to permeate to the level of a cross-border alliance between the two states.\n\nWe now turn our attention to a brief analysis of some of the core conflicts between\nIndia and Pakistan. Both sides feel that fear, hatred and a sense of persecution are the key\ndrivers of the conflict. The conflict not only revolves around the disparity in size between\nIndia and Pakistan—Kashmir, water issues and the Siachen glacier issue also constitute\nthe three core geostrategic issues affecting the two. The complexity of the conflict has\nbeen certainly aggravated by presence of nuclear capabilities and Islamic extremism. A\nstudy of Indo-Pak trade tells us that immediately after the Partition, the two states reached\nan all-time high in trade. The bilateral trade dropped in 1950s and after 1965, the figures\nfell to abysmally low levels. In 1956, the two sides had agreed to provide the MEN clause\nfor goods trade with each other. The agreement on the MFN clause however could not be\nconcluded till 1970s.\n\nA study by Nisha Taneja and Eugenia Baroncelli has found that India and Pakistan\ncollectively constitute 90% of the GDP of the region and peace between the two states\ncould yield a 405% rise in trade at the bilateral level. It is important to note here is that\nboth states have a collusion of interests on items of international trade, signifying the\npossibility of a tacit cooperation in existence between the two states. Instead of using this\nto leverage South Asian integration, ironically, the South Asian states have explored the\nglobal markets of North America, Europe and China. The intraregional trade in South Asia\nis so low today that, at times, it is described as inverse regionalism. Weak trade facilitation\nmechanisms, protectionism, lack of transit facilities and mutual suspicion are major\nfactors in deterring trade practices. Though there is a call for the expansion of bilateral\nIndo-Pak trade, some Pakistani firms do fear that Indian firms could dominate Pakistan if\nfree trade is facilitated. However, many in Pakistan do believe that the opening up of trade\nbetween the two states could lead to greater material gains for both. The two states\ntogether have a great potential to emerge as a net exporter of ferrochrome to the world.\nIndian companies have the potential to export trucks, tires to Pakistan as the same\ncommodity is imported by Pakistan from third countries via Dubai.\n\nDominance of Pakistani military ‘Section amongst government official\n\nthat may not favour easy trade favor status quo due to their hold over\nwith india black trade\n\nPakistan's rising trade with China\n» has brought in a fear that future trade\nmay not be lucrative with India\n\n“\nPakistan which may be suitable ‘Weak Pakistani economy and deteriorating\nfor india in the larger run law and order situation is not inducement\n\nApart from trade, conflicts related to water issues have played a role in the Indo—Pak\n\nrelations. Brahma Chellaney is of the opinion that future wars in Asia could be driven by\nissues related to water itself. In undivided India, when water issues used to crop up in the\nPunjab region, the British government used to resolve such issues through semi-judicial\ncommissions. After the Partition, the localised disagreements on water issues were\ntransformed into conflicts of an international nature. In 1947, the division of Indus, Ravi,\nSutlej, Chenab, Jhelum and Beas were taken up at the level of an inter-dominion\nconference but no concrete solution came up. As there was no success in resolving issues\nrelated to water at the inter-dominion conference, India demanded financial reparation if\nany allowance was made to Pakistan. In 1950, in response to Indian request for finance\nreparation, Pakistan demanded delimitation of waters through International Court of\nArbitrations. India summarily rejected any third-party intervention to resolve the bilateral\nwater issues.\n\nIn 1951, an American expert, David Lilienthal, published an article discussing the\ndevelopment of the Indus Basin through financial contributions by the World Bank. The\ndirector of the World Bank, Eugene Black, convinced India to allow the World Bank to\nwork as a conduit for a possible agreement related to the Indus Basin between India and\nPakistan. Nearly ten years later, after long-drawn negotiations between both sides with\naggressive assistance from engineers and technicians, on 19th September 1960, an Indus\nWater Treaty was born. The uniqueness of the Indus Water Treaty is that it was a treaty not\nnegotiated by diplomats but by engineers, with the World Bank becoming a non-political\nsignatory to the treaty. The treaty was designed in a manner that it focused more on\ndeveloping the Indus Basin than merely allocating water, with the emphasis being on\nincreasing the productive capacity of the Indus Basin. The World Bank acted as an agency\nto facilitate economic upliftment and did not resort to the resolution of political disputes\nbetween the two sides.\n\nIn 1978, there emerged another issue on the Salal Dam. India had built the storage\ndam some 64 kilometres away from the Indo—Pak border on the Chenab River. Pakistan\nobjected to the construction of the Salal Dam. In 1978, after negotiations, India decided to\nlower the height of the Salal Dam and assured Pakistan that the dam would be used only\nfor generation of power. This agreement was hailed by the international community. In\n2005, Pakistan again objected to India’s 450 Megawatt Baghliar Dam constructed on the\nChenab River. Pakistan invoked provisions of the Indus Water Treaty and sought\narbitration from the World Bank. A neutral expert was appointed for arbitration. The\nverdict was announced in 2011 in favour of India. The Pakistani ISI took the decision of\nthe verdict as a snub to Pakistan. They began to promote militant organisations to bring\nabout a shift in their tactics. The Pakistan based militant organisations initiated mass\nprotests in Pakistan alleging that India is resorting to water terrorism. A new wave of anti-\nIndia sentiment had been generated by Pakistani organization all over. India has never\nflexed its muscles on water issues with Pakistan as such moves are tantamount to\nillegality, but the diversion of waters by India is one of the established nuclear red lines\nstated by Pakistan. The water issues between India and Pakistan have still remained a\nnational issue in each country and neither of the sides has explored larger environmental\nconcerns due to climate change to emerge in the policy discourse. The water related issues\nbetween the two states will always generate emotionalism as there is no regional level\ninstitution today that can capably solve the problem.\n\nThe other significant problem is the lingering Kashmir issue. When the Partition of\nIndia and Pakistan happened, the British failed to integrate Kashmir into either of the\nstates. Both the states subsequently developed a feeling that massive injustice had been\ndone to both parties. Kashmir, thus, became a political issue in the bilateral domestic\npolitics of India and Pakistan. The civilian and military leadership of Pakistan used the\nKashmir crisis to divert public attention from the task of nation building in Pakistan. One\nreason why the Kashmir issue has not been resolved till date is because initially, during\nthe Cold War, the USA and the USSR saw Kashmir as the symbol of a systemic struggle\nbetween the East and the West, exploring no avenues for resolving the issue through a\nregional solution framework.\n\nDuring the Cold War, India thought that it has provided a political solution to the\nKashmir problem through Article 370 and the Simla Agreement of 1972. However, the\ntruth is that even till today, under the leadership of Modi, India has not been able to evolve\nan effective strategy to deal with the Kashmir problem. Pakistan has always resorted to a\nviolent approach of forcefully snatching away Kashmir and the wars in 1947-48, 1965\nand 1971 are a testimony to the fact.\n\nIn 1984, the Indian R&AW came to know that Pakistan had purchased specialised\nclothing for very low temperatures for its army from a supplier in London. The R&AW\nalerted the Indian army and during their one of the operations, the army found a Pakistani\nexpedition team in a place near Siachen. Before the Pakistani expedition could resort to\nany adventurism, India occupied Siachen. India considers Siachen strategically crucial.\nThe Indian army, since then, has favoured a policy of status quo on Siachen while it is the\nonly issue where Pakistan seeks an agreement. The strategic significance of Siachen for\nIndia is control of the Karakoram region that Pakistan and China have expanded into,\nunder the pretext of developing a Karakoram highway. India feels that its presence in\nSiachen can keep the China—Pakistan activities under check. The roots of the Siachen\noccupation for India, thus, are not embedded in topography but the higher geopolitics of\nthe region.\n\nAfter the 1962 war, as India was defeated, Pakistan witnessed the military weakness\nof India and decided to teach India a lesson. They chose Sir Creek in the Rann of Kutch,\nwhich exists between Sindh and Rajasthan, as a possible weak spot. Though Pakistan\nmade a military attempt, it was unsuccessful and it later decided to submit the matter to a\nforeign mediator. In 1968, a three-member commission was formed. India favoured\nYugoslav and Pakistan favoured Iran, while the UN appointed a Swede to the commission.\nThe final judgment of the commission gave some territory to India and some to Pakistan.\nBoth sides gained some territory but also lost territory. Both sides faced political\nconsequences for the settlement and India became determined not to resort to outside\nmediation in future.\n\nAfter independence, most of the leaders in India had proposed the creation of\nPakistan. Opposition arose due to the fact that Pakistan became a Muslim state in contrast\nto the secular Indian state. Nehru was the chief proponent of the stated idea and believed\nthat the Western states had exacerbated the problem by giving Pakistan economic and\nmilitary aid and had taught Pakistan to coerce India. Nehru had even hoped that Pakistan\nwould collapse but that did not happen and eventually, the two sides got mired in a new\n\nstrategic landscape where neither they were at war nor could become peaceful neighbours.\nThough the economic liberalisation of 1990s fuelled another tool that could be used to\nfoster ties, nothing concrete worked out at the level of normalisation. Manmohan Singh\nand Modi have tried using the commercial stick, but it has still not found any resonance in\nPakistan. Indian officials feel that a number of attempts were made to resolve the conflicts\nwith Pakistan but the record has been mixed and normalisation has not been achieved.\n\n’ M Y ’ ' y\nWanted a No Tashkent Simla agreement Not toattack  Apledgefor ——Reinstituted\nWar agreement agreement 1972 and sove nuclear sites No First Use the hotline\nwith Pakistan issues bilaterally of each other when nether\nhad nuctear\nweapons:\nY ’ Y\nPeople to Make the South Asian\nPeople ties borders economic\nand bus irrelevant integration\ndiplomacy\n\nDespite these efforts made by various Indian PMs till date, the imprint of the past and\ngeopolitical calculations of Pakistan’s relations with the West, China and Russia, coupled\nwith a possibility of nuclear escalation, have remained some of the key obstacles to efforts\nof normalisation. All along, India’s efforts to initiate normalisation has met with\nprovocation and escalation from Pakistan.\n\nDuring the British era, they perceived the area that later became Pakistan as strategic\nfor the Raj because Pakistan acted as the North West bulwark in the efforts to contain\nRussian ambitions. After the Partition, as India wanted to stay away from the Cold War\npolitics but Pakistan, by an alliance with the USA, brought the Cold War right to the\ndoorsteps of India. At the end of the Cold War, the Western support for Pakistan dipped\nand India took advantage of the leverage by shifting its strategy to economic liberalisation\nto foster relations with the USA.\n\nAfter 9/11, USA again began to revive the idea of engaging with Pakistan to tackle\nIslamic extremism. Since India too supported the idea of USA’s global war on terror, both\nsides, India and Pakistan, were now with the USA. This made India uncomfortable yet\nagain. However, though the US has brought India and Pakistan together to cooperate with\neach other, the process has not yielded any significant dividends. Though both states have\nnuclear weapons and have ruled out a possibility of a fully-fledged nuclear war, they have\nresorted to continuing a sub-conventional war by using the ISI and the RAW. Only a few\noptions remain in bringing about normalisation. One is that both sides resort to a ‘do-\nnothing’ approach. India has largely followed the idea of ‘masterly inactivity’ for many\nyears. The other option is transforming the ties through economic means and economic\nintegration. India also exercises the following options to manage Pakistan.\n\nInclude state governments in\n\nIndia in dialogue with\nAll players of economic integration ‘counterparts in Pakistan\nare Narendra Modi, Manmohan , Accommodate Pakistan through\n‘Singh, Rajiv Kumar initiatives and make Pakistan\n* India's Canada\nBy accomodationists, Kuldip od\n1K.

The Pakistanis believe that India wants to militarily\ncrush Pakistan. Pakistan uses an analogy with Israel to explain India’s position with\nrespect to itself. Pakistan feels that both Pakistan and Israel were created by communities\nwho perceived an impending threat of persecution by a majority state as they constituted a\nminority. Both remained under threat from neighbours. Pakistan feels that after the\nPartition, the Hindus wanted to take revenge by attacking a minority-constituted Pakistan.\nPakistan further maintains that to meet this threat, both countries (Pakistan and Israel)\nused a common strategic policy of building up of alliances with the West as a security\nguarantee. However, Pakistan alleges that neither Israel nor Pakistan got adequate support\nfrom the West for their security (Pakistan uses 1971 crises as an explanation), which\ncompelled them to go nuclear for their own security and survival. In Pakistan, the army\nhad dominated its national security and foreign policy discourse since the 1950s. This is\nthe reason that in Pakistan, the army has an upper hand in dictating diplomacy with India.\nThe Pakistani army feels that the R&AW has entrenched itself deeply in conflicts internal\nto Pakistan and has unleashed an inner leviathan in Pakistan to destabilise it from within.\n\nSince its inception, Pakistan has sought to build a link between its religious identity\nand its geostrategic location. For Jinnah, Islamic Pakistanis, being followers of\nmonotheistic Islam, were naturally more allied to the monotheistic Christians than Hindus.\nUsing the religious angle, he favoured a deeper alliance with the US. Jinnah articulated\nthat only monotheistic people could resist the Soviets in the world. Jinnah asserted that\nHindus and Indians could not be trusted in the fight against communism and advocated\nthat Hindu Indians were more sympathetic towards Soviets. Jinnah tried to market\nPakistan as a Muslim Israel to America, which shared the same values and same god.\nPakistan, therefore, succeeded in developing a nexus built upon religious values with the\nUSA to tackle a godless communist Russia.\n\nPakistani military favors a Minority view favours yielding to\nbalancing India policy Indian on Kashmir, water issues\neventoday | and border conflicts\nHardiiners favour a break up of |, Accommedate with India by\nIndia to support establishment «\nae safeguarding Pakistani interests\n\n‘Some in Pakistan favour getting help from\nthe outside to put pressure on india and\nsimultaneously work to build up Pakistani\n\n: develops economic\nstrength to be in a position to bargain with india piercing go\n\nAfter having a brief glimpse of some of the conflicts and basic perceptions of India\nand Pakistan, we now turn our attention on the mechanisms and tools that can help us\nexplain their conflicts.

Just prior to Indian independence, there were two categories of states under\nthe British. Firstly, there were states of British India and secondly, there were the Princely\nStates. The concept of Princely States was that such states could enjoy nominal\nindependence under the British Raj provided their defence, foreign policy and\ncommunications were managed by the British. At the time of independence, based upon\ntheir demography and location, a Princely State could either join India or Pakistan, as was\nannounced in the provision by Lord Mountbatten.\n\nKashmir posed some difficulty because it was a Muslim majority state ruled by a\nHindu monarch, Maharaja Hari Singh. Initially, Hari Singh was reluctant to join either\nIndia or Pakistan. Meanwhile, Pakistan launched a campaign by sending its troops\ndisguised as tribesmen to forcefully annexe the state of Kashmir. A revolt against the rule\nof Hari Singh was fomented by Pakistan. Hari Singh had his own fears. He never wanted\nto accede to Pakistan as he feared that a Muslim state of Pakistan would soon integrate the\nMuslims of Kashmir thereby relegating him to a minority status. He also had similar\nconcerns for India, as he thought that if he acceded to India, a socialist Nehru would strip\nhim of the privileges he enjoyed. As Pakistani tribesmen reached Kashmir, Hari Singh\npanicked and began to make frantic requests to India for help. India, led by Nehru,\ndecided to assist Hari Singh only if he acceded to India. Once Hari Singh signed the\ninstrument of accession, thereby acceding Kashmir to India, Indian troops landed in\nKashmir. The troops were able to stop the onslaught by Pakistani forces but by then, one-\nthird of Kashmir had fallen into the hands of the invaders. Nehru, heeding the advice of\nMountbatten, referred the case of Kashmir to the United Nation in 1948.\n\nAfter enormous negotiations, discussions and resolutions at the UN level, the body\nadvised a ceasefire agreement on 1st January, 1949. Consequently, a new Ceasefire Line\nwas created in Kashmir. As the time went by, the Kashmir issue got embroiled in Cold\nWar politics with the UN passing some critical resolutions over Kashmir. UN asked India\nto hold a plebiscite in Kashmir to determine the wishes of the Kashmiri people while\nurging Pakistani troop withdrawal from the region. Pakistan refused troop withdrawal and\nIndia did not follow up with the UN recommended action, citing the alleged refusal of\nPakistan to comply first.\n\nIn 1962, India had a border conflict with China. After its defeat in the conflict, it\ndecided to upgrade its military with assistance from the USA and the UK. The British and\nAmericans too used this opportunity to induce bilateral dialogue between the two states.\nThe US sent its Secretary of State, Dean Rusk to persuade Nehru to initiate a dialogue\n\nwith Pakistan on the Kashmir issue. From 1962 to 1963, though there was dialogue\nbetween the two sides, nothing favourable was achieved. As the talks between the two\ncould not yield any results, it motivated Pakistan to launch yet another offensive in 1965.\n\nThe 1965 war was a military stalemate. The USA did not want to be involved in the\nresolution of conflict between the two as the previous US attempt had not yielded any\nresult. This allowed the USSR to broker peace after the 1965 conflict through the Tashkent\nAgreement as it saw the bleak US interest as an opportunity to expand its Asian influence.\nThe declaration stated that the Indian and Pakistani forces would pull back to their pre-\nconflict positions (pre-August 1965 lines), no later than 25 February 1966. Further, the\nnations would not interfere in each other’s internal affairs, economic and diplomatic\nrelations would be restored, there would be an orderly transfer of prisoners of war, and the\ntwo leaders would work towards improving bilateral relations. The Tashkent Agreement\nled to maintenance of status quo by the two sides.\n\nAnother conflict between India and Pakistan happened in 1971, which originated in\nthe domestic political exigencies in Pakistan. In December 1970, Pakistani held a general\nelection. As per the result, the Awami League (led by Sheikh Mujibur Rehaman) won the\nelection in East Pakistan while Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) swept the polls in West\nPakistan. The PPP and Awami League began negotiating a power sharing agreement but\nby March 1971, the two reached a more severe deadlock. The Awami League protestors,\non failure to reach a power sharing agreement, initiated a massive protest to seek\nautonomy. The Pakistani army began to suppress the Awami League supporters in Dacca\ncity from March, 1971. As the suppression continued, the supporters of the Awami League\nbegan to leave their country and started a migration to the Indian state of West Bengal.\n\nAs this refugee influx began, India took up the issue diplomatically. As the matter\nwas being negotiated diplomatically, India’s R&AW began to design a plan to invade East\nPakistan and break it away form the control of West Pakistan. The RAW began to train\nand support the Mukti Bahini movement. The Mukti Bahini movement was a liberation\nforce trained for covert capabilities. Witnessing renewed unrest, on 6th December 1971,\nPakistani Air Force launched strikes on Indian air bases in North India. India perceived the\nattack as an attack on the sovereignty of India and decided to militarily retaliate. The\nIndian forces entered deep inside East Pakistan and captured around 90,000 Prisoners of\nWar (POWs). India subsequently supported Sheikh Mujibur Rehaman and succeeded in\nseceding East Pakistan from the West. Bangladesh was finally born out of the conflict.\n\nThe crushing defeat of 1971 came as a big blow to Pakistan. The attention of the\nworld subsequently diverted due to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and the\nKashmir issue became dormant till the end of the Cold War. After East Pakistan seceded,\nthe US and China began to use Pakistan to create troubles for India. The CIA of USA,\nalong with Pakistani ISI, began to create unrest in Punjab by supporting extremism in the\nform of the Khalistan movement. Indian army at that time was led by General K. Sundarji.\nTo intimidate Pakistan, Sundarji chose the state of Rajasthan to launch a massive military\nexercise codenamed as Operation Brasstacks. Sunderji was interested in using the\nBrasstacks to test newly built radars by India. The sheer magnitude of the exercise,\ninvolving around 1,50,000 soldiers, generated anxieties in Pakistan. The Pakistanis too\nresponded with their own military exercises, codenamed as Sledgehammer and Flying\n\nHorse.\n\nAs the situation became tense and appointed to the build up for a future war, the\nSoviet and US diplomats and officials of CLA and KGB swung into action and began to\nwork with R&AW and ISI officials to reduce tensions. As the crises de-escalated, in an\ninterview to Kuldip Nayar, Pakistan’s Abdul Qadeer Khan resorted to nuclear signalling\nby arguing that Pakistan was on the way to have a nuclear weapon. Rajiv Gandhi\nauthorised the nuclear scientists of Indian to begin work on Indian nuclear bomb. As the\ncrisis defused, General Zia died in a plane crash in 1988 and subsequently, under US\npressure, the Pakistani army decided to go for elections, with Benazir Bhutto assuming\npower.\n\nBhutto began to initiate a new round of dialogues with Rajiv Gandhi but as the\nmilitary in Pakistan began to create unrest in Kashmir from 1989, the newly launched\npeace process was jeopardised. The ISI of Pakistan began to launch a massive rebellion in\nKashmir. The initial Indian response was to suppress it with an iron first. This inflamed\nthe local sentiments and gave the ISI an opportunity to take advantage of this newly\ncreated fault line. As the crisis in Kashmir began to precipitate, India warned Pakistan that\nany attempt to enhance infiltration in Kashmir would result in conflict. In 1990, the USA\nagain stepped in to defuse tensions. The crisis was temporarily defused but the attempts at\ninfiltration from Pakistan did not end. India switched its tactics to maintain order in\nKashmir, and eventually, Pakistan resorted to the use of proxy terrorists in Kashmir to\ninitiate a proxy war.\n\nThe test of nuclear weapons by India and Pakistan in 1998 led to a new dimension of\nconflict. The US and other powers tried hard to persuade India and Pakistan to roll back\ntheir nuclear weapons programmes, but their efforts failed. Scholars were divided about\nthe future of the relationship at the time. Some believed that the acquisition of weapons\nwould lead to strategic pessimism and would reduce the possibility of escalation while\nothers argued that Pakistan, being a revisionist state, could provoke a status quo power\nlike India with its nuclear weapons. This is a classical security dilemma because,\ntheoretically speaking, if in a situation of international anarchy, both states are endowed\nwith nuclear capabilities, then it could be only used as a defensive tool and not an\noffensive one. Thus, a state is compelled to respond to the choice of the other state to\nacquire such military capabilities. This counter-action leads to a spiral of hostility in the\nsystem. A status quo state may not undertake any steps but a revisionist state may wish to\nduring about territorial changes and may construe the moves of a status quo power as a\nsign of weakness. This perception of the revisionist power then enhances its vision.\n\nWe also further need to understand that in Pakistan, the military dominating the\npolicy discourse is rooted in its history. When India became independent, it resorted to the\nuse of democracy and brought the army within the control of the political executive. In\ncontrast, Pakistan, after its creation, failed to create elements of democracy. Nehru sought\nelections while Jinnah continued to rule as an unelected Governor General of Pakistan. As\nJinnah died in the early years, the constitutional experiment was overtaken by the first\nmilitary coup in Pakistan in 1958. Pakistan began to resort to the use of its military to\nquell civil disturbances and maintain order. The army gradually began to develop a bigger\nhand and began to emerge as a dominant player.\n\nDue to differences in politico-military relations of both states, the foreign and\nsecurity priorities were contemplated differently and this often brought the two on a\ncollision course. However, as the two armies, prior to independence, were trained under\nthe British umbrella, it is interesting to note that the two sides used old strategies in the\nconflicts of 1947-48, 1965 and 1971. Many efforts have been made to resolve the crises\nand resort to negotiations but such attempts have failed to deliver results. The newly\nelected Indian PM, Narendra Modi tried to break the ice by inviting Nawaz Sharif to his\nswearing-in ceremony in 2014. In December 2015, the PM made an unscheduled surprise\ntrip to Lahore. However, the subsequent Pathankot, Pampore and Uri attacks led to the\nsuspension of dialogue once again. Let us now turn our attention to analysing Kargil\nconflicts, the Kashmir issue, Operation Parakram and the process of composite dialogue.\nWe shall begin with the Kargil conflict.\n\nAs mentioned, in 1998, India and Pakistan tested their nuclear weapons. In order to\ndefuse rising tensions, Indian PM Vajpayee, initiated a dialogue by visiting Lahore in\nFebruary, 1999. Vajpayee launched a new bus diplomacy between Amritsar and Lahore.\nDuring his meeting with Nawaz Sharif, Vajpayee launched a series of confidence building\nmeasures (CBMs).\n\nThough a body of experts, the\n_, two sides to exercise strategic\n\nHotline at the level of —\narmed forces, foreign secretary «\nand PM level\n\n* No intrusion into either's airspace\n\nThe visit of Vajpayee to Lahore was a watershed event. Vajpayee also visited Minar-\ne-Pakistan where he publicly asserted that a stable Pakistan is in India’s interest. This was\nthe most important statement ever by an Indian head of the state on Pakistani soil, as\nVajpayee endorsed the idea of the existence of Pakistan, which had been a long-standing\nconcern for Pakistan. The Minar-e-Pakistan was chosen as a venue to announce this\nbecause it was the same place where the Lahore Declaration was passed to establish\nPakistan in 1940. Vajpayee appointed a journalist, RK Mishra, as an interlocutor for the\ndialogues on the Kashmir crisis. Nawaz responded by appointing Pakistani diplomat Niaz\nNaik. For the first time, India decided to bypass official diplomatic channels for talks on\nKashmir as Vajpayee, by appointing RK Mishra, injected new blood into the negotiations.\n\nAs the dialogue was brought back on track, it got abruptly suspended as from May,\n1999, as the Pakistani army intruded into Kargil and launched an offensive. The Indian\nforces launched a mega counteroffensive and were able to drive off the intruders by mid-\nJuly. Pakistan had launched intrusions in Kargil assuming that Indian army would be busy\nin counterinsurgency in Kashmir and would not be in a position to respond appropriately.\nThe Pakistani army also assumed that the Indian wide would not resort to any escalation\nas there could be nuclear threat. The most important Pakistani assumption was that USA\nwould step in and resolve the conflict swiftly. All these assumptions were flawed and they\nexposed Pakistani weakness. However, none of these things materialised. At the end of\nJuly, the end of military operations finally concluded the fourth Indo-Pak war in 1999.\nThe new atmosphere of trust and good will was abruptly interrupted due to the Kargil\nepisode. Vajpayee was deeply pained by the breach of trust by Pakistan.\n\nThe Northern Light Infantry (NLI), armed with surface-to-air missiles was the\n\nPakistani force that penetrated inside the LoC and occupied Indian favoured posts which\nwere vacant. As per an agreement between the two, during the winter months, both states\nhad earlier decided to withdraw troops from forward posts. Pakistan occupied the vacant\nIndian posts and occupied Batalik, Turtuk and Dras in Kargil. In May, 1999, the Indian Air\nforce (IAF) launched Operation Safed Sagar, which was a sustained air strikemeant to\nsupport the ground troops and was aimed to flush out regular and irregular troops of the\nPakistani Army from vacated Indian Positions in the Kargil sector along the Line of\nControl. This air strike came as a big blow to Pakistan as it was never a part of the planned\ncalculations. The innovative airstrikes by India also caused an extremely detrimental\npsychological impact on Pakistan who found extremely difficult to retaliate. The IAF used\ninnovative bombing mechanisms to cause landslides and avalanches. A massive strike by\nIAF on a logistical camp in Muntho Dhalo in Batalik sector caused havoc for Pakistan as\nit was the sole supply depot for the forces of the Northern Light Infantry Regiment (NLI).\n\nBy the end of July, 1999, the intruders were completely driven out from the\nunoccupied posts. Pakistan, alarmed by the Indian response, immediately sought to seek\npartial de-escalation and an end to air and ground strikes from Indian. In the course of\nconflict, diplomatically, China favoured a neutral stance but the ground reality was\ndifferent. Musharraf had visited Beijing during the hostilities. China also kept supplying\narmament to Pakistan to sustain the war while the Chinese army enhanced patrolling and\ntroop presence on the Sino— Indian border when the conflict was underway. During the\ncrisis, Sharif went to the US and met Clinton on 4th July, 1999 in the belief that the US\nsupport would help control the crisis. However, Sharif was surprised and shocked to his\ncore when Clinton asserted that the conflict had been initiated by Pakistan and that they\nhad no right to violate the sanctity of the LoC.\n\nAs the crisis ended, Pakistan yet again learned a hard lesson. Vajpayee initiated a\ndialogue with Pakistan again in 2001. He favoured meeting Musharraf at a probable\nmultilateral meeting. However, LK Advani insisted that Musharraf be called for a bilateral\nmeeting. In May, 2001, the Agra Summit took place, which again failed as no headway\nwas made on issue Kashmir and cross border terrorism from the Pakistani side. However,\nit was decided that Vajpayee and Musharraf would again meet on the sidelines of the\nUNGA session in September, 2001. Due to events around 9/11, the meeting was cancelled.\nPakistan came under tremendous US pressure to sever its ties with the Taliban. India on\nthe other hand, allowed the US to use Indian military base to launch military action on the\nregime of Taliban in Afghanistan. The USA preferred to go for Pakistani bases than Indian\nbases because of closer proximity to Afghanistan. On 1st October 2001, after the Jaish-e-\nMohammad launched an attack on Kashmir assembly building, the Indo—Pak relations\ndeteriorated yet again. Things came to a head after the attack on the Indian Parliament on\n13th December, 2001.\n\nThe analysis of the Kargil conflict clearly proves that the major agenda of Pakistan\nbehind launching the Kargil conflict was to exploit the cleavages within India over\nKashmir. Despite Pakistani provocation, India continued to resort to dialogue with\nPakistan. The hard-line approach of the Pakistani military, trying to exercise deeper\ncontrol over Pakistani politics and diplomacy, failed to achieve peace with India. The\ndecision of the Pakistani army to resort to covert activities yet again proved that Pakistan\nfavoured a territorial change, strengthening the argument that a revisionist state like\n\nPakistan will continue to challenge a status quo power like India.\n\nKashmir is so central to the domestic politics and identity of Pakistan, that despite its\nfailure every time in war over Kashmir with India, it is not willing to abandon its claims.\nIn fact, it has continued with a range of proxy pressures on India. Pakistan has always felt\nthat its existence is incomplete without Kashmir and has tried to ensure that the Kashmir\nquestion remain alive forever. India, on the other hand, has always believed that the unrest\nin Kashmir is partially due to the recalcitrant irredentism of Pakistan and partially a law\nand order issue. The Indian government has not been successful in realising or addressing\nthe domestic causes of discontent and alienation of the Kashmiri population. This policy\nfollowed by India till now, even under the Modi era, has failed to address the deep-seated\ndiscontent in the valley. Whenever these deep-seated factors responsible for discontent stir\nup unrest in the valley, Pakistan further steps into sow more discord and stokes the crisis.\nThe Indian strategy is again to resort to the use of force and this reinforces the alienation\nand causes more antipathy towards India amongst the Kashmiri people.\n\nThe Indo-Pak relationship took a severe plunge in December 1999 when IC-814 was\nhijacked and taken to Kandahar. The IC-814 was a routine flight from Kathmandu to\nLucknow. The hijackers landed the flight in Amritsar before it reached Lahore. India, at\nthat time, lacked any contingency plan to deal with such crises. The negotiations led to the\nrelease of Maulana Masood Azhar, Mushtaq Ahmed Zarg and Ahmed Umar Syed. This\nwas followed by attacks by terrorists on Amaranath Yatris in 2000. Despite these issues,\nMusharraf was yet again invited for a dialogue in 2001. The talks again did not occasion\nin any material success as Musharraf wanted to accomplish some tangible progress on the\nKashmir dispute in a single meeting. Some R&AW officials present in the one-on-one\nMusharraf—Vajpayee meeting also stated that no success could be achieved in the talks\nbecause Pakistan refused to accept its support to terrorists and insisted only on solving the\nKashmir issue while India favoured discussions on issues unrelated to Kashmir. Senior\nR&AW official asserts that LK Advani, present in the meeting, pressed for the addition of\nPakistan involvement with terrorism as part of the final communiqué while Vajpayee and\nJaswant Singh favoured that Musharraf be given a leeway on Kashmir without such\ninsistence as demanded by Advani.\n\nOn 13th December, 2001, while the Parliament was in session, terrorists of Lashkar-\ne-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) stormed the Parliament complex in New\nDelhi and began to fire indiscriminately. The Indian security officials swung into action\nand eliminated the terrorists. After the Parliament attack, there were calls for strong\nmilitary action on Pakistan. The Indian government, however, resorted to coercive\ndiplomacy. India broke off existing diplomatic ties with Pakistan and recalled its\nambassador (High Commissioner of India). India closed its airspace for civilian aircrafts\nof Pakistan while sending Indian jets at forward positions. The army was asked for a\ntimeline for a possible strike on Pakistan. The Indian army stated that any substantial\noperation against Pakistan would require a minimum of three weeks. In the meantime,\nMusharraf went public and announced a host of measures to ensure that none of the terror\ngroups use Pakistani soil to wage terrorist attacks against any state. Such announcements\nin public made it all the more difficult for India to launch a military offensive. India\nfinally made a choice to mobilise its forces along the international border on the West and\nkeep the IAF ready all times. As the tensions escalated, the US, led by Bush, immediately\n\nresorted to defusing tensions.\n\nIndia resorted to public display of anger. Vajpayee and the then Army Chief asserted\nthat time had come for some action. Despite all this, the army never resorted to any cross\nborder surgical strikes. This could not happen because by the time the Indian forces had\nreached the international border, lot of time had elapsed and Pakistani forces too were\nadequately beefed up. Apart from the possibility of a nuclear escalation, the USA too had\nbeen pressurising for restraint. Due to mounting pressure from the US, both sides began a\nphased withdrawal. India, despite troop mobilisation under Operation Parakram, did not\nuse force against Pakistan.\n\nIndian analysts and R&AW officials assert that Operation Parakram was successful as\nit was able to raise the issue of Pakistani sponsorship of terrorism at the global level.\nHowever, no structural change ever happened in the Indo-Pak relationship after Operation\nParakaram. Due to enormous pressure on Pakistan from the US, Musharraf finally\ndeclared a unilateral ceasefire with India along with LoC in 2003. The Indian army, on the\nother hand, began to search for a new doctrine. In fact, senior officials in the army assert\nthat since the Kargil War, the army had been looking for options to fight a limited war\nwith Pakistan under the nuclear umbrella. This process accelerated in the aftermath of the\nParliament attack. This led India to toy with the idea of the Cold Start doctrine, as a\ndoctrine for limited war. Under the Cold Start doctrine, it has been decided to break the\nlarge ‘strike corps’ into division sized integrated battle groups, which, with thorough\nspeed, will resort to rapid mobilisation. Such mobilisation will resort to swift manoeuvre\nover Pakistan and capture a limited strip of land through air, ground and naval action.\nSuch captured territory is to be used as a bargaining chip with Pakistan.\n\nIn 2002, Kashmir witnessed elections. After the elections, in 2003, Vajpayee visited\nSrinagar and announced fresh dialogues with Pakistan. In 2004, the Vajpayee government\nwas replaced with the government of Manmohan Singh. Manmohan decided to carry\nforward the idea of composite dialogue. Manmohan stressed the idea of negotiating with\nPakistan as he strongly believed that India would not be able to position itself as a global\nplayer if it remained mired in conflict with Pakistan. The diplomatic ties were re-\nestablished and a process of normalisation began.\n\nDisputes related to Kashmir,\nIssues related to Siachen, and Sir Creek\nnuclear CBM’s *\\ a\n__ Issues related to terrorism,\nCommercial issues related sug eating\nto Wallar barrage, «\nTulbul project ..

It decided to reduce troop presence in Kashmir and\ndecided to help in establishing a channel for negotiations with Kashmiri separatists. The\nback-channel diplomacy launched by India was led by Satinder Lambah. It resulted in\nstart of Srinagar—Muzaffarabad bus service. Musharraf paid a one-day visit to India and\nattended an Indo-Pak cricket match. However, a crisis erupted again as terrorists struck\n\nthe Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus service. The negotiations continued in 2006 and\nManmohan even offered a new treaty of peace, security and friendship to Pakistan.\nHowever, Pakistan responded to the offer of the treaty by asserting that Kashmir remained\ntheir central question. The peace process was derailed in July, 2006, when LeT cadres\norchestrated the Mumbai blasts. The LeT organised bomb blasts in local trains in Mumbai.\nThe peace process moved at an extremely slow pace after the blasts. In September, 2006,\nthe two sides established a Joint Mechanism for Investigation and Countering terrorism. In\nDecember, 2006, Musharraf announced a four-step package approach for the Kashmir\nproblem.\n\nPeprtentid gint nai in weno {Initiate official level talks on Kashmir\n\nIndia to acknowledge the centrality\n“of Kashmir dispute in Indo-Pak\nrelations:\n\nAdoption of acceptable-\nsolutions to all the three\nIn 2007, Pranab Mukherjee visited Pakistan and continued the discussions. In\nFebruary 2007, the Samjhauta Express was bombed. As the Samjhauta Express bombings\nwere not done by any Pakistani group, the talks continued. Investigations had found Hindu\nterrorists responsible for the blast. In February, the Pakistani Foreign Minister visited\nIndia and a nuclear pact to reduce nuclear risks was concluded. The ousting of Musharraf\nhad somewhat put the composite dialogue in jeopardy but it was the Mumbai blasts\n(26/11) in 2008 that altogether halted the peace process. Pakistan had a new civilian\nadministration led by Asif Ali Zardari. After the Mumbai attacks, India resisted any\nmilitary action as it feared that the Zardari regime was still nascent and if India militarily\nretaliated, Pakistan would resort to escalation as the army was cornered in Pakistan.\nFurther, upon retaliation, India would have been branded as an aggressor, affecting its\nmoral international standing for an attack on Pakistan that would, in any case, serve little\nstrategic utility. Subsequently, under intense pressure, the Zardari government resorted to\nsome cosmetic actions by detaining leaders of LeT and JeM. The Pakistanis favoured\nresumption of the composite dialogue once again but the Indian side declined the request.\nThe Manmohan Singh regime did make more attempts to normalise ties with Pakistan but\nthe Pakistani military dominated its diplomacy and did not allow any major changes on\nthe ground. As mentioned earlier, even Modi tried to break the ice with Pakistan, but\nterrorist attacks in Pathankot, Pampore, Uri in 2016 and Kupwada in April 2017 have\nagain led to the suspension of the composite dialogue.\n\nOur analysis of the Indo-Pak relations thus far proves a few things. Pakistan has\nadopted a two-point strategy on Kashmir. It asserts, firstly, that they are fighting for the\nrights of Kashmiri Muslims. Pakistan insists that it has any control over non-state actors in\nKashmir. Our analysis also points out, secondly, that all regimes in Pakistan have\ncontinued with the policy that Kashmir is the core central issue and that Pakistan would\nrest only when it succeeds in taking Kashmir from India, suggesting that Pakistan would\nremain a predatory power. India today, under Modi Government, has understood that it has\nto face a revisionist state called Pakistan.\n\nImage ground resentment by Maintain troop presence in Kashmir\n‘sponsored\n\n‘of Kashmir valley to thwart Pakistani\n\nAdidress the socio-economic Sufficient vigilance and powerful\nmarginalization of the youth < » imelligence collection on the border\n\nStrategy of deterrence 3\ntwough denial ‘A shif to delensive-otfensive approach where\n+ India would strike at the place trom where an\nSustain counter insurgency in tack against India originated\nKashmir to stop inftration across LoC\n\nJuly 2014, Modi decided to resume dialogues with Pakistan.

In 1946,\nthe memorandum of the Cabinet Mission to India defined the status of such states. As per\nthe Cabinet Mission plan, once the British paramount ceases, the crown would no longer\nhold paramount power and such power would be transferred to the states. There will be an\nend to political arrangements between the states, crown and British India. The state will\nfill the void by establishing a relationship with India, Pakistan or would remain\nindependent. Two instruments, namely, Instrument of Accession and a Standstill\nAgreement were proposed by Mountbatten. Jinnah interpreted that, as per Cabinet Mission\nPlan, the situation post lapse of paramount would be such that states would gain\nindependent status of being sovereign in nature. Congress, through a resolution on 15th\nJune, 1947, held that on lapse of paramountcy, the will of the people of concerned states\nwould be required to ascertain their choices as lapse of paramountcy did not tantamount to\nthe independence of a state. With this interpretation, the Congress raised objections when\nthe Maharaja of Jodhpur began to negotiate an accession with Pakistan. India insisted its\ninterpretation in case of Junagadh. A referendum on Junagadh happened and its population\nvoted in favour of India. Kashmir was ruled by Hari Singh. In September 1947, there was\na communal trouble in Poonch province in the state. Simultaneously, Pakistani tribesmen\nhad started pouring in and had unleashed a campaign of carnage in other areas reaching up\ntill Srinagar. On 24th October, 1947, Hari Singh requested arms and troop support from\nIndia to stop the Pakistani-sponsored menace. As Hari Singh had not acceded either to\nIndia or Pakistan, troops from India could not be sent. Mountbatten asserted that the\naccession should be determined by a plebiscite after the tribesmen have been driven out of\nKashmir. Nehru accepted the views of Mountbatten.\n\nMountbatten contended that as India has not signed a formal accession treaty with\nKashmir, if it sends troops to Kashmir, Pakistan would do the same and this may lead to a\nwar. It was decided by Nehru to inform Hari Singh that only if Hari Singh acceded to\nIndia would there be any troop commitment. Nehru, however, clarified that such an\naccession is conditioned and once law and order is restored, the will of the Kashmiri\npeople about their future would holds acrosanct. Hari Singh signed the instrument of\naccession and sent a letter to Nehru to that effect. In the letter Hari Singh stated that\nKashmir had signed a standstill agreement with Pakistan. As per the agreement, Pakistan\nprovided postal and telegraph services in the state. Hari Singh also complained that\nPakistan had put a lot of pressure on him and one of the pressure tactics was the tribal\nraids. He wrote that in this emergency, instead of allowing Pakistan to destroy his state, he\npreferred concluding an instrument of accession with India. The Indian government\naccepted the accession and decided to provide military help to Kashmir. Pakistan\nimmediately declared that the accession was an act of fraud and it summarily rejected the\naccession.\n\nThe challenging of the legality of the accession by Pakistan was an unsound political\nmove. Indian policy was clear—it was aimed at driving out invaders from Kashmir. Once\nlaw and order would be restored, there would be a plebiscite under the observation of UN.\nMountbatten urged Nehru that an international agency like the UN can ensure impartiality\nin the plebiscite. On 15th January, 1948, India argued in the UN that after normalcy\nprevailed in the state, there would be a plebiscite under the auspices of the UN. The UN\nsubsequently established a UN commission for India and Pakistan with power to exercise\nmediatory influence. As the UN commission for India and Pakistan (UNCIP) came to the\nsubcontinent, there arose disagreements over de-militarisation in Kashmir. In 1949, India\nincluded representatives of Kashmir in its Constituent Assembly and worked on Article\n370. Pakistan immediately raised objections to the same. India clarified that as its\nConstitution was being discussed, the Kashmir region could not be left out. However,\nIndia asserted that the inclusion of representatives of Kashmir did not change its position\non ground. India assured that after the plebiscite, if Kashmir decided to go the other way,\nits representation in the Indian parliament would automatically cease. India further\nclarified that the instrument of accession was conditional on a plebiscite but was legal.\n\nThe Indian Constituent Assembly debated about an Article 370 (which was debated\nas Article 306A) to give representation to Kashmir till conditions conducive for a\nplebiscite were created. The UNCIP yet again made an attempt under McNaughton’s\nleadership to create a conducive condition for plebiscite by advocating demilitarisation.\nHowever, the UNCIP failed and the UNSC terminated the UNCIP in 1950 and appointed\nSir Owen Dixon as the UN Representative to the Security Council. Owen Dixon again\nproposed the idea of a plebiscite after demilitarisation. In 1951, the Indian government\nsupported the creation of a Constituent Assembly of the state of Kashmir which would\nframe its own Constitution but India clarified that it remained committed to a plebiscite\nand against forced marriages. The Constituent Assembly of Kashmir adopted a\nConstitution for Kashmir on 17th November, 1956. The Constitution declared that\nKashmir was an integral part of India. Though Pakistan objected to this provision, India\nclarified that the legality of Kashmir’s accession to India (as happened in October 1947)\ncould not be challenged but that did not change India’s position of a plebiscite to allow the\nKashmiris to determine their future, provided conducive conditions are created. India\nalleged that the Pakistani invasion of Kashmir and the subsequent Pakistani membership\nof SEATO and Baghdad pact in 1953 and 1954 had not created a condition conducive for\na plebiscite. India also alleged that Pakistan had not withdrawn its troops on the other side\nof the ceasefire line. India, by 1960, began to assert that it would not accept international\nmediation and would resort to a bilateral dialogue with Pakistan over Kashmir but\ncontinue to support plebiscite. India advocated a shift of treating the Kashmir problem as a\nworld question to treating it as a domestic issue.\n\nWhen Pakistani tribesmen had invaded Kashmir, the UNCIP was instructed to work\njointly with the two states and create a condition conducive for a plebiscite. To\nimmediately halt the hostilities, the UNCIP, through negotiations, helped India and\nPakistan sign an agreement in 1949 in Karachi. As per the Karachi Agreement, a ceasefire\nline was drawn as a temporary arrangement to divide the line between Kashmiri territory\nleft with India and Pakistan occupied Kashmir which they called Azad Kashmir. The\nPakistani army decided to take over the operational control of the Pakistan occupied\n\nKashmir and stationed its troops in the region. India had alleged that this troop presence of\nPakistan was one of the reasons why a condition conducive for a plebiscite had not been\ncreated. The ceasefire line came into effect from 1st January, 1949.\n\nIndia alleged that the stalemate over Kashmir could not end and a plebiscite could not\nhappen as Pakistan did not withdraw its troops from the PoK which was a necessary\ncondition for restoration of peace leading to a future plebiscite. As time progressed, in\n1965, Pakistan launched another conflict with India. The India army gave a befitting\nresponse to Pakistan. In the subsequent Soviet brokered negotiations a Tashkent\nAgreement was concluded and both sides agreed to maintain a status quo. In 1971, in the\nwar with East Pakistan, as explained in the previous section, India yet again gave a serious\nblow to Pakistan by slicing off Bangladesh from its control. After the 1971 war, India and\nPakistan signed the Simla agreement in 1972. Under the Simla Agreement, Pakistan\ndiplomatically paved way for recognition of creation of Bangladesh. Under the\nAgreement, the ceasefire line established by the Karachi Agreement of 1948 was re-\ndesignated as Line of Control (LoC).\n\n, No precise definition in\n” North at NJ9842\n\nUN Miltary Observer group in\n\n* India and Pakistan (UNHOGIP)\n\n‘to maintain peace along the line\nPakistan through Under UNSC Karachi\n\ntribesmen invades Resolution ‘Agreement\nKashmir 47-UNCIP is establishes\nestablished ceasefire line\n\nUnder the Karachi Agreement, the demarcation in the North at point NJ9842 was not\nclear. The two sides had no disagreement in the glacier area as the terrain was\nuninhabitable. In 1970s, Pakistan undertook expeditions in the region near NJ9842 in an\narea called the Siachen glacier. India too launched an expedition in the Siachen glacier.\nPakistan eventually made an attempt to occupy the glacier. In 1984, Indian army, under\nOperation Meghdoot, thwarted Pakistan’s efforts and successfully occupied the Siachen\nglacier.\n\nUnder the Simla Agreement of 1972, as mentioned above, the ceasefire line was now\nrenamed as LoC and thereby the tenure of UNMOGIP to maintain peace on the ceasefire\nline came to an end. The Simla agreement of 1972 gave India an opportunity to put the\nconversion of the Kashmir issue from an international to a bilateral issue on paper. In\n1972, under the Simla Agreement, Pakistan agreed to resolve Kashmir bilaterally without\nany third-party intervention. Though India gained at this point in 1972, however, critics\npoint out that India lost an opportunity in 1972 to make the LoC as an international border.\nDue to lack of clear demarcations, firing across the LoC continued from the Pakistani side\nin 1980s, 1990s and 2000s.\n\n__ Ceasefire Line became the Loc\n\n“oy The role of UNMOGIP ended\n. .\n* Disputes be resolved bilaterally\n\n“International intervention not welcomed\n\nThe Simla Agreement of 1972 could not solve all the problems and proved unable to\nstabilise Kashmir. Since the 1950s, Sheikh Abdullah’s National Conference (NC) was in\npower. In the period from the 1950s to the 1980s, he was dismissed many times only to be\nreappointed again. In 1987, Kashmir held elections. After the death of Sheikh Abdullah,\nFarooq Abdullah, his son, decided to form an alliance with the Congress for the elections.\nIn the 1980s, various social and religious organisations who wanted to resolve the\nKashmir issue peacefully formed Muslim United Front (MUF). The MUF too wanted to\nuse the 1987 elections to put forth Kashmiri grievances peacefully at the legislative forum.\nFarooq Abdullah won the elections. The MUF alleged that the elections were rigged, after\nwhich the MUF candidate Mohmmad Yusuf Shah was imprisoned. This led to mass\nprotests in the valley.\n\nA Pakistani militant outfit leader Syed Salahuddin too fuelled the protestors through\nhis group, known as the Hizbul Mujahideen (HM), which had been originally founded by\nMuhammad Ahsan Dar. The HM group mobilised Abdul Hamid Sheikh, Ashfaq, Majid\nWani, Javed Ahmed Mir and Yasin Malik and formed the Jammu and Kashmir liberation\nfront (JKLF). As the MUF cadres were suppressed, they began to cross over to Pakistan\nfor support. In 1979, the USSR had invaded Afghanistan. To contain the Soviets, the USA\nbegan to take help from Pakistan. The CIA had provided arms, ammunition and money to\nthe ISI to train Mujahideens to fight the Soviets and create an enormous amount of\nresistance to the Soviet rule in Afghanistan. In 1989, as Soviet rule ended, Pakistan’s ISI\nstarted developing confidence about the fact that a successfully trained Mujahideen\ncampaign could also be launched in Kashmir.\n\nThe 1987 elections and the suppression of MUF had given Pakistan a fertile ground\nto fuel unrest in the valley. After the elections of 1987, when MUF cadres reached\nPakistan for support, the ISI began to train them with arms and ammunition. In 1993, 26\nsocial and religious organisations united to form the All Parties Hurriyat Conference\n(APHC). The APHC began to raise the call for the independence of Kashmir. The USA\ntoo had given tacit support to APHC leaders in India and it was financially backed by the\nCIA. As the JKLF received support and training from Pakistan, in 1989, they attacked a\nHindu Kashmiri Pandit, Tika Lal Taploo. The assassination created tremendous fear\namongst the Kashmiri Pandits. The HM too vocally began to assert that Kashmiri Pandits\nimmediately leave the valley. Kashmir, which had been home to Sufi Islam and Hinduism,\nwho had always coexisted peacefully, witnessed communal crisis. As violence against the\nHindus unfolded in the valley in 1990, the central government decided to appoint\nJagmohan Malhotra as the new governor of Kashmir. The exodus and ethnic cleansing of\nKashmiri Pandits continued in the early 1990s as the ISI succeeded, through JKLF and\nHM, in arming the local population and inciting revolt against the Indian state for the sake\nof Kashmiri self-determination. From 1990 to 1994, the Indian security forces launched a\nmassive campaign against the insurgents and terrorists in the valley. The Indian forces\nlaunched a ruthless campaign to suppress the insurgents with an intention to break the\norganisations from within. By 1996, HM and JKLF were severely weakened.\n\neo @ &\nae |\n\n1987 1987 Sovereign Kashmir ideology 1993\n\n© @ . Kashmir to be part of Pakistan\n\nThe Lashker-e-Taiba (LeT) had been created by Hafiz Saeed and was active against\nthe Soviets through Jihad in Afghanistan. Through the support of the ISI, the LeT started\nturning its attention towards Kashmir from the 1990s. The ISI successfully transformed\nthe LeT into a proxy group against India. The LeT is ideologically linked to the Ahl-i-\nHadith interpretations of Islam. Since 1990s, the ISI of Pakistan launched a campaign that\nsought to infiltrate Kashmir with the Ahl-i-Hadith ideology. The Ahl-i-Hadith\ninterpretation is interlinked with the Wahabism school of Islam, which is one of the most\northodox and stringent forms of Islam practised in the world. Since 1990s, attempts have\nthus been made to Wahabise the Kashmiri society, which has always practised a softer,\nSufi ideology-oriented Islam.\n\nTehreek-ul-Mujahedeen ,\n\nUnited Jehad council « ee\n\nTehreek-ul-Mujahedeen eo ee Lashkar-e-Jabbar\n\nJamat-ul-Mujahideen\nLashkar-e-Taiba < Fa Al-Badr\ni.” _-—» Al-umar-Mujahideen\nJaish-e-Mohammad « 4\nFe ~~» Markat-ul-Ansar\nHarkat-ul-Jihad-e-isiami « ™ Harkat-ul-Mujahideen\n\nHizbul-Mujahideen\n\nThrough a dedicated department known as the Joint Intelligence North (JIN), the ISI\nbegan to provide support to separatists and terrorist groups to encourage infiltration into\nKashmir. They carry out clandestine activities in the Kashmir region. In 1990s, to counter\nthe ISI campaign, R&AW stepped in and launched Operation Chanakya. The R&AW\nbegan to form ‘political cells’ in Kashmir to counter the separatists. In South Kashmir,\nKuka Parray alias Jamsheed Sheraji, in association with R&AW formed, the pro-India\ncounter-insurgency outfit called Ikwan-ul-Musalmeen. The Ikwan group neutralised\nPakistani groups in South Kashmir. Jamsheed was in reality a member of state assembly of\nKashmir. R&AW created factionalism within the Hurriyat where Kuka Parray played an\ninstrumental role in creating factional split within APHC to encourage moderate leaders.\n\nThe R&AW also created the Muslim Mujahideen to neutralise Pakistani groups in 1990s.\nIn 2003, the R&AW also succeeded in creating a split in HM. The basic idea of Operation\nChanakya was to neutralise ISI groups using Indian counter-insurgency groups.\n\nAll this while, ISI fuelled their campaign of spreading Wahabism in the valley and\nalso initiated an attempt to introduce the idea of slicing off Kashmir from India to be\ncontrolled by Pakistan. By 1996, there was public disillusionment over ISI-sponsored\nviolence and its attempts to Wahabise Kashmir. The R&AW and Indian forces\naggressively ended the terrorist campaign in the valley and violence was drastically\ncontrolled by 1996. As the ISI received a setback, they initiated a new campaign of\nviolence with a new tactic. In the period from 1999 to 2002, the ISI resorted to a new\nfidayeen phase of the campaign. The idea was to attack army camps, zero down on targets\nand terrorise the Kashmiri population. The logic behind ISI sponsored fidayeen attacks\nwere to cause a psychological blow to the Indian forces, Indian people and the Indian\nstate. The ISI now used Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad for the campaign. This\nperiod saw the Kargil intrusions and an attack on the Indian Parliament. India pointed out\nPakistan’s role in the Parliament attacks and initiated Operation Parakram. Under intense\npressure from the USA, Pakistan acquiesced to the dismantling of Taliban infrastructure.\n\nThe hostilities between India and Pakistan along the LoC and the international border\nhad increased between, 2001-2002. In 2003, to de-escalate the rising tensions, the two\nsides concluded an agreement to maintain a ceasefire. As per the agreement in 2003, both\nsides would maintain peace and tranquillity on either side of the LoC and allow\ncompletion of fencing of the LoC. In 2005, India and Pakistan agreed not to develop new\nposts and defence works on either side of the LoC. The period post the ceasefire\nagreement in 2003 saw a sharp decline of violence and tranquillity had been achieved in\n\nKashmir again.\n= » Amamath issue\n\n, Burhan Wani and\n\nt J } ” unrest in Kashmir\nISI sponsored Fidayeen Normaicy\na siege like wartare restored in\nsituation tactic the valley\n\nThe period from 2001-2002 onwards saw a resurgence in Indian economy. The\nbenefits did not percolate evenly everywhere. As the situation became normal by 2008,\nanother controversy created a storm. In 2008, the Indian government, along with the\ngovernment of Kashmir, decided to undertake a land transfer of 99 acres to the Sri\nAmarnath Shrine Board (SASB). Such a land transfer immediately assumed a communal\ndimension and Hindu—Muslim violence broke out. After intense and heated debates, the\ngovernment decided to stall the transfer to the SASB. However, the political parties had\nalready begun to believe that Islam was under threat in Kashmir and violence unfolded. As\nan atmosphere of unrest prevailed, certain events in 2010 sparked massive protests. In\n2010, the Indian army carried out an encounter of terrorists in the Machil Sector in the\ndistrict of Kupwara. Investigation found that instead of militants, the army had killed\ncivilians living in Rafiabad area in the fake encounter. A month later, in June 2010, during\na police crackdown, some innocents were killed in the Srinagar area by the police. This\n\nled to massive protests. The protestors began to pelt stones at the security forces. The\nprotestors demanded the Indian troops to ‘quit Kashmir’. The ISI saw an opportunity to\nrevive their support to the protestors in the valley. The R& AW found evidence that the ISI\nhad begun to use social media platforms to mobilise the Kashmiri youth against India. The\nISI reinvigorated their idea of liberating Kashmir from India.\n\nThe Indian government announced measures to curtail tensions. Apart from an all-\nparty meeting, the government decided to appoint inter barters with Kashmir. The army,\ntoo, brought the perpetrators of Machil fake encounter to task.\n\nHowever, an understanding of deeper dynamics of protestors and stone pelters point\nout different factors for the uprising. Apart from the anger against the security forces, the\nprotestors were also frustrated due to lack of employment as there were no jobs for the\nyouth, with instances of violence arbitrarily perpetrated by security personnel alienating\nKashmiri youth further. The ISI took advantage of such alienation to instil the ideology of\nWahabism and radicalism amongst the youth, exhorting them to enrol for Jihad. As the\nsituation turned to normalcy, again sparks erupted. In 2013, the government hanged Afzal\nGuru. His hanging for his role in the Parliament attack caused a massive unrest in the\nvalley. In 2015, the PDP decided to form a government in Kashmir in alliance with the\nBJP. The people of the valley did not favour such an alliance. The angered the youth and\ncertain sections of the youth again found solace in extremism.\n\nBurhan Wani was a classical example. He joined the Hizbul Mujahideen (HM). The\nHM, adequately supported by the ISI, aggressively used the social media for radicalisation\nand indoctrination. The HM made him the commander of South Kashmir. His youthful age\nand sincerity found immense resonance amongst alienated Kashmiri youth. On 8th July,\n2016, the Indian armed forces killed Wani in an encounter. His death led to an upsurge in\nthe valley. Lakhs of people attended his funeral. The ISI and HM, through social media,\ninstigated the youth to resort to stone pelting against the Indian forces. The Pakistani\narmy’s ceasefire violations and the ISI’s social media-led mobilisation from 2016 to 2017\nhave led to massive unrest in the valley yet again. Prem Shankar Jha has called the 2016\nunrest in the valley as a Kashmiri intifada. Stone pelting in 2016-17 has emerged as a cult\nin Kashmir. This radical suicidal stone pelting, in the face of pellet guns and other armed\nforces ammunition, is an outcome of Pakistan-sponsored radical Wahabi indoctrination\namongst the youth. The ISI of Pakistan, according to R&AW, has earmarked 1000 crores\nto be given to groups in Kashmir to create stone-pelting led unrest. The R&AW found that\nin 2017, during by-elections for Lok Sabha from Srinagar and Ananthnag, the ISI had\ndeliberately created a fear psychosis amongst the population to deliberately have a low\nvoter turnout. After the by-elections, ISI resorted to a massive international campaign to\nhighlight the low voter turnout.\n\nThe R&AW has found that Pakistani strategy is to instigate Kashmiri youth to\nobstruct forces and pelt stones at them, which will inevitably lead to forces using fire upon\nyouth. The more youth are killed, the more it would alienate the Kashmiri population\nfurther from India. Such alienation will provide the ISI to activate HM and other groups to\nradicalise youth by preaching Wahabism. The radicalised Wahabi youth would resort to\nJihad to create more unrest in the valley.\n\nA lot of suggestions have been put forward for resolving the crises. The most\n\nimportant, however, is that the government should address the alienation of the Kashmiri\nyouth and bring them into the mainstream society. There should be immediate job creation\nand political mobilisation of the youth and efforts should be taken to connect the youth to\nthe political processes in the country. Pakistan too needs to stop ceasefire violations.\nAlienation of the youth, coupled with anger, has led to a serious crisis in Kashmir today.\nRadical Islam and Wahabism too has affected the youth who have moved away from the\nsystem. Taking advantage of the void created by the failure of institutional mechanisms by\nthe state and the central government’s side, Pakistan is back in the valley with a\nvengeance.\n\nAlienation Lack of\n\nof youth employment\n\n‘” x\n\nP Anger\nDS\n™ Anti-india feeling\nJ “Aggression\nISI, LeT, HM Sense of\n\ninciting people ~ hopelessness\nand radicalising\n\nyouth\n\nPakistan has to give up its territorial ambitions over Kashmir and cease all support to\nnon-state actors in the valley.

What also added to international concerns was the\nrefusal of the two to renounce their right of acquiring nuclear weapons. All such\ninternational concerns got aggravated in 1998 when both tested their weapons. There are\ndifferent views that have erupted on the impact of regional security in the post-test period.\n\nLet us have a look at the optimistic view. In India, this view is propounded by Sumit\nGanguly. He opines that the leaders of India and Pakistan are interested in their national\nsurvival. Both leaders realise that either party has adequate capabilities to inflict harm on\nits adversaries. Thus, if there is a crisis, both sides would strive to exercise caution with an\nintention to ensure that crises are not escalated to the nuclear level. This, as per the\ndeductive logic propounded by Thomas Schelling and Kenneth Waltz, would lead to the\nprevention of escalation of conflict to a nuclear level and would bring about stability.\n\nGanguly adds further details to his argument. He observes that the Partition has had a\nprofound impact on both India and Pakistan. Pakistani leadership continues to feel, despite\nlosses inflicted upon them in 1965 and 1971, that Kashmir is an unfinished agenda.\nThough, since 1971, the South Asian region has not witnessed a war it has witnessed\n\nlimited conflicts in 1999 and Pakistani sponsored ethno-religious insurgency in Kashmir.\nIt is well accepted that the overt acquisition of nuclear weapons in 1998 has played an\nimportant role in preventing escalation of conflicts, including the Kargil intrusion, into a\nfully-fledged war. Despite further escalation of tensions during 2006 Mumbai attacks, then\nthe 26/11 attacks and recent attacks in 2016 and 2017 from Pathankot, Pampore, Uri and\nKupwara, both sides have exhibited restraint and have not violated thresholds. Ganguly\nasserts that Pakistan may resort to a proxy war but knows its limitation. Pakistan knows\nthat if it initiates any conventional conflict with India, India too would resort to retaliation\nand this could push both towards a war. India, however, has followed a mixture of resolve\nand restraint. It has given Pakistan substantial responses to Pakistani provocation. Yet the\nnuclear deterrence between India and Pakistan would remain a robust tool to avert full\nscale wars in future.\n\nThere is also a pessimistic view advanced by S. Paul Kapur. Firstly, the pessimists\nagree with the optimists on the fact that if players have nuclear weapons, they would\nbehave strategically and strive for international stability. Instead of challenging the\noptimistic school on this account, the pessimists argue that organisations which are given\nthe responsibility to manage nuclear weapons could go rogue and indulge in destabilising\nstrategies. For pessimists, organizational pathologies would short circuit the adoption of\nstabilising strategies. Paul Kapur adds further that if a state acquires nuclear weapon, it\nmay create incentives for a state to create destabilisation. He observes that there could be a\npossibility that there is a weak state in the scenario, say, which is not satisfied with the\nterritorial boundaries with a neighbouring strong state. The neighbouring strong state is a\nstatus quo power with stronger military while the weaker state may position itself as a\nrevisionist state. The weaker state may want to alter the boundaries to seek a boundary\nfavourable to itself but knows that if it resorts to a conventional conflict against the strong\nstate, the strong state would inflict heavy damage in retaliation and thereby, the weak state\nprefers to live with undesirable boundaries. Kapur asserts that acquisition of nuclear\nweapons will change the scenario. Let’s say that the weaker state acquires nuclear\nweapons. Now, through them, the weaker state has tried to overcome strong state’s\nconvention military might with actuation of nuclear arsenal.\n\nNow let’s assume that the strong state threatens the weaker one with a military\ncatastrophe. The weaker state, to mitigate the threat by the stronger state, could launch a\nnuclear strike. On first strike by the weaker state, the stronger state could resort to massive\nand unacceptable retaliation. But, the stronger state, in such a scenario, would not prefer to\nlaunch a full-scale attack or resort to a conventional war against a weak for the fear of\nnuclear escalation. The strong state may resort to strategic restraint and at times, if needed,\nresolve to a limited extent with no possibility of crossing the nuclear threshold. If the\nweaker state develops the understanding that the stronger state would exercise strategic\nrestraint, then, it may embolden the weaker state to resort to tactics to attempt to alter\nboundaries because it would know that the stronger state would not employ its full\nmilitary power in its response to the opponent. More importantly, the weaker state may try\nto indulge in destabilising behaviour due to availability of diplomatic incentives for itself.\nThe weaker state may provoke the adversary. Such provocation will push the stronger\nstate to respond, which could push the conflict towards nuclear escalation. As the tensions\nrise, the international community would intervene. Such intervention to defuse crises\n\ncould lead to a territorial settlement that may prove profitable for the weaker state. The\nweaker state would eventually, through international intervention, seek to get a territorial\nsettlement that it may not have been in a position to get bilaterally with the stronger state.\nThus, the weaker state could also deliberately resort to provoking the stronger state to\npush crisis towards nuclear escalation.\n\nIf the provocation by the weaker state increases, there could be retribution by the\nstronger state. If the weaker state, after provocation, say happens to alter the boundaries by\ncapturing some territory, it could invite a strong action from the adversary. The stronger\nstate may not only inflict tremendous harm through a conventional military attack but may\ntry to breach the nuclear threshold. The conventional military attack by the stronger state\ncould be stronger than what the weaker state could anticipate. There could be a possibility\nthat the response by the stronger state could weaken the weaker state’s nuclear controls.\nTo prevent such a possible fear, the weaker state could hand over its nuclear launching\nauthority to the armed forces with a hope that if the stronger state retaliates, the nuclear\ncommand does not lose the ability to respond. Thus, apart from just the organisational\npathologies, the insulation from full scale retaliation and possibility of international\nintervention can also lead to destabilising behaviour. Therefore, a dissatisfied state with a\nweaker military could acquire nuclear weapons to cause destabilisation. This is a situation\nof strategic pessimism which advocates that having nuclear weapons will not always lead\nto rational calculations but, at times, can create incentives to cause destabilisation and\nescalation.\n\nNow, let us apply the two views in the context of the nuclear weapons of India and\nPakistan. Though, India and Pakistan tested their weapons in 1998, but the idea of\nacquiring such weapons goes back to the 1970s. After India defeated Pakistan in the 1971\nwar, in 1974, it demonstrated its capabilities through a Peaceful Nuclear Explosion (PNE).\nThe Pakistani defeat in 1971 war and subsequent Indian PNE brought about a major shift\nin Pakistani strategic thinking and it began working on the development of its own nuclear\nweapon. The development, in a covert manner, continued by both states in 1980s. By the\nend of 1980s, the two had capabilities to develop their weapons at a short notice.\n\nThe reasons that drove India to explore the nuclear option were different from\nPakistan’s. India failed to get international security post Chinese nuclear test in 1964. This\nled Shastri to authorise a Subterranean Nuclear Explosions Project (SNEP). The SNEP\nlater in 1974 manifested as PNE. Indira and Rajiv Gandhi played important roles in the\ndevelopment of India’s nuclear capabilities. For Pakistan, on the other hand, the trigger\nwas their defeat in 1971. Pakistan understood that only a nuclear weapon could help them\novercome the threat of the conventional superiority of India. If we apply strategic\npessimism here, then some more factors can help us understand Pakistan’s bid for the\nacquisition of nuclear weapons. Pakistan was not happy with the partition in 1947. It\nwanted to alter the boundaries with India. After Kashmir signed the Instrument of\nAccession with India in 1947, Pakistan tried to alter the boundaries through 1947-48 war\nand 1965 war. With the Pakistani territory of East Pakistan also lost in the form of an\nindependent state (Bangladesh) in 1971, Pakistan realised that it would not be able to fight\na war with India over Kashmir ever again. But, Pakistan did not give up the cause of\nKashmir fully. It decided to challenge territorial boundaries in Kashmir after it acquired\ncapabilities that could alter the strategic situation. This compelled Pakistan to acquire\n\nnuclear weapons. As the acquisition of weapons was going on, the Soviet invasion of\nAfghanistan in 1979 and subsequent mujahedeen campaign by the US gave Pakistan a\nnew idea on how to resort to a proxy model to alter the status quo in Kashmir. As the Cold\nWar ended in 1989, bolstered with arms, training and knowledge from the mujahedeen\ncampaign, coupled with a capability to produce a nuclear weapon at a short notice,\nPakistan unleashed proxy insurgency in Kashmir in 1989. Pakistan began to realise that it\ncould use the nuclear option if India resorted to a conventional attack upon Pakistan due to\nprovocation in Kashmir. Pakistani strategic elite clearly knows that it can continue to\nsupport insurgency in Kashmir as the acquisition of nuclear capabilities has neutralised the\nIndian option of conventional conflict with Pakistan.\n\nTherefore, as the Pakistani side began to support insurgents in Kashmir, the Indian\nside immediately enhanced its security presence in Kashmir to suppress the insurgents.\nThe Pakistani side responded by enhancing their presence along the international border.\nIndian side responded by deploying armoured units from the international border till the\nLOC. As the crises escalated, Pakistan feared a full-scale attack from India while India\nfeared an attack on Kashmir. To defuse the crisis, the US government sent its Deputy\nNational Security Adviser Robert Gates to the region. The Gates Mission succeeded in\ndefusing the crises by warning Pakistan that in case of an attack from India, it would be\ndefeated. As the crisis deescalated, both sides announced normalcy again.\n\nOne view which explains why the two sides did not go for a war in 1990s is the view\nby Sumit Ganguly. According to him, despite massive infiltration by Pakistan in Kashmir,\nIndia exercised caution because it was aware of Pakistan’s nuclear capabilities. In 1965,\nwhen Pakistan had undertaken infiltration, Indian troops had crossed over the ceasefire\nline and destroyed the assembly points used by the infiltrators in Pakistan. In 1990s, when\nthis massive infiltration happened again, the Indian side enhanced force presence at the\nLoC but did not undertake any forceful measures. The Indian officials at that time offer a\ndifferent perspective. They argue that India never wanted to escalate the 1990 crisis into a\nwar as India did not perceive the situation at that time volatile enough to occasion a full-\nfledged war. The then Indian Foreign Secretary SK Singh stated clearly that assuming that\nthe 1990s crisis could lead to war is a mere conjecture. According to this logic, then the\n1990’s crises that happened in the backdrop of nuclear weapon did into stabilize but\ncreated a possibility of destabilization as witnessed in Pakistani support to insurgents in\nKashmir.\n\nAgain, in 1998, Pakistani army men carried out an intrusion in Kargil. They crossed\nover the LoC and entered into the Indian side. When the Indian side observed these\nintrusions, in 1999, Indian forces carried out an intense air and ground offensive and drove\nout the intruders. As the Indian side had suppressed the insurgency in Kashmir by 1996,\nthe international attention on Kashmir too began to decline. Pakistan wanted to make an\nincursion in the region again without harming vital its security interests of India. The\nprime intention of making an intrusion in Kargil was to slice off a part of the National\nHighway IA as doing so would make it difficult for India to supply logistics to the Indian\ntroops in the Siachen glacier. India launched an offensive to dislodge intruders but ensured\nthat neither the ground troops nor its air force crosses the LoC. India exercised tremendous\nrestraint. Pakistan thought that its nuclear capabilities would prevent an Indian\nconventional response and also the international attention in case of crisis between two\n\nnuclear armed players would be beneficial to Pakistan.\n\nThe optimists argue that the nuclear weapons in the context of Kargil prevented\nescalation. However, the Indian officials argue differently. Indian Army Chief during\nKargil conflicts, VP Malik, asserts that India did not cross over the LoC as it wanted\ninternational support and had cared for the world’s opinion. Even G Parthasarathy asserts\nthat India did not cross the LoC to ensure that the world would accept that Kargil had\nhappened because of Pakistani provocation. Indian response was rooted in self-defense.\nVP Malik further states that as the political leaders wanted the forces to eject the intruders,\nthey exercised fluidity and flexibility by granting the forces the authorisation to cross over\nthe LoC if need be. He asserts that there was no nuclear threat in the picture and if the\ntactical operation did not go well, India could have crossed the LoC. Even Brijesh Mishra\nasserted that if army would have requested the need to cross over the LoC and the political\nleadership would have accepted the request if circumstances had necessitated thus.\nAccording to the official view, crossing the LoC would not have triggered any nuclear\nbacklash from Pakistan.\n\nAs the crises of Kargil ended, new situations erupted and now the Indo—Pakistan\nconflict was at an all new level. India demanded that Pakistan hand over terrorists\nresponsible for attacks on India, failing which India would strike Pakistan and snatch their\nterritories. In January, 2002, Pakistan declared LeT and Jaish-e-Mohammed illegal and\nbanned their activities. Musharraf asserted that Pakistani territory would not be used\nagainst India by terrorists. The US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, visited India to assure\nIndia of serious steps taken by Pakistan to dismantle terrorist infrastructures. India, in the\nwake of visit of Colin Powell, decided not to strike but did not remove its forces from the\nborders. In May, 2002, Pakistan ambushed Indian troops in Kuluchak in Jammu. India\ndecided to attack Pakistan from Rajasthan across the LoC and sieze territory and destroy\nPakistani forces. Consequently, Musharraf assured the world that Pakistan would\npermanently end infiltration. The USA Deputy Secretary of State, Richard Armitage,\nvisited India and assured India once again of Musharraf’s pledge. India began to withdraw\nthe plan and decided to end Operation Parakram.\n\nWhy did India not resort to attacking Pakistan despite escalation of conflicts in 2001-\n2002? One view is that the nuclear weapons prevented any serious conflict escalation and\nIndia exercised restraint. The other view is that Indian officials did not feel the need to\nattack Pakistan as they believed that Operation Parakram had delivered the desired results.\nIndian officials observe that there was no point attacking Pakistan because they received\nassurances from the US that Pakistan would dismantle its terrorist infrastructure. They\nfurther clarify that their goal was to ensure that terrorism does not emanate from Pakistan\nand Operation Parakram and USA assurances achieved this goal.\n\nSince the stand-off, the two sides have not witnessed any form of major crises\nescalation. India’s use of coercive diplomacy has sent a strong message to Pakistan. The\nfuture relations post 2001-2002 have taken a different turn. The US has de-hyphenated\nIndia and Pakistan and has, over a period of time, bolstered Indian capabilities. It has\ngiven India a nuclear deal in 2005. The US is now working with India to strengthen its\ndefence apparatus through the Indo—-USA DTTI (explained in the chapter of India and\nUSA relationship) and the LEMOA. Pakistan, on the other hand, has tilted towards China,\n\nwhich has been attempting to bolster Pakistani economic capabilities. Nuclear weapons\nhave played a considerable role in crisis prevention strategy. Nuclear weapons have played\na considerable role in crises prevention strategy. Despite Pakistani provocations in the\nform of 2006 Mumbai train attacks, 26/11 attacks in Pathankot (2016), Pampore (2016),\nUri (2016) Kupwara (2017), Krishna Ghati (2017); India has resorted to a strategy of\ndiplomatic isolating Pakistan and on provocation, has followed a mixture of resolve and\nrestrain.\n\nThere is, however, an alternative view that suggests that post 9/11, Pakistan started\ntaking steps to dismantle terrorist infrastructure within its territories, which led to a serious\nbacklash by the terrorist groups against the state of Pakistan. Many terrorist group\nnurtured by Pakistan have evolved a sense of betrayal by the Pakistani regime. As a result\nof this, such groups have gradually turned against the Pakistani establishment. In recent\ntimes, Pakistani diplomats have globally started voicing a concern that Pakistan too is a\nvictim of terrorism. As the terrorist groups have organised themselves in NWFP, FATA\nand Baluchistan region, the attention of the Pakistani army has been diverted from\nKashmir to maintain internal security. Thus, Pakistan is finding it extremely difficult to\nfight along three fronts, namely, a proxy war against India in Kashmir, a combo of Al-\nQaeda-Taliban and internal groups resorting to aggression against Pakistan. Pakistan has\nbeen now started alleging that India’s R&AW is funding terror groups in Pakistan. India\nhas, on the other hand, summarily dismissed such allegations.\n\nIndia has also decided to inflict harm upon Pakistan for their provocation through the\nCold Start doctrine. Under this doctrine, India, on Pakistani provocation would inflict\nharm upon Pakistan, capture their territory to use it as a bargaining chip in the post-\nconflict period and yet the depth of the incursion by India under the Cold Start will not be\nintense enough to trigger a nuclear response by Pakistan. Pakistan has, in the recent times,\nbrought about a shift in its attitude. It has started using Kashmir as a launch pad to attack\nother Indian cities like Varanasi, Lucknow, Ajmer and Hyderabad and so on. This gives\nPakistan not only the option of deniability but a brilliant strategy of showcasing the\ndisgruntled Indian Muslims and their suppression to the world."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The potential motivation for Pakistan to develop nuclear weapons began\nwith its perceived asymmetry with India in conventional warfare. The response of the\nUSA in not fully supporting Pakistan outright in the 1965 and 1971 wars aggravated\nPakistan’s fear that the US would not be able to function as a long-term security guarantor.\nThe secession of East Pakistan in 1971 made Pakistan perceive India as an existential\nthreat. It therefore decided that acquisition of nuclear weapon would provide it with a tool\nto face India equally. For Pakistan, the nuclear weapons are not just a response to\nconventional superiority of India but also a tool to ensure the stability and survivability of\nPakistan. Though India advocates a No First Use (NFU) policy, Pakistan has stated that it\ndoes not have any confidence on India’s NFU and they have, therefore, not accepted the\nNFU as a viable policy.\n\nStabilise strategic\ndeterrence\n\nCore features of\nPakistani nuclear policy\n\nDeter external\n\ni aggression\n\ni fo Deter a counterstrike\nInvest in conventional e fF\nand strategic deterrence pies Strategic assets\n\nPakistan’s idea of strategic deterrence is based upon the logic of developing\nconventional capabilities first. Pakistan believes that developing conventional capabilities\nwill help them ward off a conventional attack from India. Based on this logic, Pakistan has\nsought to buy the F-16 fighter jets from the US. This is driven by the logic that Pakistan\nshould not allow India to exploit any Pakistani faultlines—from sub-conventional to\nconventional to nuclear level—as this may endanger the security of Pakistan. Pakistan\nfurther believes that if India ever resorts to a full-scale conventional attack, Pakistan\nwould resist the same through conventional preparedness, but, if the survivability of\nPakistan is under a threat, then it may exercise a nuclear option.\n\nIf India captures huge\n_~ Pakistani territory and\n“breaches space threshold\n\nIf India strangulates\nPakistani economy ».\n%\n\nConditions t\nPakista:\n\nNuc\n\nIf India resorts to fo\ndomestic destabilization\nand internal subversion\n\n°\\. If India destroys land and\n* air forces of Pakistan and\n\nbreaches military threshold\n\nThe four conditions are not officially mentioned by Pakistan. In fact, they believe that\nthe essence of deterrence is ambiguity and some amount of uncertainty will create\ndissonance amongst Indians about the extent they can they push Pakistan. Pakistan\ndeliberately favours an stability—instability paradox as a central element of their security\ncompetition with India. The stability-instability paradox is an international relations\ntheory regarding the effect of nuclear weapons and mutually assured destruction. It states\nthat when two countries each have nuclear weapons, the probability of a direct war\nbetween them greatly decreases, but the probability of minor or indirect conflicts between\nthem increases. To aggravate matters further, Pakistan strives for developing a large\nnuclear stockpile. Pakistan believes that the Indo—-USA nuclear deal, the NSG waiver for\nIndia and a potential NSG membership for India will allow India to buy uranium globally\nand use its own uranium for its weapons programme, which might contribute yet again to\nan existential threat to Pakistan. This has compelled Pakistan to explore the idea of\ndeveloping an offensive deterrence posture.\n\nNuclear weapons by Pakistan have allowed them an umbrella to facilitate a proxy\nwar in Kashmir. Pakistan has also developed an understanding that because of its nuclear\nweapons, it can continue to resort to a proxy war, and if conflict escalates, international\nintervention will pressurise India not to wage a war against Pakistan. Such international\nintervention legitimises the Pakistani idea of inflicting a low intensity conflict on India.\nPakistan also knows that even if the US and others may become critical about Pakistan, no\npower would abandon a freelancing nuclear power like Pakistan for the fear of a nuclear\n\nconflict in Asia and the possibility of proliferation of nuclear weapons to terrorists or other\nrogue states. Thus, today, it is not a nuclear capable Pakistan that deters India, but an\nambiguity that allows Pakistan to indulge in the risk-seeking behaviour of supporting\nterrorists and proxies. The nuclear weapons offer a shield to Pakistan’s adventurism and\noffer them immunity in the long run. Pakistan uses terrorism as a rational strategy as it is\ndesigned to generate security and survivability for Pakistan. This kind of militancy has\nbeen nurtured by Pakistan to hide its domestic, economic and political weaknesses and the\nstate uses it as a tool of asymmetric warfare (through non-state actors) to confront India.\nNuclear weapons, its augmentation of conventional forces and use of militant proxies\ntoday form a combined grand strategy of Pakistan. Therefore, jihad today forms a core of\ngrand strategy of Pakistan."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The US had provided the\nPakistani army training in guerrilla tactics and the Pakistani army realised that such a\ntactic could also be used against India. In time, Pakistan developed the idea of guerrilla\nwarfare in Kashmir. The approach was carefully articulated. The army began to take\nadvantage of the terrain in Kashmir. It provided support to dissenters, used the civilian\nsupport to fuel hatred and used their loyalties for launching anti-India attacks. Pakistan\nbegan its guerrilla campaign from 1947. It has nurtured this non-state actor led guerrilla\nwarfare action to keep itself ready for a ‘day after’ nuclear attack, also if need be. More\nimportantly, Pakistani has used the guerrilla non-state actor tactics to transfer a culture of\nWahabism in the Kashmir valley. From 1960s, Pakistan began to work upon a model of\ngradual infiltration. For Pakistan, infiltration is a strategy entailing minimum casualty and\nmaximum results. Pakistan began to toy with the idea of sending religious zealots and\nfundamentalists as part of the infiltration campaign. For Pakistan, infiltration began to\nemerge as a concept of conflict of the future. Pakistan today effectively uses infiltration\ntactic in Kashmir. Every year, since 2003, despite a ceasefire agreement in place, Pakistan\nhas resorted to ceasefire violations. The ceasefire violations start routinely from\nSeptember—October every year from the Jammu region. Pakistan resorts to firing and\nmortar shelling.

Pakistan then uses this diversion of the Indian forces to infiltrate terrorists across\nthe LoC, a process that gets completed in November. From December till June, the area\nremains under snow. The non-state actors in Kashmir thereafter resort to guerrilla warfare\ntactics. This is a classical diversionary tactics Pakistan has nurtured to wage low intensity\nconflicts against India.

The dispute goes back to 1984. India wanted to establish a\nbarrage at the mouth of the Wullar Lake on Jhelum River. that the project entailed the\ncreation of a 439 feet long and 40 feet wide barrage which would store 0.30 million acres\nfeet of water which would make the river navigable during summer season. Pakistan had\ntaken the matter to Indus Water Commission (since 1986) as it alleged that the Wullar\n\nbarrage violated the Indus Water Treaty of 1960 and the creation of the barrage would be\nused by India as a geostrategic weapon to restrict water supplies to Pakistan. India uses the\nterm Tulbul Navigation Project while Pakistan uses the term Wullar barrage to refer to the\nproject. Since 1986, there have been negotiations between the two sides to resolve the\ndispute, but it still persists.\n\nLet us turn our attention to Indus Water Treaty. Before Partition, the water of Indus\nRiver the Indus system was jointly used by India and Pakistan. After the Partition in 1947,\nthe two sides concluded an inter-dominion accord where it was decided that on annual\npayments from Pakistan, India would release a sufficient amount of water to Pakistan. It\nwas decided in the inter-dominion accord that the two sides in future will negotiate a\npermanent solution. In 1951, the former chairman of Tennessee valley authority, David\nLilienthal visited the region and recommended joint operation and development of Indus\nbasin. Based upon the idea propounded by Lilienthal, the then chairman of World Bank\nEugene Black convinced India and Pakistan to negotiate a settlement for water sharing.\nThe meetings began from 1954 and finally concluded in 1960 with Indus Water Treaty\n(IWT) signed between Nehru and Ayub Khan.\n\nThe Indus basin has three eastern flowing rivers (Sutlej, Beas and Ravi) and three\nwestern flowing rivers (Indus, Jhelum and Chenab). As per the INT, 1960, India got\ncontrol over the Eastern Rivers while Pakistan got control of Western rivers. India,\nhowever, as per the IWT was allowed to use the water from the western rivers for the\npurpose of consumption with restricted use of the river water for storage. On the western\nrivers, except for specific cases, India was not to build storage and irrigation systems on\nthe rivers. In the IWT, if there were to be a disagreement between India and Pakistan,\nthere was a provision to seek mediation and arbitration. As per the Article XII of the [WT,\na modification is permissible when both parties agree for the need of the same. To make\nsure that neither of the parties is violating any of the provisions of the IWT, the treaty\nprovides for a Permanent Indus Commission (PIC) where there would be one\ncommissioner appointed by India and one by Pakistan. Whenever a project is initiated by\none party, it has to share the information with the other party. If there is ever a dispute,\nfirst there are to be bilateral talks. If talks fail, the aggrieved party can seek third party\n(neutral party) intervention.\n\nJhelum is a west flowing river, one of its tributaries in Kishanganga. The\nKishanganga in Pakistan is called Neelam river. India authorised the National Hydropower\nCorporation to establish a dam named Gurez on the Kishanganga River. To generate\nelectricity, the National Hydropower Corporation envisaged the creation of a 20 kilometre\nlong tunnel to divert water. The water through the tunnel could be diverted through the\ntunnel to generate 300+ Megawatt electricity at Kishanganga hydroelectric plant (KHEP)\nin Bonar Nallah. Pakistan objected to the KHEP project alleging that the diversion of the\nwater will reduce the availability of water Pakistan requires for the Neelum-Jhelum\nhydropower plant and thereby also reduce the original share of river water due to Pakistan\nunder the IWT by 15%. Thus, in 2010, Pakistan approached the International Court of\nArbitration (ICA). The ICA gave a final decision in December, 2013. As per the ICA,\nPakistan will need at least 9 cubic metre per second water flow in the river which shall be\nmaintained by India and India would be able to, after ensuring 9 cubic metre per second\nflow in the river, go ahead with KHEP project.\n\nPakistan had also raised four design related issues at the ICA, but out of the four,\nonly one was settled while the rest could not settled at the bilateral level between the two.\nIn June 2013, India initiated a new 850 hydropower station to be constructed as the Ratle\nplant on the Chenab River. Pakistan raised objection to the Ratle plant and took up the\nissue for arbitration by the court of arbitration at the World Bank. Pakistan, on 19th\nAugust 2013, requested the World Bank to constitute a court of arbitration. India, as per\nthe IWT, had to respond to the request on 19th October, 2013. On 4th October, 2013, India\nrequested that a neutral expert be appointed. If a state requests a neutral expert be\nappointed, then such a request has to be accepted immediately. The World Bank, however,\nchose to sit on India’s request. On 19th October, 2013, when the Pakistani request\nmatured, the World Bank advocated both the setting up of a court of arbitration and\nappointment of a neutral expert. India objected to the proposal, observing that it would\ncomplicate the process. India threatened that it may not participate in the court of\narbitration as it had requested for a neutral expert’s appointment which had to be accepted\nimmediately, but it was not. The World Bank exercised a pause to the two processes and\nurged the two states to find an alternative resolution mechanism. The matter was taken up\nat the level of the Permanent Indus Commission. After the Uri attack happened in\nSeptember, 2016, India decided not to hold the PIC meetings with Pakistan till it stopped\nfunding terrorists. However, in March 2017, the suspension was lifted and the possibility\nof an agreement is awaited in future.\n\nCONCLUSION OF THE RELATIONSHIP\n\nJinnah is the founding father of Pakistan. He always wanted a relation between India and\nPakistan that would be similar to the US and Canada. Today, seventy years later, such a\nunion is a distant dream. The two countries have fought four bitter wars and are nuclear\narmed players now. If the two sides are not engaged in an outright war, then both are in a\nstate of cold war. In the last few years, the two seem to have been following a unique\nmechanism. The leaders of the two states normally meet on the side of any global summit\n(Modi met Sharif on the lines of Ufa Summit in 2015). Both announce that official level\ntalks have resumed. Modi, in December 2015, also paid a surprise visit to Lahore. The\nmoment talks are announced, in a short span of time, there is a Pakistan-sponsored jihadi\nattack against India (Pathankot air base attack, January 2016) and the dialogue breaks\ndown. Apart from a jihadi attack, there could also be a ceasefire violation along the LoC,\nwhich is a condition sufficient for the talks to break down. Then starts a phase of\nallegations. India accuses Pakistan of state sponsorship to terrorism (India recently also\nprovided evidence of Pakistani mutilation of Indian soldiers in Krishna Ghati in May,\n2017), while Pakistan accuses India of creating destabilisation in Pakistan. The talks derail\nand later are resumed yet again with the same fanfare, only to be broken again.\n\nMosting on *\nsidelines of _, Agreement to Tomorist attack |_Cancellation or, Resumption\ninternational” hold dialogue pring - Accusations > postponement — ” of dialogue\n\nforums\nThe seeds of discord were laid down extremely deep at the time of Partition.\n\nCongress never accepted the Partition. They always held the idea that the two sides would\neventually unite due to a shared culture and heritage. However, for Pakistan, India not\naccepting the Partition was an attack on its identity, nay, its very existence. It is an\nenduring theory of Pakistan’s leaders that India wants to absorb Pakistan. Though India\nhas taken many steps to assuage such concerns, they have had a limited impact upon\nPakistan. Even after the 1971 war, India through the Simla Agreement in 1972, accepted\nthat Pakistan can exist as a neighbour of India. But, as there was no pressure exerted upon\nPakistan in 1972 over the permanent resolution of the Kashmir issue, they took it as an\nopportunity to keep the Kashmir issue alive.\n\nRecent statements by RSS leaders in 2017 of an ‘akhand Bharat’ have again revived\nPakistani suspicions. Pakistan, till today, feels that Kashmir is its jugular vein, serving as a\nunifying agenda since Partition. Pakistan continues to use irregular warfare through proxy\ngroups to destabilise Kashmir as it harbours a feeling that it can continue to bleed India\nthrough this low-intensity conflict practised through indoctrinated religious zealots.\nPakistan ideologically radicalises its proxy groups through the inflammatory ‘Ghazwa-e-\nHind’ hadith. Groups created by Pakistan wage a war against India in the delusional belief\nthat India and Kashmir belong to the territory promised to them by Prophet Mohmmad.\nTehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan interprets Ghazwa-e-Hind as also including Pakistan, and thus\nresorts to terrorist strikes against Pakistan with an intention to free Pakistan from US\ninfluence. In time, it is expected that Pakistan shall also become aware of the dangers of\nfuelling religious extremism in its neighbouring territory. Peace between India and\nPakistan is possible only if Pakistan gives up its ambition to seek territorial readjustments,\ndisconnects its support to terrorist groups and extends a genuine hand of friendship. Such\na friendship has the potential of changing the course of not only Asia but the world."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

In 1949, there was a revolution in China and the Chinese Communist Party\n(CCP) was formed, establishing the People’s Republic of China (PRC). The newly\nestablished PRC accepted the Leninist-Stalinist style of state administration. The CCP\nimmediately removed the buffer of Tibet which acted as a barrier between India and China\nby forcefully annexing Tibet to China. As we also know, the early 1950s was a period of\ndecolonisation. As new countries were born in the region, the question that emerged was\nwhat role would India and China play in this newly emerging postcolonial world order.\nThe anxiety was about how India and China would behave in the era of bipolarity.\n\nIndia propounded its NAM ideology as an ideology of the decolonised world and\nused this to position itself as a third force in the era of bipolarity. However, India realized\nthat success or failure of its position in a new international order will depend upon the\nsupport or opposition to its efforts by China. India observed China unfolding very\ncautiously. In the early 1950s, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) was aggressively\nmoving in the Tibetan region and trying to expand infrastructure there to incorporate it in\nthe PRC. The British had always maintained Tibet as a buffer, and its annexation\nheightening Indian concerns. This acted as an important factor in our Chinese policy\nformulation. Nehru wanted to win the support of China to ensure that this gave us the\nleverage for implementing our world view as envisaged. Nehru believed that an East led\nby India and China could guide the world morally at a time when the Western thought\nprocess was being guided by polarized ideological underpinnings.

But his\ndeath in 1950 gave Nehru the steering wheel of India’s China policy and Nehru could\nnot be challenged by anyone thereafter.\n\nDuring the initial period, India advised China not to undertake aggressive occupation\nof Tibet and insisted that it would continue to follow the British policy to engage\ndiplomatically with Tibet, continuing with small missions in Lhasa and Shigatse Nehru\nwas not in favour of any US cooperation to contain China as he found it to be a Cold War\ntactic. In 1954, India and China came out with an agreement on Tibet. In the agreement,\nIndia agreed to recognise Tibet as a part of China and decided not to continue any special\nrights as inherited from the British in Tibet. The agreement contained the famous\nPanchsheel.\n\nMutual respect for each other's\n\nPeacets comietence ~ ~ territorial integrity and sovereignty\n\nMutual non-aggression\n\nEquality and mutual benefit ~ ™ Mutual non-interference\n\nHowever, the bonhomie over the Panchsheel began to fade away when the border\nissue began to erupt and subsequently, by 1959, the relations began to collapse. The\nNehruvian dream of cooperation with PRC to write new rules for the Asian continent was\nnow crumbling. All the support India extended for rapprochement with China came\ncrushing down. The warmth post-1954 agreement that manifested as Hindi—Chini in early\n1950s was based on two pillars. Firstly, it was believed that supporting China would\nrestrain from militarising Tibet; and that, secondly China would cooperate with India to\nensure that they rewrite the rules of a newly decolonised Asia.\n\nWhy did the partnership dwindle away? To understand this, we need to look at some\ninternational events. In 1953, Stalin died and was succeeded by Nikita Khrushchev, who\nattempted to steer the Communist Party of Soviet Union (CPSU) to undertake peace with\nWest. This created a strain between Khrushchev and Mao in China. Mao started\ninsinuating that Khrushchev was misleading the revolutionary movements and it was the\nresponsibility of CCP and CPSU to provide true leadership to the Soviet Union. This view\nof Mao also manifested in Afro—Asian rivalry with India. India had considerable influence\nin Africa, with Nehru constantly pitching for aggressive non-violent and non-\nrevolutionary policies. According to Mao, this created a misleading effect on African\nleaders, who were being influenced to fight for freedom in a non-violent way and he\nadvocated that revolution was the only way ahead. The 1962 Indo-China conflict gave\nMao the needed push to sustain his African campaign of revolution and he succeeded in\ntilting many African nations towards the revolutionary ideal. This resulted intensions in\nIndia, as India began to perceive that China had already embarked upon a divergent and\ndifferent path of violence and revolution which precluded any possibility of cooperation\nand ideological convergence."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

It remained\nindependent after the White Lotus Rebellion from 1796 to 1806. When Qing dynasty\ncollapsed in 1911-12, Tibet proclaimed its independence. The China—India border is\nactually a Tibet-India border. In 1913-14, the British and Tibet signed the Simla\nAgreement, where Henry McMahon proposed the drawing of borders according to a\nproposed plan. After the treaty was signed, the McMahon Line was drawn to\ndemarcate borders. However, all Chinese governments subsequently till date have\nrefused to accept the Simla Agreement, and in extension, the validity of the\nMcMahon Line, insisting that Tibet had always been a part of China, with no\nauthority to sign treaties independently with foreign powers. The McMahon Line\ndemarcated the Eastern Indo-Tibet border but there was no such frontier in the West\nin 1947. India continued to claim Aksai Chin as apart of India in the western sector\ndespite having no administrative or military presence in Aksai Chin. China used the\nAksai Chin territory, which was a part of Dogra kingdom in Kashmir, in 1950 to\ninvade Tibet. Further, in 1953 India consolidated its position in the Eastern Sector by\ncontrolling Tawang which was a territory south of the McMahon Line. After the\n\nPanchsheel agreement in 1954, the MEA was informed of the need to have a new\nmap with Aksai Chin in western sector declared as a part of India and in the eastern\nsector along McMahon Line. However, the new maps were not to have references to\nany line and ensure that India left no undemarcated territory. China did not object to\nIndian cartographic stance and Nehru took it for granted that no opposition from\nChina essentially signalled their acquiescence to the border arrangement.\n\nIn 1957, China established a road in Aksai Chin. This road was vital to take\ninfrastructural equipment and logistics from PLA to Tibet. As this road was established, it\ncreated a storm. In 1960, Zhou told Nehru that China would give up its claims on\nArunachal if India gives up claim on the Western sector. Nehru rejected the proposal,\naggravating Zhou’s fear that India wants to undermine China’s control of Tibet.\n\nZhou subsequently also refused to recognise the McMahon Line as the boundary\nbetween China and India despite his initial willingness to do so if India was willing to give\nup claim of Aksai Chin. Subsequently, from November 1961, Nehru began to encourage\nIndian troops to go upto high altitude regions to assert their claim. Unfortunately, the\nmilitary build up lacked high altitude training, and was short of adequate logistics to\nsustain presence in the terrain. Nehru rejected a compromise settlement and began a hard-\nline forward policy based on weak military support. The Chinese finally retaliated\naggressively in October 1962 in the eastern sector. This led to a Chinese move deep inside\nthe Indian side almost up to Brahmaputra plain. After one month of aggression, the\nChinese declared a ceasefire and maintained status quo. The ambassador level relations\nbroke in 1962 and was finally only revived in 1976.\n\nAfter the defeat of India came a sea change in our domestic politics. In India, the\npublic opinion saw the 1962 war as a betrayal by China over all support and friendship\nextending by India. The Indian leadership, in the post war period, assumed a realistic\nstance over an idealistic one to deal with China. India began to build up its military\naggressively.\n\nUp until Indira Gandhi, India’s China policy was based on the premise that the\nresolution of the border issue was the only thing that could take the Indo-China relation\nforward. Post-1962 saw growth in the proximity between India and the USSR, and on the\nother hand, in the proximity between China and Pakistan. During 1960s, the Russia—China\nhostility, which owed its roots to the Khrushchev—Mao conflict, further increased and the\nresultant tilt of the USSR to India culminated in the 1971 USSR-India Treaty. In 1971, as\nIndia and USSR came closer, the US decided to cooperate with China to contain the USSR\nand punish India. In 1971, the Indo—Pakistan war saw a mega shift. The US began to\nundertake rapprochement with China while the India-USSR nexus strengthened and\nautomatically brought Pakistan and China closer to keep an eye on India.\n\nThings did improve in 1976 when ambassador level relations were restarted and the\nChinese Foreign Minister Huang Hua visited India and agreed to restart talks on the\nborder issues. In 1986-87, Rajiv Gandhi introduced a new change in the Sino—India\npolicy. He firstly dropped the precondition that the border issue was a pre-requisite for\nbilateral talks. He favoured improvement in other dimensions of relations on an\nassumption that cooperation in other areas would create a positive and conducive\nenvironment for border talks. In 1988, he visited China and decided to launch a Joint\n\nWorking Group (JWG) on the border issue. The Deng Xiaoping era too had dropped the\nrevolutionary spirit of Mao and favoured a market oriented economy. This too played an\nimportant role in the new Sino—Indian rapprochement. Many events at the end of the Cold\nWar fostered Indo-China cooperation. In 1989, when USSR began to disintegrate, there\nwere protests in China that challenged the CCP rule in China. The CCP resorted to\nmilitary strength crush them, resulting in the suppression and massacre of the mobs at the\nTiananmen Square. This dented the Sino—-America relations. Moreover, the fall of\ncommunism, Berlin Wall and the independence of the satellite states of the Soviet Union\nmade the survival of CCP uncertain. The CCP, out of its need for survival, initiated a good\nneighbourhood policy to build up relations with India. The Russian Federation succeeded\nthe USSR and refused to play a dominant role in South Asian affairs. As the Cold War\nended, India lost the power backup of the USSR and as the Gulf War—1 progressed, it\ncreated financial crisis in India as it choked its remittances from the region. India and\nChina began to develop proximity mutual understanding for their own survival. China\nwanted India not to internationalise the Beijing massacre while India conveyed to China\nthat it would support the Chinese ideology of opposing any western interference in\ninternal affairs."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The\nnumber of civilian deaths has been estimated at anywhere from hundreds to\nthousands. India used the opportunity to patch up with China. As the JWG\nestablished by Rajiv Gandhi on border issue moved ahead, in 1993 and 1996, India\nconcluded separate confidence building measures (CBM) to reduce confrontation and\ntensions. In 2005, arrangements on political parameters and guiding principles for the\nsettlement of the Indo-China boundary question were signed. In 2013, another\npositive step that was taken up was the border defence cooperation agreement\n(BDCA).

The\nsubsequent Talbot and Jaswant Singh talks brought to force the threat India genuinely\nfaced from China and convinced the US of the threat India genuinely witnessed from\n\nChina. The US agreed not to align with China against India and help India become a\nglobal player. The India diaspora in the US and the Indian economy’s wealth generating\npotential also acted as factors in the Indo-US rapprochement. The subsequent strategic\nposturing of the US and nuclear deal with India alarmed China. As Chinese realised the\npotential of the growing US-India proximity, it dropped the ‘punish India’ rhetoric over\nIndia’s ‘Chinese threat’ theory and began to create its own space in Indo-China relations.\nIn 2005, China and India signed a Strategic Partnership agreement.

India signed the PTBT thinking it would help the\ndiplomatic posturing of India in the context of a long-term disarmament policy but China\nrefused its ratification. In 1964, China tested nuclear weapons and opened the nuclear\ndimension in security confrontation. India subsequently tested its nuclear weapon in 1974\nbut still shied away from developing further nuclear weapons. In 1998, India finally\nconducted nuclear tests and became a nuclear weapon state. The rationale forwarded by\nVajpayee was Chinese threat and its clandestine support to nuclearise Pakistan. India\neffectively stated that the Chinese threat was the reason for India to go nuclear even when\nChina, in contrast, had not resorted to citing the India threat as a reason for its own nuclear\nweapons programme.\n\nTo understand the issue better, we need to revisit the Cold War. During the Cold War,\nwhat compelled China to go nuclear was the US and the Soviet Union having weapons. At\nany point of time even during that period, China never hinted it would use nuclear\nweapons against India. India, in contrast, believed that China could use the threat of\nnuclear weapons to coerce India and it is the nuclear weapon that had given China an\ninternational status that it may use to undermine India’s attempt to increase its prestige\namongst Asia and elsewhere. China further clarified that its nuclear weapon status is based\non minimum creditable deterrence and also announced its ‘No First Use’ policy, thus\nnullifying the threat that Indian had envisaged. The nuclear threat to India, however, got\naggravated when in 1971, the USS Enterprise reached the Bay of Bengal. Thus, keeping\nthese threats in mind, India resorted to increasing its own power which led to Pokhran-I in\n1974. But even after 1974, India discontinued the urge to go fully nuclear as it felt that the\ndemonstration of capabilities was more important than using them.\n\nChina went nuclear in 1964 but joined the [AEA in 1985. In this two-decade period,\nthe media did prop up the issue of China proliferating to Pakistan. After China joined the\nIAEA in 1985 and the CTBT in 1996, it became an advocate and supporter of non-\nproliferation. However, the world is suspicious about China’s claims due to its activities\nfrom 1964 to 1985 with respect to Pakistan, Iran and North Korea. Though China has\naccepted military ties with Pakistan, it has maintained that it has not given any ballistic\nmissile capabilities carrying nuclear weapon to Pakistan. Despite Chinese refusal to accept\nthat Pakistan had received nuclear weapon assistance from China, the international society\n\ncontinues to hold China responsible for proliferation to Pakistan. India has perceived all\nChinese support to Pakistan at the military level, especially at the nuclear weapon level, as\npart of a strategy particularly designed to contain India. All these factors compelled the\nIndian strategic community to move in favour of Pokhran-II.\n\nIt is noteworthy, however, that China was merely one of the many important factors,\nnot least of which was India’s ambition to position itself as a great power and its domestic\npolitical compulsions. However, China took the Pokhran-II as part of an anti-China\nthetoric. In fact, Vajpayee’s letter to Clinton accentuated the Chinese threat theory as\nVajpayee had clearly mentioned that what compelled India to conduct a nuclear test was\nthe fact that it shared its borders with a nuclear weapon state that had indulged in\naggression against India in 1962. Though China was not directly mentioned, it was a fairly\nunambiguous insinuation.\n\nMany in China had believed that India had a right to conduct a nuclear weapon test\nand there could have otherwise been no reason for China to oppose it until India’s ‘China\nthreat’ theory came to light. Consequently, officially China strongly condemned India’s\nPokhran-II and declared that India had resorted to immaturely blaming China for its urge\nto go nuclear. China said that it was never a threat to India as it had stated that it would\nnever use nuclear weapon against non-nuclear weapon states. China also stated that India\nwanted to establish dominance over South Asia and its nuclear weapon test was a gesture\nto that effect. Thus, the Chinese threat theory became a major irritant in the relations as\nChina clarified that a pre-requisite for a healthy relationship was an absence of fear from\neach other.\n\nHowever, after Pokhran-II, India did take steps to revive talks with China. India\ncommitted that dialogue was the only way out and even invited China to revive dialogues.\nIn 1999, an Indian mission reached China and subsequently Chinese Foreign Minister\nTang Jiaxuan agreed to take note of things. In June, 1999, Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant\nSingh went to China to resume talks. That was the time India succeeded in patching up\nwith the US, France, Russia, with China realising it was being isolated and hence,\ngradually softening its position. In September, 2000, India sent two naval ships on a\ngoodwill visit to China. Thus, both realised the need to increase goodwill visits to foster\nmutual understanding. An Indo-China Eminent Persons Group was established.\nConsidering the fact that India too has announced a ‘no first use’ policy, there is a high\npossibility that there will never be a nuclear conflict between India and China. However,\nChina continues to be reluctant to accept India as a nuclear weapons state as it does not\nwant India to emerge as a great power in its own neighbourhood. China observes that\ngranting the status of a nuclear weapon state to India would jeopardise the international\ncommunity’s efforts for non-proliferation as it would be tantamount to admitting India’s\nentry in the global nuclear order despite it being a non-signatory to the NPT and the\nCTBT. Even today, China is confident of its nuclear superiority over India and is\nconcerned with a rise of Indo-US cooperation because of the possibility of the US using\nIndia as a hedge against China."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The Tibetans, in\ntheir beliefs and customs, are different from the Han Chinese, with the Dalai Lama acting\nas the spiritual head of the Tibetans. The Dalai Lama, both the spiritual and political head\nof the Tibetans, never owed any allegiance to the Chinese emperor like the rulers of Korea\nand Vietnam did. In 1717, there was an invasion launched by Dzungar tribesmen on Tibet\nand the Chinese armies entered Tibet to drive out the invaders. The Chinese emperor\nstationed a military governor in Lhasa after the defeat of the invaders. The Chinese\nemperor also began to post commissioners, known as ‘Ambans’, in Tibet during the 18th\ncentury. The Tibetans were instructed to respect the position of the Ambans. Though the\nChinese did not attempt any annexation of Tibet, neither did they assure Tibet of its\ncomplete independence. Till the end of the 19th century, neither did the Tibetans attempt\nany engagement with the outside world nor was it encouraged by the Chinese.\n\nThe study of Tibetan history can be said to have originated in the year 1895. It was in\n1895 that the 13th Dalai Lama Thubten Gyatso attained maturity and took up the title of\nthe head of Tibet. For mysterious reasons, the earlier Dalai Lamas, for nearly a century\nprior to 1895, failed to attain maturity and used to pass away. Due to this, the Tibetan rule\nwas under the control of Regents. The Tibetans were immensely dissatisfied with the rule\nof Regents because of widespread corruption during their rule. In 1890, the British and the\n\nChinese concluded a treaty for trade via the Sikkim—Tibet border. The treaty signed did\nnot include the Tibetans. This increased the anger of the Tibetans, who destroyed border\nmarkers planted by the British in protest. The Tibetans asserted that Chinese and British\ncould not conclude a trade treaty that involved the borders of Tibet without negotiating\nwith the Tibetans. In 1893, a convention was signed by the British and the Chinese to\nenable duty free movement of goods to Tibet via Yating in Chumbi Valley. This increased\nthe Tibetans’ ire even further. At this juncture, Thubten Gyantso realised that Tibet would\nneed support of a third power to enjoy true autonomy, which would be restricted till Tibet\nremains sandwiched between China and Britain.\n\nThubten looked to Russia to support. Thubten had his own teacher, Agvan Dorzhiev,\na Khori-Buryat Mongol from Siberia, to play the role of his mediator with Russia. The\nperiod from 1898 to 1901 saw regular visits by the team of Thubten to the court of Tsar\nNicholas II in Russia. These regular interactions between the Tibetans and Russians\ngenerated tremendous suspicion in the minds of the British and the Chinese. In 1899, in\nIndian Viceroy, Lord Elgin was replaced with Lord Curzon as the next Viceroy. Curzon\nwas a person who harboured an enormous hatred for the Russians and was extremely\nalarmed when apprised about the visits between Tibetans and Russians. Initially Curzon\nsent letters to Dalai Lama to establish contact with the Tibetans but his letters were sent\nback to India without having been opened. Curzon decided to send a mission led by\nFrancis Young husband to Lhasa. The mission was sent to inform Lhasa to implement the\n1893 trade convention properly. The idea was that the mission will proceed upto Khamba\nJong and meet the Tibetans but the mission did not reach Khamba Jong. The British,\ninstead, forcibly moved to Gyantse and from there to Lhasa by 1904.\n\nBy the time the British reached Lhasa, Thubten and Dorzhiev fled the city. Young\nhusband’s mission concluded with a new treaty with the Tibetan Regent which got the\nBritish access to all the trading marts. As per the treaty, a British Regent would be\nstationed in South Tibet to continue the enforcement of the earlier treaty of 1890. The\nmost important point of the treaty signed by Young husband was that the Tibetans were no\nlonger authorised to conclude third party treaties, including with China, without approval\nfrom the British. The British signed the treaty with the Tibetan Regent but neither\ndesignated Tibet as a new British protectorate nor established its presence in Tibet. The\nBritish promoted a unique concept where they asserted their influence on Tibet while\nallowing China to maintain a low level of administrative presence. The British ensured\nthat Tibet enjoyed some amount of autonomy as well. China took the opportunity of the\n1904 Lhasa convention and decided to conclude an Anglo—Chinese convention in 1906. In\nthe 1906 convention, China asserted that it would not allow Tibet to enter into treaties\nwith any third state and that the British would have to accept the conditions as well as\nagree that they would not annex or interfere in Tibet. The British agreed and concluded the\nconvention. In 1907 there was an Anglo—Russian convention signed where Britain and\nRussia agreed not to negotiate with Tibet alone without the presence of Chinese\nintermediaries.\n\nSince the Dalai Lama and Dorzhiev had already fled Tibet, the entire Tibetan\npopulation came under the control of the Chinese Ambans. This also led to an increase in\nChinese presence in Tibet. The perception of the Chinese of the 1906 and 1907\nconventions was that both Britain and Russia agreed to allowing Chinese supremacy in\n\nTibetan region. The Dalai Lama returned to Lhasa in 1909, but by then, the Chinese had\naggressively taken over the control of Tibet, forcing the Dalai Lama to again leave Lhasa\nfor India.\n\nThe period from 1824 to 1826 saw the Anglo-Burmese wars, which concluded in\nAssam becoming part of the British Indian Empire. The British extended their presence in\nAssam by undertaking tea plantations on the hill slopes of Assam. As the number of tea\nplantations in the area increased, the British had a direct conflict with tribes of Assam. In\norder to end the conflict between the British and the tribals, the British concluded not only\nvarious agreements with the tribal groups but also created an inner line system and outer\nline system. Through these inner and outer line systems, the British ensured that their\ntrade convoys to Tibet were protected. However, the British soon became quite alarmed by\nthe rise of Chinese presence in Tibet and also feared a possible Russian annexation. The\nChinese were even planning to establish a road link from Tibet to Assam and were also\npresent in the Lohit Valley region. The British not only feared Chinese advances, but were\nalso uncomfortable with the idea of extending their presence in the frontier areas till Tibet\nas that might have brought them into conflict with the tribals.\n\nThe British tried to resolve their dilemma after the events of March 1911. As per the\nprevious inner line and outer line agreements, the British were to have their presence\nrestricted to the inner line areas only. The British were not allowed to undertake\nexpeditions in the outer line areas which were reserved for the tribes. In 1911, a British\nofficer Noel Williamson crossed the banks of Dihing and entered into the outer line areas\noccupied by Abor tribe. This led to massive retribution from the Abors, leading them to\nmassacre Williamson’s entire team. The British decided in favour of a prompt retaliation\nbut decided to take this as an opportunity to carry our survey into the area as well. The\nBritish plan was to survey and carry out explorations to forestall Chinese designs and\nconclude the finalisation of the Sino—Indian boundary. Another event that strengthened the\nBritish policy was the fall of the Qing dynasty rule in Peking. The fall of the Qing\nDynasty led to the rise of a Republican government. As the Qing dynasty collapsed, there\nwas also a mutiny in Tibet, leading to the collapse of Ambans in Tibet and the Dalai\nLama’s return to Lhasa in 1912.\n\nTaking the advantage of a weak central government in Peking, the British now acted\non the goal of keeping the Chinese and Russians out of Tibet while ensuring that Tibet\nremains autonomous as a state and acts as a buffer between India and China. The British\nbegan to play their cards through the British minister in Peking, Sir John Newell Jordan.\nSir John Jordan shot off a memorandum to Peking in 1912 that asserted that Chinese\nofficials were interfering in the administration of Tibet in a violation of the Sino—British\nconvention signed in 1906. Jordan further asserted that British did recognise the suzerainty\nof China in the Tibetan region but China had no right to interfere in the internal affairs of\nthe Tibetan administration. Through the memorandum, the British told the Chinese to\nremove their troops from Tibet and conclude a fresh agreement on Tibet. In 1913, China\naccepted the offer for fresh negotiations. On 23rd May, 1913, the British invited China to\n\nTibetan region. The Dalai Lama returned to Lhasa in 1909, but by then, the Chinese had\naggressively taken over the control of Tibet, forcing the Dalai Lama to again leave Lhasa\nfor India.\n\nThe period from 1824 to 1826 saw the Anglo-Burmese wars, which concluded in\nAssam becoming part of the British Indian Empire.

On 23rd May, 1913, the British invited China to\nconclude a tripartite agreement to settle the Tibetan question. By extending the invitation,\nthe British shrewdly granted Tibet equal status to British and China. The Chinese did\nprotest on this but without success.\n\nThe British appointed the Foreign Secretary Sir Arthur Henry McMahon as the\nchairman of the conference of the three parties. The conference began in Simla on 13th\nOctober, 1913, with Ivan Chen as the Chinese representative and Lonchen Shatra as the\nTibetian representative. At the outset of the conference, McMahon unveiled his plan. As\nper the plan, the British favoured the division of Tibet into Outer Tibet and Inner Tibet.\nThe region of Outer Tibet as envisaged was the region bordering India and the British\nproposed that the Chinese will have no influence in the region as Outer Tibet will act as a\nbuffer state dependent upon the British for reasons of autonomy. As the negotiations\nbegan, the Chinese objected to such a division of Tibet. On the other hand, the British had\ngained the confidence of Lonchon Shatra and were adamant to go ahead with their\nproposal by concluding a bilateral agreement with the Tibetans. On 3rd July, 1914,\nMcMahon and Lonchen Shatra concluded a bilateral agreement while Ivan Chen insisted\nthat the Chinese would not accept any bilaterally concluded agreement between Tibet and\nBritain.\n\nNo military and civil presence\n\nbby China in Outer Tibet\n4\n\npemestieneme om .« 'ndia to gain Tawang region\n\nshown by Red and Biue Lines\nChinese suzerainty over\n\n—\" Tibet was accepted\n~ Chinese autonomy on\n\nOuter Tibet accepted\nBritish and Tibet to regulate ~\nnew trade regulations “S China not to object on installation\n\nFS of Datai Lama in Outer Tibet\n\nBritain accorded most\nfavored nation tag to Tibet\n\nBy drawing a red line as per the Simla agreement, the British added another 50, 000\nsq. km. territory to the British Empire. The Sela pass and Tawang region (in present day\nArunachal), along with the trade routes Lhasa via Assam, were added to the British\nterritory. A major part of the territory added by the British to the British Empire in India\nwas controlled by Tibet. Tibetans agreed to demarcate the new boundary via a red line\nprovided the British would maintain the private estates of the Tibetans in the new\nboundary. The Tibetans insisted that they would have problem in accepting the new border\nif Tso Karpo and Tsari Sarpa (the two sacred places for Tibetans) did not fall under the\nTibetan territory. McMahon agreed to the two conditions and sent the copies of the new\nmaps with red lines from Isu Razi Pass to Bhutan to Lonchen Shatra. The British, through\nthe agreement, achieved their strategic objectives regarding the Tibetan frontier. The\nsubsequent period saw Tibet enjoying autonomy without any interference from Russia,\nBritain or China.\n\nAfter the first Anglo-Sikh war in 1845-46, the British won the possession of\nKashmir. The British did not directly administer Kashmir but handed over its\nadministration to Gulab Singh. Gulab Singh was a Dogra chieftain and he established the\nDogra rule in Kashmir that continued till 1947. The British, while handing over Kashmir\nto Gulab Singh, made certain provisions under the Treaty of Amritsar. The British noted\nthat the eastern boundary of hills and region east of Indus were being transferred to Gulab\nSingh but the purpose of the transfer would be defined separately, after a separate survey\nby the British commissioners. By this provision in the Treaty of Amritsar, the British\n\naccepted the fact that the eastern boundary of the kingdom of Kashmir was not defined.\nThe British, not to upset the Chinese, maintained the ambiguous boundary in the east and\ndid the same in north and west of Kashmir. The reason for the British attempts to establish\nany boundary in the eastern side of the territory held by Gulab Singh proved futile was\nbecause the British, earlier through two boundary commissions, had failed to establish a\nboundary. The Chinese asserted that the frontiers had existed since ancient times and\nneeded no demarcation. The British considered an ancient boundary passing through the\nKarakorum ranges.\n\nFor the British, the Karakoram acted as a natural border. In 1865, Johnson carried out\na survey of the region and prepared a map. In the map, Johnson showed the areas from\nShahidulla, Aksai Chin to Kunlun ranges as a part of the Kashmir region. This map\ndepicting the above regions was published in 1868. Only after the publication of the map\nby Johnson did the world get to know about the Aksai Chin region. In fact, it is important\nat this juncture to understand the reasons that could have motivated Johnson to incorporate\nthe frontier upto Kunlun as part of Kashmir. In 1864, Yakub Beg of Kashgar had rebelled\nthe Chinese and established the Kashgaria Kingdom. During his rebellion, the forces of\nGulab Singh had assisted Yakub Beg and even built a fort in the Kashgar region. While\nundertaking the survey Johnson gained an impression that the frontier of Kashmir till the\nKunlun ranges belonged to Gulab Singh, compelling him to redraw the map. After the\npublication of the maps of Johnson, the surveyor general of India, Colonel Walker,\ndisowned them by asserting that Gulab Singh had no rights over the areas depicted in a\nmap by Johnson.\n\nIn 1877, the Chinese army defeated Yakub Beg and captured the region of Kashgaria\nand renamed it Sinkiang. The British now feared that the Russians could move down\nfurther and control the entire Central Asia. The British feared that such a move would\nbring the Russians very close to the British frontier. To keep the Russians out of North\nKashmir, the British established a military post in the Gilgit region. In 1892, British took\nover the control of Hunza and Nagar region in North Kashmir and the states remained\nunder the British till 1947. However, the attitude of the chief of Hunza was of a veiled\nnature as the chief yielded Hunza’s allegiance to Kashmir a well as to China. In 1899, the\nBritish minister in Peking, Sir Claude MacDonald urged the British minister in Kashgar,\nCharles Macartney, to propose a solution to the ambiguous boundary of Kashmir with\nChina. The Macartney-MacDonald Line was proposed as a line for demarcating the\nboundary in which a recommendation was made to surrender the British rights over Hunza\nand offer China possessions of Tangambush, Raskam, Shaidulla and Aksai Chin. This\nproposal was sent to China and instead of responding, Peking decided to remain silent on\nthe Macartney—McDonald line. The line had the potential to settle the dispute once and for\nall but China did not respond to the same.\n\nIn 1911, the Chinese revolution occurred and the Chinese central government\ncollapsed. The British feared that Russia might revive its territorial aggression again.\nThus, Lord Hardinge proposed that Kunlun range be made a watershed to the frontier of\nTibet to prevent any Russian designs. But in 1917, the regime of the Tsar in Russia also\ncollapsed. The absence of a strong regime in Russia and China gave the British the needed\nrelief. Our discussion helps us to understand that the British used their policy to fix and re-\nfix the frontiers to suit their best strategic interests. The British resorted to cartographic\n\naggression as per their own changing needs.\n\nWhile India became independent in 1947, China, during this time, was facing a\nviolent civil war. Tibet saw the Chinese civil war as an opportunity to assert its autonomy.\nThe Indian government, through a correspondence, informed the authorities in Tibet that\nall treaties signed by the British are now to be managed by its successor, the Government\nof India. Tibet, instead of merely acknowledging the correspondence, wrote back to Nehru\nthat Tibet would like India to return the Tibetan territories in Bhutan, Sikkim, Darjeeling\nand Ladakh. India replied to Tibet about the fact that no change on the ground was\npossible till a new treaty was concluded. Zhou Enlai used this correspondence between\nTibet and India to prove that the Tibetans had conveyed their displeasure with the\nMcMahon Line.\n\nThe Chinese civil war finally came to an end in 1949, when the communists defeated\nthe armies of Chiang Kai-sheik and the People’s Republic of China (PRC) was established\nby Mao Tse Tung. The Mao government in 1950 announced that People’s Liberation\nArmy (PLA) of China should work to ensure the ‘liberation of Tibet’. In 1950, the PLA\nentered Tibet through Szechuan, Chamdo and Sinkinagh or Aksai Chin. It is at this\njuncture that India sent a diplomatic note to China asserting that it should respect Tibetan\nautonomy under the framework centred around Chinese suzerainty. China wrote back a\nstrongly worded response to India asserting that the Tibetan issue, being a domestic issue\nof China, would be resolved by China as per the Chinese laws based on Chinese\nsovereignty.\n\nThe Chinese brought about an end to the Tibetan issue in 1951, when a seventeen\npoint Sino-Tibet Agreement was concluded which asserted that Tibetans are one of the\nnationalities living in China since historical times. India too, after the Sino—Tibet\nagreement, relinquished the dream of working for Tibetan autonomy. But Nehru continued\nto take steps to improve India’s ties with China. India even supported China for a seat to\nthe UN Security Council. In 1952, China informed India that it was willing to discuss all\ninherited rights and issues, including the Tibetian case, though negotiations. This was a\ngreat opportunity for India to negotiate with China so that the McMahon Line be accepted\nas the border. However, Nehru thought that if India were to bring up the issue of\nMcMahon line, there is a high possibility of China rejecting the line as, since 1914, none\nof the Chinese governments has ratified the Simla agreement. Nehru apprehended that if\nChinese rejected the McMahon line, they would insist on fresh negotiations, which may\nnot be favourable to India. Thus, Nehru decided that India would not raise the border issue\nat the talks. In 1954, India and China concluded the Panchsheel agreement and there was a\nnote exchanged by the two along with the agreement where India agreed to withdraw its\nmilitary presence from Yating and Gyantse and ended all the privileges it had inherited\nfrom the British under the erstwhile Simla agreement of 1914.\n\nIn the Panchsheel Agreement, India accepted Tibet as a region of China. To\nunderstand why India did not raise up the border issue with China in these talks, we need\nto take a look at some facts here. In 1954, when China invited India to discuss issues, it\nsaid that the convention would be “to discuss specific problems relating to inherited\nrights.” India, since 1951, had been administering the territories up to the McMahon line.\nChina had raised no objection to the same. Thus, the McMahon line certainly did not fit\n\nthe criteria of ‘specific problems’. More so, as it was China that had invited India for the\ntalks, if it had objections to the McMahon line, it could have raised the issue too. As China\ndid not raise the issue at the talks, it proves the fact that the Chinese accepted the defacto\nborder. In fact, by the clause, ‘mutual respect for each other’s territorial integrity and\nsovereignty,’ China signalled an acceptance of Indian presence till the McMahon line. On\nthe other hand, China was shrewd in not raising the border issue deliberately as it was\nconstructing a road through the Aksai Chin and if the border issue is opened up, India\nwould get wind of the road that China needed at any cost to reach Tibet.\n\nNehru was satisfied with the agreements and the Panchsheel led to his emergence as a\ngreat statesman. His dream of a proximate relationship with China was now materialising.\nLittle did Nehru know that his actions would lead to a crisis in future. In 1950, the Survey\nof India published a map of India. In this map of India, the boundary with China in the\nEastern sector was aligned as per the McMahon line but this boundary was marked as\n‘undemarcated’. Similarly, the Indo-China boundary in the Western and Middle Sectors\nwas called ‘undefined’ and a colour wash was used. After the visit of Zhou Enlai in June\n1954 to India, Nehru, in July 1954, communicated through a memorandum that the old\nmaps were to be withdrawn. He asserted that India should now publish new maps with no\nreference to be made to any ‘line’ in the north and north-east frontiers and the frontiers\nwith China should be firmly set. He further observed that India should also establish check\nposts along the entire frontier, even in disputed areas, as the check posts act as symbols of\nthe Indian frontier along the border. Thus, through the memorandum, Nehru asserted the\nIndian stand clearly—India’s borders were non-negotiable as they were fixed.\n\nIn 1954, when the Survey of India came out with the new maps, the words ‘un-\ndemarcated’ and ‘undefined’ used in the maps of 1950 had been dropped. The boundary in\nthe East was firmly established as per the McMahon Line while the Western and Central\nboundaries saw a firm line and the removal of the colour wash. The map also showed the\nboundary of Kashmir based on the Johnson Line of 1865 and showed Aksai Chin region\nwithin Indian territory. Even though the Johnson Line in 1865 had shown Aksai Chin as\npart of Kashmir, the British had never claimed the territory. The Macartney-MacDonald\nLine of 1899 also had the Aksai Chin region within the Chinese territory. The pre-partition\nmap of India too defined the region with an undefined boundary. The British, till 1947,\nmaintained that the Sino-Indian border in the Eastern sector is based on the McMahon\nline, but left the Western and the Middle sector boundary undefined. This was a unilateral\nattempt by India to claim Aksai Chin on the basis of the Johnson Line.\n\nUnfortunately showing the Aksai Chin region unilaterally sowed the seeds of a future\nconflict. India published new maps in 1954 on strategic reasons to remove all ambiguity\nand maintain India’s territorial integrity. After India published these maps, China did not\nrespond, but eventually did publish their own maps showing Aksai Chi and North-East\nFrontier Agency (NEFA) in the Chinese territory. In October 1954, when Nehru visited\nChina, he took up the issue of Chinese maps showing Aksai Chin and NEFA as part of\nChina with Zhou Enlai. The Chinese responded that the Chinese maps were old maps and\nbelong to the Kuomintang Regime and the PRC had not revised those old maps yet. As\nIndia had established new check posts as symbols of Indian frontier, China issued a formal\ncomplaint to India. China complained that Indians have carried out transgressions deep\ninside the Chinese territory by establishing checkpoints inside China. India replied\n\nasserting that the Indian check posts were well within the Indian Territory and not inside\nChina. India and China accused each side of violating the Panchsheel agreement. In the\nmiddle sector, India insisted that the boundary line was centred through the Himalayan\npasses while China asserted that the passes were located in their territory.\n\nThe border issue finally opened up after reports of China constructing a road from\nSinkiang to Tibet via Aksai Chin surfaced. In fact, in 1952 itself, an Indian trade agent,\nLakshman Singh Jangpangi, stationed in Western Tibet, had informed New Delhi about\nthe road construction. It was only in 1957 when China announced the completion of the\nroad that it sent alarm bells ringing in Delhi. In 1958, an Indian army patrol was sent to\ndetermine the exact coordinates of the road. The army patrol was captured by the Chinese\nand released later after enquiry by the MEA. In 1956, the Dalai Lama had visited India\nand desired to put up a stay in India. Nehru insisted the Dalai Lama to put up his stay in\nTibet itself. In 1958, Nehru accepted the invitation of the Dalai Lama for a visit to Tibet\nbut on Chinese insistence, the visit was postponed and Nehru went to Bhutan instead.\nNehru went to Bhutan via Tibet but was not allowed to visit Lhasa due to an uprising by\nKhampha tribesmen. The gradual discontentment of the Tibetans against the Communist\nParty of China’s rule in Tibet was rising. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of the\nUSA had been assisting the Tibetan insurgents. China began to believe that the CIA had\ntaken India into confidence to create trouble in Tibet and India was supporting Tibetan\ninsurgents in their quest for autonomy. All this deepened the mistrust between India and\nChina and sowed the seeds of discontent in the bilateral ties.\n\nIn 1958, China protested with the Indian mission that Kalimpong was being used by\nIndia and CIA for subversive activities in Tibet. India replied to China asserting that\nChinese observations were based on a complete misunderstanding as India had not\nallowed the CIA to infiltrate and destabilise Tibet as alleged by China. In 1958, the\nChinese magazine named China Pictorial printed a Chinese map on pages 20 and 21\nshowing NEFA, areas of the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, large portions of Ladakh and\nthe Tashigang area of East Bhutan as Chinese territory. Immediately, Indian MEA sent a\nnote to China informing them of Zhou Enlai’s earlier assurance that these were old maps\nfrom the KMT regime. India insisted that China make the necessary corrections in the\nmaps and clearly demarcate frontiers. Two months later in 1958, the Chinese responded\nasserting that the maps shown mention old border and a survey was needed and only after\na survey of the Chinese boundary could changes be made on the map. Till then, the old\nmaps would continue to demarcate the borders. This reply was a big blow to Nehru who\nhad asserted that Indian frontiers were fixed and were not open for negotiations.\n\nNehru decided to take up the matter directly with Zhou Enlai. In December 1958, he\nwrote letter to Zhou and reiterated the concerns mentioned above. He took up the issue of\nthe Chinese magazine showing a Chinese map with NEFA as part of China. At this\njuncture, Nehru’s priority was to get the Chinese accept the McMahon line as the\nboundary. In response to the letter of Nehru, in January 1959, Zhou Enlai replied asserting\ntheir views on the border issue, and observing that the Sino—Indian border had never been\ndemarcated formally and expressing tremendous dissatisfaction in the way India had\nunilaterally demarcated borders, showing Aksai Chin as part of India despite China\nasserting that they needed time to revisit old maps. China also asserted that the McMahon\nline was a British creation and the Chinese did not accept the line as legal, which\n\nforwarded doubts on the demarcations. China, therefore, indirectly conveyed that they\nwere willing to take positive view on McMahon line on the condition that India was\nwilling to show an accommodating attitude in the western sector.\n\nMeanwhile in March 1959, the Tibetan uprising had reached its peak and this forced\nthe Dalai Lama to leave Lhasa for India. The Indian government’s policy, prior to coming\nof the Dalai Lama, was to provide medical assistance to sick refugees at the border of\nIndia without permitting them to cross over. In case of the Dalai Lama, the government\ndecided that an exception can be made if a request for political asylum arises. in 1959, the\nDalai Lama left Lhasa and entered India via Tawang. He was allowed to rest at Bomdila\nand from there was moved to Mussoorie. The Chinese were, by then, of the firm opinion\nthat India had stage managed the entire escape plan of the Dalai Lama to India.\n\nAnother incident in 1959, aggravated the conflict. This time the issue arose in a place\ncalled Longju in the NEFA region. In 1959, Captain Adhikari of Assam Rifles was\ninstructed to establish a military post at Longju, which was a territory claimed by both\nIndia and China. In order to establish a symbol of authority, Captain Adhikari was\nconferred a red coat and was appointed as the village headman. Captain Adhikari then sent\na patrol team out in the vicinity. Observing this, the Chinese side also increased their\npatrolling. India too intensified its patrol in the region. This angered the Chinese and they\nattacked the Indian post at Longju. With limited resources, Captain Mitra was sent to\nrecapture the post of Longju and he succeeded in capturing a post six miles south of\nLongju at Moja. On 8th September, 1959, Nehru received a letter from Zhou Enlaimaking\nthe Chinese positions on the border question clear. In the letter, the Chinese stated that\nthey were not a party to this 1842 treaty concluded by Tibet and Kashmir, nor had they\nratified such a treaty. Therefore, they would not agree to any demarcation there. China\nalso stated that they had not agreed to the Macartney—MacDonald Line of 1899 either.\nThey maintained that boundaries in the western and central sector were never demarcated\nand never delimited formally. The Chinese also clarified that the McMahon Line was\nillegal because the Chinese did not recognise the Simla Agreement and the McMahon\nLine was nothing more than an imperialist design of the British. In fact, China not only\ndeclared the McMahon line as illegal but also condemned Indian troop advancements upto\nthe frontiers and pointed out that India had illegally occupied Longju, Khinzemane and\nTamaden. In the letter, China insisted that India should withdraw its troops from the\nfrontiers immediately.\n\nThe letter of Zhou Enlai in September, 1959 clearly denotes a shift from the Chinese\napproach outlined by them in the letter to Nehru in January, 1959. China had now\nhardened its stand and had made no mention this time of acting with prudence on\nMcMahon Line as mentioned earlier. Nehru made a reply through a letter to Zhou Enlai in\nSeptember, 1959 itself. In his response, he asserted that India had not illegally occupied\nLongju and Khinzemane but clarified that when India found Tamden located in the north\nof the McMahon Line, the Indian agencies withdrew from the post. Nehru asserted that to\nremove the troops from Longju, both sides should respect the historical frontiers till future\nsurveys. Domestically, Nehru tried to delink the Aksai Chin question from other border\nissues and favoured that the Aksai Chin issue not be brought up when other border issues\nwere discussed. He preferred to maintain status quo on Aksai Chin region. He asserted\nthat if Chinese transgressed into the Indian territory, the Chinese should be told to retreat\n\nand India side should not fire unless fired upon.\n\nAfter the Sinkiang—Tibet road was discovered, in 1959, a proposal was made by the\nIntelligence Bureau to setup more posts in the forward areas of Ladakh region. During\ndeliberations in January 1959, the Army Chief and the Foreign Secretary rejected such a\nproposal as it may have antagonised the Chinese even further. In February, 1959, Mallick,\nthe IB chief, persuaded Nehru to open the posts, to which Nehru agreed. The posts were\nfinally setup by October. This provoked the Chinese and on 21st October, 1859 an Indian\narmy patrol led by Havaldar Karan Singh suffered massive losses and were ambushed in\nKongka La by the Chinese. There was a huge public uproar in the Parliament after the\nnews of ambush of Indian soldiers came to light. In November, 1959, Zhou Enlai wrote a\nletter to Nehru urging him to maintain status quo till a future settlement. He urged that the\ntwo sides should try to withdraw their troops 20 kilometres each from the actual control\nposition along the McMahon Line. Nehru wrote back a letter to Zhou Enlai asserting that\nin the Eastern and Middle sectors, no side should send border patrols to forward areas but\nalso insisted that the Chinese retreat from Longju, assuring China that post Chinese\nretreat, the Indian side would not occupy Longju.\n\nOn 7th December, Nehru received the response from Zhou Enlai. Zhou firstly\nrejected the Nehruvian logic of treating the Western sector separately as he observed that\nthe Western sector region is of great significance to them as the Sinkiang-Tibet road\npasses through it. Zhou also sent an invitation to Nehru to meet at Rangoon on 26th\nDecember, 1959 for talks. Nehru rejected the invitation due to his prior commitments.\nThis was followed by visits of President Eisenhower and later, Nikita Khrushchev, to\nIndia. In February 1960, Nehru invited Zhou Enlai for talks to which Zhou Enlai\nresponded by accepting the request and stated that starting 19th April, he would visit India\nfor a seven-day duration.\n\nAs Zhou arrived in India, a series of one-on-one negotiations began, where he\ndeclared that China was willing to take a realistic attitude on the McMahon Line despite it\nnot ratifying the Simla convention. China said that they would adopt a policy on\nMcMahon Line with India as they did for Burma provided India showed accommodative\nbehaviour over Aksai Chin in the Western Sector. India insisted on Chinese withdrawal\nfrom NEFA and Aksai Chin and asserted that China recognise Aksai Chin as Indian\nterritory. India further declared that it would not accept the offer of the barter of the\nacceptance of the McMohan Line in exchange for Aksai Chin. As the negotiations were\nreaching a deadlock, Zhou offered that the two sides accept that there was a dispute on the\nline of actual control held by the forces of both countries and till a permanent settlement\nevolves, neither should make territorial claims and hold up to the line of actual control. To\nmaintain tranquillity at the border, Zhou stated that both sides should discontinue border\npatrolling. India rejected Zhou’s proposals as it stated that they would not accept placing\nall the three sectors on an equal footing, because India wanted the three sectors be\ndiscussed separately. The talks broke down with no agreement by either side.\n\nZhou was disappointed because Chinese were willing to demonstrate a practical\nattitude to the McMahon Line. They had accepted the boundary with Myanmar almost on\nthe same alignment as the McMahon Line itself. They expected India to be similarly\npragmatic in their approach to the Western sector. Zhou expressed great shock over India’s\n\ninsistence on Aksai Chin which historically it had never occupied, nor was of any strategic\nimportance to India. The Chinese always felt that the Indian claim on Aksai Chin was to\nundermine the Chinese influence in Tibet.\n\nIn early 1961, the Intelligence Bureau began to inform the government that the\nChinese were building up check posts in the Western sector. The IB reports suggested that\nthe check posts were being built up by the Chinese in areas also claimed by India in the\nWestern sector. This aggression by the Chinese was based on the new maps they had\npublished in 1960. In These new maps, the Chinese claimed Sirijap and Spanggur lake.\nSuch claims were not made by the Chinese in the maps they had issued in 1956. By\nstaking such claims in the 1960 maps, the Chinese brought an additional 5000 sq. km. of\nIndian Territory within their ambit. In February, 1961, Nehru asserted in the India\nParliament that India would not resort to any form of adventurism but would prepare itself\nfor action if the situation warrants.\n\nSome scholars observe that what China was doing in the Western sector in the period\n1960-61, especially in Aksai Chin, was similar to what India did in the NEFA region in\nearly 1950s. This point may not be right because India first declared in the Parliament that\nthe border in the Eastern sector is the McMahon Line. After this declaration, India went on\nto establish the civil administration in NEFA. In both cases—that of declaration of\nMcMahon Line and establishment of civil administration—China did not object. Thus, the\nact the Chinese were committing in the western sector in 1960-61 completely disregarded\nIndian sensitivities and was completely unilateral act. Witnessing the Chinese policy on\nthe border unfold, on 2nd November, 1961, a meeting happening in the Prime Minister’s\nOffice in Delhi, where it was decided that India would establish forward posts in the areas\nclaimed by them. This job would be entrusted to the Indian army. It was designed to\nirritate China by ensuring that if the Chinese created one post in one area, India would go\nonto do the same at other places. The idea was that China would not undertake any\nphysical contest if India demonstrated the counter capabilities of establishing posts.\n\nIndia, however, was well aware that logistically it would not be able to sustain these\nposts owing to the superior military strength of the Chinese. After the 2nd November\nmeeting, the government issued new direction to the effect that firstly, in the Ladakh\nregion, Indian forces would undertake a forward policy and go to far areas and establish\nposts. The idea was to ensure that the Chinese should not be allowed to establish posts in\nthe region but all this is to be done without involving any physical clash with the Chinese.\nThe government ordered, secondly, that in the Central Sector, a similar forward policy was\nto be executed and gaps at the frontier were to be covered by posts. It was decided to\nconcentrate military presence close to the forwards posts which would be activated if there\nbe a need at a short notice. Thus, the Indian strategy was to deploy troops in forward posts\nin the Western sectors primarily to forestall Chinese advancements while in the rest of the\narea, the forces were to occupy border positions. However, the Indian army did begin the\nestablishment of the forward posts but did not establish adequate supply lines and logistics\nfor assisting the forward posts in case of any eventuality.\n\nThe basic promise of India’s forward policy was that if India established its post in\nareas where China had no posts then Chinese would not establish their posts or destroy the\nIndian posts. The directives issues in November 1961 had notified that India would first\n\nestablish logistical stations that could provide all the needed support and then the army\nwould establish smaller forward posts. However, as we noted earlier, the army began the\nestablishment of forward posts without establishing logistical stations as envisaged in the\ndirectives. On Sth December 1961, the Army headquarters communicated to the comers of\nthe Western and Eastern command to establish forward posts in Ladakh and dominate any\nChinese posts in the region claimed by India. Ironically, this directive issued by the Army\nHQ was never a part of the directives agreed upon in the 2nd November meeting. What\nwas all the more ironical was that the Army HQ did not inform the commanders to\nestablish logistical stations to assist the forward posts despite they being categorically\nasserted in the meeting on 2nd November. Further, the Army HQ began to issue directions\nlimiting forward posts in NEFA region despite the 2nd November directives limiting\nforward posts establishment to Western and Middle or Central sectors only.\n\nAll this had a disastrous impact. It is widely believed that if all the directives of 2nd\nNovember meeting were implemented without any alterations, then probably the 1962\nconflict would have never happened. In early 1962, the Western Command began to\nexecute the forward policy. But the posts were nothing more than ‘penny posts’ as hardly\nany logistical supplies could be provided to them. Since October 1959, the Chinese had\nnot undertaken any further patrols. But on witnessing the Indian posts coming up, they\ninformed the higher authorities, taking no other action. Non-action from China led India to\nincrease the pace of setting up of Indian posts. In April 1962, alarmed with rise in the pace\nof India establishing its posts, China decided to resume patrolling from Karakorum to\nKongka Pass. Mao ordered that PLA resort to armed co-existence strategy. In this strategy,\nthe PLA was asked to counter-encircle the posts established by India. This was a step to\nout-manoeuvre India.\n\nIn May, 1962, in the north of Daulet Beg Oldi, an incident took place. India had\nestablished a post near the Chip Chap River. China encircled the India post, forcing the\narmy to seek permission for withdrawal from the post from Army HQ. The Army HQ\ndirected that India should retreat. After encircling the post, the Chinese retreated. India\nthought that the retreat from the Chip Chap River post means that China will not attack\nIndia as it did not attack the post. In July 1962, the Indian Army not only established a\npost in Galwan Valley in the Western sector but also dominated the Chinese post in\nSamzungling. The Chinese began to aggressively encircle this post. The post was manned\nby Gorkhas from the Indian side. The Chinese tactics were menacing and intimidating\nIndia communicated to the Chinese Ambassador in Delhi that if China does not stop its\naggression, Indian troops may open fire. The Chinese retreated but cut off land supply\nroutes to the post. The Galwan Valley episode nullified the entire premise of India’s\nforward policy as the aggressive tactics used by China negated the long-held logic that\nChina would not attack the Indian posts.\n\nUnfortunately, the China’s retreat from Galwan Valley was perceived by Nehru\ndifferently. It reaffirmed his belief that China would not attack Indian posts. After all these\nepisodes in the Western sector, the Western Command pleaded to the Army HQ to suspend\nthe forward policy and work on strengthening logistics stations to maintain the already\nestablished forward posts. The Army HQ did not agree and were of the view that the\nChinese would not attack Indian posts.\n\nThings were not smooth at the diplomatic level either. The Panchsheel agreement\nsigned in 1954 was valid only for eight years. It was about to lapse on 2nd June, 1962.\nThere was a clause within Panchsheel where either of the side could seek extension of the\nagreement. China, on 3rd December, 1961, informed India that it wished to negotiate a\nfresh agreement. Instead of India using this opportunity to douse the rising tensions at the\nborder, it instead communicated that an essential criterion to start negotiations would be to\nreverse the aggressive policies manifesting at the border. As India insisted that border\nissue be a pre-condition to start fresh negotiations for a new agreement, nothing concrete\nworked out and the agreement lapsed on 3rd June, 1962. After the agreement lapsed,\nChina closed their trading marts in Calcutta and Kalimpong while India closed its marts in\nGyantse, Tarung and Gartok. Calcutta and Kalimpong provided important routes for China\nto supply necessities to Tibet. The refusal of India to extend the agreement in 1962 was\nperceived by China as an attempt by India to squeeze their Tibetan supply lines. Since\n1959, the Eastern sector was tranquil as the Chinese had stopped patrolling in the forward\nareas. But the decision of the Army HQ to launch the forward policy in the NEFA flared\nup the tranquil border.\n\nIn June 1962, the Indian army established a forward post on the south bank of Namka\nChu River and the post was named as Dhola despite the fact that the post was located in\nChe Jong and Dhola was a mountain near the post. This post led to Chinese protests.\nThought the Chinese had not objected to Indian presence in the areas south of McMahon\nline despite China not accepting McMahon Line, China insisted that particular Indian post\nwas in the north of the McMahon Line and was thus in the Chinese territory. India insisted\nthat its post was in the south of McMahon line and not the north as alleged by China and\nwas in proper Dhola region. The GOC of the 4th division in the Eastern sector suggested\nthat this post be relocated to Thagla Ridge. By the time the Army HQ granted permission,\nthe Chinese established their presence at the Thagla Ridge. The Chinese were offended by\nIndian post and patrolling in the region where, through correspondences, Nehru had\nassured that India would never build posts.\n\nAs India set up post on south of Namka Chu River, on 8th September, 1962, the\nChinese troops crossed the river and began encircling the post. The post in-charge on the\nIndian side, in a panic, sent a message to the Battalion HQ’s that 600 Chinese soldiers had\nencircled the Indian post. It was later determined that the number of soldiers was only 60.\nHowever, to seek support immediately, the officer in-charge had sent frantic messages,\nunwittingly inflating the situation. India too immediately stationed additional troops and\ndecided to hold the Dhola post. The army began to move towards Lumpu Choksen as it\nwas designated as the first line of defence. The priority was to hold ground in Tawang and\nensure that there was no vacuum in Tawang. The movement to Lumpu proved disastrous.\nThe T-Brigade of the army was to establish a fresh Brigade HQs at Lumpu Choksen.\nIronically, the location chosen was extremely unfavourable to India as it lacked even road\nconnectivity. It was believed that the T-Brigade would evict the Chinese from the presence\nthey established in Thagla Ridge and would put a stay at Dhola.\n\nThe spark came on 13th September, 1962. In Namka Chu, 9 Punjab had taken up\npositions. The Chinese made a loudspeaker announcement in Hindi to the effect that\nIndians had entered the Chinese territory and not only should they retreat but a civilian\nofficial was to be sent for exact boundary location identification. The advice was ignored\n\nby India and the two sides sat eyeball-to-eyeball for several days. On 20th September\n1962, a Chinese soldier attacked an Indian post using a grenade, leading to injuries on the\nIndian side. The government made the decision to evict the Chinese from Namka Chu.\nThe 4-Corps was given the responsibility to execute the task. On 9th October, India\ndispatched a strong patrol to Tseng Jong, which was in the north of Namka Chu, and was a\nterritory claimed by China. The Chinese were a battalion strong in Tseng Jong and\nattacked the Indian patrol vehemently. The entire premise of the forward policy was\nshattered.\n\nThe head of the 4-Corps left for Delhi from Namka Chu and convinced the leaders in\nDelhi that with existing logistics, evicting the Chinese from Namka Chu would be\nimpossible and pleaded for the Indian withdrawal from Namka Chu. However, a decision\nwas taken not to leave Namka Chu. Nehru, on way to Colombo, informed the press that\nIndia had ordered the army to evict the Chinese from Indian territory. This statement of\nNehru was published domestically and globally and was perceived as an ultimatum to\nChina. China used this statement to brand India as an aggressor. The Chinese knew about\nthe Indian decision to evict them from Namka Chu and Dhola posts. They were\ndisappointed to witness India’s violation of the 1959 assurances of no patrolling on the\nborders of the Eastern sector. All these compelled Mao to a conclusion that a fierce and\npainful military lesson had to be taught to India. The Chinese ordered the PLA to plan a\ndetailed operation in the Eastern sector. This theatre was used for the conflict as the\nChinese supply lines were well established.\n\nThe Chinese launched an attack on 20th October, 1962 in the Eastern sector at\nNamka Chu from Tsangdhar side, west of Namka Chu and across the river. The Chinese\ntroops acted swiftly and launched high thrusts at Namka Chu. By 22nd October, the\nChinese converged at Tawang though Bumla, Khinzamane and Namka Chu. By 24th\nOctober, the Indian troops retreated from Tawang to Sela Pass. The Chinese successfully\nconverged at Tawang. On 20th October, the Chinese began an offensive in the Western\nsector through heavy mortar firing. Theyeven attacked the Galwan post. On 24th October,\nZhou wrote a letter to Nehru urging for a peaceful settlement on the border issue. Heurged\nthat till both parties agree to a peaceful settlement, both should ensure that neither of the\nsides undertakes patrolling upto 20 kms of the Line of Actual Control (LAC, as LAC\nacted as the traditional line customarily dividing the two sides. India immediately\nresponded to China, replying it was always in favour of peaceful settlement but was\nsurprised by Chinese use of the term ‘LAC’. India further stated that if China was indeed\nserious about peace, then it should halt the hostilities and retreat to the positions held by\nthe Chinese prior to 8th September, 1962. Zhou wrote back to Nehru on 4th November,\nand clarified that LAC was the line as existed between India and China on 7th November,\n1959, defined by the McMahon line in the East and the traditional customary line in the\nWestern and Middle sectors. Zhou refused to accept the Nehruvian proposal of reverting\nback to position held prior to 8th September.\n\nNehru rejected all proposals of Zhou and remained stuck to his demand.\nDiplomatically China was supported by the entire communist bloc and as far as India is\nconcerned, not even the non-aligned states supported it. By November 1962, the Chinese\nhad captured Sela, Dirang, BomdiLa and were at the foothills not far from Tezpur. Nehru\nrealised the gravity of the situation and understood that if something extraordinary was not\n\ndone, then Kashmir and Assam would both fall into the hands of the Chinese. Nehru\nfrantically requested help from the USA. President Kennedy, in response to India, had a\nUSA aircraft carrier sail for the Bay of Bengal, while a squadron of USA air force aircrafts\nalso reached India. China declared a unilateral cease fire on 21st November, 1962 and\ndecided to retreat to positions 20 km behind the LAC.\n\nThe unique aspect of this cease fire declared by China was that it did not demand the\nsame by India. China, however, maintained that its forces may strike back if Indian troops\ncontinued to fire and did not retreat post cease fire. Nehru decided not to impede the\nimplementation of the cease fire agreement but questioned the concept of the LAC. The\nwestern aid to India came along with the string that India would resume a dialogue with\nPakistan on Kashmir. India accepted condition. As the USA and the UK got involved in\nthe region, China took the lead to conclude negotiations with Pakistan on the Sinkiang—\nKashmir border dispute. On 2nd March, 1963, Pakistan and China concluded an\nagreement for the Sinkiang—Kashmir border. With the declaration of the Chinese cease\nfire, the conflict at the border finally came to end in November."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The\nBritish, in order to safeguard the British Indian Empire, resorted to the establishment of\nbuffer states. The buffer states established functioned as economical tools to manage the\nimperial security. The concept of buffer states originated from the time when in 1880s, the\nrising Russian empire acted as a threat to the British presence in South Asia. The British\nensured that the buffer remained a protectorate. The British made sure that the buffer not\nonly remained free from any extraneous influence, but also continued to be guided by\nBritish policy. Ironically, neither Tibet nor Afghanistan ever became buffer states for the\nBritish.\n\nThe British annexed Kashmir in 1846. The Treaty of Amritsar that governed the\nannexation ensured maintenance of balance of power in the region. The Afghans and\nRussians were subsequently kept under check. After the First Anglo-Sikh War and the\nTreaty of Lahore, the British acquired sovereignty of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh and\nhanded them over to Gulab Singh for control provided that British supremacy was\nacknowledged. Gulab Singh got the territories but was not allowed to alter the limits of his\nterritories, which only the British reserved the right to do. The British, as we have noted\nearlier, did make attempts to resolve the boundary disputes by making attempts to fix the\nboundary but the insecurity of the Chinese prevented any fruitful agreement. The Johnson\nline showed Aksai Chin plateau in the Kashmir territory, and was used by India after\nindependence to claim Aksai Chin.\n\nIn 1899, the Macartney—-MacDonald Line proposed a solution to the Western sector.\nThe British urged the Chinese to renounce their claims over Hunza and in lieu, receive the\nChinese part of Ladakh called Aksai Chin. The region of Aksai Chin was shown as a part\nof Ladakh by many Chinese maps. Since the British feared that the occupation of Kashgar\nby Russia would be a threat to imperial security, they somehow wanted China to\nrelinquish its sovereign rights over Hunza. In fact, today, the LAC, the claim line by the\nChinese and the Macartney—MacDonald line all coincide with each other. In 1896, John\nArdagh also proposed a line based on a strategic adoption of the already proposed Johnson\n\nline. The Ardagh Line drew the boundary in the crest of Kunlun and ended up\nincorporating Karakash River and territories up to Yarkand River. The British were unable\nto establish a firm boundary in the Western sector as China remained evasive. The\nHuztagh—Karakoram acted as a natural frontier. The boundaries in the Western sector thus\nremained undefined.\n\nFor the British, the Eastern sector was a forgotten frontier and yet the British had\ninterests in the region. In 1769, Nepal saw an internal conflict between Newars and\nGurkhas. The British, in the conflict, supported the Newars. The Gurkhas succeeded in\nreplacing the Newars and established a Hindu Kingdom. The Gurkhas closed down trade\nroutes between Nepal and Tibet, which were used by India to reach Tibet. This led the\nBritish to search alternative routes to Tibet bypassing Nepal via Bhutan and Assam. The\ndefeat of the Newars opened up subsequent conflicts between Gurkhas and the British.\nThe Gurkhas were not happy with the British for their support to the Newars. The year of\n1814 saw the Anglo—Nepal War which culminated in a British victory. The British\nconcluded the Treaty of Segauli with Gurkhas and gained access to Tibet via Kumaon and\nGarhwal region. Since 1775, the Gurkhas were constantly attacking Sikkim. In 1817, as\nper the Treaty of Titalia, the British and Sikkim agreed to a system where Sikkim would\nget British protection and allow trade till Lhasa. The Treaty of Titalia also gave the British\na platform in Sikkim to keep an eye on the Gurkhas from the east. In 1861, the Treaty of\nTitalia was replaced with a new treaty, giving the British a bigger say on using Sikkim to\ngovern Tibetan trade and policy.\n\nIn the 1920s, the Ahom Kingdom in Assam became weak. Perceiving this as a golden\nopportunity, the Burmese expanded to garner influence in the region. The British moved\nswiftly and Anglo—Burmese War broke out in 1824, leading to the British defeating the\nBurmese. In 1826, a peace treaty was concluded between the Burmese and the British at\nYandabo where by British gained Assam. The presence of the British in Assam saw its\nexpansion till Lohit Valley. Presence of coal and petroleum, along with tea plantation\npotential and a strategic route to Tibet, made the British realise the potential of the area.\nThe British did not interfere with the tribes in the region but did consolidate the presence\nover the entire North-East.\n\nIn 1901, the British again developed a fear that Russia could reach up to Lhasa and\ncreate trouble for the British. However, as noted earlier, the Chinese refused to ratify the\nSimla convention as they were angry not only due to arbitrary demarcations by McMahon\nbut also due to the fact that Tibet acquired the status of an equal power. The British,\nsurprisingly, did not publish the texts of the Simla convention of 1914 till the year 1937.\nIn 1907, the British and the Russians had agreed that neither of the parties will negotiate\nwith Tibet on their own without the presence of a Chinese intermediary because the\nBritish always accepted Chinese suzerainty over Tibet. The signing of the Simla\nconvention could have angered the Russians. The British thereby decided to keep the\nSimla convention text under wraps.\n\nIn 1937, the British published the Simla convention and used the McMahon Line to\nshow the boundary. A per the Simla convention, India had acquired the Tawang region in\n1914 but the Indian flag was hoisted in Tawangonly in 1951. India moved into Tawangin\n1951 exactly at a time when the Chinese had moved into Tibet. The British had never\n\nestablished their control in Tawang up till 1951 and adhered to the fact that the British\nfrontiers existed till south of the McMahon Line. In 1943, the Governor of Assam had felt\nthat establishing control in Tawang may be tantamount to a forward policy which may not\nbe appreciated by the Tibetans. In 1947, Tenzin Gyatso, the Dalai Lama, had written to the\nIndian government claiming that Tawang was a part of Tibet. The Dalai Lama later on\ngave up the claim but the Chinese, since then, have been claiming Tawang by referring to\nthe comments of Dalai Lama.\n\nIt must be clarified that a boundary is a line demarcating sovereign states on a map.\nHowever, a frontier is a tract or a zone that separate two states that are sovereign. The\nSino-Indian conflict at the border is defined by the Himalayas that has always acted as a\nfrontier. The core of the dispute is about the exact places through which the boundary\nshould pass in the frontier zone, that is, the Himalayas.\n\nIt is noteworthy that India has no historical claims to Arunachal as Indian presence in\nArunachal is merely a British legacy. Nor do Chinese claims hold true for Arunachal. The\nMonpas of Tawang are ethnically different from Tibetans, and are in fact, non-Tibetans. In\nfact, it would also be important for us to clarify at this juncture that Tibet, historically, was\nneither independent nor an integral part of China. The rulers of China always considered\nTibet as an area in the periphery that had potential to act as a springboard for possible\ninvasions in the mainland. It was in mid-seventh century that Chinese influence found\npresence in Tibet when there was a matrimonial alliance between a Tibetan ruler and a\nPrincess of Tang dynasty. The political status of Tibet remained non-existent till Ding\nDynasty (1614) came to power.\n\nThe initial period of Ding Dynasty saw a priest-and-patron relationship between\nChina and Tibet. In 1728, the Chinese introduced the concept of Ambans and the period\nsubsequent to 1792 saw a tight control by China over Tibet. The Ambans were given\npowers equivalent to the Dalai Lama as per the 29-point decree issued by the Chinese\nemperor in 1792. The Chinese still believe that the 1792 decree gives them the power to\nexercise influence in choosing the Dalai Lama. In the recent times, the Chinese have\nadopted as aggressive strategy to integrate Tibet with the mainland. This includes a\nplethora of infrastructure projects in Tibet and increasing the number of Han Chinese in\nthe region to change the demography of the Tibetan area. Soon, the Han Chinese will\nbecome majority while Tibetans would be a minority in Tibet, which will then dilute the\noverall cause of Tibetan autonomy. Despite China—Dalai Lama negotiations since 2002,\nnothing concrete has evolved till date.\n\nIndia—China border is divided into various sectors. The Middle sector is relatively\npeaceful, unlike the Western and Eastern sectors. In Western sector, India alleges that\nChina has occupied part of the Kashmir region and also an area given in 1963 by Pakistan\nto China, along with the Aksai Chin area of Ladakh occupied as Xinjiang. In the Eastern\nsector, China insists that the 90, 000 square kilometre Arunachal Pradesh is part of China\nand refuses to accept the McMahon Line.\n\n@ - “en\n~ Nepal-Tibet-Uttar Pradesh\n\nTibet-Kashmir ‘\nHimachal\n\nThe border dispute, as explained, led to China launching a counter-forward policy\nand attacking India in 1962, inflicting a humiliating defeat on India. The Indian diplomat,\nVasant Vasudeo Paranjpe, aptly described Chinese advances when he remarked that the\nPLA went through Indian army in 1962 like knife through butter. In November, 1962,\nChina declared a ceasefire and went 20 km behind their 1959 position. The tensions got\nfurther aggravated with Chinese nuclear tests in 1964, with continuing border skirmishes\nobserved upto 1967.\n\nBreakthrough was achieved in 1979 when Vajpayee visited China to resume talks.\nHowever, the talks were not fruitful. Deng Xiaoping advocated a package deal under\nwhich India was to maintain status quo in Western sectors while China would accept the\nMcMahon Line in the east. India rejected the deal and advocated a sector-by-sector\napproach. Indian policy post-1962 gradually transformed and the solution of border\ndispute became a precondition to talks. From 1981 to 1987, despite dialogues, nothing\nexcept maintenance of tranquillity was achieved. When Rajiv Gandhi assumed power in\n1988, he established a joint working group on the boundary question and dropped\nresolution of border dispute as a precondition. In 1993, an agreement on maintenance of\npeace and tranquillity along the line of actual control was signed and it became an\n\n\nimportant confidence building measure (CBM).\nBoth undertake troop reduction\n\nMEG to assist JWG\noe\n\nEstablish Military\nExpert Group\n(MEG)\n\nDetermine differences\nover LAC"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Till 1993, the\nunderstanding was that China has more troops in Tibet than India has on the entire\nborder. China had two personnel for each one from India. China said in 1993 that as a\nCBM it would go for a one-for-one cutback but India said that geography of Tibet\nfavours China and in any eventuality, China can send troops far more quickly than\nthe Indian side. So, the Indian side advocated for an adjusted ratio approach. India\nsaid geographically steep terrain and logistically constraints on Indian side need to be\ntaken into consideration. Therefore, both finally agreed to mutual and equal security\nand decided to cut troops’ numbers mutually.\n\nIn 1996 came the agreement on confidence building measures in the military field\nalong the LAC in India—China border areas.

The border CBMs were badly affected in 1998 due to\nPokhran-II and its attribution to the China threat theory. The JWG was also suspended and\nwas resumed only in April 1999 as the 11th JWG meet took place in Beijing. The focus\nagain shifted to clarify the locations through which the LAC passes and in 2000, at the\n12th JWG, both sides decided to exchange maps with each other to identify the LAC.\nIndia and China exchanged 595 km maps of the Middle sector to this effect. The optimism\nshown by India Post Exchange became so high that Indian leaders began to advocate that\nby 2003, both sides would also exchange maps on the Western sector. The Chinese side\nsaw this as an attempt by India to go beyond consensus and cancelled the subsequent map\nexchange. China understood that India was trying to gain advantage in the border talks\nthrough map exchange and advocated the Indian side to exercise patience with regard to\nthere solution of border disputes.\n\nSince 2002, China began to advocate mutual understanding and mutual\naccommodation. Mutual accommodation meant gives and takes to resolve border.\n\nMutual understanding and\nOne package deal tv ] mutual accommodation\nA\n\nRecently, many studies have been undertaken on Chinese negotiational behaviour.\nThe studies say that China can negotiate fast if it has a favourable solution in sight, but\ndelays and advises patience in case it senses an unfavourable solution for itself. In case of\nCentral Asia and Russia, China solved borders quickly, while with India it knows that the\nborder dispute has little or no possibility to be resolved in terms favourable to itself.\nConsequently, there is a kind of freeze and the conspicuous lack of any sense of urgency.\nIn 2003, Vajpayee, to give further push to border negotiations, launched a Special\nRepresentative talks Mechanism (SRM). In SRM, the negotiations were to be conducted\nby a higher political representative who would explore a framework solution. The focus\nhad shifted to identify common principles for resolving the border issues.\n\n> » Find a methodology to resolve border\nA\n> Devise a framework based on political\n\n” parameters and guiding principles\n\nThe aim was to negotiate on a sector-by-sector basis and announce an agreement\nwhen all sectoral difference were resolved. Sikkim, as an issue, persisted till 2005. China\nhad always questioned the status of Sikkim and its merger with India. China maintained\nSikkim could be resolved only as a part of package deal but soon realised that if it\ncontinues to hold the Sikkim rhetoric, India would open up the Tibetan issue. In 2005,\nduring Wen Jiabao’s visit to India, the Chinese presented a new map showing India with\nSikkim as a part of India. In 2006, they opened Nathu La pass but incursions continued to\nbe an issue. China claims Tawang saying it was a part of Mongul district and sixth Dalai\nLama was born in Tawang. China has courted trouble in the Eastern sector by refusing\nIAS officers of Arunachal visa, saying residents of Arunachal need no visa to visit their\nown country. Even today China maintains the same policy. On 23rd October, 2013, during\nManmohan Singh’s visit to China, he concluded the Border Defence Cooperation\nAgreement (BDCA).

The visit drew sharp\nreaction from the Chinese side. China stated that India has been using the Dalai Lama\ndeliberately to upset Beijng. Officially, the Chinese government conveyed to India\nthat such visits by Dalai Lama to disputed territories in Arunachal Pradesh will affect\nthe bilateral ties. China asserted that the implications of the Dalai Lama’s visit to\nTawang could unleash a new low in the bilateral relations. China considers Tawang\nas a part of ‘South Tibet’. It feels that visit of the Dalai Lama to ‘South Tibet’ or\nTawang could incite the Tibetans. This is because the Tawang region is an important\ncentre for Buddhist activity and the Dalai Lama’s visit to the region could complicate\nthe balance. China has an uncomfortable relationship with the Dalai Lama and feels\nthat he is a separatist whose prime intention is to create unrest in Tibet to seek an\nautonomous state. China has always harboured a feeling that India has been\nsupporting the Dalai Lama to create unrest in Tibet. The year 2016 had not gone very\nwell for India and China. The two nations remained locked over China’s repeated\nattempts to block the Masood Azhar issue and India’s entry to the NSG. Towards the\nend of 2016, China upset India further by signalling its go-ahead to the China—\nPakistan Economic Corridor, which passes through disputed territory. The central\ngovernment led by Modi had not bent to Chinese pressure. It allowed the Dalai\nLama’s religious visit to Arunachal Pradesh. The Indian government's policy clearly\nsignals the diplomatic cards India can play against China. Ironically, the Dalai Lama\nhas visited Arunachal earlier in 1983, 1997, 2003 and 2009 as well. China has been\ncreating a diplomatic ruckus over such visits. What has irritated China in 2017 was\nthat during the Dalai Lama’s visit to Arunachal Pradesh, India’s Minister of State for\nHome Affairs also accompanied him to Tawang. India has insisted that the visit of the\nDalai Lama is purely religious and no political meaning should be attached to the\nsame. China, on the other hand, enquired why, if the Dalai Lama’s visit was purely\nreligious, would an Indian Minister accompany him. The Indian foreign ministry too\nhas states that the Dalai Lama is a religious figure and the Indian government has\nnothing to do with visits related to revered religious personalities. A deeper analysis\nof the visit clearly signifies that the visit of the Dalai Lama is used by India to keep\nChina in check. If China continues to press for the China—Pakistan Economic\nCorridor and block India’s membership to the NSG, then India would have the option\nto exercise the following diplomatic measures.\n\n» Block India's membership to NSG\nahead with CPEC «\nbs 2 ...

In lawang, there is a monastery called the Gaiden Namgey Lhatse. It\nwas founded in 1680 by Lama Lodre Gyatso on the wishes of Ngawang Lobsang\nGyatso, who was the Fifth Dalai Lama. The Tawang monastery is the seat of Karma—\nKargyu sect and China knows that the Chinese legitimacy on Tibet will remain\nincomplete till it controls the Tawang monastery.

The Batang La is the de-jure border while Doka\nLa is the de-facto border.\n\n= China has a motor able road called state highway S-204 which comes from\nShigatse in Tibet to the north-east of the Nathu-La at a point called Yatung.\n\n= From Yatung to Asam are unmettaled roads that come to Doka-La which is a 20\nkilometer long Class-5 Track (capable of carrying a load vehicles like a jeep, etc.).\n\n= At the end of 20 kilometers point of the Class-5 Track in the Dolam plateau, near\nDoka La, is a turning point (barely few hundred meters away from an Indian Army\npost in Doka La) from where vehicles can reverse and traverse back.\n\nNow see the diagram and analyze the geography carefully.\n\n= Be OKAL A 4\n\nae -\n\nGYMOCHEN\n\nHeart of the Issue\n\nOn 16th June 2017, a Chinese road construction party, consisting of some 100 men with\nearth moving equipments, came to the turning point and started surveys to extend the road\ntowards Jampheri ridge. Seeing this, the Indian Army troops at the camp from Doka La\ncame down in the Dolam Plateau near the turning point (in the territory of Bhutan) and\nformed a human chain, preventing the Chinese to make the road and the standoff began.\nSubsequently, the Indian and Chinese troops (PLA’s 6 Border Defence Regiment Unit-\n77649) established tents in the area. India asserted that the creation of the road alters the\nstatus-quo of 2012 (as established by the SRT) and if China created a road to Jampheri\nridge, it would reduce the distance of China to access India’s chicken’s neck by 50\nkilometers. Doing so would not bring China in India’s artillery range but it will affect\nIndia’s offensive deployments in the area.\n\nThree Warfare Strategy\n\nAs the standoff continued, China insisted that Indian troops withdraw from Dolam plateau\n(as it belonged to Bhutan and was not a territory in dispute with India) and go back to\nDoka La while India insisted on pre 16th June 2017 position (and decided to stay in the\narea to assist Bhutan as per Article 2 of India-Bhutan Friendship Treaty). As the two sides\ngot embroiled in an eyeball to eyeball confrontation, India began to build up troops along\nthe Line of Actual Control fearing that China could open up a new front elsewhere. At the\nsame time China unleashed a psychological warfare with a strong verbal barrage driven\nwith a motive to back off Indian troops unilaterally. This Chinese approach was very much\nin sync with Chinese Three Warfare Strategy (comprising of media war, psychological war\nand legal war)developed by Chinese Central Military Commission in 2003 and reinforced\nin 2010. For India, the idea was not to back off (despite the fact that India for the first time\nwas in the territory of a third nation-Bhutan, making this standoff different from the\nstandoffs in Depsang in 2013 and Chumar in 2014, both of which happened on Indian\nterritory) as doing so would have affected India’s credibility in the neighborhood and\n\nASEAN region where it is trying to position itself as a Net Security Provider.\nQuiet Diplomacy Trumps Shrill Nationalism—Throwing All Aces\n\nAfter a gap of 72 days, both sides diplomatically defused the crises by an agreement\nwhere both mutually decided to disengage the troops from the region and re-establish the\nstatus quo ante. Indian troops have retreated to Doka La but continue to occupy the\nvantage points on the top areas of the ridge while China has decided to halt the road\nconstruction activity but will continue to patrol the region. Both sides have moved out\n‘under verification’ and China has agreed to ‘make adjustments with the situation on the\nground’. Xi Jinping demonstrated maturity while defusing the issue and succeeded in\nsaving the BRICS Summit in Xiamen (where Indian PM eventually met the Xi) while also\nsucceeded in safeguarding his reputation for the 19th Congress of the Communist Party.\nSalami Slicing\n\nAn analysis of the Dolam standoff proves that China again resorted to Salami Slicing (a\nterm coined by Hungarian Communist Matyaas Rakosi in 1940’s and in military\nterminology known as cabbage strategy) to make territorial grabs in the Himalayas\n(similar to its previous grabs of Aksai Chin, Tibet and Paracel Islands). Salami Slicing\nmeans a strategy of carrying out small actions in a clandestine manner that eventually\naccumulate into a larger action. China, to execute Salami Slicing, initiates territorial\nclaims by staking claims to a territory. Then, carries out an intensive propaganda of all\nthree types (in sync with Chinese Three Warfare Strategy) at all platforms (domestic and\ninternational) to claim the territory. The propaganda by China is so intense that it positions\nthe territory in concern as a ‘dispute’. Then China uses all its diplomatic and military\nmight to resolve the dispute by avoiding a forceful intervention.\n\nRationale (do-and-be Damned, don’t-do-and-be Damned)\n\nXi Jinping masterminded the standoff to punish India for its OBOR Lése-majesté by\nweaning Bhutan away from India but eventually ended up in a situation of ‘do-and-be\ndamned, don’t-do-and-be damned’ quandary. Though the Sino-Indian standoff is resolved,\npositioning India as a mature and responsible status-quo power, India created a template\nfor other countries to check China. India needs to strengthen its critical border\ninfrastructure, demarcate maps on settled sectors of the border and resolve pending border\ndisputes with China to avoid future standoffs of this nature ahead."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The two sides remain\nlocked in a security dilemma with each other. Any move by either in the neighbourhood at\nthe security level is perceived by the other as a threat. The recent irritants between India\nand China over issues related to India’s membership to the NSG and Masood Azhar are a\ntestimony to the strain. China, too, has continued to assert its territorial claims and has\nused strong words to criticise the Dalai Lama’s visit to Arunachal Pradesh in 2017. This is\ncoupled with its rising incursions and transgressions into the Indian territory at the\nWestern, Eastern and Central sectors. Though, for a long time, China never perceived\nIndia as a threat, the recent proximity between India and the USA after the civilian nuclear\n\ndeal (2005) and the signing of the LEMOA (2016) has set alarm bells ringing in China.\nChina has responded by encircling India through the Belt and Road initiative and the\nerstwhile String of Pearls strategy. India has responded to all this through its reinvigorated\nAct East Policy and Project Mausam and Project Spice Route.\n\nSince India’s defeat in the border conflict, the foreign policy diplomats and political\nclass in Indian has developed an immense amount of negativity towards China. India has\nto understand that China has its own national interests and that, at the international level,\nis not interested in demolishing India. It is merely pursuing its own strategic interests to\nachieve the status a great power.\n\nHowever, not everything seems absolutely hopeless. The Joint Working Group on\nborder issues, talks of special representatives, elevation of border talks to the level of a\nstrategic dialogue and a hot line between the two heads of the states clearly signify\nconvergence. It is, in fact, at the international level where India and China converge more.\nThe unipolarity of the USA and terrorism are two concerns that both nations share equally.\nThe forums of WTO and Climate Change have seen proximity evolve between China and\nIndia. At the energy level too, both, being energy-hungry states, have decided to cooperate\nrather than compete with each other. The growing convergence at the international level is\nconstrained by the nuclear dimension. China does not discuss nuclear diplomacy with\nIndia as it feels doing so may be a defacto acceptance of India’s status as a nuclear power.\nThe Chinese harbour the feeling that the 1998 nuclear tests by India were allowed by the\nUSA as it would alter the balance of power in Asia by helping India to go nuclear. The\nIndo—USA nuclear deal was also perceived negatively by the Chinese, who believe that\nthe US is attempting to use India as a balance to China.\n\nTo tackle a powerful China, India needs to evolve more sophisticated tools of\ndiplomacy. India needs to clarify its national interests and aggressively pace up its\neconomic and military might. India should evolve a coherent national strategy and identify\nthe diplomatic tools needed to execute the same, and should engage successfully with its\nneighbours in a way so as to prevent a firm Chinese foothold in India’s backyard."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The age of enlightenment gave birth to modern liberal\ndemocratic nationalism and introduced concepts like democracy and international law. In\nthe period preceding the eighteenth century, the international relations between states were\nbased upon mutual treaties to maintain peace and force as an instrument was used only\nwhen any principle of a treaty was violated. The hierarchical imperial administrations\nmaintained public order through dominance. As discussed in earlier sections, the Peace\nConference of Westphalia in 1648 was the first instrument of modern times that\nestablished the idea of balance of power. The Westphalia Conference addressed issues\nrelated to the reorganisation of Europe after the conclusion of the Thirty Years War. The\nPeace of Westphalia was followed by another landmark event—the Vienna Conference in\n1814-15, where the participants of the Conference aimed to serve peace to the world by\norganising regular meetings of the Great Powers. The Vienna Conference or the Concert\nof Europe ultimately established a peaceful Europe. It initiated the System of Congress in\nEuropean affairs where consultation was used as a mechanism to resolve disruptive rises.\n\nThough the Concert of Europe had helped in supporting international cooperation,\nyet the first World War caused a serious disorder to the existing system. At the end of the\nWorld War-I, the USA entered the club of the great powers. Woodrow Wilson, the\nPresident of USA, in his famous ‘Fourteen Points’ speech’, envisaged the creation of a\nnew body called the League of Nations. The basic aim of League was to strive for\ncollective security and eliminate chances of a future war. The formation of the League as\nan international body made sense because there had been tremendous bloodshed during\nthe World War-I and world leaders at the time were determined to establish a world\norganisation to prevent another conflict on the same scale. In 1919, at the Paris Peace\nconference, Wilson tried to include the clause detailing the establishment of the League of\nNations as part of the Treaty of Versailles. The Covenant for the League of Nations finally\ncame into force on 10° January, 1920 and the League held its first meeting in Geneva.\n\nProvisions for amending\n\nthe covenant\nHumanitarian cooperation _ i ~ Disarmament\nMandate system < aD » Territorial intogrity\nInternational cooperation ~ “ Political independence of nation states\n\n’\nEstablishment of a Permanent Court\nof International Justice\n\nThe USA, which had proposed the creation of the League in the first place, did not\njoin the same as the USA Senate had refused to ratify the Treaty of Versailles. The entire\ncause of League of Nations got diluted because of the absence of the USA as a power in\nthe League. Over a period of time, the League as a body became ineffective and\ninoperative. The Atlantic Charter of 1941 planted the seeds for a future global organisation\nfor ‘general security’. In 1942, the foundational declaration of United Nations (UN) was\nannounced. The term UN was coined for the first time by Franklin D. Roosevelt. The new\norganisation was envisaged under the Atlantic Charter and it advocated the idea of general\nsecurity and not collective security as envisaged under the League of Nation. Roosevelt,\nChurchill and Stalin laid the foundation of the new body called United Nations (hereafter\nreferred to the UN) at 4.50 pm on 24\" October, 1945. A total of 51 original members (or\nfounding members) joined that year. Fifty of them signed the Charter at the United\nNations Conference on International Organisation in San Francisco on 26 June, 1945,\nwhile Poland, which was not represented at the conference, signed it on 15 October, 1945."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The global community is apprised\nof the decisions of the UNSC through announcement of briefings. What goes into the\n\nmaking of these decisions by the five permanent members is not disclosed. Knowing how\nUNSC takes decisions is crucial as it is the sole global body vested with the authority to\ndetermine if a threat to international security exists or not.\n\nIndian diplomat Hardeep Puri asserts that at times, UNSC decisions have been\nperilous interventions causing more destabilisation in an already volatile situation.\nAccording to Puri, who has served as the Permanent Representative of the UN when India\nwas elected to be a non-permanent member of the Security Council in 2011-12, the recent\ninterventions in Syria and Libya have been perilous. Puri moreover insists that the perilous\nand unnecessary interventions in Iraq have led to the rise of non-state actors and terrorist\ngroups like ISIS. Such interventions are largely made on the logic of ‘Responsibility to\nProtect’ (R2P) to prevent genocide and seek support at the humanitarian level.\n\nSince the end of the Cold War, the idea of preventive diplomacy has emerged in the\nform of R2P. Some scholars who have analysed the R2P have developed a view that it’s a\ncode that gives the international community unbridled powers that often lead to\ninterference in the internal affairs of nation states. Such scholars feel that R2P could be a\nphenomenon that could potentially give rise to a new era of colonialism. The main idea of\npreventive diplomacy is to cure the conflicts before they emerge in their fiercest forms on\nthe international scene. The term Preventive Diplomacy was used for the first time in\n1960s by Dag Hammarskjéld, who was then the Secretary-General of the UN. He\nproposed that the basic idea of preventive diplomacy was to keep local conflicts outside\nthe superpower rivalry and prevent the two superpowers from escalating conflicts. Though\nthe view of Hammarskjéld was relevant during the Cold War period, it lost its relevance\nduring the post-Cold War era due to the absence of active rivalry between power blocks. A\nnew approach in the post-Cold War times was propounded by the sixth Secretary-General\nof the UN, Boutros Boutros-Ghali in 1992. According to Boutros Boutros-Ghali,\npreventive diplomacy was not only about preventing disputes that already exist from\nescalating into conflicts, but about taking action to prevent a dispute itself from arising.\nThe idea was based upon the logic of common good of the entire humanity.\n\nThe eighth UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, also asserted that preventive\ndiplomacy should involve all the stakeholders to strengthen UN partnerships between all\nregional and international actors. He emphasised that any preventive diplomacy, when\napplied, should be under the larger umbrella of the UN Charter and should not violate the\nsovereignty of a state.\n\nUse persuasion, negotiation,\n\nResort to prevention ~ mediation and conciliation\naa aN __ Non-coercive efforts to limit\nResort to collective __ j of terminate violence\npreventive action ._ Non-interference in internal affairs\nResort to a specific action » Cy meapecing Mat soverety\nto prevent escalation “S Resort to building of trust as.\nof contlicts er the international law\n\nWe need to keep in mind that preventive diplomacy is not concerned with solving\nevery problem in the world, as it is a special response in a situation which warrants\ninterference to avoid escalation into any form of violence. It may not even always prevent\na conflict, but as a tool may promote peace by preventing escalation of the conflict.\nAccording to the Article 51 of the UN Charter, if there is an armed attack upon a state, the\n\nstate can resort to use of force in self-defence while informing the UN Security Council\nimmediately. The Article 51 further asserts that the Security Council can also initiate steps\nto restore peace and security in the international system. Under the chapter VII of the UN\nCharter, the determination of the existence of a threat to the world peace would be taken\nonly by the UNSC and under Article 41, steps would be taken to maintain peace without\nthe use of force. However, under Article 42, the UNSC is empowered to use air, sea or\nland power to restore peace through blockades and operations. A lot of questions remain\nunanswered. The most important question is on what criteria the UNSC would get to\ndecide that an issue in a state is ripe for international intervention and is not an internal\nmatter.\n\nThere are, however, international situations where a concept like the R2P actually\nhelps. The idea of R2P is that a state actor should take steps to protect people and if a\nstate, in some extreme scenario, is unable to protect its people, then the responsibility to\nprotect its citizens falls upon the international community. The R2P was endorsed by the\nUNGA in 2005 and UN Resolutions 1694 (in 2006) and 1894 (in 2009) also affirmed the\nsame.\n\nThe states are quite worried as some have developed a feeling that R2P would be\nused to interfere in the internal affairs of a state and may lead to regime changes.\n\n~ Crimes against\nhumanity\nStates to protect “_ Genocide Pitan\net + their population —.

Nehru asserted that India would determine its own destiny by remaining\nindependent in its decision making at the foreign and domestic policy level. This led\nNehru to promote the idea of Non-Alignment. During Nehruvian times, India evolved the\nprinciples of non-interference and non-intervention. However, in 1971, when Indian\ntroops helped sliced off East Pakistan, India cited the logic of right of self-defence\nprovided under Article 51 of the UN charter (as explained above). Though India favoured\na weak Pakistan in its strategic interests, the subsequent international condemnation by the\ninternational community on India’s response in 1971 put India on toes again.\n\nIndia also intervened in Sri Lanka through UNPKF in 1987 with the consent of the\nSri Lankan government, but ended up paying a heavy price for its intervention. India\nlearned a valuable lesson—that of not resorting to military intervention if the two parties\nhave irreconcilable differences. At the global level, whenever India has engaged at UN\nlevel, it has favoured the idea of using non-violence as a tool of conflict resolution. This\nidea to resolve conflicts through non-violence is promoted by India even outside its\nregional sphere. In fact, India’s Sri Lanka episode of 1987 (explained in detail in the\nchapter of India and Sri Lanka relationship) has convinced Indian policy makers that using\nforce to impose a social change in the society will yield no results.\n\nIndia has clearly understood that in a situation of international anarchy, the states, by\nhaving an interaction with each other at all the levels, can still resolve differences through\ndialogue. India’s political perception of not viewing the world in completely black and\nwhite is rooted deep in its psyche. This perception owes its origin to 2000-year-old Indian\nepic called The Mahabharata. India often dictates openness, tolerance and non-violence to\nall states as a value irrespective of a domestic regime. India does not have an issue if a\nsociety is not democratic as India feels it’s a domestic choice of a state to have its own\nsystems of governance.\n\nIn 2001, the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty (ICISS)\nprepared a report on R2P. India, during the initial phase of evolution of the concept of\nR2P, showed some scepticism. India, initially, did not even send official representatives\nfor a discussion. The reason India did not officially participate in ICISS was because\nICISS was a NGO and India normally does not officially interact with NGOs by sending\nits diplomats. More importantly, the Indian perception about R2P was that it was largely,\nas explained and discussed by the ICISS, just a new name for humanitarian intervention\nwhere Western states wanted to resort to some sort of force to achieve their own interests.\nAll these years, India had formed a group called G—4 in 2004 with India, Brazil, Japan and\nGermany, and used the G-4 to advocate for UN reforms. As the debate on R2P\nprogressed, India initially stated that it would not accept right of humanitarian intervention\nor idea of military humanism in any form, as was under discussion. In fact, India’s\nPermanent Representative to the UN at that time asserted that only a reformed and\nenlarged UNSC should be authorised to undertake any decision on any such issue and that\nit should also include the regional organisations. India constantly exhibited recalcitrant\nopposition to the idea of R2P in the initial years. The initial document of the R2P followed\nthe idea of coercive solidarism’. However, as there was a staunch opposition to the idea,\nthe idea of ‘consensual solidarism’ was added by replacing the idea of coercive solidarism.\nHowever, two events in the times ahead brought about a shift in Indian perception of the\nR2P. Let us have a look at the two events.\n\nIn 2007, the military Junta of Myanmar suppressed peaceful protestors. All western\nstates condemned the suppression and even resorted to sanctioning Myanmar. India, on the\nother hand, stated that such issues were domestic issues of a state and that India would\nremain neutral to its neighbour’s internal squabbles and continue to engage with\nMyanmar. In 2008, Cyclone Nargis caused heavy devastation in Myanmar. India\nimmediately resorted to an engaging approach of closed door diplomacy and provided\nimmediate relief supplies.\n\nSimilarly, in 2009, as the Sri Lankan civil war was in its final stages, India\nmaintained a diplomatic rhetoric of no harm to the civilians (this was due to domestic\npolitical compulsions and the upcoming elections in 2009), but refused any sort of\nintervention in the affairs of Sri Lanka.\n\nThese two instances of 2007 and 2009 gave India an option to evolve its position on\nR2P. In 2009, when the UNGA debated the R2P, India asserted that it favours the idea that\nprotecting its citizens is the sovereign responsibility of the state. India supported the pillar-\n1 of the R2P. India also supported the idea that weak states would be provided\ninternational assistance to prevent conflicts from escalating. India, thus, also supported\n\npillar-2 of the R2P. India showed resistance to the idea of international humanitarian\nintervention in case a state failed to protect its people. India asserted that this measure\nshould be used as a last resort and only exercised on case specific basis. India maintained\nthat if international humanitarian intervention is used (as a last resort) it should be used in\ncompliance with the charter of the UN and regional organisations operating in the region\nof intervention should be consulted.

India voted in favour\nof UNSC resolution 1970. As the situation in Libya worsened, the UNSC passed another,\nmore stringent, resolution (Resolution 1973) and urged the member states to take all\npossible actions to protect civilians. India abstained in the vote of UNSC Resolution 1973\nas it stated that there was no clarity on the ground situation in Libya and the action\nadvocated under UNSC Resolution 1973 violates Libyan sovereignty. The NATO\nimmediately launched operation ‘Unified Protector’ in Libya. India vocally criticised the\nNATO operation as, when the NATO began its operations, it began to fund the rebels for a\nregime change. India was alarmed to see that instead of focussing on making peace on the\nground, NATO was making no attempts for a ceasefire. India asserted that the way the\nUNSC resolution 1973 was adopted and implemented on the ground brought a bad name\nto the idea of R2P. India began to press the idea that there needed to be a broad debate\nupon the third pillar and the circumstances in which it will be used. Brazil also promoted\nthe idea of Responsibility While Protecting (RWP) and India advocated that R2P should\nbe anchored in RWP. India further asserted that imposing the idea of a regime change from\noutside is a dangerous path to be followed.\n\nTerritorial sovereignty + Followed a pragmatic approach\nstates be maintained * dary inn\nbe used as a last resort\nNATO intervention justifies + “\nIndia skepticism of misuse of R2P Favoured the idea of RWP\n\nIn October 2011, the Syrian crisis became the second area of contention for India.\nIndia again abstained from voting in the case of Syria as it did not want a ‘second Libya’\nsituation to be perpetrated in Syria. India emphasised that it would favour a dialogue in\nSyria and not a threat of sanctions as advocated by the West. India, during its tenure as a\nnon permanent member of the UNSC, succeeded in getting statements passed that not only\ncondemned the Syrian atrocities on civilians but proposed a negotiation and a national\nsolution amongst the parties in the civil war. In February 2012 and July 2012, India\nsupported two more Resolutions which favoured a regional attempt by the Arab League to\nfind a solution and use of non-military sanctions on the Syrian regime led by Assad. The\n\nanalysis of Syria and Libya clearly prove that India favoured its own interpretation of R2P\nrooted in its own historical past.

India always attaches greater importance to global organisations as it\nhelps in measuring the rise of India as a major player in the international system. Indian\ndiplomats also consider postings in the global organisations as prestigious as it enables\nthem to inculcate some serious negotiation-related skills in themselves. In the initial\nperiod of the Cold War, India used to be a rule taker at the global level. Since the end of\nthe Cold War, India has shifted its position to that of a rule maker today. Keeping in sync\nwith growing Indian capabilities and a rising international profile of India, India has\ndecided to partake in the exercise of shaping norms today. What puts Indian diplomats in a\nplace of advantage in international organisations is their proficiency in English and deep\nknowledge about the history of core issues vested in the international scene. Instead of\nformal training, Indian diplomats work upon building their historical knowledge database\nby working with senior diplomats and such skill comes handy in international\norganisations. Many countries in the world, at different times, have appreciated this\nquality in Indian diplomats.\n\nAt the international level, Indian diplomats strive to act as a bridge between\nconflicting parties. A unique feature of Indian diplomacy at the multilateral level is that\nthey may refuse firmly to accept a deal which may be unfavourable to India. This aspect\nof India’s policy is visible at forums discussing climate change, trade and nuclear deals\nlike NPT and CTBT and so on. Due to such a behaviour, at times, India often puts to risk\nthe support of powerful countries that may have helped her play a larger role in shaping\nnorms at the global level.\n\nIndia’s traditional multilateral policy began from the way it rallied countries under\nthe rubric of non-alignment and G-77. These groups were used by India to reject the ideas\npropounded by the West against the interests of the participants. The non-aligned states\nand G-77 collectively worked as a coalition in the UN to block any initiatives that might\nhurt the interests of the coalition. At the end of the Cold War, non-alignment became more\nof a forum. India gradually began to shift to seek solidarity with smaller groups that could\nadvance Indian interests. As India searched for smaller groups, it remained confined to\ndeveloping states only. According to Aruna Narlikar, the coalition was not issue-based but\nstill a bloc-style concept (we will elaborate this in the next chapter). India has, however,\nfound it difficult to obtain recognition for new groups. India, for instance, found it difficult\n\nto establish a group called ‘Development Agenda Group,’ comprising of twenty-two\nstates. India has, in the meantime, launched a massive bureaucratic campaign for a\npermanent seat to the UNSC. In fact, whenever there has been a state visit of any leader,\nIndia makes the pledge of support by the visiting Head of the State as a part of the Joint\nCommuniqué. Despite support pledges from USA, UK, France and Russia, India has not\nbeen able to succeed effectively. In fact, India has become a part of the G4 to seek a\ncoalition-based support for a permanent UNSC seat. One of the important reasons for\nthese unsatisfactory results till date regarding the campaign is the lack of a powerful push\nfrom the Indian political leadership and relatively less resources available to the\ndiplomatic corps for the campaign. India, in the last two decades, has become\nunsuccessful in mobilising foreign states, based on compelling arguments, to push for\nIndia’s candidacy at UNSC. Also, there has been no realisation amongst the P—5S states of\nanything of India’s inherent power structures that may compel them to add India in the\ngroup. The P-5 has still not had the feeling that the absence of India at the P—5 states may\nhave led to a missing link in adequate representation of all states equally in the world.\n\nThe bureaucratic lethargy was visible in 2006 when Shashi Tharoor entered the fray\nto be appointed the UN Secretary General. Tharoor lost out to South Korean Ban-Ki Moon\nas Indian foreign bureaucracy could not powerfully assert at the level of closed door\nnegotiations with all states in the world while South Koreans made Ban-Ki Moon’s\nappointment one of the core priorities of their foreign policy. In 2007, India rectified the\nshortcomings in Tharoor’s campaign when it came to the appointment of a Secretary\nGeneral of Commonwealth of Nations. India’s MEA and political leadership launched an\nelaborate and a massive campaign that saw Kamlesh Sharma sail through.\n\nIn the sections ahead, we shall see that in the recent times, whenever the Indian\npremiers have taken a personal interest in multilateral diplomacy, India has witnessed\nmore instances of success. Now, let us turn out attention to the aspect of India and its\ndiplomacy with the UN."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

An Indian delegation was present at\nthe San Francisco conference in 1945 and was represented by C P Ramaswamy Mudaliar,\nFeroz Khan Noon and V T Krishmachari. While the discussions were going on in the\nconference, India proposed that instead of UNSC ‘electing’ six non-permanent members,\nit should ‘appoint’ the members on criteria like their population, the industrial capacity of\nthe state and so forth. India also asserted that six members be ‘appointed’ to the UNSC to\nparticipate in the discussions of the UNSC without a right to vote. Though India’s\nsuggestions were not accepted, India also raised concerns over veto powers.\n\nIndia became one of the founding members of the UN. As India began to engage with\nthe UN as an independent country, it first focussed on decolonisation. India believed that\nthe UN, as a platform, could be used to expedite the process of decolonisation of the world\nand this would also provide India an opportunity to showcase its global leadership at a\nworld platform. Throughout the period of the Cold War, India began to use the UN\nplatform for spearheading disarmament and solicited the support of UN for development.\nThe 3—-D formula of India at the UN (Decolonisation, Disarmament and Development)\nworked well for India. In the previous chapters of the book, we have argued the basic\n\ntenets of India’s decolonisation policy (see chapter of India—Africa Policy—Key drivers)\nand India’s disarmament diplomacy (see chapter of India’s Nuclear Foreign Policy). Since\nthe end of the Cold War, as Indian economy began to improve and as India began to\nemerge on the world scene as a new economic powerhouse, it began to seek greater\nparticipation in the UN, especially the Security Council. By this time, India’s perception\nabout UN had begun to alter after India’s experience at the UN level with respect to the\nKashmir problem (see chapter of India—Pakistan relationship for an in-depth analysis).\nInitially, India had perceived the UN as a platform for international peace. However, due\nto the way the Security Council dealt with the Kashmir problem, India began to realise\nthat the UNSC would act predominantly under political pressure from the bigger powers\nwhile resolving disputes which would be based upon the ideological tilt of the parties\ninvolved in the dispute. By the 1960s and 1970s, especially after the experience of\nKashmir, India began to feel that bilateralism would be more befitting to Indian interests\nthan multilateralism. However, at present, India has been seeking reforms in the UNSC.\nIndia aspires for a permanent seat at the UNSC. In 2015, an Intergovernmental\nNegotiation adopted a formal document at the UN for UN reforms. A text based\nnegotiation process has been launched for reforms of the UNSC from 2015.\n\nIndia is under ropeesentod in the\n\nUNSC wth unrepresented relions* « India is the world's largest democracy\nIndia will get Veto power andto ._ has been a major contributor 10\nbe a part of global decision making UN peacekeeping missions\n‘Tho membership will be recognition * ' India is one of the oldest and grand\nof a new world order civilizatonal powers that deserves\n\n' the status\nIndia is a secular, responsible ands\nfastest growing power\n\nChina has been one of the primary hurdles in India’s accession as a permanent\nmember to the UNSC. China does not want to share the status of being the only Asian\npower in the UNSC with India. More so, although India has received vocal support from\nUSA, UK, France and Russia for its permanent candidacy to the UNSC, these powers\nhave been quite reluctant to undertake UNSC reforms to add India. There is a general\nperception that the powers intend to maintain a status quo in the arena of international\nrelations. Also, as permanent membership to the UNSC requires two-third majority of the\nUN General Assembly, seeking a consensus on the same shall be another challenge for\nIndia. Some permanent members of the UNSC have argued that India’s contribution to the\nbudget of the Security Council does not match its claims to be at the higher table.\nHowever, with the beginning of text-based reforms since 2015 for the first time in the\nmodern history of UN, the situation has reignited hopes for India’s permanent candidacy\nonce again."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The UN Conference on Human\nEnvironment was held in 1972 in Stockholm. Twenty years later, in 1992, the world\nachieved consensus to establish UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on\nClimate Change). Over a period of time, the UNFCCC along with IPCC\n(Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) worked out some dedicated scientific\nresearch on the issues relating to global warming. The newfound euphoria for climate\nsciences culminated in the birth of the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol however\nended in 2012 (as its compliance period was from 2008 to 2012) and since then the leaders\n\nof the world have been struggling to come out with a new successor agreement. In the\nsame time period however, the leaders of the world were able to achieve a consensus on\nMontreal Protocol to tackle issues pertaining to depletion of ozone layer. India has\nparticipated in the global climate change diplomacy since the 1980s. India was one of the\nmost forceful voices in 1972 at the UN Conference on Human Environment that was held\nin Stockholm. India asserted that the fixation of the western world on industrialisation and\naggressive economic growth has been the most important reason for rise of environmental\nconcerns at the global level. Indira Gandhi at Stockholm emphasised that over-\nconsumption of resources in the West was a major cause for the degradation of\nenvironment. She refuted the claims of the West that exploitation of natural resources by\ndeveloping world was the major reason for the environmental mess. Indira asserted the\nright to development of the developing world as a strategy. She advocated that the Western\nworld provide assistance to the developing world in its quest for development as they were\nresponsible for the injustices perpetrated upon the third world due to colonialism and\nimperialism. In 1988, the UN asserted that climate change is a common concern for\nmankind and decided to setup an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to\ndeliberate upon the issue of climate change. The UNGA, in 1989, urged members to\nestablish a ‘framework convention’ to address climate change. In 1992, this led to the birth\nof the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Rio at\nthe Earth Summit. India was a part of the intergovernmental negotiating committee which\nnegotiated the conduct of the convention. India understood that climate diplomacy could\naffect its national interests and hence, became a part of the climate change negotiations.\nIndia began to outline its position on climate change, that the GHG emissions were\nmajorly caused by the developed world as the emissions of the developing world were\nminiscule in comparison. India also said that as developing world will have to work to\nremove poverty and undertake development, their GHG emissions would rise. Therefore,\nin this prevailing scenario, a legally binding target upon the developing world could not be\nadvanced. India advocated that any convention in future should establish a bridge of\ntechnology transfers from the western world to the global south to help them meet\ndevelopmental challenges. India advised that an equitable solution to tackle GHG\nemissions is that the developing world reduce their emissions per capita and converge\nthem with the per capital emissions of developing world.\nCommon but cierent area of | __ No legally binding targets for\n\nresponsibilities: developing world\nDevelopment in developing _ eS ___ Synchronization of developmental pians\nworld is the core agenda ‘and voluntary commitments possible\nTe wars F ee ent financial forervicy by\n\nAt the CoP-1 in Berlin in 1995, India advocated that Annex-I parties accept legal\ntargets to reduce emissions in a time bound manner through a protocol. India succeeded to\nget the idea of ‘differentiated responsibilities’ endorsed in the Berlin Mandate. India,\nduring CoP-3 negotiations in Kyoto, pressed for the removal of any voluntary\ncommitments for developing world. The CoP-3 agreed upon the same but introduced\nmechanisms like Joint Implementation, Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and\nEmissions Trading and so on. Over a period of time, India accepted that it would ensure\n(through a voluntary pledge) that its emissions do not exceed the emissions of the\ndeveloped world. In the Bali Action Plan, India successfully ensured that its domestic\n\nmeasures for mitigation are not placed under external scrutiny as doing so would have\nviolated India’s sovereignty. In 2008, India announced its National Action Plan on Climate\nChange (NAPCC). India pledged that it will resort to mitigation actions domestically and\nby 2020, would voluntarily reduce India’s emission intensity by 20-25% of its GDP. India\nfollows a two-point strategy. It has joined hands with the G—77 to ensure that no legally\nbinding commitments are imposed on developing states. It has also worked with the\nBASIC group (Brazil, South Africa, India and China) at the global level. When the Modi\nGovernment came to power in 2014, India continued with the same policies as it had\nespoused earlier. India is still following a bilateral policy to garner financial and technical\nsupport for clean energy, its recent deals with France and USA (as explained in the\nrespective chapters) are testimony to that fact. India in the recent times has shown a great\nresolve at the Paris Agreement of Climate Change. The Paris Agreement focuses on\ndeveloping the capabilities of developing countries to combat climate change in sync with\ntheir national priorities that each state has to define under the Intended Nationally\nDetermined Contributions (INDCs). India has announced its INDCs and is trying to play a\ncrucial role in global climate debate. When Donald Trump assumed the Presidency of US\nin 2017, he passed an order withdrawing US from the Paris Agreement. This provides\nIndia yet again an opportunity to lead the global climate negotiations."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

India was one of the members of GATT\nbut could not achieve much success as GATT was dominated by the quad of Canada,\nUSA, Japan and the EU and was a rich man’s club. Before the WTO was bor, the world\nwitnessed heavy protectionism. There were tariff barriers which were imposed by states\nthat restricted trade but, when the WTO was formed, its primary focus was removal of\n\ntariff barriers to integrate the economies of all nations in the world. The WTO came out\nwith 19 agreements (with each having an annexure) to achieve its objectives.\n\nIn 1986, multilateral negotiations began under the Uruguay round. The negotiations\nunder the Uruguay Round ended in 1994, with a recommendation to create the WTO.\nUruguay Round advocated that there shall be a gradual reduction of tariffs and a timeline\nto dismantle Multi Fibre Agreement (MFA) which governed the textile trade under the\nAgreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) as well as the Agreement on Agriculture\n(AOA). Though the process to dismantle the tariffs competed by 2005, textile products\nstill continued to have high tariffs. When the WTO was formed, it advocated non-\ndiscriminatory free trade through negotiations by ensuring predictability and transparency\nin global trade. The WTO came out with an Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing\nMeasures (SCM), which, in turn, came out with three product categories. Under the Red\ncategory, if one state gave a subsidy on a product for its manufacturing and then exports it\nto the other state, then the importing state can ban the import of the product. A state in this\ncase, under the Amber category, can either invoke countervailing duties or report to the\nDispute Settlement Mechanisms (DSM) of the WTO. If the product falls under the Green\nCategory, no action can be taken by a state. Under the General Agreement on Trade in\nServices (GATS) a state could resort to setting Sanitary and Phyto-Sanitary (SPS)\nmeasures and create Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Agreements. Under the Trade\nRelated Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement, states, by establishing domestic\nlaws, need to ensure stringent punishments for copying intellectual property rights and\ntake steps to prevent piracy.\n\nAs India integrated itself through the WTO, its trade began to increase. As the MFA\nwas scrapped under the ATC of WTO, India also witnessed a textile boom. As developing\ncountries faced difficulties to implement the agreements of the WTO, they began to seek\nconcessions. A new round of negotiations began in Doha in 2001. The negotiations were\ncalled the Doha Development Agenda (DDA). As the DDA negotiations began, India\nraised concerns over the Special Safeguard Mechanisms (SSM), which was essentially a\ntool that would allow developing countries to raise tariffs temporarily to deal with import\nsurges or price falls. Issues related to Non-Agricultural Market Access (NAMA) too\nemerged in the DDA. During the DDA, the developing countries asserted that the they had\nnot been granted sufficient trade concessions, while developed countries argued that\ndeveloping countries have not eliminated tariffs in agriculture and services sectors. During\nthe DDA negotiations, the developed countries advocated that through a Trade Facilitation\nAgreement (TFA), the developing countries should open up their markets. Due to many\ndifferences between the developed and developing states at the DDA, the negotiations\ncollapsed.\n\nAfter the failure of Doha negotiations, to make a breakthrough on agriculture\nsubsidies and SSM, the next debate began in 2013 in Bali where again issues related to\nagriculture erupted. The Bali negotiations decided to focus on TFA as it would facilitate\nborder trade. For India, the priority with respect to TFA was to clarify that if it was unable\nto fulfil some complicated provisions of TEA, then it should not be made to go through\nproceedings related to dispute settlements. As the USA realised that TFA could again\nbecome an issue with the developing countries, if they started making concessions in\nagriculture. The issue in agriculture was of stockpiling and challenging stockpiles of\n\ndeveloping states. Members at the WTO agreed that if a developing country maintained a\nstockpile over 10% of its agricultural produce, then it could be challenged by other WTO\nmembers. But the WTO said that for a certain length of time, the developing countries, in\norder to provide food security to its population, can maintain excess stockpile (over 10%\nlimit) without any member challenging the decision. The issue was to decide what interval\nwould be allowed for such a limit to remain unchallenged by other member states. India\nwanted unlimited and indefinite timeframe while the USA favoured a two year ‘peace\nclause’. After intense negotiations, it was agreed by the Ministerial Decision on Public\nStockholding for Food Security Purposes that a four-year peace clause will be followed\nand the TFA has to be concluded and implemented. However, when the Modi government\ncame to power in 2014 in India, it asserted that it would not accept the agreements related\nto TFA and public stockholding as they are against the interests of India. India asserted\nthat a new agreement should be worked out where stockholding restraints are removed for\ndeveloping countries and they be given an indefinite exception. Later, in 2014, during a\nmeeting with Obama, Modi announced his support for the Bali Agreement with a tighter\nlanguage and the Bali Agreement was then taken to the next step.\n\nMany negotiators theorise that India always adopts a hardline policy in trade\nnegotiations as it always suffers a feeling that any blanket trade treaty may put India in a\ndisadvantage. Thus, India has this culture of resorting to either a flat-out refusal or, at\ntimes, taking a long time to negotiate. However, India also has to understand and consider\nthe consequences of the costs involved with such an attitude on other member states in the\ntimes ahead.\n\nAmrita Narlikar says that when India negotiates for trade, it favors to work with\nhybrid coalition of states. These hybrid coalitions are issue centric (like agriculture etc.).\nAmrita argues that India adopts a distributive, demandeur and a naysaying strategy that\nhave legitimacy of process or equity of outcomes at the heart of negotiations.\n\n1.

However, no such court\n\ncould be established at that time. Similar proposals were made even after World War-II, as\nwell as in the early 1990s, during the Cold War, but three events gave a strong push for the\nidea again in the late 1980s and 1990s. Firstly, in 1989, the PM of Trindad and Tobago\nAN.R Robinson proposed the creation of an International Court to deal with issues related\nto drug trafficking. After the proposal of Robinson, an International Law Commission\n(ILC) was tasked by the UNGA to draft a statute to establish a Permanent Court. Secondly,\natrocities in Yugoslavian wars by the armed forced of Yugoslavia led to the formation of\nan International Criminal Tribunal for trying cases related to the former Yugoslavia in\n1993. Thirdly, following the genocide in Rwanda, an International Criminal Tribunal for\nRwanda was established in 1994.\n\nWhen these tribunals for Rwanda and Yugoslavia were established, there was a need\nfelt to have a Permanent International Criminal Court. In 1994, a final draft for the\nestablishment of International Criminal Court (ICC) was prepared by the ILC. The ILC\nurged the UNGA to convene a conference and negotiate a treaty to establish a statute for\nthe court. The negotiations began to draft the statute and continued till 1998. The UNGA\norganised a conference in Rome to finalise the treaty that would act as a statute for the\nICC. Subsequently, the Rome Statute of the ICC, or simply, the Rome Statute as it was\ncommonly called, was adopted and the ICC was formally established, after ratifications by\nmember states, on 1* July, 2002. The headquarters of the ICC is in The Hague,\nNetherlands. The ICC prosecutes those who are responsible for genocide, war crimes and\ncrimes against humanity and is the court of last resort which intervenes only if a national\nauthority could not prosecute the ones responsible for the crimes stated above.\n\nTill date, India has neither signed nor ratified the Rome statute and is nor a party to\nthe ICC. India has raised a lot of objections to the Rome Statute. India feels that under the\nRome statute, the ICC has been subordinated to the UNSC and such subordination would\nresult in political interference by the UNSC in the decisions of the ICC. As per the Rome\nstatute, India states, the non-state parties that go to the ICC can be bound to the UNSC by\nthe ICC. This, India feels is a violation of the Vienna convention, because under the\nVienna convention if a state has not accepted a treaty, it cannot be made to forcibly accede\nto it (veritably the exact same point of objection that India has in case of the CTBT). India\nfeels that the Rome statute has given extraordinary powers, in this regard, to the UNSC.\nMoreover, India takes issue with the fact that the Rome statute has refused to accept\nterrorism and use of nuclear weapons as crimes under ICC, as proposed by India. India has\nalso raised objections to the definition of “war crimes” under Article 8 of the Rome\nStatute as it has included in its ambit “armed conflict not of an international character”.\nIndia feels this provision could be used against India by other states by making a case for\nKashmir where India asserts it is tackling state sponsored terrorism by Pakistan. India,\nthus, has not signed or ratified the ICC and remains an observer to the ICC."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The UN Charter in San Francisco established the\nICJ in 1945. The ICJ is in The Hague, Netherlands and it has 15 Judges who belong to\ndifferent nationalities. The [CJ helps in settling disputes between two conflicting states on\n\nthe basis of international law. It also looks into legal matters referred to it and gives\nadvisory opinions. The ICJ can only be approached by member states of the UN as private\nindividuals and entities are not permitted to take up the matters at the level of ICJ. When a\nstate may take up a matter at the ICJ, it can take up a case of an individual person with\nrespect to another state in concern. It is on the basis of this point that India in 2017 took up\nthe matter of Kulbhushan Jadhav (an Indian national, in custody of Pakistan, arrested by\nPakistan on 3* March, 2016 in Mashkel area of Baluchistan on spying charges). Pakistan\nhad arrested Jadhav in their territory and asserted that Jadhav was sent by India’s external\nintelligence agency (R&AW) to create destruction of the China Pakistan Economic\nCorridor. Jadhav was arrested on the charges of espionage and terrorism. India and\nPakistan are both signatories to the Optional Protocol of the Vienna Convention on\nConsular Relations (VCCR), 1963. India has sought consular access to Jadhav many times\nwhile Pakistan has rejected the same every time. Jadhav was further tried in a military\ncourt in Pakistan and in April, 2017 was awarded death sentence. As both India and\nPakistan are signatories to the VCCR, India subsequently took up the matter to the ICJ.\nThe ICJ has the jurisdiction to hear disputes if an aggrieved party asserts that there has\nbeen a different interpretation on the VCCR by the other party involved in the dispute.\nIndia in May, 2017 requested ICJ to apply provisional measures to ensure that Pakistan\ndoes not execute Jadhav. Under the provisional measures, ICJ under article 41 of the\nstatute of the ICJ, it can issue injunctive directions. The article 74 of the ICJ has given\npowers to the President of the ICJ to issue ad-interim directions when matters related to\nprovisional measures are brought up. Under article 74(4) of the ICJ Statute, the ICJ\nPresident issued orders to Pakistan to ensure that it does not execute Jadhav for the time\nbeing. India had put up to the ICJ that if Pakistan executes Jadhav, there would be\nirreparable damage caused to the rights which are claimed by India. The ICJ while\nordering ad-interim relief to India in May 2017 asserted that Pakistan by denying consular\naccess to India has violated the human rights of Jadhav despite it being a signatory of\nVCCR."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The\nGCC emerged as an alliance of six Gulf States to promote economic interaction. Western\nscholars believe that GCC is based on a foundation of a common security concern but the\nscholars of the GCC nations insist that it is a platform for economic, cultural, political and\nscientific integration. There was a proposal in 2011 to establish a Gulf Union and\ntransform the GCC into a tight economic and military union. The proposal has met with\n\ncertain objections from some member states. The GCC has also been negotiating a\ncommon currency named Khaleeji but the progress on the same has been slow.\n\nIndia’s relations with GCC has been on since 1947. Initially, as mentioned in the\nchapter of ‘India—West Asia Policy—Key Drivers,’ India politically supported GCC and\nother states in the region during Cold War. By the end of the Cold War, as India’s\ndependence upon energy from the Gulf increased, India began to hold the GCC as crucial\nfor its energy security. In earlier chapters, we have mentioned that India decided to sign\noil-based partnerships with Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar. India realised that it can\nleverage its historically good political relationship with the GCC to develop energy\nsecurity partnerships. As India’s oil trade increased in the post-Cold War times, a lot of\nIndians began to work in the Gulf States as professionals. The post-Cold War times have\nwitnessed a shift from blue collar to white collar Indian presence in the GCC states.

India, due to these two reasons, has started observing the region through a strategic\nlens. This is also visible from the recent high level bilateral visits. India has not only\ndecided to establish a strategic petroleum reserve with the UAE but has added defence\nrelationships as a new element in its interaction with the GCC. The GCC states have\ncooperated with India in the region as they feel that India’s engagement with GCC at\neconomic, political, security and strategic level will enhance India’s global profile.

This change in\nperception of the GCC has contributed to their realising the need to build up strategic\npartnerships with India. As the GCC states have begun to look east, it has found\nsynchronisation with India’s attempt to link west. The GCC, however, has been insecure\nabout India’s developing proximity with Iran and Israel. Pakistan, too, plays the Islamic\ncard to assert to the GCC that India is an anti-Muslim state and therefore remains an\nirritant in the deepening India~GCC ties.

Scholars assert that if India and Thailand\ncan take some FDI to other BIMSTEC members, the investments can act as a push for the\nFTA. India, under its Act East Policy, has prioritised infrastructure development and if\nIndia succeeds in developing infrastructure in the north-east states, it can act as a\nspringboard for deeper integration and connectivity with BIMSTEC. India has realised\nthat BIMSTEC will be a bridge between South Asia and South East Asia. Today, India has\ninitiated steps to boost connectivity and investments to promote regional cooperation\nthrough BIMSTEC. In April 2017, the Indian government has approved the MoU with\nBIMSTEC to establish an interconnected BIMSTEC grid. The creation of the grid will\nfacilitate power exchanges across borders by member states and will help in development\nof regional networks for electricity supply. In the recent times, India has decided to shift\naway from Pakistan, which has emerged as an irritant in regional cooperation at the level\nof SAARC, to deepen ties with BIMSTEC."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The WA seeks to ensure that states do not end up\nexporting conventional arms and dual use technologies and goods that could ultimately\nland up in the hands of terrorists. It ensures that countries to which such exports are made\nprotect such transfers and ensure that exports do not cause destabilisation. To join WA, a\nstate has to be a producer and exporter of items that are mentioned in the control list of\nWA. India fulfils this criterion to join WA. As per WA, a state intending to join WA should\n‘adhere’ to NPT. As the rules don’t mention that a state needs to be a ‘party’ to NPT, India\nmeets all such criteria despite not being a party to the NPT. By being a part of WA, India\ncan contribute to world peace and international security. The membership to WA also\nincreases India’s probability to access items under the WA control list. India will also be\nable to identify, at the global level, the items that are active threats to international\nsecurity.\n\nThe AG is an initiative of Australia that came up in 1985 after the use of chemical\nweapons by Iraq in the Iran-Iraq war. The AG focusses upon preventing the proliferation\nof biological weapons and their export to rogue state and non-state actors. India has a\n\nthorough and an elaborate export controls system over chemical agents having potential\nuse in a chemical war (dual use). India wishes to be a member of AG. By being a part of\nthe AG, India can have a say in the international chemical and bio-technology commerce.\n\nIn 1987, the G—7 countries decided to establish an informal political group to ensure\nthat states do not proliferate missiles and related technologies. This group was called\nMTCR. The MTCR is not a treaty but an understanding amongst partners to ensure non-\nproliferation of missile technologies, software and to attempt to control the exports of the\nsame to countries. The aim is to ensure that there is no proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction (WMDs). By identifying and restricting exports of technology and equipment,\nit ensures that a state is not able to construct a delivery system to launch WMDs. A special\nemphasis is placed on rockets and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) which are designed\nfor carrying a payload of at least 500 kilogrammes and a range of 30 kilometres. The\norganisation follows a set of guidelines and an MTCR Annex. The Annex has a list of\nitems whose exports are to be controlled. The highly sensitive and less sensitive items are\ncategorised into Category-I and Category-II. Joining MTCR is a voluntary subscription\nand since there are no legal obligations, the partners have to act with restraint and\nresponsibility to export items to ensure that exports do not lead to proliferation. France is\nthe regime’s first point of contact but MTCR has no secretariat and a decision to join the\nMTCR requires a consensus of its existing members. India applied for membership to\nMTCR in June 2015. In October 2015, at the Rotterdam Plenary meeting, no progress\ncould be achieved. India again presented its case by highlighting its non-proliferation\nrecord. India asserted that it has a strong control system under a list called SCOMET\n(Special Chemical, Organic, Materials, Equipment and Technology). On 27* June, 2016, at\nthe MTCR point of contact meet in Paris, India was accepted as the 35\" member of\nMTCR. In October, 2016, at the Seoul Plenary meet, India participated as a member. Now\nIndia is obliged to follow a no-under cut policy. India has to ensure consultations with\nother MTCR members before granting license to export any MTCR item that has been\nnotified as denied by another partner pursuant to MTCR guidelines (as mentioned on the\nMTCR website). The membership to MTCR will enable India to buy missile technologies\nfrom other states.\n\nThe NSG was created in 1974 and met in 1975 for the first time. NSG is a group that\nhas come up with guidelines to ensure that member states do not sign nuclear deals with\nother states where signing of such a deal could lead to proliferation of nuclear weapons.\nThe group is a high table of states that frame rules governing nuclear commerce. In order\nto strengthen the global nuclear non-proliferation order, India wishes to be a part of the\nNSG. However, as India is not a member of NPT, China and Pakistan have objections to\nits enrolment. Pakistan has stated that India’s becoming a member of NSG will mean that\nit shall have access to fissile material for its civilian reactors. Consequently, it will have\nmore material for its military reactors and thus, as per Pakistan, inducting India into the\nNSG will fuel an arms race. China has observed that the accession of India to NSG should\nbe norm based, meaning that if an exception is made for India (that India being a non-\nsignatory to NPT still joins NSG), then the same exception should be made for others.\nChina wants the same exception for Pakistan. There is a growing feeling that, since China\nis not a member of MTCR, it wants the US to support Chinese membership to MTCR in\nlieu of Chinese support for India’s membership to the NSG. By being a member of the\n\nNSG, India’s nuclear regime will have a stronger legal foundation and would also give\nIndia an option to set rules related to nuclear commerce. India will, by being a member of\nthe NSG, be on a firmer footing to propose trade of plutonium for India’s thorium based\nreactors, thereby providing far greater energy security to India. India can also produce\nexport-worthy nuclear equipments, have greater access to uranium abroad, boost Make in\nIndia as well as adopt efficient nuclear energy, by being a member of the NSG."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Economic interaction was the key goal of the ASEAN states. In 1980s and\n1990s, the EU was formed. This affected the ASEAN-Europe trade. As the US\nconsolidated the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), this further dented the\nASEAN’s trade practices. In 1989, Australia suggested the creation of the APEC as an\nAsian version of an FTA comprising of North East Asia, South East Asia and the Pacific\nRim states. Similarly, even Malaysia proposed an East Asian Economic Group (EAEG). In\n1989, Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke met his South Korean counterpart and\nmooted an idea where ministers could meet to enhance regional economic cooperation. In\nNovember 1991, a Seoul Declaration was adopted that announced the scope of the APEC.\nThe APEC was to promote trade, technology transfers and promote growth. The first\nAPEC summit happened in 1993 and decided to focus upon liberalisation and economic\ntrade. The APEC has 21 member economies today, and India wants to join the economic\ncommunity called APEC as it wants to undertake trade promotion within the economies of\nthe Asia-Pacific.\n\nInitially there was opposition to India’s membership to the APEC as some members\ninitially raised objections about India’s economic reforms and its engagement with the\nWTO. In recent times, a lot of members feel that as India has undertaken economic\nreforms and it should be allowed to be part of the APEC. Many feel that India’s maritime\nstrengths and its clout as a balancer will help the APEC. Currently, India holds the\nposition of an observer state in the APEC. The US too, has favoured India’s accession to\nthe APEC as a member. If India becomes a member of the APEC, it will be perceived as a\nserious economic power in Asia Pacific and this will help in India’s negotiations at the\nlevel of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RECP)’. Apart from\nimproving trade volumes, joining the APEC will facilitate India’s domestic growth and\nlead to job creation. The main reason as to why India is not yet a member of the APEC is\ngeography. Geographically, India is not part of the Pacific region. Some APEC members\nalso have reservations about India’s high custom duties and stringent rules for FDI. India\nis not keen on shedding off protectionist measures prevalent in its domestic economy,\nwhich has not gone down well by other member states.

India’s relations with South East\nAsia (SEA) saw a major boost at the end of the Cold War. India announced a Look East\nPolicy (LEP), which was, at the very best, a circumstantial policy. At the end of the Cold\nWar, India witnessed certain critical circumstances that posed a significant challenge to its\nforeign policy. The Soviet Union disintegrated; Indian economy faced severe crisis while\nPakistan triumphed in the Mujahedeen campaign in Afghanistan. As there was complete\nuncertainty in the world, India decided to reduce this uncertainty and build relations with\nthe US its allies in SEA and East Asia (EA). In this context, India announced its LEP\nwhere the core priority for India was to build relations with the ASEAN. Narasimha Rao\nmade economic cooperation under LEP a major foreign policy priority for India. Starting\nfrom being a Sectoral Dialogue Partner in 1992 to finally concluding an FTA in Goods and\nServices with the ASEAN in 2014, the trajectory captures the impressive integration of\nIndia with the ASEAN.\n\nIndia also forged BIMSTEC and the Mekong Ganga Cooperation as sub-regional\ngroupings to reach out to the ASEAN. In the recent times, India’s Act East Polity (AEP) is\na connecting bridge between India and SEA and EA. The Indian Prime Minister, while\nlaunching the AEP, asserted that the ASEAN is central to India’s AEP. Though the LEP\nbegan with a thrust on economic cooperation with the ASEAN, the AEP has added the\nneeded strategic perspective in the engagement. Today, India is engaging with ASEAN at\nthe levels of security, terrorism, urban renewal, piracy, climate change and so on. The\nIndian participation in the ASEAN Defence Ministers Meeting (ADMM) plus forum\n(comprising of defence ministers of the ASEAN, China, Japan, India, South Korea,\nAustralia, New Zealand, the US and Russia) provides a forum to cooperate on issues\nranging from maritime security to medicine to peacekeeping operations. Under the\nauspices of the ASEAN, India is also engaging with the East Asian Summit (EAS) that\nprovides a platform to work upon issues ranging from education to energy to connectivity.\nThe Indian presence in the ASEAN has now led Indian to negotiate the RCEP where the\nfocus is on trade, facilitation and economic integration. The AEP has announced that\nconnectivity, culture and commerce (3 Cs) shall be priorities for India. The Indo-ASEAN\nrelations still have some constraints. Many ASEAN states feel that trade with India has\nstill not reached its full potential as tariff barriers and bureaucratic delays from the Indian\nside have slowed down the process. The ASEAN states have raised complaints about lack\nof fulfilment of commitments announced by India in infrastructure and connectivity. India\nfaces three key challenges in deepening trade and integration with the ASEAN. The first is\nconnectivity, which the AEP proposes to bridge in the near future. Second are tariff\nbarriers, that ASEAN states cite as a key hindrance on the Indian side to deepening of\ntrade. Third is lack of a vision to boost trade. The ASEAN states argue that India needs to\nprepare a concrete roadmap on how it intends to integrate with the ASEAN states at the\nlevel of trade."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

In 1980s, Zia Ur Rahman, the former Bangladeshi President, came up with an\nidea of knitting the South Asian (SA) states under a group. Initially, India viewed the\nproposal cautiously as it thought that such a body would be used by the SA states as an\nopportunity to resort to India-bashing. India also thought that if it does not accept the\nproposal, this move would be perceived by the SA states as an attempt by India to scuttle a\nmechanism for regional cooperation. India, keeping these concerns aside, in 1985, decided\nto go ahead and join the SAARC. It was formed in 1985 with India, Bangladesh, Bhutan,\nNepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Maldives. In 2007, Afghanistan joined SAARC as a\nmember. The SAARC wanted to promote economic cooperation amongst members and\nhelp each member facilitate economic growth, thereby contributing to the alleviation of\npoverty. Each member state was to respect the territorial integrity of others and no\ninterference would be tolerated in each other’s internal affairs. It was decided by members\nthat SAARC as a forum will not be used by any member to raise any contentious and\nbilateral issues as such issues had to be resolved on a one-to-one basis.\n\nSince the end of the Cold War, there has been a renewed thrust towards regionalism\nbut SA has not witnessed the same despite the presence of SAARC. Many believe that it\nhas ended up in becoming a ‘talk shop’. SAARC has had some achievements—for\ninstance, the states have agreed on a Regional Convention of Suppression of Terrorism;\nthere is a SAARC Audio Visual Programme; in Dhaka, a SAARC Agriculture Information\nCentre exists and the members have agreed upon a social charter for poverty eradication\nand development of human resources. In 1993, the South Asia Preferential Trade\nAgreement was finalised (yet to be operational). The fundamental reason for the weakness\nof the SAARC as a platform is trust deficit amongst its core members. Unresolved border\ndisputes and trade barriers erected by each member state too have contributed to weakness\nof the organisation as a whole, as well as its inability to achieve its goals. Scholars assert\nthat a perpetual cold war between India and Pakistan has fuelled mistrust. For Pakistan,\nKashmir remains an irritant for SAARC to flourish while India cites terrorism sponsored\nby Pakistan as a reason for the mistrust. The member states have viewed the borders more\nas security threats than a conduit for people-centric engagements. As India is one of the\nlargest members of SAARC, other members perceive any initiative by India as an\nintention on India’s part to assert hegemonic ambitions. Such perceptions are further\ncemented because of different political beliefs in the neighbourhood. There are three\nstructural impediments in SAARC. The first flows from the SAARC charter. The charter\nmentions that steps would be taken to promote growth and self-reliance. But the ground\nreality is that these steps have not been institutionalised. Secondly, SAARC has concluded\na lot of agreements and conventions but implementation on ground amongst states has\nbeen poor. Thirdly, SAARC bodies also prevent meaningful interactions as these bodies\nhave not contributed to the removal of suspicion and mistrust.\n\nFor any form of regional cooperation to succeed, there are three necessary conditions\nand some sufficient preconditions. Regional cooperation can be successful if states, first of\nall, renounce violence. This renunciation leads to the birth of a pluralistic, secure\ncommunity. Then, there should be an agreement that no state will question each other’s\nterritorial integrity, as doing so leads to possible conflict. Lastly, if there is a dispute, then\nit needs to be resolved mutually. The Charter of the SAARC has all these three necessary\nconditions. The charter, as mentioned above, asserts that states will not use force, not\n\ninterfere in each other’s affairs and shall advocate for peaceful resolution of conflicts.\nHowever, Pakistan has not commented upon the non-use of force. Pakistan has always\nasserted that if political differences are not resolved (namely, the Kashmir issue), then\nthere can’t be any meaningful cooperation. For Pakistan, SAARC is just another platform\nfor furthering the cause of Kashmir. Despite the 1972 Simla agreement between India and\nPakistan also asserting that the two shall resort to bilateral mechanisms to resolve\ndisputes, Pakistan is often keen on bringing foreign powers into dispute resolution.\n\nGeographically, since the ancient times, there is a belief that South Asia constitutes of\na single compact unit and a common geographical space where people, culture and ideas\nhave freely moved. India has always believed that SAARC, as a platform, can be used to\ngain the erstwhile geographical space and fuse SA yet again into a compact unit. This is\nthe reason why India lays so much emphasis upon connectivity with its neighbours (the\nrecent BBIN-Motor Vehicle agreement is testimony to this). The rest of the South Asian\nstates however perceive it differently. Pakistan feels that the Indus River separated its\nterritory from SA and makes it closer to West Asia. Nepal feels that it has always had a\nseparate existence while Sri Lanka too feels that it has had its own trajectory of historical\nevolution. India’s neighbours find it tough to reinforce the idea of recreating the unity of\npast, favouring instead a unity of equals. It is for this reason that despite SAARC, Pakistan\nand Bangladesh are reluctant to allow their territories as routes for transit. India, through\nSAARC, visualises a homogenisation of the region while the other members see it as\nhegemonisation and resort to measures leading to dehegemonisation. Due to such\ndifferences of perceptions amongst the members of the SAARC, the body has almost been\npushed into a morgue. Many steps were taken by Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh to revive\nthe SAARC, but the perceived mistrust continued to hamper any meaningful interaction\nthough.\n\nThe coming of Modi was seen as positive sign. In his swearing-in ceremony, he\ninvited all the SAARC leaders and tried rehabilitate SAARC relationships. Modi launched\nIndia’s Neighbourhood First Policy in 2014 and SAARC was destined to play a central\nrole in the same. Modi attended the 18\" SAARC summit in Kathmandu, Nepal, in 2014.\nHe asserted that India would take all steps to remove the cynicism and scepticism\nassociated with the SAARC. He proposed that a SAARC Union be formed where there is\nfree flow of trade, people and investments. As things progressed from 2014, the recent\ncross border terrorist strikes on Indian soil from Pakistan in 2016 brought the engagement\nto a halt. The 19\" SAARC summit was scheduled in 2016 in Islamabad. After the attacks\nat Uri in India, India decided to cancel its participation in the Summit. Citing Article X of\nSAARC charter, Pakistan has postponed the SAARC summit. India has also realised that\nits conflicts with Pakistan would remain an obstacle to regional integration. India has thus\nrecognised that it needs to adopt a policy of ‘SAARC Minus one.’ It has spearheaded\nregional integration with like-minded countries. The BBIN-Motor Vehicle Pact, India’s\nthrust to re-energize BIMSTEC and a possibility of a future Bay Bengal Community or\nBOBCOM are shining examples of India’s new ‘SAARC Minus one’ diplomacy. In order\nto ensure that the rest of South Asia and India move ahead, in May 2017, India resorted to\nstratospheric diplomacy and gifted its neighbours a SAARC satellite. In order to ensure\nthat rest of South Asia continues to integrate, we have now started witnessing a new form\nof sub-regional cooperation. This will go a long way in reviving the SAARC once again."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Apart from this, the two other factors that have played an\nimportant role in India’s security policy are British colonial rulers (and their heritage) and\nthe impact of the Partition on India. Nehru certainly has had the biggest imprint on the\nsecurity policy of the initial years. The external threats for India have remained the same\nover time while the internal threats have evolved as a part of our unfolding political\ndiscourse. At the external level, an important threat to India is that of Pakistan. India has\nfought four wars with Pakistan (1948, 1965, 1971 and 1999). Since the 1980s, Pakistan\nhas resorted to asymmetric warfare in Kashmir. However, since Pakistan has now acquired\nnuclear weapons, the possibility of a full-fledged war has diminished because both are\nnuclear players. Pakistan has resorted to limited incursions in the past few decades. This\nkind of limited incursions are visible all over and a classical case is that of the Kargil War\nof 1999. India has always tried to engage with Pakistan through dialogue despite the 2001\nParliament attack and 2008 Mumbai attacks. However, the rapprochement has been\nseverely affected due to the ongoing limited war.\n\nTo understand India’s national security, we also have to understand the concept of\nNational Interests. The origin of the term national interests goes back to the 16\" and 17°\n\ncentury. Charles Beard has studied the history of the concept in his book- The idea of\nnational interests. He asserts that the idea of national interests emerged parallel to the idea\nof nation states. The older terms like ‘will of the Prince’ were now replaced with terms\nlike vital interests and national interests. Such terms were able to mobilize the will of the\npublic very effectively. A scholar named Joseph Frankel also agrees that the origin of\nnational interests goes back to the period of the 16* century. He asserts that the ancient\nGreek city states confused politics and metaphysics. Such confusion prevented the origin\nof the concept of national interests in the ancient times. In the medieval times, the world\nwas majorly feudalistic. That kind of world again prevented the rise of the concept. In the\n21\" century today, though the term national interest has become very fashionable, still,\nthere is no global consensus on an exact definition for the same. For India, its national\ninterests are the core values of the Indian society. India’s national interests include the\nwelfare of Indian people, protection of its political beliefs and its national way of life.\nIndia’s national interest is its self-preservation. India intends to achieve these national\ninterests through maintenance of territorial integrity. Today India witnesses conventional\nand sub-conventional threats that have slowed down its economic growth. India however\nknows that to maintain territorial integrity, a dominant defense force is required. The\ndefense forces of India have tackled the proxy wars (from Pakistan) and other external\nthreats and insurgencies. However, India still lacks a coherent defense and a security\nstrategy or a policy document. There are two reasons why India’s National Security\nstrategy document is missing. Firstly, in India there is a lack of consensus at the political\nlevel on what exactly are the internal and external threats India witnesses. Secondly, the\ngovernment is unable to develop a coherent strategy to address the core security problems.\nThus, it clearly reflects that the core problem is a lack of consensus on what exactly\nconstitutes problems in national security. Keeping in mind this, we have to remember that\nthe 21* century has changed the concept of war. Now full-scale wars are unlikely to\nhappen. A new dimension of war in the 21\" century is limited, intense and short wars that\nwill involve all dimensions from air, land, water, space, cyberspace, electro-magnetic\nspectrum to psychological war. India needs to gear up to these challenges as it is\nwitnessing such conflicts. The recent India-China stand-off in Doklam is a classical\nexample of psychological war.\n\nIn the recent times, with the coming of the new government in 2014 in India, a full\ndiplomatic outreach was envisaged to open talks again but the Pathankot air base attack in\nJanuary, 2016 and the June, 2016 Pampore attack have once again stalled talks. In\nSeptember, 2016, Pakistan again violated ceasefire and attacked a base of army soldiers in\nUri. As a consequence of Uri attack, India decided to cancel any ongoing talks with\nPakistan. The Indian government also announced the decision to isolate Pakistan globally.\nIndia used the UN General Assembly platform to condemn Pakistan for sponsoring\nterrorism. In the General Assembly debate in September 2016, India highlighted the role\nof Pakistan in sponsoring terrorism and also branded it as a state trying to destabilise\nSouth Asia. India also presented the human rights violation undertaken by Pakistan in the\nBaluchistan region of Pakistan at the UN. Due to the Uri attack, India also conveyed its\ndecision of its refusal to participate in the SAARC summit in Pakistan in November, 2016.\nAs a response to the Uri attack, on 29\" September 2016, the Indian army retaliated against\nPakistan by crossing over the Line of Control and carrying out a surgical strike using the\nspecial para forces of the army inside the Pakistani territory to eliminate the terror launch\n\npads on the other side of the Line of Control. This is the first time since 1971 that the\nIndian army had crossed the LOC to carry out a surgical strike in Pakistan occupied\nKashmir (POK) region. This has gone on to add a new dimension in the management of\nPakistan.\n\nIn the security policy of India, China is widely recognised as our second external\nthreat after Pakistan. India, after independence, initially did not perceive China as a threat.\nDuring the Nehruvian era, India focused on rapprochement but 1962 changed the equation\nbetween the neighbours. Subsequently, in 1963, Pakistan also gave a territorial chunk of\nPakistan occupied Kashmir (POK) to China, which led to the formation of a new Sino-\nPak axis becoming a threat to India. From 1964, as China tested nuclear weapons, these\nnuclear weapons of China pulsated as a new threat to India. India and China have tried to\nresolve border problems without any success till date. China also continues to deepen\nengagement with Pakistan through its One Belt One Road’ initiative and String of Pearls’\nStrategy. China also continues probing operations on the border and to raise issues with\nIndia due to its having granted Dalai Lama sanctuary. It also refuses to reconcile India’s\nstatus of a nuclear weapon state.\n\nDomestically, India has firstly witnessed insurgency in the North East and\nsecessionist movements in Punjab. While the problem related to the North Eastern states\nhas been brought under control to some extent through concessions and dialogues, the\nPunjab problem needed military intervention. India, at the domestic level, has also\nwitnessed Maoism owing origin to land appropriation issues. Over a period of time,\nNaxalism has become one the biggest internal security threat for India. Evidence has also\nbeen found pointing to state sponsored violence by Pakistan in an attempt to cause social\nunrest in India.\n\nIndia has, over a period of time, built up human and material capabilities. At the\nhuman resource level, India has a superior military and a paramilitary force. The\nsuperiority can be judged by the fact that India provides military training to a host of\nnations in the world. At the level of material capabilities, the dependence upon foreign\nsuppliers is high and domestic indigenous production capability is relatively slow. More\nattention needs to be paid on domestic military industrial complexes.\n\nTo tackle China, India’s national security strategy is to create deterrence through\ndenial. India has deployed trained and specialised mountain personnel along the entire\nborder with China. It has upgraded road and other military infrastructure to establish a\nbase. For instance, India has upgraded an Airstrip in Tezpur, Assam, enabling take off and\nlandings of Sukhoi Su-30, a twin-engine, two-seat super manoeuvrable fighter aircraft that\nIndia imports from Russia. A 90,000 strong mountain strike corps are stationed in the\nregion. In August, 2016, the NDA government had given a green signal to the deployment\nof Brahmos missiles in the Indian North Eastern region. All these initiatives are planned to\nensure denial through deterrence. For effective deterrence, India has invested in long range\nmissiles to project power. The competition from China in the Himalayas is weak and is\nnow emerging at new places. The new theatre of action is maritime conflict in the Indian\nOcean where China, through the maritime Silk Road initiative, is increasing military and\nnaval presence and building up economic cum security ties in the region. India’s response\nto the naval assertion by China is to nurture closer cooperation with the US, Mauritius,\n\nSeychelles, Japan, and so on. This newfound naval cooperation with Africa under the\ntubric of Blue Economy of India gives India the needed muscle. India has also deployed\nits navy with Vietnam in South China Sea for protection of sea lanes of communication\n(SLOC), denying China any space for assertion. This it is another form of denial exercised\nby India. To tackle the external threats from China, India needs to develop a strong naval\nstrength. A strong navy can not only browbeat China, but also act as a strong deterrent.\nIndia has to remember that its security horizon extends from the Strait of Malacca to\nHormuz. USA has a strong naval presence in the Middle East but the persistent Shia-Sunni\nconflict in the region has made it more volatile. Due to the shale gas revolution, USA’s\npresence in the Middle East will decline. This gives India an opportunity to extend its\numbrella to provide security. For this, a strong navy is mandatory. The growing India-US\nproximity has created a perception in China that USA could use India as a Pivot to contain\nChina. Thus, China has been compelled to economically engage with India. But, the\nChinese economic engagement is based on a belief that India favors status quo at the\nborder level. India has to assert to China that it will not be enmeshed with the economic\nlogic of boosting trade at the cost of tranquility at the border. India has to convey a strong\nwillingness to resolve the pending border dispute. In the wake of recent Doklam crises,\nIndia needs to develop critical military infrastructure at the border level on the immediate\nbasis.\n\nAt the level of Pakistan, despite overwhelming evidence of Pakistani state\ninvolvement in terror strikes on Indian soil, India has managed to stave off an all-out war\nand instead use diplomatic channels to undertake dialogue. In 2013, when Nawaz Sharif\nwas elected, hopes of dialogue increased. But in Pakistan, the military continues to\ndominate the foreign and security policy and does not favour balance in Indo—Pakistan\nrelations. However, the asymmetric military capabilities of Pakistan at present and its\ninability to match the military capabilities with India in the future acts as a source of\nfrustration for Pakistan. This asymmetry has caused insecurity in the Pakistani military,\nwhich sponsors terrorism and uses terrorist groups as proxies against India. India\ncontinues to remain vulnerable through costal and border levels with Pakistan—gaps from\nwhere terrorists usually infiltrate. India does not resort to a retaliatory strike strategy or\neven a pre-emptive strategy for Pakistan as the basic criterion of the Indian national\nsecurity doctrine is to negotiate with Pakistan through dialogue. Moreover, Pakistan has\nstated clearly that if India resorts to conventional attacks, Pakistan would resort to nuclear\nescalation. This is the reason India invests in ballistic missile defence capabilities to stop\nany nuclear escalation.\n\nAt the international level, India still does not aggressively try to build alliances with\nthe US. One reason is that, despite India’s pointing out of evidence of Pakistani\ninvolvement in symmetric warfare against India, the US continues to engage with\nPakistan. This confuses the Indian National security apparatus as to whether there is at all\ngenuine interest from the US in the matters of any potential strategic cooperation. To that\nextent, however, the recent deepening of Indo-US cooperation signifies US acceptance of\nIndia as a strategic hedge against China.\n\nOur national security doctrine, as clear from the discussion in the chapter, is a mixed\nbag. There is an absence of coherence in strategy as different approaches are used against\ndifferent threats. India certainly needs a more coherent doctrine for future."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The strategy underlines China's\npush to take a larger role in global affairs, and the desire to coordinate manufacturing capacity with other countries in\nareas such as steel manufacturing. It was unveiled in September and October 2013 in announcements revealing the\nSREB and MSR, respectively. It was also promoted by Premier Li Keqiang during the State visit in Asia and Europe.

It has recently established military bases in Africa. China asserts that the bases\nare to assist China in recuperating and seeking supplies. China has realized that to\nbecome a leading maritime power, it has to establish a firm position in the IO. This\napproach of China has alarmed the strategists in India who feel that a rising Chinese\nnaval presence in IO could lead to a new security dilemma between India and China.\nJohn. F. Morton in his study has asserted that IO will remain the most significant\nregion in the world in the times ahead due to economic growth in the rim states and\nrising demand of oil.\n\nThe importance of Indian Ocean for India can be judged from the points below.\n\n1. India’s half seaborne global trade happens through the 10.\n\n2. Nearly 65% of world’s oil is located in the IO.\n\n3. Nearly 35% of global gas reserves are located in the littoral states of the 10.\n\n4. Instability in the Middle East to Piracy in Africa and rising competitive pressures\nto fuel economic growth by demand of oil.\n\n5. Nearly 90% of India’s global trade happens through the IO.\n\nAs the Indian economy grows, India would need to ensure unhindered access of\nenergy and goods from the region. India’s entire developmental process depends\nupon the region of IO.\n\nTo tackle threats ranging from piracy to terrorism arising from the sea, India has\ndecided to exert more influence in the IO. Indian strategists have asserted that IO is\nIndia’s backyard and Indians draw inspiration to assert in the IO from Alfred Mahan.\nMahan asserted that which ever power controls IO would eventually maintain\nhegemony in Asia. K.M. Pannikar too asserted the need for India to be dominant in\n10. Even though there has been an intellectual consensus of India’s role in the IO, the\ncivilian political leadership in the post independent India have not adequately\nresponded to make India a predominant maritime power. In the initial years, the focus\nof India was to tackle territorial threats from Pakistan and China. The naval\nmodernization got majorly neglected. India was unable to equip the navy with the\nneeded offensive punch to project power. Throughout the Cold War, Indian strategy\nwas to push out extra regional naval powers from IO and ensure that IO remains a\n‘zone of peace’. This made India’s littoral neighbors quite apprehensive about India\nas they perceived that India’s behavior is in sync with its own intention to dominate\nthe IO region. Since the end of Cold War, India has recognized the importance of\nnaval modernization and naval power projection. In the recent times, India’s desire to\nmodernize its navy is also driven by threat assessments done by R&AW which\nasserts that India could witness sea borne attacks by terrorists. Keeping these\nchallenges in mind, India has announced its own version of maritime doctrine. The\ndoctrine asserts that India must look at the naval security as an arc extending from the\nGulf to Malacca as an area of legitimate interests. India has embarked upon an\nattempt to enhance naval capabilities to achieve the objectives said above. China in\n2006 in a Defense White Paper has announced that Chinese needs to enhance their\ndefensive and offensive naval capabilities to maintain strategic depth in the IO. Thus,\nfor India, China remains the biggest competitor in the IO. China is preparing its navy\nto assert itself as a regional hegemon and a future superpower. China is driven by an\nurge to assert to India that it needs to remember that IO cannot be a backyard of\nIndia.\n\nChina is trying to tell India that it also has a responsibility to ensure a stable,\npeaceful and a secure IO. China has established a submarine base in Sanya in South\nChina Sea. The Sanya base has underground tunnels to hide submarines and is\nmerely 1200 nautical miles away from Malacca waterway. The Indian strategists feel\nthat the base in Sanya is an attempt by China to consolidate its presence and control\nin the Indian Ocean and may restrict the Indian freedom to maneuver in the region. A\nrecent attempt by China to boost its presence in the IO can be seen in the Chinese\n\nattempt to construct the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. All these, along with\nChinese strategy of String of Pearls have affirmed to India that China is making all\nattempts to control the global energy jugular. India has decided to respond to China\nthrough a trinity strategy. India has firstly started undertaking naval modernization.\nThis is an attempt by India to enhance its naval capabilities. Secondly, India has\nstarted using its navy as a tool of diplomacy. India is diplomatically undertaking joint\nnaval exercises and port visits to friendly states. Thirdly, India has positioned its navy\nas an effective tool to provide instant disaster relief missions. This trinity strategy is\nadopted by India to position itself as a Net Security Provider in the IO region. India\nhas joined hands with USA, Japan and Australia to shape up the strategic\nenvironment of the Indian Ocean in the near future. Doing all this is likely to position\nIndia as a medium power. A medium power is one that has a great economic potential\nwith rising military potential. The situation of 21\" Century in the IO of power\ncompetition between India and China is akin to 20\" Century power competition\nbetween the US and Japan in the Pacific."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

However, Kashmir\npractices a distinct form of Islamic culture that is quite different from the Pakistani\npropagated Islamic culture. The blend of Islam in Kashmir is called Kashmiriyat that\naccepts all religions along with Islam. The strategy adopted by Pakistan is to destroy\nthis Kashmiriyat and impose a Saudi funded fundamentalist Wahabi Islam. Pakistan\nintends to polarize the society and exclude other faiths and thereby eventually break\nup Kashmir. Pakistan has received initial success by driving out Kashmiri Pandits.\nWajahat Habbibullah asserts that India too has focused less on the demands of the\nKashmiri people and has been more reactive than being proactive. Though Pakistan\nhas tried to undertake polarization, but, the polarization strategy of Pakistan has not\nmet with much success as Kashmiri people have rejected the Pakistan attempts to\npolarize Kashmir. Since 2014, the Indian government has adopted a hardline\napproach. This has led to elimination of many prominent militant heads. Though\nPakistan does enjoy a limited constituency of support in Kashmir through the\nseparatists.

Pakistan continues to use the nuclear bogey with India\n7. Pakistan continues to internationalize the Kashmir dispute\n8. Pakistan wants to alienate Kashmiri people from India\nTo tackle the external threats from Pakistan, India needs to establish a coherent\nstrategy with the following points below.\n1. The government needs to ensure that all intellectuals, officials and politicians are\nput on the same footing with respect to the issue and speak the same language\nensuring a common intellectual understanding.\n2. A separate ministry of J&K affairs to manage issues can be established.\n3. A strong surveillance needs to be done by Intelligence Bureau on the separatist\nleaders and their source of financing to ensure Pakistan does not support them to\ncause street violence.\n4. India should continue to engage with civilian leadership of Pakistan with an\nintention to reduce the influence of Pakistani army in India-Pakistan relationship\n5. India should use ‘hit to hurt’ policy at the Line of Control for any Pakistan\nsponsored terror attacks on the Indian soil.\n6. India should carry out covert operations in Pakistan to eliminate heads of Lashkar\nand other terror groups.\nSome specific points need to be kept in mind while tackling Kashmir problem.\n= Kashmiri people are very sensitive. There is a need to adopt a therapeutic\napproach. The Kashmiri people have witnessed a lot of trauma due to ongoing\ncrises since 2016. There needs to be a healing therapy.\nm= The government can establish an interactive forum to bring together all the\nsegments of multilayered Kashmiri society.\nm@ The PDP party favors soft separatism. It means that they allow opposition\nforces to voice their concerns. The separatists should be encouraged to come\nwithin the democratic mainstream. Dialogue is the only way out.\n@ At the administrative level, the government needs to focus of job creation and\nhorticulture sector. The horticulture sector, which is the mainstay of the\neconomy, has been damaged due to instances of insecticide strains.\nm The government also has to address the issues related to missing persons.\nEvery month, on the 10°, the Association of Parents of Disappeared Persons\nholds meetings. After proper investigations, the issues pertaining to missing\npersons needs to be closed. Such meetings don’t allow the wounds to heal.\n@ At the law and order level, there is a need to keep a watch on the usage of\n\nTrack-2 funds used by R&AW and IB.\n\nm The security forces need to be more proactive with sadbhavna (perception\nmanagement) programs.\n\nm The government, in collaboration with the civil society, needs to initiate a\ncounter narrative campaign to de-radicalize the youth"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The strength of geo-economic influence, which today, is exerted\nthrough diplomacy, was, in the 20° century, exerted through the practices of colonialism\nand imperialism, achieved by military force. India, however, has always treated economic\nand military diplomacy separately. We have never perceived military diplomacy as a tool\nof foreign policy despite it having helped us at various times to achieve foreign policy\ngoals. India has already used its military forces in the UN peace keeping missions for\npromoting peace and international security as envisaged by the Indian Constitution under\nArticle 51, and has even, at times, used air power and naval power when needed. Several\npowerful states actually actively use military power as foreign policy intervention—for\ninstance, the US has used air power in combat and non-combat roles to supplement US\nforeign policy goals.

As China and Pakistan continue to deepen their\nengagement, India needs strategies to checkmate China, and it is at this level that maritime\nforeign policy strategy is necessary. India can leverage its position in the Indian Ocean and\nits good relations with the South East Asian States and Africa to undertake maritime\nassertion. The significance of Indian Ocean rises for China as it trades with Afghanistan,\nMiddle East, and Africa and Central Asia. The more resources China gets from these\nregions, the more trade happens via the Indian Ocean route, which may emerge in future\nas a new theatre of conflict. As Chinese ships doing maritime commerce pass through\nstraits of Malacca, this is also the coordinate for India to have an assertive presence.\n\nThe Strait of Malacca connects Indian Ocean (IO) to South China Sea and is 900 km\nin length and is also a prominent trade route between East Asia and West Asia-Europe. A\n\nconsiderable quantity of oil passes through this region. The problem of piracy in the\nMalaccan Strait is rampant but aggressive patrolling along the region has ensured\nreduction in incidents. India, since 2006, is instrumental in fighting piracy here. Since\nAndaman and Nicobar islands are close by, the Indian navy has built an unnamed aerial\nvehicle patrolling base. The Chinese look at the Strait of Malacca as the ‘Malacca\ndilemma’ as majority of oil for China comes via this region. The Strait of Malacca is the\nking of the Indian maritime chessboard.\n\nWhen India became independent, it extended sovereign rights over the continental\nshelf without mentioning the depth or distance of the territories. Gradually by 1956, it\nclaimed a ‘fisheries zone’ upto 100 miles away of territorial waters. At the international\nlevel, the US and the USSR were negotiating the width of territorial waters but were not\nable to reach consensus. In 1958, the first UNCLOS meeting adopted a codified law called\nthe Geneva Convention, which accepted freedom of navigation of the seas and sovereignty\nof a state in territorial sea. It worked to adopt immigration rights for contiguous zones but\nthe first UNCLOS could not evolve consensus on the issues regarding the width of\nterritorial waters and economic fisheries zones. In 1960, the second meet of UNCLOS was\nheld, in which there evolved the idea of having territorial waters up to six miles. It was\nalso proposed that an additional six miles beyond territorial waters be considered as\neconomic fisheries zone, but a two-third majority could not emerge and eventually this\nidea failed once again.\n\nIn the first UNCLOS meeting, India proposed that any warship should get\nauthorisation from the state. There was no consensus on this issue in the UNCLOS\nmeeting and the proposal, therefore, could not be added. Consequently, India refused to\nratify the Geneva Convention, which emerged after first UNCLOS meet. In 1967, as\nPakistan extended its territorial waters from three to twelve nautical miles, India also did\nthe same on 12* September, in the same year. During the 1960s, as the technologies\nprogressed, the nations began to use modern technology to explore oil and gas in the sea\nbed. This advancement in seabed technology led the countries to take steps to safeguard\ntheir interests. Some advanced nations deployed submissions with ballistic missiles. This\ncompelled the UN to find a solution. In 1968, the General Assembly established a Seabed\nCommission of 42 UN members to discuss how nations can peacefully use the seabed. In\n1970, a Declaration of Principles was accepted whereby the areas of seabed and resources\nin the seabed were to be considered the common heritage of humanity and the seabed and\nresources were declared to be subject to a global regime through a treaty. This was the\ntime when the Indian government had authorised the mining of polymetallic modules from\nthe seabed and had also discovered oil and gas in Bombay and Andaman Islands. On 25*\nAugust 1976, India passed the Maritime Zones Act. The act stated that upto 12 nautical\nmiles would be territorial waters, 24 NM would be contiguous zone and upto 200 NM\nwould be EEZ and to enforce its compliance, the government established coast guard as an\narmed force of the Union of India in 1978. The Indian coast guard was to enforce the act\nand assist the fishermen in distress, in addition to providing back upto customs in anti-\nsmuggling activities and prevention of marine pollution.\n\nIn 1973, at the global level, began the third meeting of UNCLOS or UNCLOS-3.\nIndia participated in UNCLOS-3 and proposed ‘Freedom of Navigation’ and free mobility\nof naval ships. It also advocated the idea that Andaman and Nicobar Islands be declared as\n\narchipelago islets. India further advocated division of waters as per its own maritime zone\nact. The UNCLOS-3, after negotiating for nine years, adopted the draft of UNCLOS in\n1982. It adopted five zones, as given in the table below:\n\ncme Jove etna\n\nInternal waters Within Full sovereignty Law and order agencies\nSistine 0to12NM_ Full sovereignty Lie pelleagwilens\n3. Contiguous 12-24NM _ Full sovereignty Coast guand, customs _\nGb po re paar ee angel LRT EINE)\n\n5. High seas of NM Open zone x\n\nIndia was included as a pioneer investor for seabed mining. Most of what India\nadvocated was agreed in the UNCLOS-3 declaration. But there was an opposition to the\nidea of notifications being needed by foreign warships in the territorial waters of a foreign\nstate. Moreover, Andaman was not accorded the status of an archipelago as UNCLOS-3\ngranted the status only to those islets which had a distinct political entity. This was done to\nensure that off-lying islets are not used by states to restrict freedom of navigation. The\nUNCLOS-3 also held that 500 metres around any artificial island should be a safety zone.\nIndia’s proposal for a bigger buffer area was not accepted. India has, since then, peacefully\nconcluded agreements with Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand and\nMaldives and Indonesia over a period of time.\n\nThe region of Asia Pacific played an important part in the Cold War due to strategic\nformation of alliances. The post-Cold War period saw a rise of the Indo-Pacific, which\nwas known in the west as Asia-Pacific. After the Cold War ended, as Asian economies\nbegan to rise, the new geopolitical term used for the region changed to Indo-Pacific. Over\na period of time, the dependence of the US on oil from west Asia declined and with\ndiscovery of shale it is bound to decline further. The US has realised the need to focus on\ndomestic shale rather than imported oil, but continues its presence in Indian Ocean with a\nnew priority.\n\nThe US considers the Indo-Pacific as a strategic region and India a lynchpin in the\nscheme. Meanwhile, the ASEAN security community aims to establish peace and a just\norder and ensure that all members are at harmony with each other and the world. With\n\nrising Chinese assertion in South China Sea and defiance of China of the international\ntribunal’s award over South China Sea dispute between China and Philippines in July\n2016, the significance of ASEAN security community will rise. In 1991, the ASEAN\nRegional Forum was established, with India as its member. The forum assists the ASEAN\nsecurity community. India is increasing its role in the ASEAN and has deepened\nengagement with its neighbours under the Act East Policy, while attempting to make its\npresence being felt deeply in the region.\n\nIn 1995, India undertook the MILAN exercises in the region. China is not a part of\nMILAN but it has other 17 nations from the Asia-Pacific. The aim of MILAN, undertaken\nby the navies collectively at Port Blair, is to gather and learn from each other about\nstrategies for combating piracy and drug trafficking. This platform enables India to\nexplore its power projection capabilities in collaboration with others. India, in 2008,\norganised the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium (IONS). It is a forum where littoral states\nof the Indian Ocean come together to discuss regional maritime issues. As of now, 28\nstates are a part of IONS. Since 1992, Malabar exercise has been undertaken between\nIndia and the US at different locations in the world. India’s cooperation with Singapore\ntakes the form of a bilateral joint exercise called SIBMEX (Singapore-India Bilateral\nMaritime Exercise). Due to India’s warm and cordial relations with Japan, the JIMEX\n(Japan-India Maritime Exercise) has also been held since 2012.\n\nSIBMEX = MILAN\nJIMEX~ f\n\n_» MALABAR\n\nJoint Anti-Piracy |\n\nOperations ~* Bilateral Maritime\n\nagreements"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The Indian Prime Ministers at the helm have had a deep imprint in moulding\nthe IFEP. The national leaders ended up creating and evolving the present IFEP by\nanalysing the interaction of economic actors and politics. As the state of India progressed\ndomestically, its interaction with its external environment increased, leading to several\nencounters that left an imprint on its economic foreign policy.\n\nIndia deepens ties with Russia\n~~ Economically engages with Russia\n\nPeriod of limited\n\nglobal experience * Paese® = (1907) Realisation of weakness\nIndia engages ; 4 of import substitution\nwith US and USSR > Phase-1 = _ Phase-3 = Uneot\n\n“ (194767) ” (1975-90)\n\nAim was to get support ¢ J global engagement\n\nfor import substitution '\nPhase-4 = (1990 till now)\n\nIndia begins globalisation - ~» Embedded liberalism (term used by Ruggie)\n\nBefore we attempt our study of IFEP, we must understand how ideas and the state\ninteract to create economic leverage. A state develops certain national interests, which\nmust necessarily include an economic component, depending upon the present\ncircumstances of the state’s domestic affairs. For instance, when India became\nindependent, the domestic principle in our state made it mandatory to opt for a closed\neconomy and undertake import substitution. This idea of this domestic economic\nparadigm continued till 1975. However, by 1975, it was clear that the results of this\nstrategy of import substitution was not what India had envisaged for itself. Consequently,\nthe idea from 1975 to 1990 was to adopt an export-led growth strategy. This period was\nfollowed by an opening of Indian economy to complete the cycle of integration with the\nworld. Thus, state policy architecture and its ideas shall always dominate economic\nforeign policy at all times.\n\nIn India, change in the economic paradigm is brought about by ideas and crises. In\n\n1991, by when import substitution strategy had clearly failed to bear fruit, the Balance of\nPayments (BOP) crises paved way for a change to export oriented liberalisation and\nglobalisation-based strategy.\n\nCrises occur and State acts in\nidea Feeds to the politics uses external autonomy without\ndominates Political class pressure for own favours external pressures\no——_e—0-__8__ 0 _e—_#®\n\nTechnocrats Politics believes Changes occur\ncapture in the ideas but\n\ntakes no external\n\nPressure to change\n\nThus, if we need to understand the interests of the Indian state, we need to perceive\nthe core ideas of the state that are dominating at the moment. Secondly, the Indian state\nexpresses a unique behaviour of getting from the world what they need on the basis of the\nideas/goals they have set for themselves. When the Indian state adopted closed economic\nmodel, it exploited the global actors to get resources for its import substitution model.\nWhen, in 1990s, it adopted globalisation, it advocated for investment, heavily promoting\nsympathy for its own concerns.\n\nNow, let us try to apply the logic derived above in the four phases outlined further\nahead."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The\nstate pursued the ideology of non-alignment and import substitution. The idea was to\nmaintain independence in foreign policy decision making and have engagement with those\nwho can support us in import substitution. India engaged with both the US and the USSR\nin this regard. Both nations, in different ways, supported import substitution.\n\nPro-private sector ar Mined economy\n\nPro-state intervention\n\nAfter the death of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in 1950, Nehru took the decision to\nincline the Indian state towards state intervention. The Second Five Year plan in India and\nthe passage of the Industrial Development and Regulation Act 1958 laid the foundation of\nimport substitution and a closed economy. As the idea of import substitution dominated,\ndespite multiple ups and downs, ideational changes were not entertained. For instance,\nafter the Second Five Year Plan was launched in 1956, a BOP crisis emerged. India still\nresorted to channelling resources to sustain the plan that posed challenges to an open\neconomy. The World Bank tried to push India to undertake liberalisation, but India\nresorted to even more import substitution after 1966. Since the dominant idea behind this\n\npolicy was not unjust, India did not displease any power between 1950 to 1955.\n\nThe US, in fact, provided 500 million dollars in aid to India in that period. Nikita\nKhrushchev, who visited India in 1955 and appreciated its Second Five Year Plan,\nannounced an aid for heavy industrial development. The USSR also provided assistance\nfor the Bhillai Steel Plant. Perceiving the strong USSR support to India, the US began to\nfear that India might be sorely tempted to join the Soviet Camp, and consequently, from\n1957 onwards, it increased its aid to India. In 1960, the US provided 800 million dollars in\naid and low-priced wheat under PL-480 for tackling food shortages in India. As wheat\ncame under PL-480, it eased out immediate shortage concerns we had but the bigger issue\nwas that India had neglected its agriculture and had inclined too much towards rapid\nindustrialisation.\n\nThe decade of 1960s did not augur well for India. The war of 1962, then of 1965\nwere followed by successive droughts in India. Perceiving the dire situation, the US began\nto use aid levers to push India to open its economy. The US not only urged India to open\nits economy but also to increase spending in agriculture and undertake a devaluation of its\ncurrency. India perceived it as interference deemed that the idea of US to open Indian\neconomy was not a best choice at that moment. It did, however, found the idea to increase\nspending in agriculture to mitigate drought and establish balance between agriculture and\nindustry to be profoundly logical, and therefore continued with import substitution with a\nfocus on agriculture. India laid the foundation for Green Revolution to achieve self-\nsufficiency in agriculture. Thus, this phase proves what we observed earlier. Only when\nIndia is convinced of the total failure of an existing policy does it bring change, else the\nidea continues."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The collaboration\nbetween domestic bureaucracy, foreign policy practitioners and political executives began\nto give shape to the strategies to achieve India’s energy security. To achieve energy\nsecurity, the government has adopted diversification of energy supplies as a primary\npolicy. It has also resorted to the use of Indian firms, including the PSU ONGC Videsh\nLimited (OVL) to invest in overseas oil and gas ventures.\n\nThe oil policy India followed after it became independent was based on its colonial\nlegacy. The imprint of British policy was at its maximum on oil policy. The oil that used to\ncome to India also controlled by the US firms Caltex and Standard Vacuum. During this\nperiod, a majority of the refineries were owned by western firms and oil to these refineries\ncame from Iran, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Kuwait. From the 1960s, India established\ninstitutions for a socialist economy and developed proximity to the USSR, which led to a\n\nchange in its oil policy. India had issues with foreign refineries and suppliers. As per a\ncontract with the USSR in 1960, India imported Russian oil. The Indian government\ndecided to build PSU refineries with help from the USSR and Romania, and signed\nRupee—Ruble agreement for payments.\n\nThe western companies were not allowed to increase their influence and expand in\nIndia and 1976, the Indian government succeeded in nationalising of Burmah—Shell and\nCaltex, thus ending the reliance on western firms. India also began to continue oil imports\nfrom the USSR and West Asia. As the Cold War ended, India opted for a liberalised and\nopen economy and began needing more resources as its domestic consumption began to\nincrease. Consequently, India began to import oil from Africa and South East Asia. To\nenhance energy security, OVL was given permission to purchase assets abroad to\nundertake oil exploration. The OVL began to become prominent in Sudan, Vietnam and\nSakhalin. An aggressive Indian diplomacy, coupled with support from political executives\nand domestic bureaucracy began to secure energy for India. The OVL today has\nexploration and oil development going on in Libya, East Timor, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Nigeria\nand Brazil. The OVL also competes with China in bids internationally. Good historical\nrelations between India and a majority of these countries worked in India’s favour. In\n2006, India signed an agreement with China where both have decided to not to compete\nbut cooperate in overseas oil asset acquisition. There has been an extension of diplomatic\noutreach to all oil producing nations by India. However, at times, due to limited resources\nand delayed government response, the OVL loses bids to others, otherwise having\nachieved tremendous success. India, in recent times, has also taken steps to emerge as a\nnet exporter of petro products by augmenting oil refining infrastructure in its territory.\nThis helps save foreign exchange and boost petro product exports. Shall has emerged as a\nnew resource in India’s energy security matrix and India has decided to import it from US.\n\n_ Myanmar—China pipeline\nfe} Russia—Kazakhstan-Iran pipeline\ny,\n\nio™\nVa\n\\\nSakhalin-Korea— St Asian Gas\\\nChina pipeline_ e Grid\nUzbekistan—Turkmenistan— ~ Ou. been\n‘Azerbaijan IPI pipeline\nInvest in downstream\nrefineries Long Term LNG contracts\n\\ raf\n\n\\ Z\n\n- Acquisition of overseas oil assets\n\n™.

India has been dependent upon foreign suppliers for gas. It imports gas\nas LNG while the Department of Atomic energy makes efforts in indigenous production in\nthe field of nuclear energy. Canadian-Indian Reactor Uranium System (CIRUS) and\nCANada Deuterium Uranium (CANDU) dominated the initial years of Indian nuclear\nresearch. After India’s Pokhran-1 testing in 1947, the NSG and NPT created embargos of\nany foreign supplies to India. For the Tarapur plant, however, the US continued its support\ntill 1982 and the French agreed to supply fuel beyond 1982. China and Russia supplied\nfuel for Tarapur till 2001. In 1988, Russia also decided to agree to supply India with two\n1000 Mega waltz Light Water reactors but Russia’s collapse in 1989 prevented the\nagreement from materialising. The agreement was finally executed in 1998 and rector\nconstruction began in 2002 and finished by 2012. Due to the testing of Pokhran-I and II,\nthe embargos were still in place and India was prohibited to import Uranium. The\ndomestic nuclear programme, therefore, could not achieve its aims. In 2005, as the US—\nIndia nuclear deal progressed, the embargo was lifted and NSG trade restrictions came off\nin 2008. Since then, the doors of nuclear commerce have been open for India.\n\nEnhance military profile\nin West, Central Asia and\nIndian ocean"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Immigration is when a person comes to a foreign\ncountry as a permanent resident. Emigration is the act of settling in another country away\nfrom the home country. As per the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999, a Non-\nResidential Indian (NRJ) is a person who has an Indian passport but stays outside India\n\nfor business, employment, vocation for more than 182 days in a year. A Person of Indian\nOrigin (PIO) is one whose parents or grandparents were Indian citizens by virtue of\nnaturalisation. If an Indian citizen marries a foreign citizen, the foreign citizen married to\nthe Indian citizen shall also be hold the status of a PIO. The indentured labourers taken by\nthe British to foreign states from India settled in those lands and their off springs in\nsubsequent generations are now known as PIOs. If an NRI becomes a citizen of another\ncountry, he will hold the status of a PIO. A Person Resident in India (PRI) is an Indian\ncitizen who is a citizen of India but may go abroad for a certain period for education\npurpose or medical treatments.\n\nThe entire phenomenon of human migration is presently captured in a term called\n‘Diaspora’. Diaspora originates from a Greek word that meant scattering or dispersion (of\nseeds). It was first used in the 6* century BC to explain the Jewish exile from Babylon and\nlater to describe the population of Jews living outside Palestine. Diaspora therefore\nsignifies a movement and a spread of people outside their homeland. Earlier, such\nmigration used to be in search of food, shelter and resources. In the post-World War-II\nperiod, the migration was brought about with the movement of labour to the industrialised\ncountries for jobs, and in search for better quality of life. The most recent trend of\nmigration is influenced by globalisation and the demand of skilled expertise as well as\nlarge scale political instability in certain regions of the world which occasions frequent\nrefugee crises.\n\nDesirable commitment restoration\nof hometand 7 = Dispersion trom home land\nRealised wish to return to tho homeland ~ CED = Rotention of collective momory\n‘Continuous links with the homeland ~ ~ Partial assimilation of a person in\nhost society\nMaintains cultural traditions - Maintains tamity tradition\n\n+ Integrates culturally to host countries\n= Well aware of the indian origin.\n™ Influences host stata in lobbying for homeland\n\nwhen abroad ~\n‘Tako as deep interest in the tate of India +\n‘Sends remittances ~"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

In the second century AD, during the reign of Kanishka, a\ngroup of people migrated from India to Eastern Europe. During the Chola period, people\nfrom the Chola kingdom migrated to South East Asian states as they had a powerful navy.\nMany Indians began to settle soon in the regions comprising of present day Indonesia and\nMalaysia. During the British times began the first wave of migration, which is referred to\nas ‘Old Diaspora’. In 1833, the British abolished slavery and initiated the indentured\nlabour migration system from India to meet the labour demand. Under the indentured\nlabour migration system, the labourers would enter into a contract for five years to work in\na plantation or a factory. The labourers, as per the contract, would be paid in cash and\nkind. After the expiry of the five-year period, the labourers could either leave and go back\nhome or conclude a fresh contract. If the labourer decided to go back home, then he would\nhave to testify before a magistrate that he was indeed ending his existing contract. From\n1834 began the export of bonded labour from India to the African states. This was also\nreplicated by the Dutch and the French, which in turn led to a mass movement of Indians\nto other nations. The workers from India were mostly taken to do plantation work. The\nlabour was taken mostly from Bihar and the United Province to Mauritius, Suriname,\n\nTrinidad and Tobago and Fiji. From Punjab and Gujarat, the labour was mostly sent to\nGuyana and East Africa. The indentured system was abolished in 1916. This old diaspora\nconstituted of 60% for the ID abroad and was majorly a pre-World War-II phenomenon.\nDuring the Indian National Movement, delegations of Congress leaders comprising of CF\nAndrews, Shastri, Kunzru and Gokhale would travel abroad to check the conditions of\nIndian workers abroad and used to bargain for better conditions for the workers.\n\nA section in the Congress wanted to safeguard the economic interests of the ID in\nBritain. During this period, there was mass mobilisation of the ID in Mauritius and Fiji,\nand consequently, the ID gradually began be absorbed in local governments of these\nstates. In some countries, the sections of the Indian community also pushed for Indian\nIndependence. In 1927, a foreign policy document prepared by Nehru advocated that\nIndians in foreign countries should adapt themselves to local countries and not seek\nspecial positions or provisions for themselves. The core idea propounded by Nehru was\nthat the ID should cooperate with the natives and support the anti-colonial struggles of\ntheir host countries. Nehru advocated that the interests of the natives should be paramount\nduring the process.\n\nThe post-independence period witnessed the rise of a new wave of migration known\nas the ‘New Diaspora’. A lot of Indians in the second phase began to move to the USA,\nBritain, Australia, Canada and Western Europe. After the Second World War, Britain had\nformed a commonwealth immigration policy whereby citizens of commonwealth nations\ncould work and live in Britain. This led to the movement of lot of skilled workers and\nstudents from India, and other commonwealth states, to Britain. The period of the 1960s\nalso witnessed phenomenon of double migration by the ID. During this decade, many\nnewly independent African states initiated policies that affected outsiders. In Kenya and\nUganda, there were anti-Indian discriminatory campaigns and this led the Indians to\nmigrate from Africa (as well as the Caribbeans and Fiji) to Europe, Australia and North\nAmerica. In the 1970s began a movement of the ID to the Gulf states. This happened\nlargely due to the oil boom which resulted in the movement of semi-skilled workers to the\nGulf States to assist Arab citizens. However, the ID in the gulf enjoys the status of mere\nsecond class citizens. In the post-1990s period, globalisation led to a software boom,\nleading the US to introduce the concept of H1-B visas. A US firm, under H1-B visas,\ncould hire the citizen of a foreign state if the citizen had a special occupation and set of\nskills. The software boom led to a huge wave of Indians entering the US as highly skilled\nworkers in the IT industry.\n\nSince independence, Nehru had been of the idea that if India supports the ID abroad,\nit would lead to more harm than good for India. He deliberately favoured a policy of\ndisassociation as he wanted the ID to serve native interest in their respective host nations.\nIndia also followed a policy of dissociation during the Nehruvian period because it lacked\nthe infrastructure and resources to meet the concerns and address the issues of a diverse\nand expansive Indian diaspora abroad.\n\nThe period from 1950s to 1960s witnessed a period of active dissociation. The core\nadvice to the diaspora during this time was that they adapt to their host countries and\nbecome active agents of host countries. Nehru advised the ID to identify themselves with\nthe locals. Whenever the ID was in crises, they failed to elicit help from the Indian\n\ngovernment. Thus, the Nehruvian period witnessed the suppression, subjugation and even\nmarginalisation of the ID. The overall policy till 1962 was that the ID should adjust to the\ncountries they reside in, even at great cost to themselves. Post 1962, the policy forwards\nID began to change. In 1964, during Indira Gandhi’s tour of Africa, she did emphasise that\nthe ID be loyal to their local communities but also began to address the ID as ambassadors\nof India. The policy of India Gandhi was showing a shift away from the Nehruvian policy\nof active dissociation. When Indira became the PM in 1966, the shift from dissociation\nbegan to visible as the ID was gradually brought into the policy discourse.\n\nThere was also a further visible shift in the policy in 1970s, when there was an oil\nboom in the Gulf. Due to this, a lot of low income Indian workers began migrate to the\nGulf to work in the oil services and construction sectors. These Indian expats began to\nsend foreign remittances back home. The moment the money started flowing to India, the\ngovernment began to improve the banking system to ease out the repatriation of foreign\nexchange. The government also took up issues related to the welfare of the workers with\nhost countries, primarily to protect the Indian workers from exploitation. In 1980s, the rise\nof IT-based diaspora, that got fully established in 1990s in the USA, UK and Canada, also\nsaw a rise in remittances back home. At the end of the Cold War, as India witnessed\neconomic growth, it began to accept aid from the cash rich NRIs abroad. The Indian\ngovernment convinced the cash rich NRIs to park their funds in branches of Indian banks\nabroad and rallied to have them invest their money in the industries in India. As India\nbrought about structural reforms in the economy, the ID too began to show faith in the\nfuture of the Indian economy, began to push their money into India. The government also\nembarked upon a proactive association with the diaspora abroad. The NRIs were allowed\nby the Rao government to invest in stock markets and established industries. As India’s\npriority was to usher in economic resurgence, the proactive diaspora policy began to focus\nmore on the NRIs than on the old diaspora.\n\nThe association with the old diaspora continued to be cultural in nature while with\nthe new diaspora and the NRI, it became more economic and political. As the BJP\ngovernment came in 1998, they brought about a radical rehaul in the Diaspora policy.\nTheir focus was now not only on transfer of investments and assets but on using the\ndiaspora as an instrument to make India a global power. The LM Singhvi committee was\nappointed during the BJP rule, which led to birth of a host of new initiatives of which the\nPravasi Bharatiya Diwas (PBD) and Pravasti Bharatiya Samman (PBS) were the most\nnotable developments. The concept of PBD was launched in 2003 and has continued since\nthen. The UPA government also initiated multiple policies for the ID during their rule\nfrom 2004-2014. A new women’s helpline, a legal helpline for the Diaspora in distress\nand various MoUs to safeguard Indians abroad have been their initiatives. The coming of\nthe new government in 2014 has brought the diaspora back to focus. The Modi\ngovernment has gauged that the Diaspora is an important tool for economic development\nand has an important role as international influencer. The Modi government has made the\ndiaspora a key driver of the Indian foreign policy. The various chapters of this book\nleading up to this chapter have also elaborated upon Modi’s diaspora policy. To recap\nquickly, PM Modi addresses the diaspora in foreign countries to inform them about the\nprogrammes in India where the diaspora can be stakeholder in India’s development story.\nHe usually addresses the diaspora in a huge gathering to convey to the host countries that\n\nthere is a sizable chunk of Indian population in most nations, and that they are taken care\nof, they will, in turn take care of the local politicians in the elections."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Initially, the islands\nwere under Spanish control. The Spanish were ruthless and were mainly interested in\ndraining the resources of the area. The major economic activity in the area was plantation\nwork and slavery was therefore quite rampant. The Indians were taken to the Caribbeans\nas part of the indentured labour system. As the islands gained independence from their\ncolonial masters, the region became a strategic backyard for the USA, leading to a\ntransformation of the region’s economy from plantation work to industrialisation. As the\nnature of the society began to witness change, the ID also evolved and began to adapt to\nanew, modern way of life. The ID realised the significance of education and educated the\nyounger generations. The period from 1880 to 1914 also saw multiple strikes by Indian\nplantation workers, leading to an assertion of their identity and thereby giving birth to a\nnew kind of political activism by the ID.\n\n* soniny Ramadhin\n\n(Cricketer)\n\n_» VS. Naipul\n(Nobel writer)\n» Lakshmi Prasad\n\\ (Novelist)\nv\ny\n\nBasdeo Pandey\nIndian Diaspora in Africa\n\nThere exists a considerably large ID in Africa, with most of it settled in Mauritius. Most of\nthe Indians had reached Africa under the Indentured Labour System. Indians were taken to\nwork in forests in East Africa to lay down railway lines. A lot of migrant Indians were also\nfree passengers who were mainly traders from the West coast of India, especially Gujarat.\nThe Indians faced difficulties in Kenya and South Africa and the India government did\nattempt to provide covert and overt support to the ID whenever needed.\n\nIn 1946, when South Africa had initiated segregation and discrimination of Indians,\nthe Indian government took up the matter at the level of UN not just for Indians who were\ndiscriminated against but for all communities that became victims of racial discrimination.\nNehru, in other parts of Africa, recommended integration of the ID with the African cause\nbut maintained a different policy towards the ID in South Africa where there was outright\nsupport. With reference to South Africa, India tried to merge the issue of apartheid and\nIndian discrimination. India, post-independence, solicited economic support from all\nsources except South Africa, and Nehru decided to break up diplomatic ties with the\nformer over racial discrimination. In East Africa, the ID had visibility since ancient times.\nAs the ID in East Africa mainly comprised of the trading community, it was visibly a rich\ndiaspora. During colonial times, the British followed a nativity policy, thereby debarring\nthe PIOs from any form of power sharing. In 1967, the government in Kenya initiated a\nprocess of Kenyianisation of the economy which affected the Indian as well. The Indian\ngovernment encouraged the Indians in Kenya to apply for local citizenships. The\ngovernment instructed the Indian diplomats stationed in Kenya to help PIOs get\nintegrated, to which the ID in Kenya showed a lukewarm response. The government\nlaunched an Africa—India development cooperation to help the Indian community in\nKenya get economic support. India also faced a similar issue in Uganda when Idi Amin\ndecided to outlaw outsiders from Uganda. Amin gave a 90-day ultimatum period for the\noutsiders to leave during his ongoing war of liberation. India, by diplomatically taking up\nthe issue with Idi Amin, ensured that the Indian settlers with Indian passports would be\ngiven compensation for their business and properties held in Uganda. In Mauritius, the ID\nis a majority. Since independence till today, India has used the ID in Africa as its goodwill\nambassadors.\n\nIndia Diaspora in South East Asia\n\nThe Indian diaspora is well represented in Singapore, Thailand and Philippines. The ID in\nSouth East Asia (SEA) comprises of NRIs, PIOs and stateless Indians. Some are affluent\nwhile others are striving for affluence. The local leaders of ASEAN states trust the ID,\nthereby ensuring that the community plays a positive role in the development of SEA.\n\nIn the chapter entitled ‘India and South East Asia Policy—Key Drivers’, we have\ndiscussed about the eviction of Indians belonging to the Chettiar community from Burma.\nAs more Indians were evicted, the space was filled but the Chinese migrants. The inaction\nof India in Burma, which stands in complete contrast with the proactive stance of India in\ncase of Sri Lanka, also became counterproductive. In the post-Cold War period, India\nbrought about a shift in its ID policy in SEA. India realised that its diaspora in Singapore,\nThailand and Malaysia, is placed in strategic sectors like trade, investments, engineering\nand textiles. The Sindhi community is dominant in manufacturing in Philippines while\nPunjabis are dominant in money lending. Singapore has a mixture of Tamils, Malayalis,\nGujaratis and Punjabis who range from being in trade to civil services to education to\npharmacy. The Sikhs and Sindhis are dominant in Thailand in textiles, IT and real estate.\n\nIndian Diaspora in Europe\n\nImport of spices, ivory and so forth, via other countries, do find a mention in the Old\nTestament of the Bible. King Solomon was gifted many spices by the Queen of Sheba\nfrom India. There is evidence of the Panchatantra being translated in the 6th century BC\nin Latin, Spanish and Italian. India came in contact with Europe during the 15\" century,\nwhen trade was undertaken via the sea route. Vasco da Gama was a Portuguese explorer\nand the first European to reach India by sea. His initial voyage to India (1497-1499) was\nthe first to link Europe and Asia by an ocean route, connecting the Atlantic and the Indian\noceans and therefore, the West and the Orient.\n\nDa Gama’s discovery of the sea route to India was significant and opened the way for\nan age of global imperialism and for the Portuguese to establish a long-lasting colonial\nempire in Asia. Traveling the ocean route allowed the Portuguese to avoid sailing across\nthe highly disputed Mediterranean and traversing the dangerous Arabian Peninsula. The\nsum of the distances covered in the outward and return voyages made this expedition the\nlongest ocean voyage ever made until then, far longer than a full voyage around the world\nby way of the Equator. With the advent of the colonial era, the Indian movement to Europe\nsaw an upswing. In the initial year of the Cold War, the aggressive nationalism in Africa\nled to the migration of Indians to European states. The ID in Europe amounts to nearly\neight per cent of the total population of Europe with majority of it concentrated in Britain.\n\nvlame\npresence Gai eae\n\nStates—Poland,\nCyprus, Bulgaria ~ Minium doctors, engineers\nBusiness activity ~ Le\n\n~ Medium -~ Russia, Ukraine, Austria\nPresence ~s Sectors—tashion,\n\nThe ID in EU settled close to the capital cities and industrial towns than in the\nhinterland. After World War-II, another wave of professionals working in IT, construction,\nmedicine and engineering migrated to Europe. In 1990s, the European Union imposed\nrestrictions leading to the entry of only teachers, nurses and scientists. From early 2000s,\nthe migration of IT professionals have again been on the rise in Britain.\n\nPolitics G\n\nDodiere< — Indian Diaspora > Industrial workers\nin Britair\n\nae —_ we Small retailers\n\nEngineers Skilled professional\n\nDoctors\na Traders\nTechnocrats\nR and D personnel\n\nIndian Diaspora in __-» Medicine\nGermany, Portugal peer\n\nDoctors Netherlands and —\n\nBelgium —™ IT industry\n\nTeachers Diamond traders\n\nStone polishing work\nIndian Diaspora in North America\n\nThere is a strong ID in Canada in Toronto and Vancouver. The ID in Canada is majorly the\nSikh population. The Sikhs in Canada consider the non-Sikh Indian community in Canada\nas outsiders, asserting the religious—regional bias. The ID in Canada is politically\ninfluential as they have a strong presence in the political and bureaucratic setup. In the\nUSA, the ID is composed mainly of the educated and professional class. The presence of\nthe ID in the USA has increased from 1970s, when amendments were made to local laws\nallowing entry of trained skilled personnel. A scholar named Jenson has argued that the\nmigration of skilled labour to USA has led to a brain drain in India. In 1990s, there were\nmore amendments in US laws allowing US firms to build up human capital capabilities of\nUSA and this gave the USA firms an option to open up the US labour market for Indians.\nThe H1-B, a non-immigrant visa, also facilitated the transfer. Indian immigration to the\nUS has been majorly in the professional category, including executives, administrators and\nmanagerial staff. Ethnic balancing of the population is, however, a concern that, at times,\nleads to hate crimes against ID.\n\nThe Diaspora in Australia, New Zealand and Fiji\n\nAustralia, an island continent and a former British penal colony, shares the shores of\nIndian Ocean with India and acts as a bridge in the movement of people. In the 18°\ncentury, Indians began to migrate to Australia, which was then known as ‘New Holland’.\nLater, traders from Gujarat, Sindh and Punjab also landed up in Australia. A lot of Anglo—\nIndians in the post-1947 period have settled in Australia as well. In 1958, the Migration\n\nAct allowed settlement rights to Anglo—Indians from India to Australia. The ID is largely\ninvolved in sugar plantations, taxi driving, and security. These days, the number of\nmembers of the ID working in IT, health, medicine and academics is also on the rise. In\nNew Zealand, in the 20° century, a considerable number of Indians worked as halal\nslaughterers in the meat packaging industry. Presently, New Zealand has a skilled diaspora\nof professionals, doctors, geologists and academicians. The ID in New Zealand is settled\nmainly in Auckland and Wellington. In 1879, the indentured labours were taken by British\nto work as coolie labours in the sugar and cotton plantations of Fiji. Later, Gujarati traders\nbegan trading in cotton cloth while the Punjabis, as per a study by Pacific Studies scholar\nRonald Gordon Crocombe, began work in transport and money lending. In 1970, when\nFiji gained independence, the Indian in Fiji accepted Fijian nationality. In the present day,\nIndians dominate the political system of Fiji and contribute to national development.\n\nIndian Diaspora in West Asia\n\nIndia—West Asia relations go back to the ancient times that led to the birth of trade and\ncultural ties. The presence of Indians in the Gulf goes back to pre-Islamic times. During\nthe medieval times, the merchants from India traded with the Gulf. Studies point out that\nVasco da Gama had noted Indian presence in the port of Chiraz. In the 17\" and 18\" century,\nIndia traded with Iran through the land route. The trade extended upto Central Asia. The\ncoming of the British in India saw a large number of Indians settling down in the Gulf\nregion, especially in Muscat and Bahrain (due to a thriving pearl fishing industry). In 19*\nand 20\" century, pearl finishing was a dominant activity but when it gradually declined,\nIndians shifted to general trade and goods in ports from India and Europe. Since the\ndiscovery of oil, Indians have been actively working in the oil sector. The oil boom of the\n1970s led to another major flow of migrant Indians to join the oil sector in the Gulf. As the\npolitical conditions of the Gulf witnessed a swing from 1990 to 1998, there was a general\ndecline in number of Indians in the Gulf. About 70% of the ID in Gulf is from Karnataka,\nAndhra Pradesh, Telangana and Tamil Nadu. There is also some presence of the ID in\nIsrael. The ID in Israel is in specialised agriculture work.\n\nMlegal immigrants _» Semi-skilled\n~s labour\n» Business men\nProtessionals ~~\n* Entrepreneurs\nDelay in wage\nPayment\nPsychological trauma i a aero\na fae\nRestricted mobility ~ Cae Denial of labour rights\nS\\ ™* Long work hours\nRetaining of passports “ / “ Lack of medical facilities\n\n, ’\nPhysical — Non-payment\nabuse of salaries"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Nehru had exercised\ntremendous influence on India’s nuclear thought and policy. He laid down the foundation\nof India’s nuclear programme and its nuclear behaviour. The person other than Nehru who\ncreated a deep imprint on the Indian nuclear programme was Homi J. Bhabha. In 1939,\nBhabha came back to India to establish the Nuclear Research Institute. He sought financial\nassistance to further Indian nuclear research and to establish a nuclear research project\nfrom the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust. He was able to convince him about the role that nuclear\ntechnology could play in the development of modern India. In 1945, the Tata Institute of\n\nFundamental Research (TIFR) was established, with Bhabha as its director. He based his\nidea of nuclear technology and energy resources on the basis that as India would progress,\nthere would be a demand for more energy and India’s conventional energy resources\nwould not be able to adequately meet that demand. Thus, nuclear energy as an alternate\nand affordable option needed to be developed. In order to explore the nuclear option,\nnuclear reactor technology had to be understood and built upon. The government, after\nindependence, established an institutional architecture for further nuclear research.\n27 August 1947:\n\n> Atomic Energy Act is passed\nPp\nThe first meet of AEC\n\nC1047 > => Atomic Energy Commission\n(AEC) is established\n\nAfter India became independent it began to seek assistance from foreign nations. In\n1956, the British helped India to build the Apsara reactor. In 1955, Canada provided a 40\nmegawatt reactor which used natural Uranium and heavy water. The heavy water was\nprovided by the USA under a partnership called CIRUS. India chose Canadian reactors\nbecause India possessed very limited foreign exchange and uses this limited foreign\nexchange to purchase the only affordable reactors which Canada offered. Canada further\nattached a no-strings policy including on hour the Plutonium was to be used. The Indian\nscientists, by 1960, created fuel rods and used them for the first loading of CIRUS in\n1960. The use of self-made fuel rods gave India the claim to use the resultant Plutonium\nfor future use. In 1958, a plant named Phoenix was established at Trombay to extract\nPlutonium. The US, under Atoms for Peace, had declassified the procedure to reprocess\nPlutonium, a technique that India used at Phoenix to produce its first weapons-grade\nplutonium in 1964.\n\nIn 1958, the government adopted a three-phase power production plan. India would\nfirst take assistance from Canada and develop Uranium-fuelled reactors. As these reactors\nwould operationalise, they would generate Plutonium as a by-product. In the second stage,\nIndia would develop reactors which would use Plutonium and burn Plutonium with\nThorium. The burning of Plutonium and Thorium would create Uranium (U-233). In the\nthird stage, India would use U-233 burn, burn U-233 and Thorium to produce more U-233\nand energy. The foundational ideas that dominated our development discourse after\nindependence were a heavy industrialisation model and import substitution. It was\nbelieved that this model would push India to the next stage of growth. In this model,\nnuclear energy was to have a core role in providing electricity. Nehru and Bhabha had a\nconfluence of ideas at this level as they both agreed that nuclear energy can take the\ncountry forward and help in achieving its developmental goals. Thus, Indian policy\nmakers understood that nuclear energy can be an alternative to conventional energy and\ncan be produced at a cheap price to achieve socio-economic goals. This plan of using\nnuclear energy for the stated purposes was institutionalised in the Second Five Year Plan.\n\nEnergy source\nfor development\n\nseduction\n\nNuclear energy }—» Nuclear energy has spill"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

As the US was providing assistance to India under Atoms for\nPeace at the nuclear level and this support was domestically governed by the Mutual\nDefence Assistance Act of 1951, it created some issues. The US Act said that if the\nUS supplies any nuclear materials to any country, then the recipient country cannot\ntrade materials given by the US with Soviet satellite states or the USSR. The US,\ntherefore, opposed India’s bid to sell Thorium Nitrate to China. India asserted that it\nis not bound by US conditions or laws. Later, a compromise took place and the US\nallowed the existing shipment be sent to China.\n\nAs time progressed, the Thorium nitrate issue (as seen in the case above) added some\nstrain in India-US relations and the US thereafter began to cement its alliance with\n\nPakistan. However, even as the US did so, Eisenhower assured India that the US would\nensure that Pakistan does not use its aid against India. The US also gave further assurance\nto India that it would be ready to give military assistance to India but in 1954, after the\nSEATO was created, India politely turned down the US request, thereby asserting its\nsovereignty.\n\nIn 1953, Eisenhower, in the UN General Assembly announced the launch of Atoms\nfor Peace initiative as also the subsequent establishment of the IAEA to assist other\nnations in peaceful use of civilian nuclear technology. Though India was sceptical of the\nIAEA, it continued to pitch for total elimination of nuclear weapons and advocated\nnuclear technology be only used for peaceful purpose. It also advocated that no country\nshould dominate the IAEA and all countries should be allowed to have a full say in its\nfunctioning. The IAEA decided to establish tight safeguards over nuclear materials given\nto states. One of the points was Plutonium generation. The IAEA asked that Plutonium\ngenerated by states be given to IAEA, which would, in turn, allow some quantity to be\nkept with a country for non-military use. Bhabha opposed this policy and advanced that it\nwas an inalienable right by a state to retain Plutonium or any other fissionable material.\nUltimately, India won on this point at IAEA. A decision was arrived at that such\nsafeguards would not affect socio-economic development of a country and India retained\nits right to have Plutonium for future use.\n\nIn the meantime, after the Cuban missile crises, the US, the USSR and Britain\ndecided to work towards the reduction in nuclear escalation. In 1963, they drafted a Partial\nNuclear Test Ban Treaty (PTBT or LTBT). India found PTBT a favourable draft. The\nPTBT asserted that there shall be complete prohibition on underwater, atmosphere and\nouter space nuclear testing. India ratified the PTBT, thinking that the PTBT is a step\ntowards complete disarmament. However, China refused to conclude the PTBT, which\naggravated tensions in India. In 1964, Nehru was succeeded by Shastri after his death and\nin the same year, China conducted a nuclear test in Lop Nur. Bhabha attended the\nPugwash Conference in Udaipur in 1964. He presented that a country like China having\nnuclear weapons can threaten India, and India had to either go for development of a\nnuclear weapon or collective security. Two things emerged here. Firstly, India was trying\nto articulate a collective security pact with the US or the USSR for security guarantee,\nwhich especially became more relevant post 1962. Secondly, India explored the option of\ngo nuclear. At the Pugwash conference, Bhabha gave a clear understanding of the\nproblems lying ahead for India with a nuclear China around and effectively presented a\nlikely course of action for India. Post-1962, India embarked upon military modernisation\nand sought support in defence modernisation from the US and the USSR. The USSR\nagreed to help India and provided the MIG-21 fighter jets to India.\n\nThe first nuclear test was conducted by China on 16* October 1964. A six-week\ndebate in India from 16\" October 1964 to 27* October 1964 brought a major shift in the\nIndian nuclear thought. After the nuclear test of China in 1964, days later, a pitch by Jan\nSangh and Samyukta Socialist Party to allow India to possess nuclear weapons began. The\ndebate saw tremendous pressure being exerted from the opposition parties. Though Shastri\ncontinued to follow Nehruvian line, he also continued to accelerate military rebuilding of\nIndia. As domestic pressure grew, Shastri, on 27* November, 1964, announced the\nauthorisation of subterranean nuclear test in the Parliament. The period till 1965 saw\n\nIndian scientists debating costs and financial implications for the same. Bhabha also\nbelieved that a nuclear India would serve as a triumph for the third world and would\nstrengthen democracy in Asia. The initial idea of a security guarantee could not work out\nas the US continued with its alliance with Pakistan and India’s own non-aligned\ncredentials would not have favoured an active relationship with either the US or the\nUSSR. The 1965 Indo-Pak war created a wedge between India and the US. In 1965, India\npresented a five-point proposal to the Eighteen Nation Disarmament Commission\n(ENDC), which had been established in the same year to negotiate a nuclear Non\nProliferation Treaty (NPT). India was one of the eight non-aligned nations, along with five\nthe US allies and five Russian allies that were part of the commission. India, at the ENDC,\nadvocated that all 18 nations freeze nuclear weapon production and halt production of\ndelivery systems, which would be the only move that would ensure that Non Nuclear\nWeapons States (NNWS) would not go nuclear. India also clarified that a security\nguarantee could not deny nuclear weapons to NNWS and that only a total disarmament by\nNuclear Weapon States (NWS) can give assured satisfaction to NNWS. India also pitched\nthat a global approach to disarmament is needed. On 24” January 1966, Homi J Bhabha\nwas travelling to Vienna on Air India flight number-707 (flight was from Mumbai to New\nYork). The CIA of U.S.A. had planted a bomb in the cargo panel of the flight. The bomb\nexploded mid air and the plane crashed into Mont Blanc mountains in the Swiss Alps. In\nauthors interaction with a senior government officer serving in R&AW, the CIA had given\nthe task to its officer named Robert T Crawley. The CIA wanted to eliminate Bhabha as he\nwas the brain behind the Indian Nuclear bomb.\n\nThe ENDC was followed by the NPT in 1967. The NPT as a treaty stated that the\nworld will be divided into NWS and NNWS. The NPT said that the countries that have\ntested a NW (nuclear weapon) before 1° January, 1967 were to be called NWS. The\ncountries that had not tested a NW before the date fixed were thereafter labelled as\nNNWS. The NPT stated that NWS would not increase their nuclear arsenal and would\nundertake gradual disarmament. The NNWS, on the other hand, would not procure nuclear\nweapons. The NPT clarified that there shall be a review of NPT 25 years from the date of\nits enforcement. The NPT also said that in order to prevent any diversion of nuclear\nenergy from peaceful to military use, the states party to the NPT will accept the IAEA\nsafeguards.\n\nHowever, after looking at the draft, India refused to sign the NPT. India asserted that\nNPT is a discriminatory treaty which had divided the world into nuclear haves and nuclear\nhave nots. India held that this distinction in the treaty is highly arbitrary in nature. India\nalso said that the NPT as a treaty was unfair because it placed no obligation on nuclear\nweapon states to destroy their nuclear weapons and the gradual disarmament advocated\ntherein was nothing more than an eyewash. The NPT had set no time frame for complete\ndisarmament and it was clear that the gradual disarmament advocated was not to happen\nin the foreseeable future unless a timeline was adhered to. India clarified that under the\nNPT, if NWS were allowed to have a nuclear weapon, it would be a threat to India. Based\nupon these reasons, it refused signature to NPT. The NPT was opened for signatures in\n1968 and finally enforced in 1970. The NPT created an impression that the emerging\npowers would not be allowed to have nuclear weapons and the monopoly over nuclear\nweapons was being legitimized by the superpowers."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The NPT is based\non certain core pillars. They are explained in the diagrams below:\n\nAn explanation of the nuclear fuel cycle is warranted in this regard. The diagram\nbelow will help.\n\nThe Uranium that exists in nature is extracted from the ground. The naturally\noccurring Uranium is called the Uranium-238 isotope. In this isotope, the fissile material,\nthat is Uranium—235, is about 0.7% is just enough to sustain a nuclear reaction. Since\nUranium-235 only constitutes a meagre percentage of the fuel, more amount of fissile\nmaterial is required. The naturally occurring Uranium is leached using chemicals to\nprepare the yellow cake. The transformation of yellow cake is brought about using\nUranium hexafluoride gas. As the concentration of Uranium-235 increases, it becomes\nready for generation of nuclear energy. The enriched Uranium is grinded into power form.\nThe powder is further processed to produce ceramic pellets. The ceramic pellets are put\ninside the fuel roads to power the reactor core. After the usage of Uranium-235, Uranium-\n238 and Plutonium thus generated are then kept in the spent fuel pool separately. The\nPlutonium and Uranium-238 are then further reused thereby competing the fuel cycle.\n\nEE\n\nFor a period of time, the countries that had nuclear weapons enjoyed a wider political\nclout than the states that did not possess such weapons. The nuclear weapons also\nprovided the ‘haves’ an insurance against attacks and unbridled power in the international\nsystem. This generated a sense of insecurity that eventually compelled some states to\nsecretly build up an insurance policy by acquiring nuclear weapons. Iraq and North Korea,\nin 1990s, were able to acquire nuclear weapons. In 1991, the US used the context of the\nIraq—Kuwait war to invade Iraq. Post the Iraq—Kuwait conflict, the UN resolution 687\nforced Iraq to declare all nuclear facilities and allow IAEA inspections. The subsequent\ncreation of the United Nations Special Commission was given power to eliminate the\nweapons of mass destruction that Iraq possessed.\n\n~*~\n\nAt this time when Indira Gandhi was in power as the Prime Minister of India, there\nwere again calls for the nation to establish a nuclear weapon arsenal. However, India\nrestricted itself to peaceful nuclear use only. Stephen Cohen remarks that the period of the\nlate 1960s in India at nuclear level was called ‘the option’.\n\nNuclear abolitionist behaviour\n\n_.» Emergence of hawks who advocated\nnuclear weapon\n\nRise of contingency hawks who advocated\nnuclear weapon if need arises\n\nIndira Gandhi focussed largely on domestic economy. As the NPT unfolded, India\naptly understood that NPT intends to augment nuclear apartheid. Certain events also\nfurthered India’s urge to think about nuclear weapons. Firstly, in 1971, India and the\nUSSR signed a Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation, which gave India Soviet support.\nSecondly, after 1971 Indo—Pak war, the US undertook a rapprochement with China and\nalso helped China get a permanent seat in the UN Security Council. In December 1971,\nwhen the Indo-Pak war in East Pakistan broke out, the US dispatched USS Enterprise in\nBay of Bengal to support Pakistan. This made India rethink its post war situation.\n\nNuclear gunboat Friendship treaty with Soviets,1971Friendship\ndiplomacy by US _oy treaty with Soviets,1971\nmar - > Indo-Pak war,1971\n\n> Resounding electoral victory of 1971\n“~ Indian scientists get a green signal to\nundertake subterranean test\nIndia conducted a subterranean nuclear test at Pokhranin 1974. It is also known as\nPokhran-I or a Peaceful Nuclear Explosion (PNE). Considering the fact that it was a\nsubterranean test where sub-criticality was not achieved, India could not proclaim itself as\na NWS.\n\nAfter Pokhran-I, the US and Canada suspended all support to India and the Nuclear\nSuppliers Group (NSG) was formed in 1975. A London Club is also formed. Both groups\nare formed to isolate India. Domestically in India, emergency was imposed, which was\nfollowed by the Janta Party government in 1977 led by Desai till 1980.

The United Nations General Assembly, on\nthe request of the developing countries, launched a special session on Disarmament\n(SSOD) in order to achieve global disarmament. The first SSOD meet happened in 1978\nand reaffirmed the need for disarmament. At the end of first SSOD, the General Assembly\nestablished a Disarmament Commission comprising of all UN members. The second\nSSOD happened in 1982 but failed to establish consensus despite an urgent need for\ndisarmament. The Third SSOD in 1988 also failed to establish a consensus.\n\n» India says disarmament is important\nA\n#\ny India presents a five-point\n-—< » disarmament plan to freeze\n\\ weapon production\n\\\n4 India presents Rajiv Gandhi Action\n» Plan for Nuclear Weapons, Free\nWorld and non discriminatory safeguards\n\nZulfikar Ali Bhutto, then head of state of Pakistan, acquired Saudi Arabian financing\nfor nuclear weapon. The most important reason for Pakistan’s going nuclear was India’s\nalready having done so. Pakistan perceived its nuclear capability as a bargaining chip in\nthe Kashmir in future. Indira Gandhi in the Parliament accepted Pakistan’s right to go\nnuclear but maintained that India had an edge on “all aspects” over Pakistan.\n\nStrengthen cooperation with USSR:\n* to contain Pakistan\n\noperation Put pressure on Pakistan through\nPtpisatv ociepreh rig international community to halt its ambition\n\nIndira Gandhi adopted a wait and watch policy. Though reports do suggest that she\nplanned to test nuclear weapon in 1982, when US satellites captured images of the nuclear\ntest preparations by India, the idea was immediately dropped. In 1983, India launched the\nIntegrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) to establish five guided\nmissiles (Nag, Trishul, Akash, Prithvi and Agni). After India tested Prithvi in 1988, the\n\nMTCR was established. During the times of Rajiv Gandhi, Pakistan continued nuclear\nweapon development. As Pakistan had opted for a military programme since beginning of\ntheir nuclear programme, the money was judiciously used and, unlike India, did not divert\nthe resources for civilian use.\n\nAs the Cold War ended, the NPT review conference was slated to happen in 1995.\nClinton revived the goal to have a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). The end of\nthe Cold War also saw the Indo-US rapprochement. In 1993, the Conference on\nDisarmament (COD) began. India participated in the COD and pitched for complete\ndisarmament. The COD culminated in 1996 in a draft of the CTBT. The CTBT firstly\nbanned all forms of nuclear testing, including underground testing which, as an option,\nhad been left open by the PTBT. The CTBT made allowances for computer simulation for\nimprovement. Under Article 14 of the CTBT, it went on to assert that all countries of the\nworld which had nuclear technologies were to mandatorily agree to the CTBT. A\nsubsequent list of 44 nations was prepared which also included India. In 1996, India\nrefused to sign the CTBT. India asserted that the name of the treaty was faulty and that it\nshould be called Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and not Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty as it\nwas banning nuclear testing even while keeping an option of computer simulation open for\nbomb improvement. India also asserted that the Article 14 of CTBT violated international\nlaw as no treaty can compel a state to sign a treaty which the state had not intended to\nsign. India urged for removal of Article 14 and also refused to sign CTBT for its lack of\ncommitment to complete disarmament. The NPT review conference of 1995 also decided\nto continue the NPT in the same format without any change and advised no more reviews\nin future of NPT. Thus, in 1996, India refused to ratify both the NPT and the CTBT both.\nIn 1992, IAEA had also come out with a safeguard agreement and had stated that only full\nscope countries be entitled to get technology.\n\nPerceiving the trend of discriminatory global practices, India conducted Pokhran-II in\n1998. From 11th May to 13th May, India carried out nuclear tests in an underground\nformat. After Pokhran-II, India announced that sub criticality had been achieved and\nproclaimed itself as a nuclear weapon state. India also brought about a self-imposed\nmoratorium on further nuclear testing and subsequently announced its nuclear doctrine.\nIndia pledged that it would maintain a No First Use Policy. It accepted the doctrine of\nMinimum Credible Deterrence. This meant that India clarified it was not necessary for us\nto keep our nuclear weapons in the state of readiness all the time and the mere possession\nof nuclear weapons was sufficient to create the needed deterrence. However, India, in its\nnuclear doctrine, clarified massive and unacceptable retaliation on first strike. India also\nstated that the use of chemical and biological warfare on India or its armed forced\nanywhere in the world would mean that India would retain the option to retaliate with a\nnuclear strike.

In the post-Cold War times, we witness new threats in the world ranging from\nlimited wars and territorial disputes to terrorism. It is not wrong to assert that the post-\nCold War times have pushed the international system into an age of uncertainty. The\nuncertainty has been compounded by the asymmetry in the security structure of the world\nwhere states having no nuclear weapons at present want to acquire them in any whichever\nway possible to ensure that the ones having the same do not stand to gain any security\nleverage.\n\nThe discussion in the chapter has clearly proven that since independence, the pursuit\nof nuclear capabilities has been at the heart of India’s governance. India, through its\nnuclear weapon, intends to achieve a credible minimum deterrence. The nuclear doctrine\nof India has declared the policy of no first use. Despite various threats, India since\nPokhran-II, has refrained from expanding its nuclear arsenal or even adopting a nuclear\nposture that could destabilise the region.\n\nIndia, however, needs to be cautious about changing ground realities. China and\nPakistan have both modernised their nuclear arsenals. The fact that Pakistan is developing\n\ntactical nuclear weapons has emerged as a new security concern for India. As China gives\neffect to the power transition theory, it will expand its nuclear arsenal further. China and\nPakistan are also deepening their cooperation on nuclear balance in the region, which is\nnot reassuring because of the deliberate ambiguity cultivated by Pakistan in its decision of\nnot having published a comprehensive nuclear doctrine. In future, regional rivalries and a\ndesire to resort to military intervention will push more states globally to acquire nuclear\nweapons. The debate during the Cold War period had also revolved around complete\ndisarmament, which, more than ever, seems a distant dream. In the post-Cold War times,\nwe see no hurry by the nuclear haves to reduce or cap their arsenals. A new round of\nactivism has come up now that advocates for ‘Zero Nuclear Option’. The countries not\nhaving nuclear weapons are sceptical that the nuclear haves are using the global zeros\ndiscourse to forsake the nuclear ambitions of the have-nots. In this context of uncertainty,\nIndia should strategically evolve its responses. India has to emphasise upon the\nsurvivability of its nuclear arsenal. If nuclear arsenals in our immediate neighbourhood\nexpand, India should develop second strike capabilities. India should focus on developing\nmaritime nuclear capabilities as this will enhance our security presence in the Indian\nOcean. At the global level, India should continue to participate in the non-proliferation\ninitiatives and should take up a leadership role to speak out on issues that motivate and\ncompel states to acquire weapons. We should portray to the world that the key drivers of\ninsecurity and rivalry propel states to seek a nuclear umbrella.\n\nAs India is vulnerable to nuclear terrorism, it must build up strong surveillance\ncapabilities at border points with Pakistan. The same capabilities need to be upgraded at\nairports and seaport levels. As Pakistan has a history of nuclear proliferation, India should\namend its nuclear doctrine and clarify the actions it might contemplate if nuclear weapons\nfrom a state are stolen or misappropriated. This will ensure that Pakistan cannot claim\nhelplessness if it ever deliberately assists terrorists to go nuclear in future. An important\narea to work upon by India should be nuclear disaster management. To prevent any\naggressive retaliation from our side, India needs to strengthen nuclear forensics. This will\nenable us with abilities to identify the source of launch of nuclear offensive. Seeking of\nUS cooperation in the area of nuclear forensics can help. India, today, still stands for\ncomplete disarmament and favours the zero nuclear option but knows that complete\ndisarmament of nuclear weapons is a chimera till the time that nuclear weapons remain the\ncurrency of power in the international system. India, to advance the goal of complete\ndisarmament, can now promote a global No First Use Treaty at the international level as a\npart of its new disarmament diplomacy. In this way, it may remain committed to the goal it\nstood for since independence without compromising its own security. A key question\nremains in the mind of the readers. India has a nuclear weapon it tested in 1998 through a\nseries of tests. Why does India have a No First Use policy? The answer lies in the nuclear\ndoctrine of India.\n\nThe situation at the end of the Cold War was very different. Pakistan and China has\nnot only developed nuclear weapons but were collaborating with each other to proliferate\nthem in Asia. India on the other hand, at the end of the Cold War, was a state that had\ntested a Peaceful Nuclear Explosion way back in 1974 under the NPT. Since 1974, India\nhad already faced a nuclear threat thrice (twice from Pakistan and once from the US on\nbehalf of Pakistan through US enterprise in 1971). By 1998, it was clear that the nuclear\n\nweapons had become a core currency of power in the age of uncertainty. India stated that\nit would not be the first to use the weapons as their prime role is to deter states that had the\npotential to blackmail us. However, India clarified that on first strike, it will resort to\nmassive and unacceptable retaliation against the adversary state. This was India’s concept\nof credible minimum deterrence. India’s nuclear posture is defined not by the number of\nweapons in its total arsenal but how it will inflict damage on an adversary as a retaliatory\nstrike of First Use by others.\n\nThe core purpose of India to have nuclear weapons is to have them for national\nsecurity in a world of anarchy and blackmail. India has not acquired its nuclear weapons\nto rectify military imbalances or assert regional superiority, but serve the purpose of\ndeterrence.\n\nSince 1998, after India acquired these weapons, no state has resorted to blackmailing\nIndia or used any nuclear coercion against India. As India has resorted to a mixture of no\nfirst use and assured retaliation, this policy has served the India’s nuclear strategy but has\nsome direct implications on the nuclear posture of India. For deterrence to be successfully\nachieved, India needs to match war heads with equal numbers of missiles as possessed by\nthe adversaries to make the threat of retaliation credible enough. There is a possibility that\nin this scenario, the adversary would test Indian space below certain thresholds of nuclear\nescalation. In such instances (as happened in 1999 in the Kargil conflict) the logical\nstrategy is not counter force targeting whereby the military structures of enemies are\ntargeted but to resort to counter value targeting where the assets of the opponents are\ntargeted. In this scenario, the Prithvi missiles with a range of around 350 km are effective\ninstruments of deference.\n\nHowever, debates have arisen about the efficacy of the NFU Policy. Some scholars\nassert that the Indian NFU is a pious hope without covering other Nuclear Weapon states.\nIn this case, assuming that India might shift to first use policy, the question arises, would it\nserve any purpose? Answer is no. Because a first use policy does not prevent blackmailing\nthreats and more so, is destabilising in nature. In this case, India’s NFU is at least deterring\nthe use of weapons of NWS. There could be a situation, however, where a NWS could\nthreaten India with a nuclear strike and an assessment by India could establish that the\nthreat was imminent. In this scenario, would India resort to a first strike? The nuclear\ndoctrine is silent on this. Thus, Indian NFU and its deterrence have provided the needed\nprotection to India. India lives in a neighbourhood which is heavily nuclearised. The\npolicy of keeping the nuclear option open, since in 1950s, has enabled us not only to\nweaponise but keep these nuclear threats at a bay. The nuclear choice of India may have\nbeen couched in moral terms but has been expressed in realistic terms."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

This testing by India was a challenge to the global\ndisarmament framework. The Indian test ended the Cold War security system and forced\n\nthe forced the world to move towards a re-evaluation of global non-proliferation system.\n\nIndia has always linked its domestic security with the nuclear disarmament at the\nglobal level. India has always asserted that nuclear weapons pose a security threat as they\nare instruments of coercion and therefore India has pressed for a nuclear weapons free\nworld. To seek the elimination of nuclear weapons, India has favored a multilateral forum\nlike Conference on Disarmament (COD), which India wants, should develop an effective\nand verifiable treaty to end nuclear weapons. The Indian goal has been complete universal\ndisarmament since the end of World War-II. In 1963, when PTBT emerged, India\nsupported the same as it felt that PTBT would be a step to end the ongoing arms race\nbetween USSR and US. But, PTBT felt short of all expectations for India. The world\nmoved from PTBT to the NPT. As NPT tried to institutionalize the hierarchy at the nuclear\nlevel; India rejected the NPT too. Though India maintained a civilian nuclear program\nfrom 1948, but the Indian strategic security environment was challenged when China\ntested its nuclear weapon in 1964. This Chinese test compelled India to undertake SNEP\nin 1974. Through the 1974 SNEP India conveyed its strategic resolve to preserve global\nstrategic autonomy. Post 1974, India embarked strategic ambiguity and this effectively\nserved India’s security interests. India, even post 1974, asserted that it would favor global\ndisarmament and focus on economic development. This strategic ambiguity served an\neffective deterrent to China while it also thwarted any Pakistani attempt to overtly seek\nnuclear capabilities. More so, such opaqueness also did not challenge the global non-\nproliferation order. India continued to favor universal disarmament during Rajiv Gandhi’s\ntenure as he proposed the famous Rajiv Gandhi Action Plan on Disarmament (in 1988)\nseeking complete disarmament by 2010. In 1995, in the NPT Review and Extension\nConference the world again lost an opportunity to reassess the NPT. Their decisions to\nindefinitely extend the NPT led to India assert that the world has decided to postpone\ncomplete disarmament forever. India thought that the Nuclear Test Ban Committee that\nwas tasked with the responsibility of drafting the CTBT could rectify this anomaly. But as\nthe draft of the CTBT emerged in 1996, the draft did not show any affirmative\ncommitment on global disarmament. India rejected the CTBT by asserting that the CTBT\ntried to legitimize the nuclear weapons as a privilege for a few and also presented no\ntimeframe for complete disarmament. During the CTBT negotiations, India for the first\ntime had asserted that India needed to have a strategic flexibility till the time countries in\nand around India don’t relinquish their nuclear weapons (with special emphasis upon the\nclandestine Pakistan-China cooperation and the nuclear bazaar of Pakistan). India\neventually conducted a nuclear test in 1998 and ended the ambiguity. Post 1998 nuclear\ntest, India decided to engage with nuclear powers after assuring the concerns of the world\nby announcing its nuclear doctrine. Since then, India has concluded a host of nuclear deals\nfor nuclear commerce (with most recent one with Japan in 2016). In 2015, during the visit\nof President Obama to India, the President exercised his executive powers to remove the\nfinal hurdles in the Indo-US Nuclear deal. As per the Indo-US nuclear deal, US would\nmonitor nuclear material that India would purchase from any third country. But, President\nObama, during the visit, rolled back this clause. The two sides established a nuclear\ninsurance pool to assure suppliers in case of nuclear accidents. Thus, in the conclusion, it\nwould not be wrong to assert that India has successfully found its way into global nuclear\norder based on its own terms and has come a long way as a responsible nuclear power\nfrom being a nuclear pariah."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Mohammad was born to Abd Allah\nIbnAbd al Mattalib (Father) and Aminah (Mother). He was raised by Abu Talib, who\nbelonged to the Banu Hashim clan of the Quraaysh tribe. Mohammad was a worker and he\nmarried Khadijah. In his mid-forties, he took retirement. During his prayers at the Mount\nHira cave, he received revelations from the Angel Gabriel, which was the God’s message\ntransmitted to Mohammad. This became the foundation of the religion today known in the\nworld as Islam. Mohammad faced a lot of difficulties to convince people about the\nrevelations of God but he succeeded in creating the foundation of Islam.\n\nAfter the death of Mohammad, the issue of succession arose. Mohammad belonged\nto the Quraysh tribe which had descended from Banu Kinahah tribe from Khuzaiman.\nThus, the successor of Mohammad had to be selected from Quraysh tribe itself. After the\ndeath of Mohammad, Abu Bakr became the new successor. Abu Bakr established the\nCaliphate institution and became a Caliph after Mohammad. Nearing his death, Abu Bakr\ndesired that Umar be his successor as the Caliph. Umar established a committee of six to\ndecide his successor. The committee arrived at a unanimous decision that the Caliph after\nUmar should be chosen from the six members. The Committee chose two successors—\nUthman and Ali. During the times of Umar as the Caliph, Islam was growing into a huge\nempire. The growing empire needed a Caliph who would be a military politico genius-like\n\nUthman, while Ali was a religious man. Ali was also the son-in-law of Mohammad.\nUthman belonged to Umayyad clan which was a wealthy clan and eventually succeeded\nUmar as the caliph. Ali, who had been sidelined, did not appreciate the idea of Uthman as\na Caliph as Ali advocated that caliphate should be held by someone hailing from the\nlineage of Mohammad. Thus, there was a growing rebellion against Uthman as a Caliph.\n\nDuring the reign of Uthman and Umar, Islam had spread outside Arabia to Egypt,\nSyria, Palestine, Iraq and Persia. However, after a few years, Uthman was killed by\nEgyptian Muslim rebels. After the death of Uthman, the Caliphate now came under Ali\nwho ascended the Caliphate as the fourth Caliph.\n\nThe first four\nCaliphs\nPart of Rashidun calphate They were all relatives of Mohammad\n\nad yen\n\n“\n\nAbu Bakr (First) 1\n\nAlli (Fourth) “ >< Uthman (Third)\n\nAli faced a lot of challenges as a Caliph. Many people felt Ali was ineffective in\npunishing the killers of Uthman and some even suspected Ali’s involvement in the murder.\nUthman’s cousin Muawiyah was a member of Ummayid Clan and the governor of Syria.\nAt the time of Ali’s reign, Muawiyah claimed the caliphate for himself. Ali refused to\naccept Muawiyah as a Caliph and advocated the need to get Islam back to the ethical path.\nA group of people called Kharijites, who first appeared during the time of third Caliph\nUthman, were followers of Ali. However, over a period of time, as Ali began to bargain\nwith the Ummayids, the Kharijites felt that Ali had betrayed them and subsequently\nassassinated him. Meanwhile, after the death of Muawiyah, his son Yazid succeeded him\nas a Caliph and defeated Hussein at the Battle of Karbala, marking the full schism in\nIslam. Ali was succeeded by Abu Mohammad Hasan ibn Ali and the successors of Ali\ncame to be called Imams, while the Ummayid and Muawiyahs adopted a Caliphate\nmonarchy. The period of Ummayids saw a dynastic rule. In 638 AD, the faith was split\ninto two main sects namely, the Shias and Sunnis. The Sunnis believed that the leader of\nIslamic faith should be elected from among the successors of Prophet Mohammad while\nthe Shias believed that the leaders have to come from the descendants of the Prophet.\n\nP Umar (Second)\n\nAfter the death of Yazid, there was again chaos about the succession. By now Islam\nhad spread all over the Arab and Middle Eastern world. There were two main tribes in\nSyria—Qays in North and Kalb in South—who rallied around Marwan Ibn al Hakam. Ibn\nAl Zubayr established a Caliphate in Arabia while Al Muktar established a Caliphate\nunder his leadership in Iraq. Marwan I was succeeded by Abd al Malik who was\nsucceeded by his son Al — Walid, who spread Islam from Arabia all the way up to France\nwhere, in 736 AD, he was stopped by the Franks of France. The last Marwani Caliph\ncollapsed and was succeeded by the Abbasids led by Al Abbas.\n\nThe Abbasids came to power in 750 AD and remained in power till the Mongol\ninvasions in 1258. Abbasids also bought non-Muslim boys and brought them up like\n\nSunnis. They were soldiers for Abbasids and were called Mamluks. In counter to Abbasids\nrose the Fatimid who formed a Caliphate in rivalry to Abbasids in North Africa, Sicily,\nPalestine and Syria. To expand influence, they used the Dawa (missionaries) and used\neducation to spread ideas and principles of their school of thought. The Fatimids declined\ndue to promotion of a doctrine not acceptable to Sunni Muslims. The Fatimids wanted the\nallegiance of the people to Fatimid Caliph Imam which did not go down well with Sunnis.\n\nMeanwhile, Abdur Rehman of Umayyad established his rule in Cordoba in Spain. By\n720, a Moorish control was established in Andalusia in Spain but the state collapsed a\nlittle later. There was also a revivalist group of Ahmohads had established their Caliphate\nin Morocco were led by Ibn Turmat, who advocated strict monotheism but the Almohad\nCaliphate declined due to the rise of fanatic Almohads. Thus, during the time of Abbasids,\nmultiple caliphates sprung up. In 1517, Selim-I made Egypt a part of Ottoman territory\nand this saw the rise of the Ottoman Caliphate which lasted till 1924, when it was\nabolished leading to the birth of Turkey. In modern times, in Nigeria, Usman dan Fodio\nhad established Sokoto Caliphate in 1804 while in lieu of Ottoman Caliphate came\nSharifian caliphate. There have also been two non-political Caliphates, namely the Sufis\nand the Ahmadiyyas. In June 2014, Abu Bakr al Baghdadi of the Islamic state of Iraq and\nLevant (ISIL) gave a fresh call for establishment of a Caliphate once again.\n\nThe Shia Muslims on the other hand believed that Ali was the first Imam and Abu\nMohammad Hasan ibn Ali was the second. For Shias, the eleventh Imam was Hasan Al\nAskari. Today, amongst the Shia Muslims, one school of thought believes that Hasan Al\nAskari had no surviving sons but another sect called the Qatiyyas believes that\nMohammad Al Mahdi is the son of Hasan Ali Askari and he is in hiding somewhere and\nshall come to guide the Shias.\n\nUmayyad caliphate of Cordoba (929-1031)\n\nFatimid / i\nED cir. _/ nimonad caliphate 1107-1260) _ Sul caliates\n\n(909-1171) Sokoto caliphate (1804-1903) Almadiyya caliphate\n\\ / ' / (1908-till present)\nRashidun Ummayad Abbasid Ottoman Sharifian Non Islamic State of\nCaliphate Caliphate Caliphate Caliphate Caliphate political Iraq and\n(632-661) (661-750) (750-1258) (1517-1924) (1924-25) Caliphate Levant (ISIL)\n2014-till present\nHason Ali bn Ja‘far Ibn Ali Ibn Ali Ibn Al\nton Ali Husayn Mohammad Musa Mohammad Mahdi\nAli Ibn Husayn Mohammad Musa Ibn Mohammad Hasan Al\nAbu Talib ton Ali Ton Ali Jafar Ibn Ali Askari\n\nBroadly speaking, Muslims are divided into four branches, namely Shias, Sunnis,\nKharijites and Quaranists.

Al Wahab was born\nin 1703 in Nejd in Central Arabia. At the age of ten, Al Wahab learned Quran and found a\nlot of discrepancy in what was mentioned in Quran and what was being practised in\nreality. Al Wahab noticed people deviating from the path advocated in Quran by\nworshipping saints and tombs, which were practices that were completely against the\nQuran. He began to preach the ideas of Quran which went against the existing practices of\npeople. In 1724, Al Wahab went to Basra in Iraq and found many followers and\nsympathisers in Basra, amongst whom were several prominent persons. However, he was\nasked to leave Basra. In 1727, Al Wahab came back to his village Uyayna in Nejd from\nBasra. In his village Al Wahab again began to preach his ideas which were not appreciated\nby the ruler of Nejd who ordered him into exile. Al Wahab reached a small emirate in\nArabia by the name Diriya. The king of Diriya was Mohammad Ibn Saud. As Al Wahab\npreached in Diriya, he began to increase his followership. This was not appreciated by Ibn\nSaud who wanted Al Wahab to leave Diriya but Ibn Saud’s wife, being a follower of Al\nWahab, convinced Ibn Saud to let him stay in Diriya.\n\nAl Wahab’s ideology was based on monotheism. In this book Kitab at-Tawhid, Al\nWahab explains that Muslims should only follow Allah and those who believe in one God\nare true Muslims. He said that all others who are Muslims but believe in practices other\nthan Allah and monotheism live in a state of Jahiliya. Al Wahab demanded conformity to\none God or Caliph and advocated that the true followers of unity and monotheism, who\nare the chosen ones, can eliminate non-true Muslims like Sufis and Shias, and so on.\nWhen Al Wahab preached these doctrine in Diriya, Ibn Saud saw in these doctrines a\ngrand design to enforce conformity, gain acceptance and expand his empire in other\n\nemirates of Arabia. Ibn Saud began his territorial expansion and conquest over other\nemirates of Arabia on the pretext of the enforcement of Wahabi doctrine and gave birth to\na unified Arabia which was now called Saudi Arabia (derived from the name of\nMohammad Ibn Saud).\n\nAfter the death of Ibn Saud, his successor Abdal Aziz also used territorial expansion\nand violence to ensure the spread of Wahabi ideology and this is how, after the unification\nof Saudi Arabia, Wahabism emerged as the core ideology of the ruling state and ruling\nfamily. Abdal Aziz established an army of people named Ikhwan to spread Wahabi\nideology through forced coercion. The members of Ikhwan used to slaughter people who\ndid not conform to the Wahabi ideology. The Ikhwan soldiers used to wear black clothes,\nraise black flags, wear a black robe to cover their faces. It is this Ikhwan spirit which is\nvisible in ISIS today. In the period during the World War-II, the US and Saudi Arabia\ndeveloped an alliance whereby the US would buy Saudi oil in return for money, arms and\nammunition and Saudi was allowed to export Wahabism in the Middle East to gain\nhegemony in Middle East. Saudi used the money to provide training to west Asians and\nalso provided support to extremists who would seek conformity. The ideological\nunderpinnings of the ISIS, Taliban and Al Qaeda trace their roots to Wahabism. Post the\nSoviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, the CIA revived the [khwan spirit, leading to the\nformation of the Al Qaeda and Saudi Arabia used it to expand its influence and hegemony\nwhile the US used the ideology and its armies to contain the Soviet.\n\n1932: Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is established\n\nAl-Saud Abdulaziz King King King King King King Salman\n(Mid 18\" (1902 to Saud Faisal Khalid Fahd Abdullah (Since 2015)\nCentury) 1953)\n\nSalafism\n\nSalafism is a world view that looks at the religious questions of Islam. When Prophet\nMohammad was alive, he used to preach and hold sermons regularly. There were people\nwho used to listen to Mohammad who would then spread the knowledge they heard from\nMohammad by word of mouth. The words of Mohammad to those people who had the\nprivilege of listening to him became a part of the Sunnah. This knowledge of Mohammad\nor Sunnah was handed over to the successive generations. Salafis are those people who\nbelieve that the best way to follow Islam is to follow what these generations learned. For\nSalafis, those generations of people who listened to Mohammad followed the purest form\nof Islam and they believe that it’s that form of Islam that needs to be followed today. Thus,\nSalafism is a reform movement aimed at direct emulation of Mohammad, the initial\ngeneration, the first few who followed Mohammad. Salafism is a movement which wants\nto go back for purity of Islam. There have been scholars of Salafism in the modern times\nwho advocate use of Jihad (a holy war) if needed to follow Salafism.\n\nIbn Taymiyyah\n\nSalafist lbn Qudammah\n\nScholars\n\nIbn Qayyim\n\nMuslim Brotherhood (MB)\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood emerged in Egypt as a resistance movement against foreign\npresence. After Napoleon’s invasion of Egypt, the territory subsequently fell into the\nhands of Western powers. As the western powers began to increase their influence in\nEgypt, it saw erosion of Islamic values in the society. It is in this backdrop that Hasan al\nBana emerged on the scene and established the Muslim Brotherhood. Hasan al Bana began\nto follow a grassroots mechanism to promote Islamic values. He began to focus on issues\nlike health, education and other humanitarian issues. His aim was to establish a direct\ntouch with people of Egypt. He used this grassroots platform to popularise his version of\nIslam and preached the need for Sharia and a Caliphate as guiding forces in society.\nAdvocates a\n\npolitical approach\n__- Allah is their objective\n~ Quoran is their law\n) “ Prophet is their leader\nLy Jihad is their way (holy war)\nS Death for Allah is the highest aspiration\n\nFocus is to go for\n“Islamic Way\" ~~\n\nPromotion of Radicalisation\n\nAs the Muslim Brotherhood has established a strong mass base in Egypt, it emerged\npowerfully on the political scene of Egypt after the Arab Spring in 2011. The MB accepts\nIslam with modern components and is therefore more pragmatic and accommodating than\nboth Salafism and Wahabism. Saudi Arabia does not support the MB as it advocates the\nestablishment of a Caliphate which endangers Saudi Monarchy and their dynastic rule.\nThus, Saudi Arabia prefers to support the Egyptian military over the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nBaathism and Iraq and Syria\n\nDuring the World War-I, Europe was looking for allies in the Middle East. A British spy T\nE Lawrence promised Faisal | of Iraq that if he supported the British in the war, after the\nwar he would be rewarded with Mecca, thus earning Faisal’s support for the British. The\nBritish, along with the French, concluded the Sykes Picot Agreement secretly. The\n\nagreement was about the division of the Middle Eastern territory post-World War-I. The\naim of the agreement was to serve oil needs of Britain and France from the Middle East\nafter the War. As the World War-I concluded, as per the Sykes—Picot Agreement, the\nterritory was divided.

The British and the French emerged as two major\nEuropean powers. After the unification of Germany by Bismarck, even Germany emerged\nas a strong power. This period of nationalism in Europe also was a period of colonisation.\nIn fact, colonisation of the world had begun by European powers after geographical\ndiscoveries and industrial revolution. The British and the French resented the rise of\nGermany as they perceived it as a serious competitor.\n\nThe later part of 1880s saw alliance formations in Europe which ultimately\nculminated in the World War-I. Germany formed an alliance with Austria, Hungary and\nthe Ottoman empire while the British had formed their own alliance with the French. The\nOttoman territory would be disastrous even for the British and French as they used the oil\nfrom the territory for industrial activities back home. As the World War-I broke out, in\n1916, the British and the French signed the Sykes—Picot Agreement. Also known as the\nAsia Minor Agreement, the agreement had the British and the French decide the division\nof the Ottoman territory amongst themselves after the World War-I. As the war ended, the\nBritish and French emerged victorious and Germany, Austria-Hungary and the Ottomans\nlost. The victorious powers of the World War—I now decided to curb German ambitions\nand also divide the Ottoman territory. The establishment of the League of Nation, the\nMandate System and the Balfour Declaration gave effect to the ambitions of victorious\npowers. The British got the mandate of Iraq and Palestine while the French kept Syria and\nLebanon as mandates. In order to curb German ambitions, the Treaty of Versailles was\ndesigned and signed in 1919. As per the treaty, the Germans were not allowed to maintain\na strong military and its resources were to be shared with victorious powers like Britain\nand France. The prime intention to inflict harm upon Germany was to ensure that it does\nnot recover enough to act as a threat to Britain and France again. It also severely limited\nGermany’s colonial ambitions.\n\nThe wars also created a sense of nationalism in the Jews. The Jews were also inspired\nto have their own national home in the land they believed had been ‘promised’ to them by\nGod. Theodore Herzl, in 1896, established the World Zionist Organization in Basel in\nSwitzerland as a political movement to take Jews from Europe to Zion. (Zionism\nsubsequently emerged as a political movement of Jews; Zion or Jerusalem is where the\ntemple mount is located in Palestine). The basic idea of Theodore Herzl was that first, rich\nEuropean Jews would go to Palestine and purchase lands and over a period of time, other\nJews would go and settle in Palestine. Zionism, which emerged as a political movement,\nended up being a movement to colonise Palestine. As the number of Jews in Palestine\nbegan to increase, the move was not appreciated by the Arabs. After World War-I, as the\nMandate of Palestine had come under British control, the Arabs complained to the British\n\nabout the rising number of Jews in Palestine. The British subsequently controlled the entry\nof the Jews into Palestine but did not impose a complete halt. This sowed the seeds of the\nArab-Palestine disenchantment.\n\nDuring the inter-war period, Germany began to defy the Treaty of Versailles and also\nbegan to uproot the Jews in Germany. Hitler blamed Jews for the problems of Germany\nand in 1940, unleashed the horrific Holocaust as a ‘final solution to the Jewish Problem’.\nThe mass massacre of Jews led to a wave of deep sympathy for the Jewish people all over\nthe world. America also convinced its ally Britain to allow entry of one lakh Jews from\nEurope to Palestine and ease the entry restrictions. As more number of Jews began to enter\nPalestine, it upset the Arabs in Palestine. The situation in Palestine was very volatile. As\nthe Jews and Arabs fought for the claim of Palestine, the UN was created as a successor to\nLeague of Nations on 15th May, 1947. The British decided to hand over their mandate of\nPalestine to the UN for deliberation. Subsequently, the UN established United Nations\nSpecial Commission on Palestine (UNSCOP). The UNSCOP deliberated upon the\nPalestinian issue. During the UN debates, one group advocated that Arabs have been\ncontrolling Palestine but Jews also have a rightful claim on the territory and therefore, the\nterritory of Palestine should be partitioned for Arab Palestinians and Jews, creating a plan\nwhich came to be known as the Majority Plan. On the other hand, the other group\nadvocated that there should be a Federal Palestine and Jews can be accommodated in a\nunified Federal Palestine without the need to partition. Thus, this group created this plan\nwhich came to be known as the Minority Plan.\n\nOn 29th November 1947, the UN voted on both the plans. As per the vote, the\nMajority Plan received the maximum votes. The Palestine territory was to be partitioned\nand it was decided to establish an Arab Palestine and a Jewish Palestine while keeping the\ncity of Jerusalem under international control. As per the decision of the UN, with support\nof the US, on 14th May 1948, the Jewish Palestine got established on the demarcated\nterritory and Israel, as a state, was born. However, the Arabs failed to establish Arab\nPalestine on the demarcated territory. In 1948, after the creation of Jewish Palestine or\nIsrael, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Egypt and Jordan collectively attacked Israel. This led to the\nfirst Arab—Israel war in 1948. The UN immediately stepped in and by 1949, an Armistice\nagreement was achieved. From 1919 to 1956, there was truce in the region but in 1956,\nNasser nationalised the Suez Canal and prevented Israel from accessing the Suez Canal.\nThis led to a Tripartite Agreement between Israel, Britain and France in Sevres, France\nafter which, Ariel Sharon of Israel attacked Egypt and captured the Gaza strip and Sharm\nel Shaikh.\n\nThe subsequent intervention of US to diffuse the crisis led to peace again. But the\nSuez crisis firstly led to a big blow to the supremacy of Britain and France while boosting\nthe image of Nasser in the Arab world. The awakened Arab world began to ponder as to\nwhy the Arabs could not succeed in establishing the Arab Palestine. The Arabs realised\nthat it was because they lacked an organisation like the Jews and recognised the fact that\nsplinter groups advocating for Arab Palestine have to be brought under a unified umbrella.\nIn 1964, the Arabs established the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The PLO\nemerged as an organisation of the Arabs fighting Israel military for supremacy in the\nPalestinian region. Britain, France and Israel, along with the Americans, condemned the\ncreation of PLO in 1967. Egypt was mobilising its military units along the Sinai and also\n\nclosed the Gulf of Aqaba to Israel. This war lasted for six days (also known as the six days\nwar) and Israel captured the Gaza strip from Egypt.\n\nIsrael also took the West bank from Jordan and Golan Heights from Syria after the\nwar. Arabs took the matter to the UN, urging UN to compel Israel to vacate the occupied\nterritory and go back to accept the borders that existed before the 1967 war. The UN\npassed the UN Resolution—242, urging Israel to vacate the territory and immediately resort\nto holding of borders as existed before 1967. The state of Israel refused to comply to UN\norders. The refusal of Israel to comply to UN resolution 242 came as a big shock to the\nArab world. The PLO subsequently became more radical to tackle Israel.\n\nThe factional group called Fatah was one of the most radical groups which began to\ngain popularity for its aggressive stance to Israel. In 1969, the leader of the Fatah, Yasser\nArafat, became the head of the PLO and began to vouch for an armed struggle against\nIsrael. The Arabs continued to support the aggressive tactics of the Fatah, which now\ndominated the PLO. On 6th October, 1973, as the Jews were busy celebrating the holy\nfestival of Yom Kippur, Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Iraq and Libya attacked Israel. This took\nIsrael by surprise, but with support of the US, Israel succeeded in defeating each Arab\nparticipant. Subsequently, the Arab countries of OPEC imposed an oil embargo upon the\nUS. The efforts of the Nixon administration led to the uplifting of the embargo by 1974\nbut also caused an upward spiral of oil prices. For the first time, the global financial\nbalance of power tilted in favour of the Middle East. The US responded domestically with\nProject Independence (a project for energy security) and also decided to use the\ncomfortable situation to advocate for peace. Post the oil embargo, PLO also shifted its\noriginal maxima list position of advocating for liberation of Palestine under Israeli control\nto advocating the two states theory. It pressed for the creation of Arab Palestine in the\nGaza strip and West Bank.\n\nThe US sensed an opportunity in this changed stance and in 1978, invited the Arab\nnations for talks at Camp David. The PLO rejected the call for talks organised by US.\nHowever, Egypt, led by Sadat Anwar, responded positively and went ahead with the talks.\nThe Camp David Talks of 1978 led to the Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty and Egypt agreed not\nto use violence against Israel while Israel agreed to more autonomy for Palestinians, with\nthe possibility of sovereignty in future. However, the Israel-—Egypt rapprochement was\ndenounced by the Arab world and the PLO. Despite a breakthrough at Camp David talks\nwith Egypt, there was no big achievement overall as the PLO did not participate while\nIsrael refused to give effect to the UN Resolution—242. The frustration amongst Arabs for\ntheir failure to make Israel vacate territory and the intense disenchantment in Palestinian\npeople led to the first Intifada. The first Intifada culminated with rise of Harkat-al-\nMugawama al-Islamiya (HAMAS), led by Sheikh Ahmed Yassin.\n\nHamas emerged as an organisation in Gaza strip and vowed to eliminate Israel by\nforce. At this time, the response of the Fatah was different and it proposed that as an\norganisation, its focus would remain on establishing the Arab Palestine in Gaza strip and\nWest Bank.\n\n[TEmenedin 1964] [Emerged ater the 1967 warln 1960] | Rive of HAMAS 1967 |\n\nAs the Cold War ended with the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1989, the US\nemerged as a superpower. In 1991, the US invited the Arabs again at Madrid as a follow\nup to the Israel-—Egypt Peace Treaty. In the Madrid conference in 1991, Israel, Jordan,\nLebanon, Syria and some influential Palestinian people participated, although the PLO had\nnot been invited as a representative of the Palestinian people. The only success of the\nMadrid Conference was the Israel-Jordan Peace Treaty. Syrian insistence on reclaiming\nGolan Height delayed the Syria—Israel truce. Israel did propose, however, that it would\nhand over Golan Heights back to Syria if Syria concludes a Peace Treaty. The talks with\nLebanon in Madrid could not proceed as Iran exercised influence on Lebanon, through\nHezbollah. The US followed up the Madrid talks of 1991 with the Oslo Accords in 1993.\nFor the first time in the history of the Middle East crisis, the US succeeded in bringing\nIsrael and the PLO at a common platform for talks. HAMAS continued with its military\nposition and therefore was not a part of Oslo talks. The Oslo talks saw the ‘Land for\nPeace’ proposals. It was decided that Israel would undertake a phased withdrawal from\nGaza strip and West Bank while the PLO would accept the existence of Israel and would\ndo away with idea of using force against Israel. It was agreed that PLO would establish a\nPalestinian Authority (PA) which would act as a political entity to govern Gaza strip and\nWest Bank.\n\nIsrael was to vacate Gaza Strip and West Bank by 1998. The PLO, in the meantime,\nhad also established the PA. The rise of a right wing government in Israel by 1998 created\nan issue. In 1998, the Israeli government refused to vacate Gaza strip and West Bank.\nSubsequently Israel’s Ariel Sharon visited the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem (the third\nholiest site in Islam after Mecca and Medina) and this move provoked the Palestinians.\nThis provocation manifested as the Second Intifada in 2000. The Second Intifada caused\nheavy violence in the region again.\n\nry\n\nThe volatile situation came under control in 2003 when Ariel Sharon announced the\nDisengagement Plan. Israel agreed to vacate Gaza strip and West Bank by 2005. However,\nin 2004, Yasser Arafat died and was succeeded by Mohammad Abbas. In 2005, Israel\nvacated Gaza strip and West Bank and elections were organised on behalf of the PLO.\nBoth PA and the HAMAS decided to contest elections. The US and its allies extended\ntheir support to PA in the election. As the results of the election were announced, it\nstunned everybody as HAMAS won the election in Gaza Strip while Fatah won a few\nseats in the territory of West Bank. This sowed the seeds of subsequent Fatah-HAMAS\nconflict.\n\nIn 2007, after the talks, HAMAS and Fatah formed the National Unity Government\n(NUG) where HAMAS was led by Khaled Mashal and Fatahor PA by Mohammad Abbas.\nThe violence still continued due to ideological differences. The NUG collapsed in June\n2007, after which the HAMAS took control of the Gaza Strip while the Fatah took over\nthe control of West Bank. As Fatah enjoyed the support of the US, in 2014, it succeeded in\nmaking Palestine a non-member state of the UN and in 2015, a member state of\nInternational Criminal Court. Hamas as an organization continues to deploy military\ntactics and remains committed to eliminate Israeli military. In December 2016, US\nabstained at the Security Council resolution related to a resolution sponsored by New\nZealand on the settlement issue in the Palestinian territory. This was the first time in the\nhistory of creation of Israel that US, instead of supporting Israel, abstained from a\nresolution and came down heavily on Israel. For a long period of time, the Obama\nadministration and Benjamin Netanyahu had been on opposing ends with each other.\nThere had been some critical differences over the perception of the Iranian nuclear deal (of\n2015) by both US and Israel. Obama administration favoured a positive attitude to Iran,\nwhich was not the case with Israel. The long pending disagreements were a major factor in\nthe recent decision of US to abstain from voting at the UN Security Council.\n\n—\"\ni"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

However, after\n1453, the fall of Constantinople coupled with subsequent Renaissance, Reformation,\nEnlightenment and Industrial Revolution saw the rise of Christianity in Europe. The rise\nof Europe was perceived as the rise of Christianity by Islamic scholars. This time also\ncoincided with the beginning of imperialism. The western intrusion in the body politic led\nto a new discourse. Many scholars of Islam sensed a feeling of defeat and began to\nintrospect. Some believed that the reason Christianity flourished was because of\nadvancements in science (fuelled by the Renaissance and geographical discoveries) while\nothers believed it was because of military superiority. Some Islamic scholars advocated\ndeep introspection within and presented an idea of going back to pristine Islam as they felt\nthat Muslims have deviated from their true faith.\n\nThe early modern period also saw a strong control of Western powers over the\nMiddle East. Initially, it was by the British and the French who wanted a control over the\nMiddle East for oil to sustain the Industrial Revolution. The World Wars also led to\nredrawing of the boundaries of the Middle East, done in a manner to suit the imperial\ninterests. This territorial demarcation at the end of World War-I created a deep sense of\nresentment amongst the Arabs. The period after World War-II and the Cold War saw the\nUS emerging as a new power. The Cold War period in the Middle East witnessed a rise of\nmilitary dictators and dynastic dictators (as in Saudi Arabia). The oil boom post-1973 and\nthe oil embargo again financially strengthened the dictators but the financial benefits did\nnot percolate to the Arab citizens. The population at large was still left out and felt\nhumiliated to see how their leaders (authoritarian rulers) co-opted by the West. The Arabs\nwere also aggravated with creation of Israel in 1948 and subsequent loss of Arab lives in\nmilitary conflicts with Israel in 1948 and 1967.\n\nOne answer that emerged for Arabs during the Cold War was to reassert the influence\nof Islam, with which came the invocation of Jihad. The US, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan\nplayed a key role. The US used Jihadis to contain the Soviet influence in Afghanistan\nwhile Saudi Arabia spread Wahabism through Jihad to urge for a return to pristine Islam.\nThe Salafist Jihadism that emerged during the Cold War was perceived as the first\nresponse to regain control over destiny. Thus, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the US used\nIslam to mobilise it as a weapon to tackle communism. However, they rapidly lost control\nover the monsters that they had bred and fed. This precisely happened in the form of 9/11\nattacks. Post-9/11 we saw the US invasion of Afghanistan (2001) and Iraq (2003). The\nsubsequent period also saw a rise of Islamophobia in the Christian world. The Arabs again\nwere fatigued with increased violence and consequences caused by the Holy war or Jihad.\nIt was now well accepted that radicalism was not the answer. There was a huge intellectual\nvacuum felt by Arab citizen who had legitimate grievances against their leaders and\nrealised that violence certainly was no answer. What contributed to more frustration in the\nArab world was a series of Arab Human Development Reports that emerged from 2002\nonwards till 2009.\n\nAll these Arab Human Development Reports pointed out to lack of social\ndevelopment of Arab citizens. These reports also contributed to a deep sense of loss of\ndignity amongst the Arab people. The common Arab citizen was frustrated due to brutal\nsuppression by their leaders, high prices of commodities, rising unemployment and\nrampant corruption.\n\nThe spark came from Tunisia in December 2010 when a street vender, Mohmmad\nBouazizi, self-immolated himself due to suppression by Tunisian police. Self-immolation\nin Islam is a forbidden act as it is believed that a person indulging in immolation will find\nno place in heaven. This act of self-immolation became a political statement leading to\nmass agitations in Tunisia against Ben Ali, who promptly ordered his forces to militarily\nsuppress the protestors. The military forces refused to act on orders. This ultimately led to\nhis downfall. The revolution that happened in Tunisia was called Jasmine Revolution\nbecause jasmine is culturally important for Tunisians—in the month of December, a lot of\nvendors in Tunisia sell jasmine flowers. The Tunisians appreciate the purity and the scent\nof the jasmine. It was called Jasmine revolution as the idea was to purify Tunisia and clean\nit up from the corrupt government held by Ben Ali. Due to this Jasmine Revolution in\nTunisia, on 20th January 2011, the Democratic Constitutional Rally, the party under Ben\nAli was dissolved. On 1st March 2011, the Nahdah Party in Tunisia was legalised to\ncontest future elections. Ben Ali was convicted for embezzlement of public funds even\nthough he has lived in exile in Saudi Arabia since his ouster. The unrest from Tunisia\nspread to Egypt. Egypt, since 1980, was under the rule of Hosni Mubarak. The protestors\noccupied the Tahir Square in Cairo to demand the ousting of Hosni Mubarak. Post Arab\nSpring, Egypt witnessed a power tussle between Muslim Brotherhood and the Egyptian\narmy.\n\nIn 2011, the protestors also protested against the Muammar Gaddafi regime in Libya\nwho refused to leave the Libyan scene. Libya then subsequently saw a NATO intervention\nwhich led to a forced removal of Gaddafi. Libya became the first state that underwent\nCivil War after the Arab Spring. After Gaddafi, Libya has fragmented into multiple groups\nall of whom assert power today. The regime of Gaddafi at least had kept all factions under\n\ncontrol but post Gaddafi, Libya has slipped into a civil war and the crisis in Libya still\ncontinues. The conflict in Libya is about wealth and power. After the removal of Gaddafi,\nthe society which has got fragmented has seen the rise of local militias. The militias are\ncontrolled by tribes which have been asserting dominance over resources. In 2012, the\nGeneral National Congress was elected but each major city still has a dominant militia.\nThe GNC elected in 2012 had to give power to House of Representatives in 2014 which\n\nhas not happened yet.\n[ed eV]\n(tee aaa\n\ni 4\n.\n\n| |\n\nThe Arab Spring has seen protests against Ali Abdullah Saleh in Yemen and also\nagainst the ruler in Bahrain.

The problem of\nKurds goes back to the period of World War-I. After the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in\nthe World War-I, many Kurds wanted a separate state called Kurdistan. The idea was to\n\nunify all Kurds spread in the Middle East.\n\nar\n\nThe Treaty of Sévres in 1920 also advocated a new Kurdish state to be established.\nAs the Ottoman Empire disintegrated after World War-I, the Treaty of Lausanne\ndemarcated the boundary of Turkey and created Turkey as a modern state without the\nmention of Kurdistan. However, the Kurds, since then, have been fighting for an\nindependent state. The Kurdish people have no common dialect but belong to a common\nrace and culture and a majority of them are Sunni Muslims. In the years since 2014, the\nKurds have been in news due to attacks on the Kurdish people by Islamic State (ISIS).\n\nIn 1978, Abdullah Ocalan, a Kurdish nationalist leader, established the Kurdistan\nWorkers’ Party (PKK) and proposed to fight for Kurdistan as an independent state in\nTurkey. Till 1990s, The PKK indulged in an armed struggle and demanded the\nindependent state. However, since the end of the Cold War, the PKK has dropped the idea\nof an armed struggle and has been advocating more cultural and political autonomy. The\nPKK has been in negotiations with Turkish government and the latest round of talks\nhappened in 2012 where the Turks and PKK have established a ceasefire. In July 2015, as\nthe ISIS-related violence on members of PKK increased, the PKK blamed Turkey for all\nattacks on their members. The Turks, in relation, launched a synchronised war on terror on\nPKK and ISIS. Turkey alleges that the PKK has been adamant on the secession of the\nKurdish region from Turkey through armed struggle and thus labels it a terrorist\norganisation.\n\nKurds in Syria have established a Democratic Unity Party (PYD) which fights in\nSyria not for an independent Kurdish state but for more autonomy in the local democratic\nadministration in Federal Syria. In 2004, after the Qamishli uprising in Syria, the PYD\nformed People’s Protection Units (YPG) in Rojava or the area of Syrian Kurdistan. In\n2014, when the ISIS attacked Syria, the YPG repelled the ISIS.\n\nIn Iraq today, around 15—20% of the population is Kurd. The Kurds, historically, have\nenjoyed maximum rights in Iraq. In fact, in 1946, the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP)\nwas formed by Mustafa Barzani. Barzani wanted more autonomy for the Kurds in Iraq. In\n1958, the Kurdish nationality was recognised by the new Iraqi constitution, but Barzrani\nadvocated self-rule which was not acceptable to Iraq. In 1961, Barzani launched an armed\nstruggle. To diffuse the situation, the Iraqi government offered an autonomous region in\n1970 but the deal failed. In 1974, there was a split in KDP which led to Jalal Talabani\nestablishing the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). The KDP and PUK have repeatedly\ntried to share power but tensions between the groups have prevented any such endeavour.\nAfter the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, a coalition called Kurdish Regional Government\n(KRG) was setup in 2005 in Dohuk, Ibril and Sulaimanya. The KRG has been primarily\nan advocate of autonomy for Kurds. They have members belonging to the Kurdish\n\nnationalist guerilla organisations called Peshmargas. In 2014, when the ISIS attacked Iraq\nin the North where Kurds reside, the KRG sent Peshmargas to fight. Since February 2016,\nMustafa Barzani’s son, Massoud Barzani, the current leader of the KDP, has been an\nadvocate of a referendum and the demand for the referendum was forcefully forwarded\nagain in January, 2017.\n\nThere also exists a small group of people in the Middle East called Yazids. They are\namong the world’s oldest minorities and are a monotheistic people. Yazdis and their faith\noriginated thousands of years ago, with roots in Zoroastrianism. They follow a blend of\nIslam and Christianity. In the recent years, due to attacks on Yazdis by ISIS, the minority\ngroup is in danger. The ISIS has labelled them devil worshippers and have called for their\neradication. The Yazdis are almost on the verge of extinction. Today, they live near the\nSinjar Mountains in Iraq.

To understand the origin of the ISIS, we need to trace\nback to the period of the Gulf War-I. In 1990, when the first Gulf War began, in Iraq,\nSaddam Hussein used chemical and biological weapons against his adversaries. The US\nsupported Kuwait in the war but as the war ended, it failed to remove Saddam Hussein\nfrom power in Iraq. As the UN imposed sanctions against Iraq and isolated it, it was\nbelieved that a weak Iraq under Saddam Hussein would lead to a palace coup against\nSaddam and there would be a subsequent regime change.\n\nIn 1998, the US passed a law signed by Clinton authorising 97 billion US dollars to\nreplace the regime of Saddam with a democratic regime in Iraq. The task was entrusted to\nthe CIA. However, the 9/11 attacks changed all equations. In 2001, the US President was\nempowered with the Authorized use of Military Force (AVMF) to declare a war upon\nAfghanistan and Iraq for which the US President would not require authorisation from the\nUN Security Council. This led to the US invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 and of Iraq in\n2003. After the end of Gulf War, the UN had instructed Iraq to remove and dismantle all\nits chemical and biological weapons. Iraq had not complied with the directions of the UN.\nIn November, 2001, the UN Weapon Inspector Hans Blix informed the Security Council\nthat Iraq is in possession of Weapons of Mass Destruction. On 20th March, 2003, after\nfailure of Iraq to dismantle the weapons of Mass Destruction, the US invaded Iraq and\nlaunched operation Iraqi Freedom.\n\nSaddam was captured in December, 2003 and hanged subsequently after court’s\nverdicts. After Saddam’s capture, the ground was prepared in Iraq for democratic\nelections. Before we move further, we have to keep a few things in mind. Firstly, the\nMuslims living in Iraq are Shia and are in majority. Secondly, Saddam was a Sunni\nMuslim. The situation in Iraq under Saddam was that Shia majority nation was controlled\n\nby Sunni minority and a Sunni leader. When the US invaded Iraq, the US was determined\nto side with the Shias as they constituted the majority. This created an inherent sense of\nbetrayal and a rising number of Sunni extremist groups who unleashed violence and chaos\nin Iraq. One such prominent group was Jamat al Tawhid Wa-i-Jihad (JTWD). It was\nfounded in 1999 by Abu Musabal-Zarqawi in Jordan. Al-Zarqawi developed proximity to\nAl-Qaeda’s Osama Bin Laden in due course of time. In 2004, the JTWJ performed bay’ah\nand joined the Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI). The commonality of Al Qaeda and JTWT in Iraq\nwas the deep anti-Shia sentiment.\n\nIn 2006, Al-Zarqawi took steps to bring other pro-Sunni, anti-Shia groups fighting in\nIraq under a uniform banner and succeeded in knitting the organisations under Majilis\nShura-al-Mujaheeden (MSM). Al Zarqawi was killed in the same year in a US air strike.\nHe was succeeded by Al-Masri, with the Al-Qaeda in Iraq now transformed into Islamic\nState in Iraq (ISI). Abu Ayyub al-Masri announced that the new goal of ISI was to capture\nthe territory of Iraq which had passed into the hands of Nour Al Maliki (the Shia ruler who\nassumed power after elections in 2005 in Iraq). Al-Masri clarified that the goal of ISI is to\nestablish Sharia in Iraq.\n\nThe ISI began to capture the lands of the Anbar province in Iraq where Sunni\ndisenchantment with Shias was very high. The US forces in Iraq in 2007 began to take\nhelp of Shawat al Anbar to tackle ISI. As the US used Sahawat al Anbar, they began to\nsuccessfully wipe out ISI. In 2010, al-Masri died and was succeeded by Abu Bakr al-\nBaghdadi. Al-Baghdadi began to rework the structure of Islamic state of Iraq. He decided\nthat the group needs to broaden its thinking and reach. Al-Baghdadi repositioned the\ngroup, shifted base to Syria and renamed the group as the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant\n(ISIL). The shifting of ISIL in Syria upset the Al-Qaeda in Syria fighting against the\nAssad government and they decided to split from ISIL. Al-Baghdadi, on 21st June, 2014,\nannounced a new goal of ISIS or ISIL, that is the establishment of a Caliphate once again\nin the Islamic world, followed by its establishment in rest of the world later. Al-Baghdadi,\non 29th June, 2014, designated himself as the Caliph Ibrahim. ISIS has vowed affiliation\nto the Salafi-Jihadi ideology."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

On the other hand, ISIS has established\na proto-state in areas from where they carry out the attack on the periphery. The\nmajor issue in the fight against the ISIS is that the states are concerned about tackling\nthe periphery and not the core.

The root cause of\nthe uprising was the demand by Houthi for more autonomy with an aim to protect Houthi\nShias from cultural invasion by Sunni Muslims. This conflict lasted from 2004 to 2010. In\n2011, as the Arab Spring gripped the entire Arab World, the Houthis participated against\nthe Saleh government, which was being led by Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi as a de facto\nhead. In 2012, Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi came to power. In February 2014, National\nDialogue conference happened in Yemen. In the conference, Houthis also participated.\nThe conference spoke about dividing Yemen into a federation of six regions. The Houthis\nopposed the idea, saying that with the forming of such a federation, violence shall begin\nall over again. Houthis, being Shias, receive support from Iran and at present, control\nNorthern Yemen and the capital Sana.

In the 1980s, when there was a coup in Turkey, the army had\nblamed Gulen for plotting for an Islamic dictatorial government.

In 1999, Gulen went to the US for medical reasons and since then has stayed in\nthe US, living in exile in Pennsylvania today.

The\nunfolding international financial crises have created a dent on the global economy. As\nChina emerges as a strong player in this new unfolding global system, it has launched a\nnew initiative called One Belt and One Road (henceforth referred to as OBOR) Initiative.\nIt has just taken China a period of 40 years to transform itself from an agricultural\neconomy to the manufacturing powerhouse of the world. It has followed a unique model\nof producing commodities at home and exporting the commodities to developed global\nmarkets. However, the Chinese economy, in recent times, has witnessed a slowdown in\ngrowth which has led the Chinese government to look for new avenues of growth within\nits developing neighbours who are witnessing a growing demand. The aim of the OBOR\nproject is to create an economic land belt and a maritime link to redirect Chinese capital to\ndevelop infrastructure and trade capacity of ASEAN, Europe, Central Asia, Europe and\nAfrica. The idea of the Silk Road has been taken from the old Silk Road built by the Han\nDynasty, connecting Xian to the Roman Empire. In this mega trade network, the Chinese\nused to trade in silk, which inspired the German geographier named Ferdinand von\nRichthofentoco in the term, ‘Silk Road’ in the 19th century. The network built by Han\ndynasty reached its zenith during the Tang Dynasty when it emerged as a colossal network\nof lucrative trade and cultural exchange between China, India, Arabia, Persia, Rome and\nother Mediterranean nations.\n\nDuring the Mongol and Yuan dynasty regimes in India and China, rule as the political\npowers fragmented, the Silk Road declined in its significance. With the rise of Ottoman\nEmpire in 1453, the shipping route for silk also ceased to exist. Now, as China has\nachieved global resurgence, we see the revival of the ancient Silk Road in the 21st century\n\nin the form of OBOR. As China knows that its own domestic development is connected to\nthe development of Asia and beyond, it is now undertaking a mega initiative to establish\ninfrastructure in the neighbourhood to give effect to the OBOR. China’s ultimate goal is to\nuse OBOR to establish connect from China to Latin America, Africa, Europe, Central\nAsia, South East Asia and East Asia. The entire plan is based on the core spirit of the\nancient Silk Route.\n\n. 4 _ | Peaco,\n\nThe concept of the OBOR is based on certain principles where the broad aim is to\nestablish a multi-dimensional and multi-tiered connectivity to tap the market potential of\nthe region’s leading countries to aggressively undertake job creation and promotion of\nconsumption. The more important thing is that the OBOR has a very strong cultural\nagenda to enhance people-to-people contacts, trust and understanding to promote\nharmony, peace and prosperity. Not only does the OBOR rest upon mutual non-\ninterference in each other’s internal affairs, but also respect for the diverse development\npath adopted by a participating nation without any intention to change it. China does not\nwant the initiative to be restricted to old Silk Road nations but rather proposes a global\noutreach for all to participate, as the basis of the Silk Road is to garner and channelise the\nmarket forces of demand and supply.\n\nChina has a plan to involve more than 60 countries in the project and also plans to\nnegotiate Free Trade Agreement with all of them along the entire OBOR. Some studies\ndone by the Asian Development Bank suggests that China would require around 8 trillion\ndollars’ worth of investment for creating the needed infrastructure. China has created three\nfinancial institutions to support the OBOR. In February, 2014, China launched a 40-\nbillion-dollar silk road infrastructure fund, to be managed on the lines of China’s\nsovereign wealth fund. In October, 2014, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank was\nestablished as a global developmental bank for 21 Asian Nations, ranging from India to\nLaos to Oman to Uzbekistan, with a registered capital of 100 billion dollars. In July, 2014,\nwith a seed capital of 50 billion dollars, a new development bank was launched by BRICS\nnations.\n\nChina has conceptualised the OBOR based on two mega initiatives, both of which,\nonce complete, would impact around four billion people in the world from Asia, Europe\n\nand Africa.\n\n|_ Components = Maritime stkroad | _ Components = Sik read economic bolt\n\nThe OBOR is designed in a way that it will also impact the domestic economy of\nChina. China today has achieved an overcapacity in steel, cement and aluminium industry\nand would like to undertake exports to further stimulate its domestic economy. To do so,\nChina has divided its domestic territory into five different regions. In each identified\nregion, China will build infrastructure and use that infrastructure to establish a connect\nwith countries in the neighbourhood.

The\nEmperor of China has been given the divine authority to mirror heavenly order on\nearth. If the emperor fails to do so, he can be replaced. A successful revolution marks\nthe shifting of this mandate from one king to another.\n\nAlthough communism sees itself as rational, and so anti-religion and anti-\nmythology, the communist revolution under Mao Zedong effectively marked the shift\nin the Mandate of Heaven from the old order to the new. The rise of China into an\neconomic powerhouse under Deng Xiaoping also indicates yet another shift in the\nMandate of Heaven. The current leadership in China is now expanding its Pax Sinica.\n\n?\nul\n\n7\na\n\nby\n7\n\n(\n\\\n|\n\n|\n+\n\na :\n\n:\n\na\n\nGeography plays a key role in Chinese mythology. At the centre is the\nForbidden City (Beijing) around which is China and around which is the peripheral\nnations who look towards China for guidance to create heavenly order on earth.\nBeyond are the lands of chaos, whose people are best kept out using projects such as\nthe Great Wall of China.\n\nBy contrast, time (kala) plays a key role in Hindu mythology. Buddhism,\nJainism and Hinduism speak of a world that has no beginning (anadi), no end\n(ananta) and is always impermanent (anitya). Indian mythologies speak of great\nuniversal emperors (chakra-varti) but these are more conceptual than historical. India\nthrives in dynamic diversity, with multiple kingdoms that rise and fall from Mauryas\nto Guptas to Vakatakas to Rashtrakutas to Kadambas to Gangas to Pallavas to\nPandyas to Cholas to Nayakas to Mughals to British.\n\nThere is no Beijing equivalent in Hindu mythology, though Delhi is often\nprojected as such in post-Independence textbooks. India, known in Buddhist, Jain and\nHindu texts as Jambu-dvipa or Bharata-varsha or Arya-varta, is bound not by politics\nbut by religion; it has been united not by empires but by pilgrim routes, an idea that\nperplexes modern historians who try very hard to prove India is a creation of the\nBritish.\n\nIn Chinese mythology, there is authority and bureaucracy in heaven too. The\ngods enable the living to be successful, and successful mortals such as emperors,\nmilitary commanders and noblemen take the position of immortal gods. The highly\nformal, hierarchical and socially-responsible Confucianism, with its great regard for\nauthority, is balanced by the more mystical and occult Taoism, that speaks of\n\nharmony and flow.\n\nEssentially, the tone is highly materialistic and worldly in contrast to the other\nworldly nature of Indian mythologies, where the psychological matters more than the\nphysical. Jain, Buddhist and Hindu mythologies place great value on yoga, the un-\ncrumpling of the mind crumpled by hunger and fear.\n\nIn Chinese worldview, India is seen in two ways. Firstly, it embodies luan,\nchaos. This chaos threatens the Chinese sense of order. This makes India a perpetual\nthreat. It makes the Chinese leadership nervous. Secondly, India is Sukhavati, the\nWestern Paradise in Chinese Buddhism, source of great spiritual wisdom. It speaks\nabout transcending materialism to be free of suffering, an idea that invalidates the\npromise of the material philosophies, be it communism or capitalism.\n\nUntil the arrival of the Europeans, Buddhism was the only foreign idea that has\nhad a dramatic impact on Chinese history. Since then, China watches with trepidation\nthe rising tide of Christian evangelism in South Korea and Singapore, and Islam on\nits Western borders, and the hurricane of technology coming from the West. The\nChinese way is eroding, unless the Emperor takes charge. Hence, OBOR.\n\nFor the OBOR to succeed, China has decided to cooperate upon some core priority\nareas with participating states. At an initial level, China envisages policy coordination to\nbe undertaken through multi-level intergovernmental macro policy exchange and\ncommunication mechanisms. The second priority is to strengthen sub regional and border\ninfrastructure, with a strong focus on promoting a green and low carbon infrastructure\ncreation. At the infrastructural level, there are priority areas.\n\nAt the soft policy level, China intends to use OBOR to connect to people of different\nnations through scholar exchanges, tourism, films, cultural years, art festivals, TV\nprogrammes, and so on. Another core dimension is health based cooperation where the\naim is to collaborate to address public health energies, with expanded cooperation in the\nidea of traditional medicine. There is also renewed emphasis upon youth employment,\nentrepreneurship training and skill development to accelerate regional and multilateral\nintegration under which various cooperative mechanisms are to be used.\n\nn Lil\n\nChina-Arab States Cooperation Forum ‘Shanghai Cooperation Organization\n¥ 4\nCentral Asia Regional\nEoor C ~ ASEAN Plus China\nChina~Gulf Cooperation .~ “\nCouneit Strategic Dialogue Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation\n\n‘Asia Cooperation Dialogue ‘Asia-Europe Meeting\n\nChina has identified the China—Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and\nBangladesh-China—India-Myanmar (BCIM-EC) economic corridor as key initiatives\nbroadly associated with OBOR.

The relations have deepened to the extent that\nChina has been willing to supply nuclear materials to Pakistan. Pakistan has acted as a\nbridge for the US and China during the Cold War and a frontline state for the US to\ncontain Soviets in last stages of the same. Today, China clearly believes that Pakistan has a\ncore part to play in its transition to a global power as it lies at the heart of China’s plan for\nports and railways for oil and gas. As China engages more with the Islamic world for\nresources, the more it would need Pakistan to counter the influence of rising Islamic\nextremism so that it brings stability in the western periphery of China and also in its Islam\ndominated domestic provinces like Xinjang.\n\nThis relation is based largely on self-interest of China, which intends to expand and\nreach out to the world. Apart from this, Pakistan otherwise serves no deep interests for\nChina. It is rather an investment by China in its own geopolitical well-being than any sort\nof expectation of a quid pro quo. One of the greatest achievements of this long-standing\nfriendship is the China—Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The CPEC comes at a time\nof growing geopolitical ambition of China, being partly a developmental initiative and\npartly a strategic gambit. One of the important aims of the CPEC is to bolster the Pakistani\neconomy by addressing the key infrastructure constraints in Pakistan and facilitate the\ndevelopment of Pakistan by establishing a connect from Kashgar in China to Gwadar in\nPakistan. In March, 2015, China’s National Development and Reform Committee\nannounced the One Belt, One Road Initiative. The CPEC is a part of the OBOR and was\nformalised in April 2015 between Pakistan and China, who concluded around 51\nmemorandums of understanding with a total investment of 46 billion dollars.\n\nThe OBOR has an overland component called the Silk Road Economic Belt (SREB)\nand a maritime component called the Maritime Silk Road (MSR). The CPEC is a flagship\nproject which will have the potential to serve as a fusion of MSR and SREB. It is now\nbelieved that the conclusion of CPEC as a link from Arabian Sea from Pakistan to China\nthrough land based CPEC can help alleviate the Chinese Malaccan dilemma. China also\nfaces threat due to rising Islamic extremism in Xinjiang province, especially from ethnic\nfigures. Over a period of time, the Uyghurs have taken refuge in Pakistan. The Uyghur\nextremists have established relations with Al-Qaeda, Taliban and other Pakistani\nextremists, and China feels that such a relation might endanger Chinese interests in\nPakistan. Thus, China’s CPEC is designed to create jobs in Pakistan and reduce anti-state\nsentiments, thereby providing more resources for Pakistani security agencies which\n\nPakistan would use to safeguard the corridor. The CPEC is created in the manner that it\nwill help Pakistan generate revenues to quell the Jihadi threats, thereby ultimately helping\nChina to protect its own western periphery alongside, giving it an alternative route to the\nStrait of Malacca. Pakistan also feels that the project will help it to gain mileage politically\nin elections and also strengthen Pakistan against India.\n\nAs per the plan, China will invest in industrial power, railways, expressways and\nenergy stations from Kashgar in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region to Gwadar port in\nthe 2000 km long belt.\n\n[sgt ]\n| _Rastgae vet adar | Z\n\nOnce the CPEC materialises, it will be a blessing for the economy of Pakistan and\nwill transform the country into a regional trade and energy hub. From the Chinese point of\nview, successful materialisation of the OBOR and CPEC would help China achieve the\ndream of constructive engagement announced by Xi Jinping. It will reduce Chinese\nvulnerability to oceanic piracy and provide China an opportunity to connect with South,\nCentral and West Asia. One of the options for India is to protest against CPEC as it passes\nthrough disputed territory, but, this protest ultimately cannot halt the CPEC project. C\nRaja Mohan aptly suggests that an alternative is that India open up its land routes for\nChina to connect to Pakistan, by which India can also eventually gain economically.\n\n'"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

There are three broad\nperspectives that can be used to study the history of a sovereign dispute. The first\nperspective in International Relations is called the national perspective. Under this, we try\nto study the history of the territory as far as possible to look for evidences that the piece of\nland in question has always been a part of the national patrimony. Then, using the\nanalysis, we demonstrate that the piece of land has always been under some sovereign\ncontrol through various mechanisms ranging from occupation to utilisation of the land in\nquestion. In the second perspective, we use a non-partisan legal treatise and try to\nestablish a chronology of all conflicting claims made to the sovereign piece of land and\nthen evaluate the chronology on the basis of merits, as per international law. In the third\nperspective, we try to study the dispute as a part of international history. While doing this,\nwe analyse the events through the prism of a change in balance of power vis-a-vis the\ninternational system. In a nutshell, in to the process of resolution of any sovereign dispute,\n\nhistory plays an important role. In our attempt to analyse the SCS dispute, the parties\ninvolved in the conflict are making claims on the basis of ancient documents. Therefore,\nto understand the issue better, we shall need a quick overview of the earlier periods.\n\nHistorically, the SCS has always been used for the purpose of communication by\nsmall and large ships. This route of communication goes back to almost two thousand\nyears. As the ships passed through the region, it also gave rise to powerful states all along\nthe route which used the income from merchant vessels transiting the seas to sustain their\nstates.\n\nin the region due\n\nmarine communication\n\nThe rulers of all these states used to tax the ships passing by and maritime\ncommunication and trade certainly acted as a source of revenue. The trade in the Malacca\nStrait region was dominated by traders of Sri Vijaya state in the period from 8th to 12th\ncentury. In the period from 12th to 15th century, the Chinese emperor suddenly ordered a\nhalt to expansion and building of ocean going ships. This sudden halt by the Chinese\nemperor gave Japanese, Koreans, Persians and Arabs an opportunity. The subsequent\nperiod witnessed Arabs and Persians not only resorting to maritime trade in the region but\nalso bringing Islam to the region. In this long-distance trade, the Malaya language\nemerged as a lingua franca. The trade was dominated by Chinese ceramics, silk and\nSoutheast Asian spices. In the 16th century, the region witnessed an inflow of commercial\ntrading ships from Europe circumventing through Africa, with Europeans establishing\ntrading bases in areas like Macau, Manila, Melaka, Formosa. As the ships used to pass\nthrough the region here, the captains of the ships used to steer their ships away from two\nreefs—namely Paracel and Spratly—which the captains used to perceive as danger zones\nin the middle of the sea. They did not know about a passageway between the two reefs\nthat existed which, in modern times, is used as a transit route. Thus, at times during that\nperiod, the captains of the ships, during hostile weather, would often drop their wrecks\ncontaining merchandise on the reefs. Also, there have been some historical instances when\nthe emperors in the region would authorise plunder of the shipwrecks. Today, such\nplunders are used as arguments to claim sovereignty which itself are dubious as the\nmodern law at the international level requires proof to show exercise of sovereignty and\nnot economic plunder to establish claims.\n\n% 4\n\\ y,\n\\ yr\n\nwe a\n=e | om\n\nThe pre-modern era saw a continuation of this with important powers such as the\nBritish, French, Spanish and Dutch passing through the route in the colonial period.\nbecame. During the colonial era, based on the concept of territorial sovereignty, new states\nwere constructed by the European colonisers. During the era of colonial rule, the British\nestablished their presence in Singapore, Melaka, Hongkong and north Borneo. As a result,\nthe Dutch began to merge all their possessions into the ‘Netherlands Indes’ while Spain\ndeepened their presence in the Philippines. France colonised Indochina from 1863\nonwards. After Japan won the Sino-Japanese war in 1895 and the US won the Spanish—\nAmerican War of 1898, it led to rise of five mega external powers in the South China Sea.\n\nColonial naval condominium\nin South China Sea\n\nAs Europe began to slip into alliance formations, Japan allied with the British (in\n1902) but the power relations amongst Japan and the four other powers got affected when\nthe issue of the settlement post World War-I came up. The period after World War-I saw\nJapan diplomatically losing power as power relations post-war began to be dominated by\nthe four western nations. Restrictions were imposed upon Japan about the number of ships\nit could build while also making it give up its Chinese possessions. This ultimately led to\nthe emergence of the Asianist ideology spearheaded by Japan based upon anti-western\ndomination. Japan resorted to consolidating its position by increasing its commerce and\ndomestic production by using resources like guano from islands and the reefs of South\nChina Sea. In the interwar period, Japan occupied Manchuria in 1932 and won a war with\nChina, precipitating a crisis in the South China Sea. This compelled the western powers to\nconsolidate their positions to check the expansionism of Japan.\n\nNo power used to pay attention to the islets in the SCS, but all of them did perceive\nthe islets as a source of danger. The British captains began to give British names to these\nislands. One of such name to an archipelago was ‘Spratly’. The British, who had\ndesignated these islands as dangerous grounds, began to undertake surveys. The eastern\nSpratly was to be avoided for sailing while there commended route to sail was through the\nPalawan islands. As the oceanographic expeditions began, the surveys found that during\nsome parts of year, the islands were inhabited by nomadic fisherman speaking Hainanese\n\ndialects who primarily lived in Hainan. The British had established a Protectorate in\nNorthern Borneo and had a governor in Labuan, which was an island in the north of\nBorneo. In the 1870s, same merchants in Northern Borneo sought some concessions from\nthe British Governor in Labuan to use guano on Spratly and Amboyna Cay. In 1877,\nsubsequently, the British asserted a formal claim on Amboyna Cay and Spratly. In modern\ntimes, this British claim emerged as one of its kind during this period. In the British\ncolonial office list, the British annually made mention of Spratly and Amboyna Cay as\nBritish possessions.\n\nParacel island was a larger island along Singapore to Hong Kong shipping route to\nwhich no European power made claims to. After the decline of the Qing dynasty in China,\neven China did not make any claims to these islands, including small ones like Pratas. In\n1932, even the British decided to give up their claims to Spratly islands and Amboyna cay.\nHowever, a renewed interest to claim Paracel and Spratly was generated when Japan\nbegan to assert its strength. In 1932, when Japan invaded Manchuria, it generated\ntremendous insecurity in the western world. Japan had already been exploiting the guano\nfrom Paracel and Spratly islands, and it turned out that the Japanese presence was not just\ncommercial but also strategic in its expansion southwards. The fear of Japanese\nexpansionism made France to assert claims on Spratly and Paracel. To forestall any\naggression by Japan, in the period from 1930 to 1933 France claimed and occupied the\nislands. The British did not object to French claims as the British had given up claims to\nSpratly in 1932. In 1938, when China—Japan war broke out, the French established their\npermanent presence in the Paracel island to which the Japanese protested while the British\ndid not. In 1939, Japan invaded Taiwan and claimed the entire archipelago of Spratly as\nJapanese territory. The island was used as a military base to invade Philippines in World\nWar-II and the Japanese also drove out the French from one of the largest islands on\nspartly—ItuAba (Taiping Island).\n\n“Focneome St | SP eee\nx\n\nFrom 1942 to 1968, the countries around the South China Sea witnessed change as\nthe colonial rules were now replaced with new independent states which were all divided\nby Cold War ideologies. After the World War-II ended, the Chinese government of\nChiang Kai-Shek sent a naval expedition in 1946 to Paracel and Spratly and established\npermanent presence on the Aba and Woody Islands. A dotted U-shaped line was\nestablished in 1948 by the government in Nanjing in the entire SCS territory. However, its\nlegal status was not clarified by China. In 1946, the French sent expeditions and\nestablished a permanent presence on Pattle Island on the western part of Paracel. In 1949,\nthe Chiang Kai-Shek government was chased away from mainland China and it fled to\nTaiwan. In the 1950s, the Chinese troops from Spratly and Paracel were removed. The\nFrench did not make any claims on the islands previously held by Ching Kai-Shek but\ndefended their presence in Pattle island. Vietnam had two regimes—one led by the Ho Chi\n\nMinh, which supported the claims of People’s Republic of China and the Bao Dai-led state\nof Vietnam, supported by the US and Britain, which did not.\n\nIn 1951, at the San Francisco Peace Conference, Japan agreed to leave Taiwan and\nHainan for China. Japan also decided to abandon claims on the islands in South China Sea\nbut did not clarify to which player the other islands would be ceded. At the conference in\nSan Francisco, there was no representation of China, while France and Vietnam continued\nto make own claims on islands of Paracel and Spratly. The British and the Americans were\nof the view that Paracel and Spratly were not strategically or economically important and\nthus allowed the issue to remain unsettled. Since Japan relinquished any claim to Taiwan,\nPescadores, and Paracel and Spratly, the treaty gave the impression that Paracel and\nSpratly were henceforth a part of China. After the division of Vietnam along the 17th\nparallel at Geneva conference in 1954, in Philippines, two maritime activists Tomas\nCloma and Filemon Cloma began to assert claims on Spratly, stating that Japan had\nabandoned all claims. The Cloma party proclaimed Freedom land or Kalaya’an by\noccupying a number of islands. This led to Taiwan counter-claiming Spratly. In 1950,\nTaiwan reoccupied the Itu Aba island and since 1971, has established a permanent\noccupation on Itu Aba. This led to PRC claiming Woody Island where it established a\npermanent presence, while, South Vietnam also protested against the Cloma party and\nbegan to claim Spratly. Due to Nikita Khrushchev’s rapprochement with US, the Sino-\nSoviet split occurred in 1969, paving way for Sino—US rapprochement from 1972. In the\nsubsequent period of Sino—US rapprochement, the Chinese government undertook naval\nexpansion to re-emerge as a dominant naval player in the region.\n\nIn this period, 1971-72 to 1989, the UNCLOS-3 and the discovery of oil changed the\nstakes involved in the SCS. As oil surveys were being carried out, there was renewed\ninterest in the world to discuss how far from the shore of a coastal state national\njurisdiction of a continent shelf could extend. This also led to the UNCLOS-3\nnegotiations which began in 1973 and extended to 1983. During UNCLOS-3 negotiations,\nas the concept of EEZ was being pushed, the South East Asians began to be tempted to\nclaim the Spratly islands. In 1982, the UNCLOS-3 finally accepted the 200 nautical mile\nlimit for EEZ and this was enforced in 1994 after 60 states ratified the instrument of\nratification. The period from 1969 to 1972 had already seen an aggressive attempt by\nstates around SCS to push off-shore oil agendas. In 1971, Philippines had declared\nKalayan as a part of its territory and had allowed oil firms to explore oil. In 1973, South\nVietnam had given the US oil blocks for oil exploration in western region of Spratly. As\nthe US—Vietnam war ended with the Paris Accord in 1973, Vietnam was eventually\nunified into a Socialist Republic of Vietnam In 1974, in a Vietnam—China conflict, China\nsnatched away Paracel islands from Vietnam. This subsequently unfolded as an outright\nconflict between two distinct ideologies—namely, communist Vietnam and China. Since\nthe 1974 war, Vietnam began to increase the presence in Spratly. Vietnam had received\nSoviet supported all along. In 1978, when Vietnam invaded Cambodia, it led to the\nisolation of Vietnam in the region. But even during this period, Vietnam continued to\nextend oil concessions to oil consortiums in SCS. China often objected to such\nconcessions when they were made within the dotted U-shaped line. After the ratification\nof UNCLOS-3 in 1982, the only way China could make a claim to the continental shelf in\ncentral SCS was to base claims based upon possessions of island of Spratly.\n\nIn Spratly, the only two claimants were Brunei and China who occupied no features,\nthus compelling China to enter the scramble of Spratly. In Russia, when Mikhail\nGorbachev assumed power, he decided to scale down Soviet naval deployments abroad.\nThis gave China an opportunity and in 1987, the Chinese sent an expedition in the region.\nIn 1988, there was again a conflict and China established presence in Spratly. Vietnam\nwithdrew from Cambodia in 1989, thereby ending its isolation and paving way for a\nregion power constellation in the post-Cold War period.\n\nAs the cold war ended, there was a sense that the US will withdraw from the South\nEast and East Asia as its strategic goals to contain the Soviets had ended. As the debate on\na power vacuum left by the US was raging, China became a possible filler. As Chinese\neconomy and military had grown aggressively after its transition during the Cold War,\nthere was a perceived fear of Chinese assertiveness. In 1995, the Chinese had built upon\nan artificial island on Mischief Reef in Spratly, located very close to the Philippines. As\nTaiwan was gearing up for its first presidential election, during a military exercise by\nChina in 1996 in the Taiwan Straits, it launched a few missiles. This incident brought the\nUS back into the picture as it sent a US carrier force into Taiwan Strait to signal China that\nit would not tolerate any interference or restriction on its maritime activity in the SCS.\n\nIn 1992, at a meeting of foreign ministers of ASEAN, all nations had agreed upon a\njoint declaration on SCS with a commonly agreed principle of not using any violence in\nthe dispute settlement. As ASEAN expanded at the end of the Cold War, it brought\nCambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Myanmar and Brunei within its fold. The 10-member ASEAN\nblock had nations which had claims on territories in the SCS. In the first decade since the\nend of the Cold War, China, however, insisted that it would resolve all disputes in SCS\nbilaterally with the states. In 1999, ASEAN adopted a draft code of conduct putting an end\nto more occupation of reefs in the SCS. China again proposed that joint cooperation be the\ncore value in dispute settlement. In 2002, the draft code of conduct was finally adopted as\na Declaration of Conduct of Parties as conflicts had flared up repeatedly due to China’s\nassertiveness and territorial claims in the SCS due to the presence of oil and gas region. In\nthe recent past, we have witnessed China asserting itself over the “nine-dash line” to\nvirtually claim the entire South China Sea. Countries in the region and the US have\nblamed China for aggressively militarising the SCS. China has been resorting to a passive-\naggressive strategy to state claims.\n\nAfter years of vee futile negotiations at a bilateral level with China, the\nPhilippines, decided to take the issue to the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in\n\nJanuary, 2013. China completely opposed it, advocating that the issue needs to be resolved\nbilaterally.\n\nThe reason for the Philippines suddenly dragging China to the PCA was that China\nhad escalated the tension by taking control of the disputed Scarborough Shoal in 2012.\nTensions further got aggravated in 2012 when Chinese vessels began to poach marine\nspecies at Scarborough Shoal and Chinese surveillance strips prevented the authorities of\nPhilippines to apprehend them. In July, 2016, after three years of intense deliberations on\nthe SCS, the tribunal came out with a 501-page award in favour of Philippines.\n\ne&E>\npemntnn dior) Kasha \"a\n\nHowever, China has refused to follow the verdict of the PCA. Considering the fact\nthat PCA lacks an enforcement mechanism, nothing on the ground is likely to change,\nthough the verdict is a morale booster for Philippines. The award is, however, likely to\nheavily affect diplomatic and economic ties between China and Philippines.\n\nIndia is not a party to the dispute in the South China Sea. However, as it explore soil\n\njointly with Vietnam and also uses the sea lanes of communication for commerce, in the\nrecent times, it has evolved a stand based on the points above.\n\n™\n‘China damaged coral reefs\n=\n\n|\n\n|"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

India always had a theoretical policy\nof extending influence in the neighborhood. However, it was only after it embraced\nglobalisation that India began to use its rising economic power as a tool to fulfill its\nambition of emerging as a great power. Afghanistan stands to be a step in India’s global\nquest. The Indo—Afghan relationship chapter has explained the security, economic and\nstrategic components of diplomacy used by India in Afghanistan. For India, a stable\nAfghanistan is very crucial as it will avert the spread of extremism to Kashmir. More\nimportantly, India feels that Afghanistan also is a land bridge to resources-rich central\nAsia region. Thus, for India, Afghanistan is not only strategic due to security concerns but\nalso crucial for achieving the economic resurgence of India. A long-term interest of India\ntherefore, is a stable and peaceful Afghanistan. In this regard, the chapter of India—\nAfghanistan relations has explained the initiatives of India to develop infrastructure,\nhealth and education in Afghanistan, India has contributed to develop Afghanistan\ninternally by providing capacity building to Afghanis at all levels, from the army to police\nto healthcare, under the agreement on strategic partnership signed by the two sides in\n2011.\n\nIn the recent times, India has gradually begun to support the integration of tribal\nfighters who are willing to abjure violence. In early 2017, India has started sending feelers\n\nto the Afghan government especially after the Afghan government achieved success in\nnegotiating a deal with Hekmatyar. India has declared support to an Afghan led and\nAfghan owned peace process in the future, as it is quite aware of the possibility of the\nreturn of Taliban to Afghanistan. As India has remained committed to soft power play and\nhas supported Afghanistan in its development, there is a rising call by Afghan government\nto seek military support from India. One reason why India has remained reluctant in\nproviding military hardware (as requested by Afghanistan since 2013) is because it feels\nthat such a support could probably provoke the Taliban and instigate Pakistan to increase\nhostilities with India. India feels that military support would probably also dent India’s\nimage as an aid provider to Afghanistan. Many in Afghanistan, however, have perceived\nIndia’s lack of support at military level as a myopic decision. As Taliban leadership\nundergoes a change, any hardliner at the helm of the Taliban will be detrimental to the\nsecurity interests of India. For India, a key challenge in Afghanistan in future would be\nChina. China has not only enhanced its economic footprint in the region, but has taken a\nmore pro-active interest than India in initiating a dialogue with Taliban.

India criticised the test and advised North Korea to refrain\nfrom such tests in the future. India also described the tests as a matter of grave concern as\nsuch tests affect the stability and peace of the entire region. The statement issued by India\non North Korea’s nuclear tests expressed serious concern about India’s national security\ndue to the proliferation of nuclear technology and missiles around it. Pakistan—North\nKorea ties go back to the times of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Bhutto visited North Korea in 1976\nand Pakistan purchased Long Range Missiles from North Korea and, in reciprocity,\ndecided to help North Korea with nuclear enrichment technology. In January, 2016, during\na nuclear test by North Korea, India’s MEA observed the proliferation links between\nIndia’s neighbours and North East Asia. India’s MEA asserted that such ties are well\nknown to the USA and South Korea and both have resorted to use UN sanctions as a\nmechanism to isolate North Korea. Both have repeatedly urged North Korea to give up its\nnuclear programme but have failed to create the needed deterrents. The main concern of\nIndia is that although the international community acknowledges and condemns the\nnuclear programme of North Korea, it does not acknowledge the network that North\nKorea and Pakistan have established, which, in future, is likely to emerge as a threat. India\nis concerned about the ability of North Korea to manufacture plutonium, which is being\nused to make miniature plutonium bombs. It is also quite likely that Pakistan, which failed\nto conduct a plutonium test device in 1998, can today develop miniature weapons grade\nplutonium devices, since it has had help from North Korea. India has condemned all\nnuclear tests done by North Korea in 2017.

India has started asserting its\nnational interests with a new self-confidence vis-a-vis its more powerful neighbour. This is\n\nalso reflected in the way India has embraced Taiwan. China is now willing to cooperate\nwith India in Afghanistan as well. As the ISIS threat looms large over China, it has found\ncooperation with India and Russia more fruitful in the process. In the backdrop of Chinese\nrefusal to designate Masood Azhar as terrorist and its refusal to allow India’s accession to\nthe NSG, India has decided to work upon the insensitivities of China. The invitation of the\nDalai Lama to Arunachal Pradesh in 2017 is a testimony. India is leveraging the Dalai\nLama as under its new Act East Policy, India is eager to use the tool of Buddhism as a\nconnector. India’s relations with the Dalai Lama has been viewed by China as a violation\nof its core interests.\n\nIn the 21st century power transition, China is not exactly attempting to overthrow the\nUSA as a dominant power but wants to establish its credentials as a parallel global power.\nChina is aiming at multipolarity and does not wish to breakdown mechanisms that exist.\nThe Asian infrastructure investment bank (AIIB) of China is an effective example. As the\neconomic benefits were immense, India joined the AIIB. The Maritime Silk Road (MSR)\nhas given Chinese some space in the Indian Ocean. They have increased their economic\nimprint in the island states through port construction. The Chinese have converted their\ndebts in island states into equities. This has, in turn, raised concerns for India. There are\nstrategic angles attached to the MSR and India needs a coherent strategy to tackle the\nsame. As no clarity exists on structures and rights, responsibilities and stakes in MSR,\nIndia has shown reluctance in joining the same. Under the One Belt One Road (OBOR),\nChina is constructing the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC as explained in the\nchapter of issues related to China). India’s official position is that as the CPEC passes\nthrough Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK), which is a disputed territory, it is actually\npassing through illegally obtained land. India asserts that China has not shown any\nunderstanding of India’s sovereign claims and thereby it will not be part of OBOR. In May\n2017, China organised a Belt and Road Initiative Summit (BRIS), where India refused to\nparticipate. India has asserted that China has to clarify through a statement that it is not\nsupportive of any Pakistani claims over Kashmir. India feels that OBOR is a national\ninitiative of China to enhance its connectivity all over to ensure that it is able to sustain its\nlow-cost manufacturing programme (which is declining due to rising domestic wages in\nChina) by integrating itself to global value chains. India has to decide carefully whether it\nshould allow its political differences with China to prevent an effective economic\ninteraction or not."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Russia has opposed unilateral\nUSA military interventions in Iraq, Libya and Syria. Russians backed the Assad regime\nand continues to counter the Islamic State (ISIS). Crimea had been gifted to Ukraine in\n1954 but Putin annexed the province back. Russia has become a new partner to China at a\ntime when the west is busy demonising Russia. As far as India is concerned, Russia has\nalways supported India on important and defining issues like Kashmir, terrorism,\ntechnology, military equipment and so forth. India and Russia, as explained in the chapter\nof India—Russia relationship, have established a new partnership in the energy sector. As\nIndia is rising on the global scene, it is increasingly partnering with the west. The recent\nIndo-USA LEMOA is a testimony to the rising Indo—west proximity. The post-Cold War\nera has seen a shift in India’s armament policy, inducting France, Israel and USA, in a\nfield that had always been dominated by Russia. As France, Israel and USA increase their\npresence in India’s armament supply, it shrinks in space for Russians. On the other hand,\nRussia wants to explore new markets for its arms and energy. It is the shrink of Indian\nspace for arms supply that has motivated the Russians to look at Pakistan.\n\nThe US—Pakistan relations have not been very smooth lately. Due to a number of\nstrains in the US—Pakistan relations, Pakistan does not want to be dependent solely upon\nthe US in future. Pakistan too has demonstrated an openness to explore a relationship with\nRussia. The world is witnessing not just a multipolar world, but a huge spectrum of\nmultiple alliance building based upon linkages and dependency. As the US tries to contain\nChina, China has gone on to get the Yuan accepted as a world currency at the IMF to build\nup a new hegemony of US-China where both continue to dominate the international\nfinancial architecture. Russia has been quite cautious and it is carefully exploring whether\nthe Chinese belt and road initiative is actually Chinese foray into the Russian backyard of\nCentral Asia. One of the key motivations of Russia is to keep China in check, which has\ncompelled Russia to balance China by improving relations with Pakistan, which is in the\nbackyard of China.\n\nThere is potential re-alignment of power structure witnessed where a Russia—~China—\nPakistan axis could also emerge. Such an axis could use its combined effort to challenge\nthe unipolarity of the US in global affairs. The Trump Administration is undertaking more\nassertion of US power in the world and it could meet the China—Russia—Pakistan axis as a\npotential challenger. The Sino—US rivalry in the Indo-Pacific and recent events in 2016—\n2017 point out to a rising discomfort between the US and China. Russia not only rejected\nthe verdict of the tribunal on South China Sea but also went ahead with a bilateral naval\nexercise with China in the disputed region, raising further concerns. The Russia—China\naxis has been a channel to promote strategic co-operation to resist US hegemony but the\ninclusion of Pakistan in the matrix of Russia~China makes a compelling case for the\ncommencement of a new Cold War. Russia is not only trying to rebalance the region but is\npositioning itself through a new diplomatic space to project Russia back on to the centre\nstage in global affairs. The new geo-strategic goal of Russia is to check USA hegemony.\n\nWhat feeds the Russian matrix is the entry of Pakistan. Pakistan has been a core ally\nof the US but the sanctuary of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan and its support to terrorist\ngroups has brought the US and Pakistan on two opposing sides of a continuum. As the\nnumber of players of west and their support to Pakistan dwindles, the entry of Russian on\nthe scene opens a new strategic front for Pakistan. The gradually solidifying alliance of\nIndia with the USA hurts Russia as it can foresee that its role as the sole defence supplier\nto India will be compromised by aggressive US suppliers in the future. The signing of\nLEMOA has also exacerbated Russian fears. In 2016, Russia and Pakistan undertook a\nmilitary exercise known as Druzhva 2016 or Friendship 2016, between Pakistan army and\nRussian ground forces, at the special force training centre in Cherat in North Pakistan. It\nlasted as a drill for two weeks where the two sides worked together on combat\npreparedness at high altitudes. Despite the fact that Russia and Pakistan have been rivals\nduring the Cold War (the USA used Pakistan to breed Mujahideens against the Soviet\ninvasion of Afghanistan), the defence exercise marks a new shift in the ties. In 2014, the\narms embargo on Pakistan imposed by Russia was removed and in 2015, Pakistan\npurchased four MI-35 helicopters from Russia. This should act as a wakeup call for India\nto not take Russia for granted. The USA—Pakistan relations post-2011, when Osama bin\nLaden was executed by US forces on Pakistani soil, have been very strained. The US also\nrefused the sale of F-16 jets to Pakistan. This compelled them to purchase military\naircrafts from Jordan. Pakistan is also trying to build up a hedge against USA by\ndeveloping proximity to Russia.\n\nThe Russia—Pakistan relationship is also visible in Afghanistan in their support of the\nAfghan deal with erstwhile terror groups. In Afghanistan, there is a militant group called\nHizb-e-Islami (Hel). It is the second largest militant group of Afghanistan. In 2016, there\nwas a 25-page deal that was concluded between the Afghan Government and Hel that\ngranted immunity to Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. Hekmatyar was an erstwhile warlord, who\n\nwas the Afghanistani Prime Minister in 1990s and has been a recipient of US support in\nanti-Soviet campaign. After the withdrawal of the Soviets from Afghanistan post the\nGeneva Accord, Hezb-e-Islamihad unleashed violence in Afghanistan to capture power in\nKabul. The intensity of violence unleashed got Hekmatyar the moniker of the ‘Butcher of\nKabul’. Hekmatyar later left Afghanistan when the Taliban captured power in 1996. In\n2003, the USA designated Hekmatyaras a terrorist. In recent times, as the Hizb-e-\nIslamitoned down the intensity of violence, the Afghanistan government extended an olive\nbranch and initiated negotiations. This led to the conclusion of deals between Hekmatyar\nand Afghan government in 2016. The deal is significant as it is a first deal by the Afghan\ngovernment without any UN mediation. There is a possibility that the deal could have a\npositive spill over on other groups to initiate rapprochement. The deal does prove that\npeace with rebel groups is possible. The Taliban and its spokesperson, Zabinullah\nMujahid, has refrained from commenting upon the deal. Hizb-e-Islami controls the\nShamshatu area in Peshawar where it has camps harbouring 10,000-plus refugees, now\nreturned to Afghanistan. The returning families will get help from the international\ncommunity.\n\nThe return of Hekmatyar will also bring various fractions of Hizb-e-Islami within a\npeaceful framework. But there are likely challenges ahead as well. The return of\nHekmatyar will reinitiate the rivalry between the HezB and Jamat group. If the Shamshatu\npeople return to Afghanistan, it will give Hekmatyar a space for mobilisation to pressurise\nthe Afghan government. The deal does not talk about the fate of Hizb-e-Islami militias and\ntheir return of weapons. This may complicate issues as nothing on disarmament is\nmentioned. Whether Hizb-e-Islami will go through disarmament, demobilisation and\nreintegration (DDR) is not very clear.\n\nAn emerging view is that the Hizb-e-Islami could pursue a policy of strategic depth\nin collaboration with Pakistan to keep India out of Afghanistan. It is believed that this\ncould emerge as a possibility as Russia and China had been in favour of such a deal.\nRussia and China have also initiated a dialogue with other good Taliban. India, on other\nhand, refrained from any talks with the good Taliban or bad Taliban as it feels that Taliban,\nas a terrorist organisation, can’t have good or bad elements. India’s fears have been\nenhanced after the deal because it knows that Hekmatyar has his roots in Pakistan, which\nnot only created Hekmatyar but also nurtured him. The ISI and Hamid Gul had at one\npoint had called Hekmatyar as a great Pakistani. Indian concerns have been on an all-time\nhigh since the deal."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

In 1957, the trade\nbetween the above states saw the rise of a comprehensive framework governing the trade.\nIn the same year, the Treaty of Rome was signed, setting up the European Economic\nCommunity (EEC) as a common market. Gradually, the EEC kept on expanding and\nbecame a union of 28 states. In 1990, a meeting of the European Council was held in\nRome which initiated an inter-governmental conference on establishment of a monetary\n\nunion.

The procedure to leave EU began from March, 2017\nand is to be completed by March, 2019. We can have a look at the impact of Brexit on\nIndian economy in the short run and in the long run.\n\nThe impact of Brexit on the Indian economy on the immediate level will be\ncomparatively less due to a rise in agricultural production in India. The consumer industry\ndemand in India did slow down due to demonetisation but it is picking up due to the\nratification of the 7th Pay Commission. The exports to and from India have fallen in UK\ndue to a weak demand in the Euro zone and Britain, since the Eurozone crises. Post-Brexit\nthe possibility of dip in exports may rise as currencies will fluctuate and the real picture\nwill only emerge upon the basis of appreciation of other currencies with the Pound. The\nprocess will also create an impact on outbound FDI from India to the UK, which today\nstands to be at 8% of the total FDI. As India export automobiles, it will affect our exports\nto the EU and the UK. The deeper impact is to be on IT exports, which constitutes the core\nof Indian exports to the UK. Other commodities like metals, pharmacy, garments and\nfinancial service will also feel the pinch. As the number of EU applications for education\nto the UK will fall, it will be favourable for Indian students for outbound education\nseekers. A depreciation of the Pound will lead to short term gain for Indian students as the\ncost of education will decrease.\n\nOne of the big reasons for a 51.9% UK vote to leave EU was the free movement of\nlabour in the UK.

In the 13th and 14th centuries, the centre of gravity in the region\nshifted to Moscow and since then, Russia has been a force on the global scene. In modern\ntimes, Ukraine had an independent existence only for a limited period in the 17th and 18th\ncenturies. In the post-World War-II Europe, Ukraine has the second largest area and below\nUkraine was the Crimean peninsula. In the period from 1853 to 1856, the region witnessed\nthe Crimean War, in which the Russian Empire lost to an alliance of the Ottoman Empire,\nFrance, Britain and Sardinia. The immediate cause involved the rights of Christian\nminorities in the Holy Land, which was a part of the Ottoman Empire. The French\npromoted the rights of Roman Catholics, while Russia promoted those of the Eastern\nOrthodox Church. The long-term causes involved the decline of the Ottoman Empire and\nthe unwillingness of Britain and France to allow Russia to gain territory and power at\nOttoman expense.\n\nFrom 1917 to 1921, Russia witnessed the Russian revolution, during which Ukraine\nvacillated and drifted under the control of Austria-Hungary Empire and the Polish empire.\nPost-1921, Ukraine again came under the control of Russia and remained there for some\ntime. Crimea was controlled by Russia but in 1954, there was transfer of power, annexing\nCrimea to Ukraine. Russia’s Nikita Khrushchev decided to hand over Crimea to be\ncontrolled by Ukraine because Crimea was dependent upon Ukraine for all its basic needs.\nKhrushchev was of the opinion that such a mechanism would be useful for the\nadministration of Crimea and would not create an issue for Russia because Ukraine was\nunder Russian control. This mechanism prevailed till 1991. After the disintegration of\nSoviet Union, the erstwhile Russian satellite states began to assert independence. Ukraine\ntoo asserted independence but was vacillating between having a Pro-Russian or Pro-Euro\nzone regime. In the period after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, in a referendum in\nUkraine, 90% people voted in favour of a separation from Russia. Since then, till 2004,\nUkraine has vacillated and remained a state with loose control.\n\nIn 2004, Ukraine witnessed elections which Yenukovich won and initiated his rule.\nThe election of Yenukovich was challenged by Yushenko, who launched a protest against\nYenukovich called as Orange Revolution. The Orange Revolution led to a re-election in\nUkraine which Yushenko won. In 2010, Ukraine had the next election. In the 2010\nelection, Yushenko lost while Yenukovich won. Yenukovich was a pro-Russian leader.\n\nIn 1994, Russia and the NATO entered into an agreement that neither would resort to\n\nexpansion in Europe. In 1998, Russia and Crimea entered into an agreement where Crimea\nagreed to allow Russia to station 25,000 Russian soldiers in Crimea near the Black Sea.\nThis led NATO to initiate expansion and extend NATO memberships to Poland and\nHungary. In 2004, NATO expanded by offering memberships to Slovakia, Slovenia,\nEstonia, Lithuania and Latvia. In 2008, the US initiated the process to bring Ukraine into\nthe fold of NATO. In 2008, Ukraine was led by Yushenko, who was a pro-US leader. As a\nconsequence, the Russians entered into an agreement with Crimea where Crimea offered\nRussia access to apart of Sevastopol in the Black Sea region. As per the agreement, Russia\nwould maintain a Black Sea fleet in Sevastopol and such Russian presence would remain\nundisturbed till 2042. As this expansion and counter-expansion by NATO and Russia\nunfolded, in 2013, the US backed Euro zone offered Ukraine a membership to the\nEuropean Union (EU).\n\nThis offer was made to Yenukovich, a pro-Russia leader, in power since 2010. Russia\nsaw this offer as an indirect attempt by NATO to reach Russia borders. As Yenukovich\nrejected the deal to allow Ukraine to be a part of European Union, a crisis began to unfold.\nIn the independence square in Kiev, massive protests took place to seek a pro-EU decision\nfor Ukraine. Russia supported the counter-protests and this led to violence in Ukraine\nleading to the beginning of the Ukraine crisis in November, 2013. As the conflict\nintensified, in February 2014, Yenukovich fled the country, signalling a victory for the\nrebels. Witnessing the situation turning in favour of the rebels, Russia, in March 2014,\ninstigated Crimea to undertake a referendum. On 16th March, 2014, Crimea ordered a\nreferendum and 95% people in Crimea voted in favour of Crimea joining Russia. On 19th\nMarch, 2014, Russia took over Crimea and used Crimea to assert power in the region.\n\nThe 5% people who did not vote in favour of Crimea joining Russia were the Tartars.\nThe Tartars are ethnic Muslims in Crimea who have always been at the receiving end of\nrepression by the Russians. In 1950s, Stalin had crushed the Tartars and even deported\nthem to Bulgaria, Turkey and Romania. Post-Soviet disintegration, the Tartars settled back\nin Crimea again. Since 19th March, 2014, Crimea is under the Russian control. The US\nand other western states allege that Russia has illegally annexed Crimea. In October, 2014,\nwhen fresh elections happened in Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko won the election.\nPoroshenko has favoured an equidistance policy and has maintained distance from both\nRussia and the US. Over a period of time, US too have realised its mistake of stirring up\ncontroversy in Russian backyard.\n\nRussia has tried to assert dominance on the entire issue. For Russia, Crimea and\nUkraine are very crucial. The Russians get an access to the warm waters of the Black Sea\nonly through Ukraine and Crimea. Russia’s northern stream and southern stream pipelines\npass through there. These pipelines are lifelines for the European states of Germany,\nFrance and others. Russia supplies oil to the European states through these pipelines\nwhich pass through the region of Crimea and Ukraine. The violence in Kiev, Luhansk and\nMinsk, along with other regions, has been under control since a 2015 ceasefire agreed\nupon between the rebels and others. However, the rebels who were armed by the CIA\n(which had pumped 5 billon USD in the region) continue to possess arms as there has\nbeen no mechanism to take back the arms from the rebels.\n\nThe Ukraine issue was a geopolitical conflict for dominance. The west has expanded\n\nthrough NATO aggressively and is at the doorsteps of Russia. An indirect attempt was\nmade by NATO through the EU to penetrate into Ukraine. Russia lost its patience over\nNATO expansion and precipitated a crisis. Some scholars have observed that the crisis is\nonly a beginning of a new energy war in Europe since the US is desperately looking for a\nshale gas market in Europe and wants to end the dominance of Russia in Western Europe.\nHowever, an assertive and rising Russia, as visible in Ukraine, Iran and Syria, is a pointer\nto the fact that the future could see a commencement of a new Cold War. The implications\nof the Ukrainian crisis on global politics is that Russia has tried to assert multipolarity and\nhas conveyed to the US that it should learn to respect the opinions of others. Though India\nhas not been a direct party to the dispute over the crisis in Ukraine, it has still maintained\nthat it favours Russian assertion of multipolarity.

TPP was\ndesigned to help the US economy to grow and help the US create jobs. Any USA farmer,\nentrepreneur or businessman would find it easy to sell his products in participating\ncountries. The TPP has contributed to abolish more than 18000 taxes and barriers, making\nit easy for US companies to sell abroad. For the US, the TPP was a strategic goal as a\nstrong US economy is at the core of its national interests and its global hegemony. Its\nnational security is largely dependent on its economic performance. Since World War-Il,\nthe global trading system has been dominated by the US, which has lent the country\ntremendous stability in the global order. However, though it has always followed an open\nand a transparent model of global trade, in the recent times, it has been challenged by\nsome less transparent and open models (for instance, China). Thus, the US felt the need to\nrewrite its trade rules for US firms to work effectively. The TPP established new rules for\ntrade to help the US economy grow and allow it to maintain its hegemony. The US wants\nits values to be assimilated by other states, which could only happen if US standards are\nfollowed by other states. The USA, under TPP, established rules related to labour laws,\nenvironmental standards and so forth. These rules would have to be adhered to by the\nparticipating states and once adhered to, would strengthen US ties with its allies and\ncontribute to the rebalancing of Asia.\n\nIn the TPP, the US set up very high standards in strategic areas. It advocated for free\ninterest, free flow of information, ensuring strong IPR regimes, strong fair market access\nand ensuring that public sector firms of participating states don’t take undue advantage.\nBetween the US and other participating countries, TPP eliminated import duties on the\nmanufacturing items as also 70% duties on automobiles and 5% duties on US-based IT\nexports. It also eases out farm exports.

He believed that TPP\nstrengthens sates like Vietnam, Malaysia and others that have cheap labour there by\nhurting US workers.

The US was determined to use atomic technology for peaceful\npurposes within and amongst developing counties for civilian nuclear programmes. The\nrecipient states were to use the nuclear technology only for civilian and peaceful purposes.\nThe Iranian Nuclear programme (INP) began in 1957 when Mohammad Reza Shah of Iran\nentered into an agreement to cooperate on civilian use of atomic energy. In 1959, in the\nUniversity of Tehran, the Iranian Shah established the Tehran Nuclear Research centre and\ninitiated negotiations with the US under AFP for civilian nuclear support. In 1967, the US\nestablished a 5 Mega Watt Nuclear reactor with highly enriched uranium fuel to fuel the\nreactor at the Tehran Nuclear Research Centre (TNRC), which had the capacity to produce\n600 grams of plutonium per year in spent fuel. Akbar Etemad was the father of the INP.\nUnder the AFP, Iranian scientists also got an opportunity to get trained in the US. In 1974,\nIran created the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran to achieve the target of training\nmanpower for 20 reactors in the next 20 years. Subsequently, in 1975, the Atomic energy\norganization of Iran and MIT entered into an agreement to train Iranian nuclear scientists.\n\nThings changed after the 1979 Iranian Revolution. When the rule of the Shah came to\nan end in 1979, the US suspended all nuclear cooperation with Iran. Iran, on the other\n\nhand, continued to receive support from Russia, China and Abdul Qadeer Khan’s nuclear\narms bazaar. Russians helped Iranians in building a heavy water reactor in Iran which had\ncapabilities to produce weapons grade plutonium. China assisted Iran with two sub critical\nreactors and electromagnetic isotope separation technology for the Esfahan Nuclear\ntechnology centre. Pakistan provided Iran with P-1 and P-2 centrifuges which were used\nto enrich the uranium. Pakistan also gave Iran technical drawings and advanced design for\nreactors. Initially, Ayatollah Khomeini reduced the intensity of the INP but the 1980 Iran—\nIraq war brought about a rethinking in Iran about its nuclear programme. In 1983, Iran\nasked the IAEA to provide Iran assistance for technical help in setting up of a plant to\nprovide Uranium Hexafluoride (UF6) required for enrichment. With assistance for France,\nIran had established a home grown facility to develop nuclear fuel at Esfahan Nuclear\nTechnology Centre (ENTEC). The IAEA, under Article X1-A of its statute, was obligated\nto help a member state with such a project. In the same year, a team from the IAEA visited\nENTEC to assist Iran with local expertise. Finally, due to US pressure, however, the [AEA\ndid not initiate any support.\n\nThe time progressed, the US applied more pressure on the IAEA and other states not\nto assist Iran. In 1995, then Iranian President Rafsanjani decided to break the ice and\nbegan to improve ties. He gave a firm named Conoco a contract on 6th May, 1995, to\ndevelop an Iranian offshore oil field in the Persian Gulf but the Clinton administration\nprevented the firm from going ahead. Clinton continued sanctions against Iran while\nRafsanjani signed an agreement with Russia to begin work on completing the incomplete\nBushehr plant. From 1976 to 2003, as per the subsidiary arrangements of the safeguards\nagreement between Iran and the IAEA, Iran had to report any new facility to the IAEA\nwithin 180 days along with providing information on any new location or outside facility.\nSince 1992, the subsidiary arrangement which were part of the safeguard agreement began\nto change but Iran was not a party to change in the safeguard agreements till 2003. The\nIranian opposition party, Mujaheeden Khalaq Organisation (MKO), revealed that Iran had\nestablished a secret facility at Natanz. As Iran was not a party to the changing safeguard\nagreements till 2003, by not declaring the Natanz facility within 180 days, it did not\nviolate any legal obligation of the IAEA.\n\nSince 1992, the Board of Governors at the IAEA began to accept the subsidiary\nArrangement called modified code 3.1 which required a member state to notify any\ndecision to setup a new facility immediately. In 2003, Iran agreed to abide by the modified\ncode 3.1, but as the US sanctions continued, Iran refused to finally ratify the code. Iran\nbegan negotiations with the EU-3, that is, Britain, France and Germany. The talks led to\nthe adoption of Sadabad Declaration between Iran, Britain, France and Germany, whereby\nIran decided to suspend all uranium enrichment. This was followed in 2004 with the Paris\nagreement. Under this, it was agreed that Iran and EU-3 will look for a long term\nagreement to ensure an INP for peaceful purpose. The Sadabad Declaration and the Paris\nAgreement failed as Iran could not get a security guarantee for any attack on Iran. Iran\nsaid that it got a box of chocolates out of the deals which was empty. Since 2006, Iran\nresumed enriched at its facility in Natanz. The belligerent policy of the US on Iran gave\nrise to a hardliner in Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who became the next president. The\nrefusal of Iran to ratify the modified code 3.1 led the US to send the Iranian dossier for\nsanctions to the UN Security Council.\n\nIn 2009, Iran sent a letter to the IAEA declaring that it is constructing a second\nuranium enrichment facility at Fordo under the mountain. As the Iranian Majeles had not\nratified the modified code 3.1, it was not bound to follow. Tensions between the US and\nIran continued. In 2006, China, Russia and the US joined the group of EU-3, becoming\nthe P-5+1. Germany was a key trading partner of Iran and its nuclear programme\ndepended upon German products and services. German firms like Siemens, Mercedes,\nLurgi, Krupp, and Volkswagen were also heavily operational with Iran. The negotiations\nof P-5+1 did not yield any results due to the presence of the hardliner Ahmadinejad. In\n2012, with the election of Hassan Rouhani, things began to progress further. The first\nsuccess was achieved in 2013 as per the Geneva Accord, where a Joint Plan of Action was\nachieved. It was further negotiated upon, leading to a final Join Plan of Action (JPOA) in\nJune, 2015. The 2013 Geneva deal acknowledged that Iran has to accept that it would not\nenrich Uranium for a nuclear bomb. The deal accepted the fact that it is a step-by-step\nsolution where actions by Iran in good faith shall gradually lead to a comprehensive\nsolution, and would finally involve an integrated whole, where nothing would be agreed\nupon until everything would be agreed upon. Under the Geneva agreement, Iran was not\nto enrich Uranium beyond 5%. Iran would make no advances of activities at facilities in\nNatanz, Arak and Fordo.\n\nIn 2015, under the Lausanne framework joint comprehensive plan of action, Iran has\nagreed not to enrich uranium beyond 3-6%. It retains the right for a peaceful nuclear\nprogramme. Iran would cut centrifuges from 19,000 to 6,104, with 5,060 centrifuges for\nenrichment. This makes it tough for Iran to make a bomb. Iran would also reduce its\nstockpile from 10,000 kgs to 300 kgs, ensuring transparency in its peaceful use of nuclear\ntechnology. The IAEA will access all nuclear facilities of Iran and there will be gradual\nlifting of sanctions. Iran has to address the concerns of the IAEA related to possible\nmilitary dimensions of its nuclear programme and has to redesign the heavy water facility\nat Arak and transform the Fordo facility into a physics research centre.\n\nThe Middle Eastern states had a mixed response to this arrangement. Hezbollah\nleader Hassan Nasrallah and the Lebanon’s speaker Nabih Berri welcomed the deal, along\nwith the Syrians. Saudi Arabia felt that the Iran deal allowed Iran to maintain a nuclear\nthreshold and that the elimination of sanctions will economically revive Iran. A strong Iran\nwill allow it to assert its hegemony over Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen and Syria. Though Israel\nhas criticised the deal, we need to remember that Israel has actually never witnessed any\nexistential threat from Iran. It has, however, faced regional competition post withdrawal of\nsanctions. For Israel, the real issue, therefore, is not the bomb but the regional balance of\npower. A nuclear Iran, even for civilian use, threatens the decade-old strategy of allowing\nIsrael to be an unrivalled military power of the Middle East. Israel knows that allowing\nIran to have a civilian nuclear facility means that Iran too shall have the flexibility to turn\nmilitary in nature at a short notice. Such a situation would severely delimit the ability of\nIsrael to be the only player in the Middle East to establish regional hegemony with 200-\nplus unmonitored nuclear warheads. For Saudi, the revival of the regional GCC to prepare\nfor a long term confrontation with Tehran is the only option. A renewed attempt to\nstrengthen the Saudi—Pakistan axis is already underway. Iran has decided to follow the\nChinese model. The idea is to get the sanctions removed and get rich and then use the\nwealth to establish Iran as a regional hegemony. Israel and Saudi Arabia both fear the\n\ndominance of Iran stretching from Beirut, Damascus to Bagdad and Aden. This fear is\ndisturbing the balance of power in the Middle East post the 2015 Nuclear Deal."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

As\nthe Obama administration ended US involvement in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, it\nbegan to shift to the Asia—Pacific region to secure American interests and values. The\nword used by Obama in this regard was ‘rebalancing,’ signifying readjustments of the US\npresence from Europe and Middle East to the Asia—Pacific. While the US offered the\nterminology of ‘rebalancing’ the global media loves to call it the USA's ‘pivot to Asia’\npolicy. It was only during George W Bush (II)’s second term that the USA realised a need\nto deter a rapidly aggressive and hegemonic China from playing a negative role in Asia-\nPacific.\n\nWhen Obama became the President, his national security team prepared a sheet of\nassets and liabilities for the administration in foreign policy. The US found China to be\ncritical to US on issues of global significance ranging from Afghanistan to North Korea to\ntrade. However, aggressive military modernisation by China raised alarm bells in the\nstrategic community of the US. Obama’s strategy to manage China was simple. He\nensured that China would not be viewed as an adversary but a cooperative partner in\nresolving global crises and issues within the framework of international law, ensuring that\nChina does not resort to the use of force or intimidation. Obama also ensured that China’s\nrise would not destabilise the existing order of the Asia—Pacific and that China would not\nact antagonistically to the allies and friends of the US. To manage China through his re-\nbalancing strategy, Obama adopted an adequate mixture of military, economic, political\nand ideological elements by covering a wide geo-strategic space from Southeast Asia to\nAsia-Pacific, ensuring a confluence of Asia—Pacific and main allies of the US who feel\nthat China may eventually not only project power as a regional hegemony but may try to\nlock out the US from the region completely.\n\nAs China is economically more empowered than the US, the US has understood that\na rising China should not be contained but should be effectively balanced. To achieve this\nbalance, USA has launched its rebalancing initiative. Militarily, under rebalancing, the US\nintends to deploy 60% of its naval strength in Asia, leaving 40% for other regions. The\nUS, under the Pivot to Asia, has initiated a programme to strengthen its relationship with\nits key allies, such as Japan, South Korea and Australia. It has decided to augment\nstrategic and military capabilities through strategic partnerships with India, Singapore,\nIndonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia. To put up a viable strategic front in the region, ideas\nlike USA—Japan—India—Australia quadrangles at the strategic level have been floated. An\neconomic component of the Pivot was the TPP, but, the Trump administration has\nwithdrawn the USA from the agreement. The US wants to use the Pivot to counter China\nat the ideological level, using the values of democracy and human rights.\n\nUndertaking USA led Re-deployment of military\n\n‘economic resurgence * in Asia-Pacific\n., Building strategic partnership and\nstrengthening existing alliances\nAssertion of core ay Aang 4 Re-building Asian strategic\n\narchitecture\n\nIndia knows that nearly 65% of global raw material being in Asia gives enough\nimpetus to the US to look towards Asia to grow its own economy. China feels that, since\nthe end of Cold War, the allies of USA in Asia have economically become more integrated\nto China through forums like ASEAN. It feels that the US is concerned about its future\nwith the allies and intends to reinforce some sort of unity amongst them, compelling them\nto rebalance their relationships. China has thus decided to remain more stable and strong\nin the face of any crisis. The Chinese have responded to US through their Belt and Road\nInitiative. If the USA, through the Pivot, wants to enter into the Chinese backyard, then\nChina would enter Europe, which has been USA’S strategic sphere, through its Belt and\nRoad initiative. China, however, says that it needs to cautiously watch the USA’s military\ndeployments in the region as it is directing its Air Sea Battle (ASB) at China where it may\nuse air power and sea power to attack Chinese strategic land targets. This, China\nperceives, could lead to a new arms race, as a fallout of the US’s rebalancing. China\ntherefore deduces that it should develop both defensive and offensive capabilities.\n\nAs the Indo-USA relations are in an upswing, India, through its Act East Policy, has\ndecided to shift from benign neglect of the South East Asian region to an active\nengagement with it. India has elevated its relationship to special strategic and global\npartnership level with Japan while trying to add more strategic content in its relationships\nwith Australia, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia and South Korea. India has favoured a\ncooperative framework in the Asia-Pacific to ensure a prosperous Asia. India is also\nwilling to take up responsibilities to work closely with the USA to create an inclusive,\nsecure and stable network of interdependence which is participatory in nature for all\nnations in Asia."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

In 1998, India, after conducting a nuclear test, declared itself as a nuclear\nweapon state. Our first priority here is to analyse this contradiction—why did the land of\nGandhi, which espoused the ideology of ahimsa for centuries, have to acquire nuclear\nweapons? Before we attempt our analysis, we need to understand that India has not\nacquired a nuclear weapon for enhancing its status or prestige in the world, which would\nrather be decided by how we solve our socio-economic problems and develop into a\nmodern society, than by possession of nuclear weapons. In order to achieve our goals of\nhuman development, we need an environment that assures us of peace and stability.\n\nThe world actually witnessed the threat of nuclear confrontation for the first time\nduring the period of the Cold War, when the world was ideologically divided, and nuclear\nweapons were used as instruments of political and military diplomacy. During the entire\nperiod of the Cold War, starting from 1946 onwards, the world witnessed more than 40\nincidents where nuclear threats were exercised. A very detailed examination of the events\nand incidents (though beyond the purview of our analysis here) clearly prove that in all\ncases of nuclear threats, the country that exercised the treats played on asymmetry of the\nother nations. The country on which the nuclear threat was exercised either had no nuclear\narsenal or was in an asymmetrical state with low capability to retaliate. For example, US\nconveyed a number of nuclear threats to China from 1950 to 1964 but when, in 1964,\nChina acquired nuclear capability, the threats vanished.\n\nThe responses of the threatened parties were thus appropriately shaped based on the\nexercise of asymmetry. Out of the 40 plus incidents of nuclear threat, more than 30 were\nexercised upon Asian states. The threat against India got aggravated post 1960s when\nChina began to acquire a nuclear arsenal, after the two nations fought a border war. The\nChinese also clarified that they would continue to retain the nuclear arsenal for an\nindefinite period and thus, the existential threat to India would continue to emanate in the\n\nfuture. The nuclear threat to India further increased in 1971 when the US sent the USS\nEnterprise to the Bay of Bengal to coerce India to follow the US line. Though the threat\ngot mitigated by the Soviet navy tailing the USS Enterprise, it did expose our\nvulnerability. Thus, the core logic for India to possess nuclear weapons emerged from the\nchanging geo-political and strategic concerns in our regional and global environment.\n\nIndia’s initial nuclear policy was driven by the Chinese factor; and the same factor\nshall continue to remain dominant in our policy discourse. As the Chinese economy grows\nin the 21st century and it uses its economic muscle to modernise its military, it will\neventually alter the strategic balance of Asia. Though Sino-Indian relations have\nimproved significantly in the post-Cold War period, India needs to be prepared for the\nfuture where there is any reversal of the relations back to pre-1962 times. If India\ncontinues to follow the spirit of non-alignment where it refrains from joining any military\nalliance with any state in the future, it will need its own insurance policy based on a\nprinciple of self-reliance. As China remains reluctant to give up its own nuclear weapons,\nthe only way to have insurance is for India to have its own nuclear weapons. Since\nindependence, India has pursued a nuclear policy where it has kept the option of a nuclear\nweapons open. However, India has exercised restraint, which was based upon the Indian\ncivilisation value of following the middle path.\n\nIndia still favours disarmament despite being a nuclear weapon state, but this is\nprincipally based on a global disarmament policy. Only a global nuclear disarmament will\nserve Indian national security interests. India has made it clear that it cannot be right that\nsome countries have the ability to exercise the nuclear option while others don’t. Either all\nnations in the world should have a right to have a nuclear weapon or all nations should go\nfor complete disarmament. Despite possessing nuclear weapons, India is willing to go for\ndisarmament if the world moves to achieve global disarmament. Since the end of the Cold\nWar, there was a shift from disarmament to non-proliferation.\n\nThe non-proliferation order in the post-Cold War period revolves around the NPT.\nHowever, the indefinite extension of NPT in the 1995 Review Conference has only\nheightened Indian concerns. The inclination of nuclear weapon states since the end of the\nCold War has been towards tightening the non-proliferation order to ensure that nuclear\nweapon states continue to maintain their hegemony. Even the CTBT and FMCT, instead of\ncontributing to disarmament, have remained measures that propose and promote non-\nproliferation. By 1998, as the nuclear non-proliferation order tightened around it, India\nrealised that if it does not exercise the open option to break out of it, then it would have\nbeen left with no options at all. Thus, India in 1998, after the nuclear test, broke out of the\nsituation and emerged as a nuclear weapon state, thereby rectifies the asymmetry with\nnuclear weapons as an insurance against any arm-twisting or nuclear coercion by any\npower."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Does that mean that India has switched over from its goal of disarmament? In this\nsection, we shall try to assert that even though India has decided to weaponise, it still\nremains committed to global disarmament including domestic disarmament if there is a\nglobal will. Even today a Nuclear Weapons Free World (NWFW) remains a cherished goal\nfor India, which it intends to achieve. However, it is imperative for us here to make an\nassessment of the Indian conception and initiatives on Nuclear Disarmament.\n\nIndia has long been a champion of nuclear disarmament. In 1940, even before our\nindependence, Nehru, in a confidential note written at Wardha on 25th August, 1940, had\nadvocated the need of complete disarmament. The initial leadership of modern India\narticulated its views against a nuclear weapon and favoured nuclear disarmament on both\nsecurity and moral grounds, arguing that nuclear weapons are against the spirit of\nhumanity. The Indian ideal of NWFW was based upon the requisite of survival of\nhumanity and the human race. India tried to position the issue of a NWFW not just as an\ninternational problem but one that affected the very existence of mankind. No nation in the\nworld except India has ever tried to link the concept of disarmament to the survival of the\nhuman race. India perceived disarmament not as an end in itself but as a means for\nensuring global peace, security, progress and development. India has been an ardent\nsupporter of a time bound framework to achieve disarmament, but unfortunately, on this\n\npoint, it has merely received cold support from nuclear weapon states. India is also the\nonly nation in the world that has propounded a link between disarmament and\ndevelopment. India has been a firm believer that if a country undertakes disarmament and\nreduction in military expenditure, it would help a country to have access to extra resources\nwhich it can use for development.\n\nIt is important to note that India has used every multilateral forum and opportunity\navailable to pursue its objectives consensually.\n\n—\n\nIn 1948, when the UN Atomic Energy Commission was established, India advocated\na complete elimination of nuclear weapons and proposed that atomic energy be only used\nby nations for peaceful purposes. In 1950, India proposed the establishment of a UN Peace\nFund to ensure that countries don’t indulge in arms race and use the amount spent on arms\nrace for development through the Peace Fund. After the US tested its first hydrogen bomb\nin 1954 in Marshall Islands, Nehru, on 2nd April, 1954, in a speech in the Parliament\nsuggested a standstill agreement on all explosions.\n\nyA\n\n| u\n\nIndian\nmemorandum\nat disarmament\ncommission\nin 1956\n\nDespite India having raised the matter innumerable times at various multilateral fora\nin the 1950s and 1960s, the measures proposed did not receive much attention and\nhorizontal and vertical nuclear proliferation continued. In 1964, India sowed the seeds to a\nfuture NPT by placing “Non Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons” on the UN agenda for\ndiscussion to adopt an international treaty.\n\nIndia continuously raised the disarmament issue at the Special Sessions on\nDisarmament, the Six Nation Five Continent Peace Initiative (with Argentina, Greece,\n\nMexico, Sweden and Tanzania) and through the Rajiv Gandhi Action Plan, but with the\nabsence of political will amongst Nuclear weapon states, the success of disarmament in a\ntime-bound framework remained a distant goal. Thus, after waiting for almost 50 years,\nIndia finally responded in 1998 by undertaking the Pokhran-II which became a game\nchanger. Even after Pokhran-II, India clarified that it would support a NWFW if all\ncountries in the world opt for complete disarmament. The failure to achieve global\nconsensus for nuclear disarmament, coupled with deteriorating strategic environment),\nnecessitated Indian acquisition of weapons but India remains committed to the goal of\nglobal disarmament and a NWFW."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Even though the phenomenon of war\nappears to be a part of human history, it is certainly different from other forms of violence.\nWarfare itself has undergone a tremendous change, from being fought with primitive\nweaponry to bows and arrows to complex forms of cyber tools today. The Cold War\nperiod (the postmodern warfare) has witnessed use of high technology, thereby blurring\nthe distinction between the civilian and military uses of technology. Initially, there used to\nbe wars of plunders where two states would often fight for natural resources or water\nresources. Today, war is more complex because it involves non-state actors and even\nterrorist organisations. In war, the conflict is furthered by the use of armed forces that do\nnot resort to sporadic attacks as they are more organised. As per the UN, major conflicts\nare defined as ones where 1000 or more deaths occur. This definition, however, does not\ndo justice to multiple conflicts faced by the world today. The World Wars-I and II are\nexamples of ‘total war,’ which may be defined as warfare that includes the consideration\nof any and all civilian-associated resources and infrastructure as legitimate military\ntargets, mobilises all of the resources of society to fight the war, and gives priority to\nwarfare over non-combatant needs. It is understood to be the kind of war that is\nunrestricted in terms of the weapons used, the territory or combatants involved, or the\nobjectives pursued, especially one in which the laws of war are disregarded.\n\nEvery war has an objective. The objective could be to establish hegemonic\ndominance or demand redrawal of boundaries. Wars are normally triggered due to some\n\nsocio-political circumstances. In the earlier sections of the book where we have discussed\nthe World Wars and the Cold War, we have analysed how historical reasons may cause\nlong-term conflicts. According to Kenneth Waltz, war theories have three levels of\nanalysis.\n\n__ [Burnes natire cot be the foods |\n\nAnother explanation of war, as argued by the ancient Greek historian Thucydides, has\nplaced emphasis upon human greed and a lust for power. The focus of the school is to\nbrand war as an outcome of the human instincts to satisfy their infinite desires through the\navailability of finite resources. Liberals, however, base their explanation of war on inner\ncharacteristics posed by political actors of the state. The core emphasis is upon the\n‘democratic peace’ thesis which argues that states that are democratic, often do not fight\neach other but authoritarian states are more inclined towards war due to the complete\nabsence of any form of democratic representative process. In such authoritarian states, the\ndomestic order is maintained through suppression by using instruments of the state\n(mainly the military) and war is recognised as a legitimate state policy. Realists, on the\nother hand, look at war as an inevitability since they perceive the international system as\nan inherently anarchic one by nature. In this context, they argue that the states, irrespective\n\nof their constitutional structure, only seek to maximise their power. The only way war\ncould end permanently is through the abolition of this anarchy.\n\nThe Marxists have explained war as the consequence of a dynamics interpolated by\ncapitalism. They argue that the capitalist urge to expand in search for zones of profits\ninvariably lead to plunder. The Marxists consider war as an outcome of capitalist\neconomic impulses. However, it is difficult to prove the utility of Marxist theories because\ncountries have accepted that economic interdependence and trade has considerably\nweakened the urge of states to go to war. The economic expansionism is perceived more\nas a tool of prosperity than war today. Prussian theorist Carl von Clausewitz, in his work\ncalled On War (1832), has explained war as a continuation of politics and a means to\ncompel an opponent to submit to the will of the one who initiated the war.\n\na\niz Bd yeob tot ad\n\nThough Clausewitz attempted a definition, it has invited multiple criticisms. One of\nthe biggest criticisms is that Clausewitz’s theory is an outdated concept that had no\napplicability to the wars in the 21st century. The theory has also been criticised on moral\ngrounds for considering war as an inevitable phenomenon as opposed to looking for\nsolutions reached by negotiations based on principles of justice.\n\nHegemonic states War is due to\nuse war to expand the masculine\ntheir political urge for domination\n\nEgoism of a War is\nas, “som pede sacsscoaie “aoe\ncapttaism i\n\nWis doo to Anarchy Free wade Socialism\n\ninternational increases could lead = guarantees\n\nanarchy possibility to peace peace\n\not war\n\nThe end of the Cold War has affected the concept of warfare. The post-Cold War era\nis called as the phase of the ‘new’ war or postmodern war. A scholar named Kaldor calls it\nthe post Clausewitzian or post-Westphalian phase of war. Kaldor says that earlier, after the\nestablishment of the Westphalian states, wars were fought to give effect to the ideas that\nClausewitz later propounded, that is, to subdue other states to conform to one’s will.\nHowever, Gilbert stated that during the Cold War, the tactics used in Vietnam, Palestine,\nCongo, Liberia and so on, proved that war had been redefined. The end of Cold War again\nsaw a shift to ‘new’ wars as happened in cases of Afghanistan (2001), Iraq (2003) and\nChechnya.\n\n_-y Less interstate in nature and more civil\n~_-» Prominence of identify\na > Asymmetrical nature\nmaintenance of distinction ~~ More ruthless and barbaric\nbetween civilian and military units\n\nA peculiar feature of these ‘new’ wars, or wars in the post-Cold War era, are that 95%\nof such wars are civil and not inter-state in nature. Factors like democracy and its\nwidespread acceptance, along with a shift in the moral attitude of states about war have\nbeen the dominant explanatory factors for the shift. In the post-Cold War era, civil wars\nhave become more common and this has led to emergence of failed states that are unable\nto maintain domestic order, thereby transforming them into a zone of turmoil. Most of\nthese failed states have tribal rivalry or economic underdevelopment caused by erstwhile\ncolonialism. A scholar named Gray asserts that in postmodern war, even if actual conflicts\non the ground are less, the states still prefer to undertake heavy weapons development.\nThe assertion of Gray stands true for states like India under Modi and the US under\nDonald Trump.\n\nUS troops and Sunni queria confit\n&: of Shia~ Nee ilicciion\n\nSunni sectarian violence ~ & + Imporatt in natr as\nUltimately led to rise of ISIS —\n\nporn a"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

However, 9/11\nchanged everything and brought to the fore a new phenomenon of global terrorism,\nindicating the rise of non-state actors and terrorists as new threats to a stable order in the\ntwenty first century. The subsequently launched global war on terrorism (GWOT) opened\nup a new chapter in the debate of new security threats of future.\n\nThe term terrorism owes its origin to the French Revolution when Robespierre\nunleashed a reign of terror, killing the so-called enemies of the revolution. However, in the\nmodern times, 9/11 changed the way world perceived terrorism. Post-9/11, scholars\nasserted that the principal security threat to global peace is terrorism. Jeff Goodwin is of\nthe view that terrorists aim to achieve their objectives by inculcating fear by perpetrating a\nform of political violence. Goodwin says terrorists strive to create uncertainty and\napprehension by using an element of surprise in their acts. Thus, violence unleashed by\nterrorism is clandestine in nature. Schmidt and Long man are of the opinion that terrorists\nresort to violent acts to destabilise and inculcate fear in civilians as innocent civilians are\ntheir target and mostly their victims.\n\nAccording to Glenshaw, terrorism as a tool is used by those groups who cannot defeat\ntheir opponents in an armed conflict and therefore is a weapon of the weak.\n\nThe realists have attempted to define terrorism on the basis of the state/non-state\ndichotomy. Politics is about the competition between several actors to seek and ultimately\nseize power. The terrorists, who are non-state actors, resort to violence to seek power. As\nterrorists cannot challenge the state actors directly through an armed conflict, the realists\nassert that any attempt by the terrorists to subvert the civil order should be sternly dealt by\nthe state. The realists emphasise that, to protect the political order under threat, the states\nshould even compromise upon the existing conventional morality and political leadership\nshould be prepared to resort to a ‘dirty hands’ approach to deal with the threat of terrorism.\nThere is a compromise upon civil liberties in the realistic framework of countering\nterrorism. The liberal school on the other hand focusses less on power seeking and\nemphasises more upon ideology. The liberals believe that terrorism is an attack upon\n\ndemocratic and other liberal values of the society. They assert that any counter-terrorism\noffensive must stick to liberal democratic values and any counter-operation should not\nviolate civil liberties.\n\nAt the critical level, the analysis by Noam Chomsky and Richard Falk states that\nterrorism perpetrated by state actors may be termed wholesale terrorism while by non-\nstate actors may be called retail terrorism. As per their analysis, the terrorism orchestrated\nby the state as an actor is more coercive as it is meant to maintain economic and political\ninfluence over other states in the international system. This view brands the US as the\nmost leading terrorist state in the world.\n\nTackling terrorism requires a key mixture of multiple initiatives.

Environmental activities or, more precisely,\nactivities that threaten the environment in one state, may make another state vulnerable.\nThe most meaningful way to resolve any environmental concern, therefore, is to raise the\nissue of usage at the global level. The realities of global environmental negotiations prove\nthat the debate has become ridden with ideological and political underpinnings. As\nenvironmental priorities are in conflict with economic priorities, at the global level, there\nhave been major disagreements and issues. The key concern at the global level is to link\nenvironment to economic growth which is sustainable in nature. The origin of green\npolitics in modern times owes its origin to the 1960s and 1970s, when an environmental\nmovement was launched in the west to showcase the divide between humankind and\nnature due to increased growth. In 1962, it was Rachel Carson’s book, Silent Spring\n(1962), that highlighted how the use of pesticides affected wildlife. The period also saw a\nbirth of new green NGOs like Green Peace and Friends of the Earth. A new emphasis was\nlaid on highlighting the dangers of the excessive use of fossil fuels.\n\nProblems related to use of\n\n- ie\nProbl to wildlife and - non — renewable sources\n\nimpact on the agriculture ~~ _\n\n» Problems related to pollution\n\ngreen politics\n\nInitially, the movement emphasised upon the finite nature of resources and the need\nto conserve the exhaustible resources and wealth of the planet. The focus was primarily on\nindustrialisation-led pollution and fast depletion of resources. The key theme during this\nperiod was to initiate an idea of putting some limits on the ongoing growth. As the\nproblems highlighted acquired a global status, it led to the birth of the first UN conference\non Human Environment (UNCHE) in 1972 at Stockholm, and ultimately to the birth of the\nUN environment programme (UNEP).\n\nTowards the end of the Cold War, events like Bhopal Gas tragedy (1984), Chernobyl\ndisaster (1986) and the publication of Brundtland Commission Report (1987) led to a new\nidea of sustainable development. The countries in the South showed more interest in\nlinking development and environment. The end of Cold War finally saw the adoption of\nthe Kyoto protocol in 1997. The negotiations for the Kyoto protocol clearly exposed the\nglobal fault lines in the negotiation process as it highlighted the differences between the\ncollective interests of the international community and individual interests of the state.\nOne school of green politics is known as the Reformist Ecology school and are also called\nModernist Ecologists and Humanists.\n\n_-y Favour green taxes\n\n» Advocates market ecologism\n\nHave hope on global .\ngovernance * ~* Promote green capitalism\nFavour innovation <—— ®S Encourage developing green\nand clean technologies\n\nFor them, damage to the environment comes at a social cost. Thus, they advocate\nsustainable development where the growth is undertaken slowly, and in a manner where\nbiological systems are able to remain diverse and productive indefinitely, thereby offering\na balance between the goals of modernisation and sustainability of the planet.\n\nOn the other hand, another school known as Radical Ecology School has developed\nits thesis on anti capitalist plank. For them, commoditisation caused by capitalism is the\nroot cause of environmental distress. They favour decentralised communities to take\ncharge and control and self-manage natural resources. They also emphasise on eco-\nfeminism and brand men as nature’s enemy. They believe that the onus to save the\nenvironment and maintain ecological balance should be on humans as man is a part of\nnature.\n\nuy V. Shiva\nA\n\nJames Lovelock <\nBa > Ernst F.

For realists, sustainability was never an issue as the state’s priority\nis to ensure survival in an anarchic situation. The realists have discussed the Darwinian\nconcept of survival of the fittest, while explaining conflict and war. Realists also argue that\nconflict owes its origin to the tensions generated due to scarcity of resources, thereby\naffirming that scarcity does play a role in conflict. The realists’ anti-nature bias is due to\ntheir belief in individualism and human ingenuity.
