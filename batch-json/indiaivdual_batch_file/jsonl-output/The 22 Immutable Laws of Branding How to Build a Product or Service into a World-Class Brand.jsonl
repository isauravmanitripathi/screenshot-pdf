The original text is: 'Every small town in America has a coffee shop. In larger cities and towns\nyou can often find coffee shops on every other block.\n\nSo what can you find to eat in a coffee shop? Everything. Breakfast, lunch,\ndinner. Pancakes, muffins, hot dogs, hamburgers, sandwiches, pie, ice\ncream, and, of course, coffee.\n\nWhat did Howard Schultz do? In an incredible burst of business creativity,\nhe opened a coffee shop that specialized in, of all things, coffee. In other\nwords, he narrowed the focus.\n\nToday Schultz\u2019s brainchild, Starbucks, is a rapidly growing chain that does\nhundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of business annually. His company,\nStarbucks Corp., is worth $8.7 billion on the stock market. And Howard\nSchultz owns a substantial share of that stock.\n\nEvery small town in America has a delicatessen. In larger cities and towns,\nyou can often find delis in every neighborhood.\n\nSo what can you find to eat in a delicatessen? Everything. Soups, salads,\nhot and cold sandwiches, three types of roast beef, four types of ham, five\ntypes of cheese. Hard rolls, soft rolls, hero rolls, three types of pickles, four\ntypes of bread, five types of bagels. Potato chips, pretzels, corn chips.\nMuffins, doughnuts, cookies, cakes, candy bars, ice cream, frozen yogurt.\n\nBeer, soda, water, coffee, tea, soft drinks of all varieties. Newspapers,\ncigarettes, lottery tickets. Every decent delicatessen prides itself on carrying\n\neverything.\n\nWhat did Fred DeLuca do? He narrowed the focus to one type of sandwich,\nthe submarine sandwich.\n\nGood things happen when you contract your brand rather than expand it.\nThe first stroke of genius in DeLuca\u2019s case was in coming up with the\nname.\n\nFred DeLuca called his chain Subway, a great name for a store that sold just\nsubmarine sandwiches. It was a name that no consumer could forget.\n\nThe second smart move concerned operations. When you make only\nsubmarine sandwiches, you get pretty good at making submarine\nsandwiches.\n\nThe average McDonald\u2019s has sixty or seventy individual items on the menu.\nHalf the employees are teenagers, not yet old or mature enough to handle\nthe complexities of today\u2019s operation. And people wonder why the food and\nservice aren\u2019t as good as when McDonald\u2019s just served hamburgers, french\nfries, and soft drinks. (The original McDonald\u2019s menu had just eleven\nitems, including all sizes and flavors.)\n\nSubway has become the eighth-largest fast-food chain in the United States.\nThe company has more than 15,000 units in seventy-five countries. Since\nSubway is a private company, we don\u2019t know exactly how profitable it is,\nbut we do know how much money Fred DeLuca has been paying himself.\n(He was forced to disclose his salary in a court case.)\n\nIn 1990, Fred DeLuca paid himself $27 million. In 1991, $32 million. In\n1992, $42 million. In 1993, $54 million. In 1994, $60 million. That\u2019s a lot\nof dough for making submarine sandwiches.\n\nCharles Lazarus owned one store, called Children\u2019s Supermart, which sold\ntwo things: children\u2019s furniture and toys. But he wanted to grow.\n\nWhat is the conventional way to grow? Adding more things to sell. Sure, he\ncould have added bicycles, baby food, diapers, and children\u2019s clothing to\nthe store. But he didn\u2019t.\n\nInstead, Charles Lazarus threw out the furniture and focused on toys.\n\nGood things happen when you contract your brand rather than expand it.\nFirst he filled the empty half of the store with more toys, giving the buyer a\ngreater selection and more reason to visit the store. Then, instead of calling\nit Children\u2019s Supermart, Lazarus called his place Toys \u201cR\u201d Us.\n\nToday Toys \u201cR\u201d Us sells 20 percent of all the toys sold in the United States.\nAnd the chain has become the model for the specialty stores or category\nkillers on the retail scene. Home Depot in home supplies. The Gap in\neveryday casual clothing. The Limited in clothes for working women.\nVictoria\u2019s Secret in ladies\u2019 lingerie. PetsMart in pet supplies. Blockbuster\nVideo in video rentals. CompUSA in computers. Foot Locker in athletic\nshoes.\n\nGood things happen when you contract rather than expand your business.\nMost retail category killers follow the same five-step pattern.\n\n1. Narrow the focus. A powerful branding program always starts by\ncontracting the category, not expanding it.\n\n2. Stock in depth. A typical Toys \u201cR\u201d Us store carries 10,000 toys versus\n3,000 toys for a large department store.\n\n3. Buy cheap. Toys \u201cR\u201d Us makes its money buying toys, not selling\ntoys.\n\n4. Sell cheap. When you can buy cheap, you can sell cheap and still\nmaintain good margins.\n\n5. Dominate the category. The ultimate objective of any branding\nprogram is to dominate a category.\n\nWhen you dominate a category, you become extremely powerful. Microsoft\nhas 95 percent of the worldwide market for desktop computer operating\n\nsystems. Intel has 80 percent of the worldwide market for microprocessors.\nCoca-Cola has 70 percent of the worldwide market for cola. And in order to\ndominate a category, you must narrow your brand\u2019s focus.\n\nWhy then do so few marketers want to contract their brands? Why do most\nmarketers want to expand their brands? Because people look at successful\ncompanies and are led astray. They assume that companies are successful\nbecause they are expanding. (Starbucks, for example, currently is busy\ngetting into everything from ice cream to bottled drinks to tea.)\n\nBut let\u2019s focus on you for a moment. Let\u2019s say that you want to be rich.\nNow ask yourself: Can I get rich by doing what rich people do?\n\nRich people buy expensive houses and eat in expensive restaurants. They\ndrive Rolls-Royces and wear Rolex watches. They vacation on the Riviera.\n\nWould buying an expensive house, a Rolls-Royce, and a Rolex make you\nrich? Just the opposite. It\u2019s likely to make you poor, even bankrupt.\n\nMost people search for success in all the wrong places. They try to find out\nwhat rich and successful companies are currently doing and then try to copy\nthem.\n\nWhat do rich companies do? They buy Gulfstream jets. They run programs\nlike empowerment, leadership training, open-book management, and total-\nquality management. And they line-extend their brands.\n\nWill buying a Gulfstream V jet for $42 million make your company\nsuccessful? Unlikely. Will extending your brand? Just as unlikely.\n\nIf you want to be rich, you have to do what rich people did before they were\nrich\u2014you have to find out what they did to become rich. If you want to\nhave a successful company, you have to do what successful companies did\nbefore they were successful.\n\nAs it happens, they all did the same thing. They narrowed their focus.\n\nWhen Domino\u2019s Pizza first got started, it sold pizza and submarine\nsandwiches. When Little Caesars first got started, it sold pizza, fried\nshrimp, fish and chips, and roasted chicken. When Papa John\u2019s first got\nstarted, it sold pizza, cheesesteak sandwiches, submarine sandwiches, fried\nmushrooms, fried zucchini, salads, and onion rings.\n\nNow how do you suppose Tom Monaghan, Michael and Marian Ilitch, and\nJohn Schnatter built Domino\u2019s Pizza, Little Caesars, and Papa John\u2019s into\nbig powerful brands? By expanding their menus or contracting them?\n\nGood things happen when you narrow the focus.\n'.

Let\u2019s say that you want to be rich.\nNow ask yourself: Can I get rich by doing what rich people do?\n\nRich people buy expensive houses and eat in expensive restaurants. They\ndrive Rolls-Royces and wear Rolex watches. They vacation on the Riviera.\n\nWould buying an expensive house, a Rolls-Royce, and a Rolex make you\nrich? Just the opposite. It\u2019s likely to make you poor, even bankrupt.\n\nMost people search for success in all the wrong places. They try to find out\nwhat rich and successful companies are currently doing and then try to copy\nthem.\n\nWhat do rich companies do? They buy Gulfstream jets. They run programs\nlike empowerment, leadership training, open-book management, and total-\nquality management. And they line-extend their brands.\n\nWill buying a Gulfstream V jet for $42 million make your company\nsuccessful? Unlikely. Will extending your brand? Just as unlikely.\n\nIf you want to be rich, you have to do what rich people did before they were\nrich\u2014you have to find out what they did to become rich. If you want to\nhave a successful company, you have to do what successful companies did\nbefore they were successful.\n\nAs it happens, they all did the same thing. They narrowed their focus.\n\nWhen Domino\u2019s Pizza first got started, it sold pizza and submarine\nsandwiches. When Little Caesars first got started, it sold pizza, fried\nshrimp, fish and chips, and roasted chicken. When Papa John\u2019s first got\nstarted, it sold pizza, cheesesteak sandwiches, submarine sandwiches, fried\nmushrooms, fried zucchini, salads, and onion rings.\n\nNow how do you suppose Tom Monaghan, Michael and Marian Ilitch, and\nJohn Schnatter built Domino\u2019s Pizza, Little Caesars, and Papa John\u2019s into\nbig powerful brands? By expanding their menus or contracting them?\n\nGood things happen when you narrow the focus.\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The original text is: 'Most of America\u2019s 15,000 advertising agencies are committed to the\nconcept of building a brand with advertising.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental thing we\u2019re all about is building brand leaders,\u201d said the\nchief executive of D\u2019Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles recently. \u201cThe way to\ndo that is to have a superior understanding of the consumer, which leads to\nbetter, fresher, more powerful creative work that ultimately builds brands.\u201d\n\nBuilding brand leaders with better, fresher creative work? We think not.\nMost marketers confuse brand building with brand maintenance. While a\nhefty advertising budget might be needed to maintain high-flying brands\nlike McDonald\u2019s and Coca-Cola, advertising generally won\u2019t get a new\nbrand off the ground.\n\nAnita Roddick built The Body Shop into a major brand with no advertising\nat all. Instead she traveled the world on a relentless quest for publicity,\npushing her ideas about the environment. It was the endless torrent of\nnewspaper and magazine articles, plus radio and television interviews, that\nliterally created The Body Shop brand.\n\nStarbucks doesn\u2019t spend a hill of beans on advertising either. In its first ten\nyears, the company spent less than $10 million on advertising, a trivial\namount for a brand that delivers $2.6 billion in annual sales.\n\nWal-Mart became the world\u2019s largest retailer with annual sales of more than\n$200 billion with very little advertising. A Wal-Mart sibling, Sam\u2019s Club,\naverages $45 million per store with almost no advertising.\n\nOn the other hand, Miller Brewing spent $50 million to launch a brand\ncalled Miller Regular. (Or just plain Miller.) The brand generated no\npublicity, almost no perceptions in the minds of beer drinkers, and very\nlittle sales\u2014$50 million down the drain.\n\nWould better, fresher creative work have built a beer called Miller Regular\ninto a brand leader? We think not. There is no publicity potential in a\nregular beer with a line-extended name like Miller.\n\nIn the past, it may have been true that a beefy advertising budget was the\n\nkey ingredient in the brand-building process. But what worked in the past\ndoesn\u2019t necessarily work today. We live in an overcommunicated society,\nwhere each of us gets hit with hundreds of commercial messages daily.\n\nToday brands are born, not made. A new brand must be capable of\ngenerating favorable publicity in the media or it won\u2019t have a chance in the\nmarketplace.\n\nAnd just how do you generate publicity? The best way to generate publicity\nis by being first. In other words, by being the first brand in a new category.\n\n\u00a2 Band-Aid, the first adhesive bandage\n\n\u00a2 Charles Schwab, the first discount stockbrokerage firm\n\u00a2 CNN, the first cable news network\n\n\u00a2 Compag, the first portable personal computer\n\n\u00a2 Domino\u2019s, the first home delivery pizza chain\n\n\u00a2 ESPN, the first cable sports network\n\n\u00a2 Gore-Tex, the first breathable waterproof cloth\n\n\u00a2 Heineken, the first imported beer\n\n\u00a2 Hertz, the first car-rental company\n\n\u00a2 Intel, the first microprocessor\n\n\u00a2 Jell-O, the first gelatin dessert\n\n\u00a2 Kentucky Fried Chicken, the first fast-food chicken chain\n\u00a2 National Enquirer, the first supermarket tabloid\n\u00a2 Playboy, the first men\u2019s magazine\n\n\u00a2 Q-Tips, the first cotton swab\n\n\u00a2 Reynolds Wrap, the first aluminum foil\n\n\u00a2 Rollerblade, the first in-line skate\n\n\u00a2 Samuel Adams, the first microbrewed beer\n\n\u00a2 Saran Wrap, the first plastic food wrap\n\n\u00a2 Sun Microsystems, the first Unix workstation\n\n\u00a2 Time, the first weekly news magazine\n\n\u00a2 Xerox, the first plain-paper copier\n\nAll of these brands (and many, many more) were first in a new category\nand, in the process, generated enormous amounts of publicity.\n\nThere\u2019s a strong relationship between the two. The news media wants to\ntalk about what\u2019s new, what\u2019s first, and what\u2019s hot, not what\u2019s better. When\nyour brand can make news, it has a chance to generate publicity. And the\nbest way to make news is to announce a new category, not a new product.\n\nWhat others say about your brand is much more powerful than what you\nsay about it yourself. That\u2019s why publicity in general is more effective than\nadvertising. And why, over the past two decades, public relations has\neclipsed advertising as the most effective force in branding.\n\nYet for years public relations has been treated as a secondary function to\nadvertising. PR people even used to measure their successes in terms of\nadvertising space. Publicity stories were converted into equivalent\nadvertising expenditures.\n\nEven worse, marketing strategies were usually formulated first into\nadvertising slogans. Then the public relations people were asked to\nreinforce the advertising by creating PR programs to communicate those\nslogans.\n\nNot anymore. Today brands are built with publicity and maintained with\nadvertising. The cart is now driving the horse.\n\nSo why hasn\u2019t the ascendancy of PR made news in the media? Why are\npublic relations departments in most companies still subservient to\nadvertising departments? Why are nine of the top ten public relations firms\nstill owned by advertising agencies instead of vice versa?\n\nWhy have the media ignored the biggest news story in marketing?\n\nIt\u2019s the grass phenomenon. Nobody ever notices the grass growing or pays\nattention to a trend that is slow in developing.\n\nTake facsimile, for example. Over the past two decades, the facsimile has\nbecome an indispensable part of every company\u2019s communication portfolio.\nAmericans will send 65 billion pages of faxes this year, more than 230 per\nperson. And 50 percent of all international telephone calls are now fax calls.\n\nYet we don\u2019t remember a single article in any of the major management\npublications on the rise of facsimile. It happened too slowly.\n\nOn the other hand, the opposite is true of the Internet. The rise of the\nInternet happened so quickly that it created a blaze of publicity, as did the\nrapid fall of Internet stocks.\n\nAdvertising executives in particular are inclined to slight public relations.\n\u201cTf the advertising is brilliant, the PR will fall out of that,\u201d said one\nparticularly brilliant advertising executive recently.\n\nBut what works in branding today is publicity, not advertising. This is\nespecially true in the high-tech field.

By publicity, not by\nadvertising.\n\nYears ago we worked with Lotus Development Corp. on branding strategy\nfor Lotus Notes. The essence of the strategy was the promotion of Notes as\n\u201cthe first successful groupware product.\u201d With, of course, the emphasis on\n\u201cgroupware.\u201d\n\nThis idea caught on like crazy with the media, which ran story after story on\nthe new groupware concept. Yet typically the Lotus advertising people\nignored the groupware idea in favor of nonsensical advertising pabulum.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter because public relations is more important than advertising.\nAs a result of the publicity program, Notes became an enormous success\nand ultimately IBM paid the astounding price of $3.5 billion for Lotus\nDevelopment Corp.\n\nMost companies develop their branding strategies as if advertising were\ntheir primary communications vehicle.

The original text is: 'Your advertising budget is like a country\u2019s defense budget. Those massive\nadvertising dollars don\u2019t buy you anything; they just keep you from losing\nmarket share to your competition.\n\nAll of its tanks, planes, and missiles just keep a country from being overrun\nby one of its enemies.\n\nPublicity is a powerful tool, but sooner or later a brand outlives its publicity\npotential. The process normally goes through two distinct phases.\n\nPhase one involves the introduction of the new category\u2014the plain-paper\ncopier, for example, introduced by Xerox in 1959. Hundreds of magazine\nand newspaper articles were written about the launch of the 914 copier.\nXerox executives also appeared on numerous television shows to\ndemonstrate their new baby. Much was written about the potential of the\nnew category.\n\nPhase two concerns the rise of the company that pioneered the new\ncategory. Again, hundreds of articles were written about the marketing and\nfinancial successes of Xerox, a company that rose from the ashes of Haloid,\na manufacturer of photographic paper.\n\nToday, everybody knows that Xerox pioneered xerography and has become\na global leader in copiers. There\u2019s no news story left to tell, so advertising\n\ntakes over.\n\nAlmost every successful brand goes through the same process. Brands like\nCompaq, Dell, SAP, Oracle, Cisco, Microsoft, Starbucks, and Wal-Mart\nwere born in a blaze of publicity. As the publicity dies out, each of these\nbrands has had to shift to massive advertising to defend its position. First\npublicity, then advertising is the general rule.\n\n(Anybody who thinks advertising built Microsoft into a macrobrand should\ngo back and read Chapter 3 again.)\n\nSooner or later a leader has to shift its branding strategy from publicity to\nadvertising. By raising the price of admission, advertising makes it difficult\nfor a competitor to carve out a substantial share of the market.\n\nTo attack a heavily defended neighboring country requires substantial\nmilitary expenditures. To attack a heavily defended brand leader like Coca-\nCola, Nike, or McDonald\u2019s requires substantial marketing expenditures.\n\nLeaders should not look on their advertising budgets as investments that\nwill pay dividends. Instead leaders should look on their advertising budgets\nas insurance that will protect them against losses caused by competitive\nattacks.\n\nWhat should a brand leader advertise? Brand leadership, of course.\nLeadership is the single most important motivating factor in consumer\nbehavior.\n\n\u00a2 Heinz, America\u2019s favorite ketchup\n\n\u00a2 Budweiser, king of beers\n\n\u00a2 Coca-Cola, the real thing\n\n\u00a2 Visa, it\u2019s everywhere you want to be\n\u00a2 Barilla, Italy\u2019s #1 pasta\n\n\u00a2 Goodyear, #1 in tires\n\nThe list of leaders that advertise their leadership is very short. Most leaders\nadvertise some aspect of their quality.\n\nBut what happens when your advertising says, \u201cOur product is better\u201d?\nWhat does the reader, the viewer, or the listener to the advertisement really\nthink when you make the claim that you produce a better product?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what they all say.\u201d\n\nPick up a copy of any magazine or newspaper and flip through the\nadvertisements. Almost every ad makes some type of better-product claim.\nThat\u2019s what they all say.\n\nBut what happens when your advertising says, \u201cOur product is the leader\u201d?\nWhat does the prospect think?\n\n\u201cTt must be better.\u201d\n\nWho makes the best ketchup in America? Do you really believe Hunt\u2019s is\nthe best? You might, but most people believe that Heinz is the best. Why?\n\nHeinz is the leader and everybody knows that in this freedom-loving,\ndemocratic, equal-opportunity country of ours, the better product always\nwins.\n\n\u201c] pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, the republic\nfor which it stands, and the leading brand in each category.\u201d\n\nAs yet, we Americans don\u2019t do the pledge of brand allegiance, but we might\nas well. That\u2019s how strong our belief in the notion that the better brand will\nwin.\n\nThen why, you may ask, don\u2019t more advertisers advertise leadership? (Such\nclaims are quite rare.)\n\nThey do consumer research. They ask customers why they buy the brands\nthey buy. And people are quick to reply that they would never buy a brand\njust because it\u2019s the leader. As a matter of fact, they go out of their way to\ndeny it.\n\n\u201cT never buy a brand just because it\u2019s the leader.\u201d\n\nThen why did you choose the leading brand? Why do you drink Coca-Cola?\nOr rent from Hertz? Or drink Budweiser beer?\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s better.\u201d\n\nAnd now we have completed the circle. Everyone knows the better product\nwill win in the marketplace. Since most people want to buy the better\nproduct, most people buy the leading brand. Which in turn keeps that brand\nthe leader and gives that brand the perception that it\u2019s the better product.\n\nAdvertising is a powerful tool, not to build leadership of a fledgling brand,\nbut to maintain that leadership once it is obtained. Companies that want to\nprotect their well-established brands should not hesitate to use massive\nadvertising programs to smother the competition.\n\nIndeed, advertising is expensive. Today it takes $2 million or so to buy\nthirty seconds of advertising time during the Super Bowl. And top-rated\nprime-time shows are equally ridiculous from a monetary point of view. ER,\nfor example, costs $620,000 for a thirty-second commercial. Then you have\nto add the cost of production, which has been averaging $343,000 per\ncommercial.\n\nSo why spend the money?\n\nAdvertising may not pay for itself, but if you\u2019re the leader, advertising will\nmake your competitor pay through the nose for the privilege of competing\nwith you. Many won\u2019t be able to afford it; those who can won\u2019t bother.\nInstead they\u2019lI be content to nibble on the crumbs around your huge piece\nof the pie.\n'.

(Such\nclaims are quite rare.)\n\nThey do consumer research. They ask customers why they buy the brands\nthey buy. And people are quick to reply that they would never buy a brand\njust because it\u2019s the leader. As a matter of fact, they go out of their way to\ndeny it.\n\n\u201cT never buy a brand just because it\u2019s the leader.\u201d\n\nThen why did you choose the leading brand? Why do you drink Coca-Cola?\nOr rent from Hertz? Or drink Budweiser beer?\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s better.\u201d\n\nAnd now we have completed the circle. Everyone knows the better product\nwill win in the marketplace. Since most people want to buy the better\nproduct, most people buy the leading brand. Which in turn keeps that brand\nthe leader and gives that brand the perception that it\u2019s the better product.\n\nAdvertising is a powerful tool, not to build leadership of a fledgling brand,\nbut to maintain that leadership once it is obtained. Companies that want to\nprotect their well-established brands should not hesitate to use massive\nadvertising programs to smother the competition.\n\nIndeed, advertising is expensive. Today it takes $2 million or so to buy\nthirty seconds of advertising time during the Super Bowl. And top-rated\nprime-time shows are equally ridiculous from a monetary point of view. ER,\nfor example, costs $620,000 for a thirty-second commercial. Then you have\nto add the cost of production, which has been averaging $343,000 per\ncommercial.\n\nSo why spend the money?\n\nAdvertising may not pay for itself, but if you\u2019re the leader, advertising will\nmake your competitor pay through the nose for the privilege of competing\nwith you. Many won\u2019t be able to afford it; those who can won\u2019t bother.\nInstead they\u2019lI be content to nibble on the crumbs around your huge piece\nof the pie.\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Below is an excerpt from my book titled 'The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding How to Build a Product or Service into a World-Class Brand ', specifically from Chapter '5 THE LAW OF THE WORD', Section 'A brand should strive to own a word\nin the mind of the consumer.'. The original text is: 'What comes to mind when you think about owning a\nMercedes-Benz?\n\nIf you could pry open the mind of the typical automobile buyer, you would\nprobably find the word \u201cprestige\u201d closely identified with the brand. Tell the\ntruth, don\u2019t you associate prestige with the Mercedes-Benz brand? Most\npeople do.\n\nYou might also associate attributes like expensive, German, well\nengineered, and reliable with the brand, but the core differentiation is\nprestige. Lamborghinis are expensive, Audis are German, Hondas are well\nengineered, and Toyotas are reliable, but none of these brands conveys the\nprestige of a Mercedes.\n\nIf you want to build a brand, you must focus your branding efforts on\nowning a word in the prospect\u2019s mind. A word that nobody else owns.\n\nWhat prestige is to Mercedes, safety is to Volvo.\nVolvo owns the word \u201csafety\u201d in the mind of the automobile buyer. And, as\n\naresult, over the past decade Volvo has become the largest-selling\nEuropean luxury car in America.\n\nOnce a brand owns a word, it\u2019s almost impossible for a competitor to take\nthat word away from the brand. Could you build a safer car than a Volvo?\nProbably. Many brands have already claimed to do so, including Saab,\nBMW, and Mercedes-Benz. Could one of these other brands own the word\n\u201csafety\u201d in the mind? Probably not.\n\nWhat comes to mind when you think about owning a BMW?\n\nA car that\u2019s fun to drive. The ultimate driving machine. BMW owns the\nword \u201cdriving\u201d in the mind. And, as a result, BMW has become the second-\nlargest-selling European luxury car in America.\n\nYet none of these three brands (Mercedes, Volvo, and BMW) is a perfect\nexample of the law of the word since they have all recently violated the law.\nMercedes has moved into less expensive, less prestigious cars. Volvo into\nsporty cars. And BMW into more luxurious cars.\n\nAnd so it goes. The minute a brand begins to stand for something in the\nmind, the company that owns the brand looks for ways to broaden the base,\nto get into other markets, to capture other attributes. This is a serious error\nand one of the most common mistakes in branding.\n\nWhat\u2019s a Kleenex? What word do you associate with the Kleenex brand?\n\nOn the surface, Kleenex seems unfocused. It\u2019s soft and pops up; it\u2019s well\nknown and comes in many different forms. There are sport Kleenexes,\nfamily-size Kleenexes, psychedelic Kleenexes. Kleenex is by far the\nleading brand of pocket tissue.\n\nWhat word does Kleenex own in the mind? Kleenex owns the category\nword. Kleenex is tissue.\n\nKleenex was the first pocket tissue. Before Kimberly-Clark introduced\nKleenex, there was no market for a pocket tissue. But instead of expanding\nto toilet tissue and paper towels, Kleenex kept hammering away at its\noriginal focus.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t put a cold in your pocket,\u201d was the marketing message for many\nyears. The pocket handkerchief virtually disappeared from the market,\nreplaced by Kleenex tissues in their many variations.\n\nWhy don\u2019t the many varieties of tissue dilute the Kleenex brand? Because\nwhen a person looks across a room, sees a box of Scott tissue, and says:\n\u201cPlease hand me a Kleenex,\u201d you know you have a solid brand locked into\nthe mind of the consumer.\n\nIn the same way that Kleenex owns tissue, Jell-O owns gelatin dessert,\nCoca-Cola owns cola, Band-Aid owns adhesive bandage, Saran Wrap owns\nplastic food film, and Rollerblade owns in-line skates.\n\nYou know your brand owns the category name when people use your brand\nname generically.\n\n\u201cMake me a Xerox copy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need a Q-Tip.\u201d\n\n\u201cCover the plate with Reynolds Wrap.\u201d\n\u201cHand me the Scotch tape.\u201d\n\nNor is it any secret how these brands managed to own the category word.\nThey were first, plain and simple.\n\nHere\u2019s the catch: You can\u2019t become generic by overtaking the leader. Pepsi\nwon\u2019t become generic for cola even if the brand outsells Coke (as it once\ndid in the supermarket distribution channel). You can only become generic\nby being the first brand and establishing the category.\n\nSo what do you do if you weren\u2019t the first in a category? Quite often you\ncan create a new category by simply narrowing your focus.\n\nEmery Air Freight, started in 1946, was the first air cargo carrier. But\nEmery fell into the Chevrolet trap. Instead of focusing on one type of\nservice, it offered everything. Overnight, inexpensive two- or three-day\n\nservice, small packages, large packages. \u201cWhatever you want to ship,\nEmery can handle it.\u201d\n\nWhat did Federal Express do? In the early seventies, it was a struggling\nplayer in the delivery business. But in a streak of brilliance, CEO Fred\nSmith decided to narrow its focus to overnight delivery only. \u201cWhen it\nabsolutely, positively has to be there overnight.\u201d\n\nToday Federal Express is a much larger company than Emery (now called\nEmery Worldwide). And \u201cFedEx\u201d has become the generic term for\novernight delivery.\n\n\u201cFedEx this package to the Coast.\u201d\nWhat word does Federal Express own in the mind? \u201cOvernight,\u201d of course.\n\nSo what did Federal Express do next? It went global, where the very thing it\nhad become known for, overnight delivery, is impossible. (Five o\u2019clock in\nthe afternoon in New York is already tomorrow morning in Singapore.) And\nit got into less expensive two-and three-day delivery. And it recently bought\na trucking company.\n\nVirtually every marketing move Federal Express has made in the last dozen\nyears has moved the company further away from the overnight concept.\n\nDoes this expansion hurt the brand? Yes. Does it hurt the company? Maybe\nnot, as long as there are no competitors astute enough to narrow the focus\nand put the same squeeze on Federal Express that Federal Express put on\nEmery Air Freight.\n\nLook at what Prego did to Ragu. For years Ragu was the leading brand of\nspaghetti sauce with a market share in excess of 50 percent. Like Emery Air\nFreight, Ragu had many different varieties.\n\nSo what did Prego do? The brand narrowed its focus to one variety, \u201cthick\u201d\nspaghetti sauce. With this one type of sauce Prego won 27 percent of the\nmarket. Prego owns the word \u201cthick\u201d in the mind of the spaghetti sauce\nbuyer.\n\nThe same principle holds true in many different categories, no matter how\nnarrow or obscure the industry. In the financial world, a \u201cBloomberg\u201d is a\nterminal that provides analytical tools as well as instant business news and\nstock prices. Bloomberg LP was the first company to introduce a device\nthat would help money managers contrast and compare financial data.\n\nWords are the key to brand building. Reality, of course, rests in a visual\nworld of shapes, colors, textures, and dimensions. But reality has no\nmeaning without the context provided by the human mind. The mind gives\nmeaning to visual reality by using words. Only when the mind thinks that\nan object is large or small, beautiful or ugly, dark or light, does that\nmeaning arise.\n\nThe same is true of the product or service you are selling. The product itself\nmight have a visual reality. But it\u2019s the brand name and its associations that\ngive the product meaning in the consumer\u2019s mind.\n\nSo you can forget about the laundry list of wonderful attributes your\nproduct has. You can\u2019t possibly associate them all with your brand name in\na human mind. To get into the consumer\u2019s mind you have to sacrifice. You\nhave to reduce the essence of your brand to a single thought or attribute. An\nattribute that nobody else already owns in your category.\n\nThe average adult knows the meanings of perhaps 50,000 words. Yet there\nare about 2.5 million registered trademarks in the United States. And you\nwant your trademark to stand for how many different attributes in the mind?\n\nUntil science figures out a way to replace human brain tissue with silicon\nchips, it\u2019s a physical impossibility for most brands to go beyond a single\nword. Consider yourself lucky if your brand can own a word like \u201csafety\u201d\nor \u201cdriving\u201d or \u201cthick\u201d or \u201covernight.\u201d\n\nMany marketers know this and they still look to expand the meanings of\ntheir brands. Why?\n\nGrowth. They feel trapped in their present positions. They want to grow, so\nthey think they have no choice but to expand their brands.\n\nBut what works is not expanding the brand, but expanding the market. In\nother words, instead of moving from overnight to two- or three-day\ndelivery, Federal Express expanded the market for overnight delivery.\n\nBy focusing on overnight, Federal Express was able to make overnight the\nin thing among business executives. As a result of its high price and flashy\npackaging, people thought, \u201cHey, this package must be important because it\ncame via Federal Express.\u201d\n\nAnd overnight deliveries boomed along with the fortunes of FedEx.\n\nMercedes employed a similar strategy. What was the market for expensive\nautomobiles before Mercedes-Benz? Teeny-tiny.\n\nMercedes built the market for expensive cars by using prestige as its\nstrategy. But you need subtlety in dealing with a word like \u201cprestige.\u201d Its\nconnotations may work in brand building, but the word itself does not. It\u2019s\nnot that people aren\u2019t dying to own prestige brands. They just hate to admit\nit.\n\nTo be successful in branding a \u201cprestige\u201d product or service, you need to do\ntwo things:\n\n1. You need to make your product or service more expensive than the\ncompetition.\n\n2. You need to find a code word for prestige.\n\nThe first part was easy. Mercedes-Benz priced its vehicles at about twice\nthe price of a comparable Cadillac. \u201cMercedes cars must be better than\nCadillacs,\u201d thinks the buyer, \u201cbecause they are twice as expensive.\u201d\n\nMercedes also found a powerful code word for prestige. \u201cEngineered like\nno other car in the world.\u201d\n\nWhat overnight did for Federal Express, engineering did for Mercedes. It\nexpanded the market by giving the owner an excuse to buy an expensive,\n\nprestigious car. Instead of a Cadillac, the car of choice for the country-club\ncrowd became a Mercedes.\n\nBut like Federal Express, Mercedes has also started expanding the brand\nwith cheap sports cars, inexpensive sedans, and sport-utility vehicles. With\naname like Mercedes-Benz, a reputation like Mercedes-Benz, and a history\nlike Mercedes-Benz (the company invented the automobile), the brand\nshould be the largest-selling luxury car in America. But it\u2019s not.\n\nGo back in history. By far the most successful brands are those that kept a\nnarrow focus and then expanded the category as opposed to those brands\nthat tried to expand their names into other categories.\n\nWhat was the market for expensive pens before Montblanc? Minuscule.\n\nWhat was the market for expensive vodka before Stolichnaya and Absolut?\nNil.\nWhat was the market for safe cars before Volvo? Zip.\n\nIf \u201cwhat is the size of the market?\u201d is the first question your company asks\nitself, then you are taking the wrong road to success.\n\nAsk not what percentage of an existing market your brand can achieve, ask\nhow large a market your brand can create by narrowing its focus and\nowning a word in the mind.\n'.

The original text is: 'Customers are suspicious. They tend to disbelieve most product claims.\nYour brand might last longer, require less maintenance, and be easier to use,\nbut who will accept claims like these?\n\nThere is one claim, however, that should take precedence over every other\nclaim. It\u2019s the one claim that elevates the brand above the competition. And\nmakes every other claim much more believable.\n\nIt\u2019s the real thing. It\u2019s the claim to authenticity.\n\nWhen Coca-Cola first made this claim customers instantly responded.\n\u201cYes,\u201d they agreed. \u201cCoke is the real thing. Everything else is an imitation.\u201d\n\nEven though the last \u201creal thing\u201d advertising ran almost thirty years ago, the\nconcept has become closely associated with Coca-Cola.

When you have the right credentials, your prospect is likely to\nbelieve almost anything you say about your brand.\n\nLeadership is the most direct way to establish the credentials of a brand.\nCoca-Cola, Hertz, Heinz, Visa, and Kodak all have credentials because they\nare widely perceived to be the leading brands in their categories. When you\ndon\u2019t have the leading brand, your best strategy is to create a new category\nin which you can claim leadership.\n\nWhich is what Polaroid did when it became the leader in the new category\nof instant photography. Yet when it tried to tackle Kodak in conventional\nphotographic film, Polaroid failed miserably.\n\nMany marketers attribute Polaroid\u2019s failure to the fact that the brand\ncouldn\u2019t be \u201cstretched\u201d from instant to conventional 35mm film. While true,\nthis conclusion doesn\u2019t really describe the dynamics involved.\n\nThe simple fact is that Polaroid has no credentials in conventional 35mm\nfilm. Why buy your conventional film from Polaroid when Kodak is the\nexpert in this category? Only if you want instant film will you buy Polaroid;\nit\u2019s the company that knows instant photography.\n\nA number of years ago, Patrick Sullivan (currently CEO of SalesLogix)\narrived in our offices with a software product called Act. \u201cWhat does Act\ndo?\u201d we asked.\n\n\u201cEverything,\u201d Pat replied. \u201cAct keeps track of your calendar, your\ncorrespondence, your mailing lists, and your expense accounts. Act literally\ndoes everything.\u201d\n\nNot a good direction. We wanted to find the one thing we could use to build\nanew category. After much discussion the group decided that the new\nsoftware could best be described as \u201ccontact\u201d software. In other words,\nsoftware designed for salespeople and others who do contact work.\n\n\u201cThe largest-selling contact software\u201d became the credentials for the new\nbrand. Everywhere the brand name was used, the credentials were also\nused. In publicity, advertising, brochures, letterheads, calling cards. Even on\nthe product box itself.\n\nToday, Act has 70 percent of the contact software market and has become\nthe dominant brand in the category.\n\nCredentials are particularly important in the publicity process. Reporters\nand editors are quick to dismiss advertising claims as puffery. But they\nreadily acknowledge leadership and other aspects related to a brand\u2019s\ncredentials.\n\n\u00a2 Ifareporter is doing a car-rental story, who is he or she likely to call\nfirst? Hertz, exactly.\n\n\u00a2 Ifa reporter is doing a cola story, he or she will almost always call\nCoca-Cola.\n\n\u00a2 Ifa reporter is doing a computer software story, he or she will\ninvariably call Microsoft.\n\nMany companies run branding programs almost devoid of credentials. If\nyou leaf through a stack of print ads or watch a series of television\ncommercials, you\u2019 ll find an endless parade of almost meaningless benefits:\nTastes great, saves money, whitens teeth, easy assembly, bigger, smaller,\nlighter, faster, cheaper. While many of these benefits may be of general\ninterest to prospective customers, they each lack credibility so they are\ngenerally ignored. \u201cThat\u2019s what they all say.\u201d\n\nWhen the benefits, however, are structured around some aspect of a brand\u2019s\ncredentials, they carry much more weight.\n\nIf Act claims to make you more productive on the road and cut your\npaperwork in half, then you tend to believe these claims because \u201cAct is the\nlargest-selling contact software.\u201d\n\nDatastream did the same thing in maintenance software. Early on,\nDatastream found itself with 32 percent of the market. Granted the market\nwas small. Very, very small.\n\nNo matter. Datastream promoted itself as \u201cthe leader in maintenance\nsoftware.\u201d This same leadership theme was used in all of Datastream\u2019s\n\nliterature. Today, the market has exploded and Datastream still dominates\nthe category. It truly is the leader in maintenance software.\n\nConventional thinking would have it otherwise. \u201cThe market is small.\nNobody cares that we\u2019re the leader. They don\u2019t even care about\nmaintenance software itself, otherwise they would be buying more of this\nkind of product. Forget leadership. We have to concentrate all of our efforts\non selling the benefits of the category.\u201d\n\nNever forget leadership. No matter how small the market, don\u2019t get duped\ninto simply selling the benefits of the category early in the branding\nprocess.\n\nThere are also the long-term benefits of leadership. Because once you get\non top, it\u2019s hard to lose your spot. A widely publicized study of twenty-five\nleading brands in twenty-five different product categories in the year 1923\nshowed that twenty of the same twenty-five brands are still the leaders in\ntheir categories today. In seventy-five years only five brands lost their\nleadership.\n\nNever assume that people know which brand is the leader. This is especially\ntrue in fast-growing, new categories like contact software and maintenance\nsoftware. Most new prospects have no experience with the category and\nlittle knowledge of available brands, so they naturally gravitate to the\nleading brand.\n\nAs the category matures, customers become more adventuresome and more\nwilling to try different brands that offer seemingly unique advantages.\nLeaders often have to write off the more sophisticated customers who will\ngo out of their way not to buy the leading brand.\n\nWrite them off. You can\u2019t appeal to everybody.\nNot all brands can be leaders, although every category offers a wealth of\npossibilities. Take beer, for example. Here are some categories for beer\n\nleadership credentials:\n\n\u00a2 The leading beer\n\nTl\nTl\nTl\nTl\n\u00b0 Ti\nTl\nTl\nTl\nTl\n\nhe leading light beer\n\nhe leading imported beer\nhe leading microbrew\n\nhe leading ice beer\n\nhe leading high-priced beer\nhe leading Mexican beer\n\nhe leading German beer\n\nhe leading Canadian beer\n\nhe leading Japanese beer\n\nFor almost all of the hundreds of companies we have worked with around\n\nthe wo\n\nrid, we have found some credentials that could be exploited. If not,\n\nwe created the credentials by inventing a new category.\n\nYou se\n\ne credentials at work in everyday life. How many times have you\n\nwalked away from a new restaurant because it was almost empty? Most\n\npeople\n\nprefer to wait for a table at a restaurant that is crowded, rather than\n\neat in an empty one. If this place was really good (goes the thinking), there\n\nwould\n\nThat\u2019s\n\nbe a line out the door.\n\nthe power of credentials.\n'.

They tend to disbelieve most product claims.\nYour brand might last longer, require less maintenance, and be easier to use,\nbut who will accept claims like these?\n\nThere is one claim, however, that should take precedence over every other\nclaim. It\u2019s the one claim that elevates the brand above the competition. And\nmakes every other claim much more believable.\n\nIt\u2019s the real thing. It\u2019s the claim to authenticity.\n\nWhen Coca-Cola first made this claim customers instantly responded.\n\u201cYes,\u201d they agreed. \u201cCoke is the real thing. Everything else is an imitation.\u201d\n\nEven though the last \u201creal thing\u201d advertising ran almost thirty years ago, the\nconcept has become closely associated with Coca-Cola.

When you have the right credentials, your prospect is likely to\nbelieve almost anything you say about your brand.\n\nLeadership is the most direct way to establish the credentials of a brand.\nCoca-Cola, Hertz, Heinz, Visa, and Kodak all have credentials because they\nare widely perceived to be the leading brands in their categories. When you\ndon\u2019t have the leading brand, your best strategy is to create a new category\nin which you can claim leadership.\n\nWhich is what Polaroid did when it became the leader in the new category\nof instant photography.

Below is an excerpt from my book titled 'The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding How to Build a Product or Service into a World-Class Brand ', specifically from Chapter '7 THE LAW OF QUALITY', Section 'Quality is important, but brands\nare not built by quality alone.'. The original text is: 'What is quality?\n\nEverybody thinks they can tell a high-quality product from a low-quality\none, but in reality things are not always so obvious.\n\n\u00a2 Does a Rolex keep better time than a Timex? Are you sure?\n\u00a2 Does a Leica take better pictures than a Pentax?

Are you sure?\n\u00a2 Does a Montblanc pen write better than a Cross? Are you sure?\n\n\u00a2 Does Coca-Cola taste better than Pepsi-Cola? Most people seem to\nthink so, because Coke outsells Pepsi. Yet in blind taste tests most\npeople prefer the taste of Pepsi.\n\nCommon wisdom blames the testing procedures. If Coke outsells Pepsi,\nthere must be something wrong with a taste test that shows the opposite.\n\nQuality is a concept that has thousands of adherents. The way to build a\nbetter brand, goes the thinking, is by building a better-quality product.\n\nWhat seems so intuitively true in theory is not always so in practice.\nBuilding your brand on quality is like building your house on sand. You can\nbuild quality into your product, but that has little to do with your success in\nthe marketplace.\n\nYears of observation have led us to this conclusion. There is almost no\ncorrelation between success in the marketplace and success in comparative\ntesting of brands\u2014whether it be taste tests, accuracy tests, reliability tests,\ndurability tests, or any other independent, objective third-party testing of\nbrands.\n\nRead Consumer Reports. And then check the sales rankings of the brands\ntested compared to the magazine\u2019s quality rankings. You will find little\ncorrelation. As a matter of fact, the magazine\u2019s success could be attributed\nto its ability to find little-known brands that outperform leading brands.\n\nIn a recent ranking of sixteen brands of small cars, the number-one brand in\nquality was twelfth in sales. The number-two brand in quality was ninth in\nsales. The number-three brand in quality was dead last in sales. If quality\ntranslates into sales, the numbers don\u2019t seem to show it.\n\nLet\u2019s say you went shopping for an automobile tomorrow. Does quality\nmatter? Absolutely. Most car buyers look for the best-quality car they can\nafford.\n\nBut where does the concept of quality reside? In the showroom? No.\n\nQuality, or rather the perception of quality, resides in the mind of the buyer.\nIf you want to build a powerful brand, you have to build a powerful\nperception of quality in the mind.\n\nAs it happens, the best way to build a quality perception in the mind is by\nfollowing the laws of branding.\n\nTake the law of contraction. What happens when you narrow your focus?\nYou become a specialist rather than a generalist. And a specialist is\ngenerally perceived to know more, in other words to have \u201chigher quality,\u201d\nthan a generalist.\n\nDoes a cardiologist know more about the heart than a general practitioner of\nmedicine? Most people think so. Certainly the perception is true. From a\nmarketing point of view, it really doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nYet most companies want to be general practitioners. Why? They want to\nexpand the market for their products and services. And in doing so they\nviolate the law of expansion.\n\nAnother important aspect of brand building is having a better name.

Expanding a\nbrand and being a generalist tend to destroy your ability to select a powerful\nname.\n\nThere is much misinformation on this subject in business publications\ntoday.

But don\u2019t count on quality alone to build\nyour brand.\n\nTo build a quality brand you need to narrow the focus and combine that\nnarrow focus with a better name and a higher price.\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Below is an excerpt from my book titled 'The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding How to Build a Product or Service into a World-Class Brand ', specifically from Chapter '8 THE LAW OF THE CATEGORY', Section 'A leading brand should promote\nthe category, not the brand.'. The original text is: 'According to the law of contraction a brand becomes stronger when you\nnarrow its focus. What happens when you narrow the focus to such a degree\nthat there is no longer any market for the brand?\n\nThis is potentially the best situation of all. What you have created is the\nopportunity to introduce a brand-new category.\n\n\u00a2 What was the market for an expensive vodka before Stolichnaya?\nAlmost nothing.\n\n\u00a2 What was the market for expensive cars before Mercedes-Benz?\nAlmost nothing.\n\n\u00a2 What was the market for cheap cars before Volkswagen? Almost\nnothing.\n\n\u00a2 What was the market for home pizza delivery before Domino\u2019s Pizza?\nAlmost nothing.\n\n\u00a2 What was the market for in-line skates before Rollerblade? Almost\nnothing.\n\nThere\u2019s a paradox here. Branding is widely perceived as the process of\ncapturing a bigger share of an existing market. Which is what is usually\n\nmeant when the newly appointed CEO says, \u201cWe have to grow the\nbusiness.\u201d\n\nYet the most efficient, most productive, most useful aspect of branding has\nnothing to do with increasing a company\u2019s market share.\n\nThe most efficient, most productive, most useful aspect of branding is\ncreating a new category. In other words, narrowing the focus to nothing and\nstarting something totally new.\n\nThat\u2019s the way to become the first brand in a new category and ultimately\nthe leading brand in a rapidly growing new segment of the market.\n\nTo build a brand in a nonexisting category, to build something out of\nnothing, you have to do two things at once:\n\n\u00a2 You have to launch the brand in such a way as to create the perception\nthat that brand was the first, the leader, the pioneer, or the original.\nInvariably, you should use one of these words to describe your brand.\n\n\u00a2 You have to promote the new category.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it easier to just promote the brand and forget about the category?\u201d\nyou might be thinking. Easier, yes, but not as effective.\n\nWhen Apple introduced its ill-fated Newton, it forgot about the category\nname. At first it called the Newton a \u201cPDA,\u201d for personal digital assistant.\n\nA notebook computer, a digital cell phone, or a digital watch can all be\nconsidered personal digital assistants. PDA did not distinguish the Newton\nfrom all those other personal digital assistants on the market.\n\nYou knew the Newton was in trouble when Apple ran big advertisements\nwith the headline, \u201cWhat is Newton?\u201d\n\nBetter to answer that question before you launch a new brand rather than\nafter.\n\nCustomers don\u2019t really care about new brands, they care about new\ncategories. They don\u2019t care about Domino\u2019s; they care about whether or not\ntheir pizza will arrive in thirty minutes. They don\u2019t care about Callaway;\nthey care about whether or not an oversize driver will cut strokes off their\ngolf scores. They don\u2019t care about Prince; they care about whether or not an\noversize racquet will improve their tennis game.\n\nBy first preempting the category (as Prince did with the oversize tennis\nracquet, as Callaway did with the oversize driver, and as Domino\u2019s did with\nhome delivery of pizza) and then aggressively promoting the category, you\ncreate both a powerful brand and a rapidly escalating market. Callaway\nGolf outsells the next three brands combined.\n\nEatZi\u2019s is trying to do the same thing in the restaurant business. Average\nannual per-unit sales of the units in operation are an astounding $14 million.\n(The highest-grossing restaurant in the world is reportedly Tavern on the\nGreen in New York City\u2019s Central Park, which does in the neighborhood of\n$35 million a year.)\n\nWith only a handful of units in operation, EatZi\u2019s has created an incredible\namount of excitement in the restaurant industry. Yet the concept is\nsimplicity itself.\n\nLast year, Americans spent $207 billion on restaurant meals, a sizable\nmarket. Of that total, 51 percent was spent for takeout or home delivery.\n\nWhat Little Caesars did in pizza, EatZi\u2019s is doing in high-end white-\ntablecloth restaurant meals: narrowing the focus to takeout only.\n\nThat\u2019s the way you build a brand. Narrow the focus to a slice of the market,\nwhether it\u2019s pizza takeout or gourmet takeout. Then make your brand name\nstand for the category (the generic effect) at the same time that you expand\nthe category by promoting the benefits of the category, not the brand.\n\nWhat are the benefits of takeout pizza? It\u2019s the cheapest way to sell a pizza.\nNo waiters or waitresses. No delivery trucks. As a result Little Caesars can\nsell a pizza cheaper than its competition. It captures this concept with its\nslogan, \u201cPizza! Pizza!\u201d Or the promise of two pizzas for the price of one.\n\nEatZi\u2019s has yet to conceptualize the benefits of takeout beef Wellington, but\nthat\u2019s what it should be working on. Promote the category, not the brand.\nWhat EatZi\u2019s calls the \u201cmeal-market\u201d category.\n\nWhen you\u2019re first, you can preempt the category. You are the only brand\nassociated with the concept. You have a powerful publicity platform. You\nneed to put your branding dollars behind the concept itself, so the concept\nwill take off, pulling the brand along with it.\n\nWhat happens when competition appears, as it inevitably does? Most\ncategory leaders just can\u2019t wait to shift into a brand-building mode. That\u2019s a\nmistake. Leaders should continue to promote the category, to increase the\nsize of the pie rather than their slice of the pie.\n\nBoston Chicken was a huge hit when it opened its doors. It was the first\nfast-food restaurant to focus on rotisserie chicken for the take-home dinner\nmarket. But instead of continuing to promote rotisserie chicken, it changed\nits name to Boston Market, added turkey, meatloaf, and ham to the menu,\nand fell into trouble.\n\nLeaders get antsy as their 100 percent share of the initial market drops to 90\nand then to 80 or 70 percent as the market grows. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to fight back\nand recapture our rightful share,\u201d they say.\n\nThe rightful share of a leading brand is never more than 50 percent. There\u2019s\nalways room for a second brand and a passel of lesser brands. Instead of\nfighting competitive brands, a leader should fight competitive categories.\n\n\u201cTake the bus,\u201d category leader Greyhound once said, \u201cand leave the\ndriving to us.\u201d\n\n\u201cTake home your meals from EatZi\u2019s,\u201d the meal-market category leader\ncould say, \u201cand leave the cooking to us.\u201d\n\nContrary to popular belief, what would help EatZi\u2019s (and every category\npioneer) is competition. Even though the leader\u2019s market share might\ndecline, the rise of competitive brands can stimulate consumer interest in\nthe category.\n\nOne of Polaroid\u2019s biggest mistakes was forcing Kodak out of the instant-\nphotography market. Although it won a few million in its lawsuit, Polaroid\neffectively removed a competitor that could have greatly expanded the\nmarket. (A Coke/Pepsi advertising war benefits both brands. It attracts\nmedia attention, which expands the consumer\u2019s interest in the cola\ncategory.)\n\nYears ago, Johnson & Johnson, the leading brand of baby shampoo,\nmounted a major marketing campaign to sell the merits of its shampoo to\nadults. \u201cYou wash your hair every day, you need a mild shampoo. And what\nshampoo could be milder than a baby shampoo?\u201d\n\nBrilliant. At one point Johnson & Johnson baby shampoo became the\nnumber-one brand of adult shampoo. If other baby shampoo brands had\njumped on the adult bandwagon, sales might have gone even higher.\n\nUnfortunately for Johnson & Johnson, there were no other major baby\nshampoo brands.\n\nLeading brands should promote the category, not the brand.\n'.

Because in the long run a brand is nothing more\nthan a name.\n\nDon\u2019t confuse what makes a brand successful in the short term with what\nmakes a brand successful in the long term.\n\nIn the short term, a brand needs a unique idea or concept to survive. It needs\nto be first in a new category. It needs to own a word in the mind.\n\nBut in the long term, the unique idea or concept disappears. All that is left is\nthe difference between your brand name and the brand names of your\ncompetitors.\n\nXerox was the first plain-paper copier. This unique idea built the powerful\nXerox brand in the mind. But today all copiers are plain-paper copiers. The\ndifference between brands is not in the products, but in the product names.\nOr rather the perception of the names.\n\nIn the beginning it was easy to sell a Xerox 914 copier. All you had to do\nwas show the difference between a Xerox copy and an ordinary copy. The\nXerox copy was cleaner, sharper, and easier to read. The paper lay flat, felt\nbetter, and was much easier to handle and sort.\n\nToday those differences are gone, but Xerox is still the best brand by far in\nthe copier field. One reason is the name itself.\n\nIt\u2019s short, unique, and connotes high technology.

I\nwould never call a new product with as much potential as the 914 copier the\n\u2018Haloid Paper Master.\u2019 \u201c\n\nIn retrospect, no. In futurespect, maybe you would. At least the vast\nmajority of the companies we have worked with almost always prefer line-\nextended generic names to unique new brand names.\n\nOn a global scale, this is the biggest issue in the business community.\nCompanies are divided into two camps: those who believe that the essence\nof business success is in the continuing development of superior products\nand services, and those who believe in branding. The product versus the\nbrand.\n\nThe product camp dominates the marketing scene. \u201cThe brand name doesn\u2019t\nmatter. What counts is how the product performs.\u201d\n\nAs proof of this principle, product campers are quick to reduce the\nargument to absurdity. \u201cIf the product is no good, the product will fail\nregardless of whether the product has a good brand name or not.\u201d\n\nIs a Xerox copier better than a Canon copier? How does a Ricoh copier\ncompare with a Sharp copier?\n\nHave you ever bought a copier? Which brand of copier is no good? Forget\ncopiers. Which brands of any products are no good?\n\nSure, some people will dump on some brands. They might even say things\nlike \u201cI\u2019d never buy a Jaguar.\u201d But these opinions are seldom universal.\n\nThe no-good product is the red herring of marketing. It is constantly being\nused to justify the no-brand strategies of most companies.\n\nWe don\u2019t mean literally a no-brand strategy. A company might own brands\nthat might be called brands from a legal point of view in the sense that their\nnames are registered trademarks. But the company\u2019s strategies are based on\nbuilding the better product or service, and the brand names it uses to\naccompany these products have little power in the prospect\u2019s mind.\n\nProduct campers dominate the East Asia economy. Virtually every Asian\ncompany uses a megabrand, master-brand, or line-extension strategy.\n\nWhat\u2019s a Mitsubishi? Sixteen of the one hundred largest Japanese\ncompanies market products and services under the Mitsubishi name.\nEverything from automobiles to semiconductors to consumer electronics.\nFrom space equipment to transport systems.\n\nWhat\u2019s a Matsushita? Same problem as Mitsubishi. Eight of the one\nhundred largest Japanese companies market products and services under the\nMatsushita name. Everything from electric equipment to electronic products\nand components. From batteries to refrigeration equipment.\n\nWhat\u2019s a Mitsui? Same problem as Matsushita. Eight of the one hundred\nlargest Japanese companies market products and services under the Mitsui\nname.\n\nCompare Japan with the United States. In a recent year, the top hundred\ncompanies in the United States had sales of $3.2 trillion. In the same year,\nthe top hundred companies in Japan had sales of $2.6 trillion. Not that much\ndifference.\n\nThe real difference is in profits. The one hundred American companies had\nprofits on average of 6.2 percent of sales. The one hundred Japanese\ncompanies had profits on average of just 0.8 percent of sales.\n\nThat 0.8 percent is the average net profit in Japan. With so many companies\nclose to the break-even point, you can be sure that many are losing money\non a regular basis.\n\nThe Asian practice of fielding a wide variety of products under the same\nbrand name has drawn favorable comments from many business writers\nwho don\u2019t always look under the financial covers to find the real story.\n\nKorea is in even worse shape. In a recent year, the sixty-three largest\nKorean companies had sales of $409 billion, but had a combined net loss of\n0.4 percent of sales.\n\nTake Hyundai, for example. This $71 billion Korean chaebol brags about a\n\u201cchips to ships\u201d strategy. Hyundai makes microprocessors,\ntelecommunications satellites, passenger cars, commercial vehicles,\nsubways, high-speed trains, turnkey engineering and construction projects,\nsupertankers, and LNG carriers, among other products. All under the\nHyundai name.\n\nHyundai makes everything except money.\n\nThroughout Asia you see the same pattern. Rampant line extensions that are\ndestroying brands. (When you expand a brand, you reduce its power. When\nyou contract a brand, you increase its power.)\n\nBrands are not just something to think about at marketing meetings. Brands\nare the essence of the company itself. A company\u2019s very existence depends\non building brands in the mind.

Virtually every Asian\ncompany uses a megabrand, master-brand, or line-extension strategy.\n\nWhat\u2019s a Mitsubishi? Sixteen of the one hundred largest Japanese\ncompanies market products and services under the Mitsubishi name.\nEverything from automobiles to semiconductors to consumer electronics.\nFrom space equipment to transport systems.\n\nWhat\u2019s a Matsushita? Same problem as Mitsubishi. Eight of the one\nhundred largest Japanese companies market products and services under the\nMatsushita name. Everything from electric equipment to electronic products\nand components. From batteries to refrigeration equipment.\n\nWhat\u2019s a Mitsui? Same problem as Matsushita. Eight of the one hundred\nlargest Japanese companies market products and services under the Mitsui\nname.\n\nCompare Japan with the United States. In a recent year, the top hundred\ncompanies in the United States had sales of $3.2 trillion. In the same year,\nthe top hundred companies in Japan had sales of $2.6 trillion. Not that much\ndifference.\n\nThe real difference is in profits. The one hundred American companies had\nprofits on average of 6.2 percent of sales. The one hundred Japanese\ncompanies had profits on average of just 0.8 percent of sales.\n\nThat 0.8 percent is the average net profit in Japan. With so many companies\nclose to the break-even point, you can be sure that many are losing money\non a regular basis.\n\nThe Asian practice of fielding a wide variety of products under the same\nbrand name has drawn favorable comments from many business writers\nwho don\u2019t always look under the financial covers to find the real story.\n\nKorea is in even worse shape. In a recent year, the sixty-three largest\nKorean companies had sales of $409 billion, but had a combined net loss of\n0.4 percent of sales.\n\nTake Hyundai, for example. This $71 billion Korean chaebol brags about a\n\u201cchips to ships\u201d strategy. Hyundai makes microprocessors,\ntelecommunications satellites, passenger cars, commercial vehicles,\nsubways, high-speed trains, turnkey engineering and construction projects,\nsupertankers, and LNG carriers, among other products. All under the\nHyundai name.\n\nHyundai makes everything except money.\n\nThroughout Asia you see the same pattern. Rampant line extensions that are\ndestroying brands. (When you expand a brand, you reduce its power. When\nyou contract a brand, you increase its power.)\n\nBrands are not just something to think about at marketing meetings. Brands\nare the essence of the company itself. A company\u2019s very existence depends\non building brands in the mind. And so does a country\u2019s.\n\nEast Asia does not have a banking problem, a financial problem, a\nmonetary problem, or a political problem.\n\nEast Asia has a branding problem.\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The original text is: 'You don\u2019t have to go to Asia to find examples of rampant line extension.\n\nMore than 90 percent of all new products introduced in the U.S. grocery\nand drug trade are line extensions. Which is the major reason that stores are\nchoked with brands. (There are 1,300 shampoos, 200 cereals, 250 soft\ndrinks.)\n\nScanner data indicates that many of those line extensions (at least in\nsupermarkets) sit on the shelf and gather dust. Research from Kroger\nsupermarkets in Columbus, Ohio, found that of the average 23,000 items in\na store, 6,700 sold in a day, 13,600 sold in a week, and 17,500 sold ina\nmonth, leaving 5,500 that sold nothing in an entire month.\n\nThis plethora of line extensions, in our opinion, is the reason for the\nincreased demands from retailers for trade promotions, slotting fees, and\nreturn privileges.\n\nAccording to industry experts, power has been shifting from manufacturers\nto retailers. The primary reason is line extension. With so many products to\nchoose from, retailers can force manufacturers to pay for the privilege of\ngetting their products on the shelf. If one company won\u2019t pay, the retailer\ncan always find another company that will.\n\nNo industry is as line-extended as the beer industry. Before the launch of\nMiller Lite in the mid-seventies, there were three major beer brands:\nBudweiser, Miller High Life, and Coors Banquet.\n\nToday these three brands have become fourteen: Budweiser, Bud Light,\nBud Dry, Bud Ice, Miller High Life, Miller Lite, Miller Genuine Draft,\nMiller Genuine Draft Light, Miller Reserve, Miller Reserve Light, Miller\nReserve Amber Ale, Coors, Coors Light, and Coors Extra Gold.\n\nHave these fourteen brands increased their market share over that obtained\nby the original three brands? Not really. There has been some increase, but\nno greater than what you might expect. Big brands always put pressure on\nsmaller brands, in the same way that Coke and Pepsi have eroded the\nmarket share of Royal Crown Cola.\n\nHas the availability of these fourteen varieties of Budweiser, Miller, and\nCoors increased beer consumption? No. Per capita beer consumption over\nthe past twenty-five years has been relatively flat. (Cola consumption in the\nsame period of time has almost doubled.)\n\nWhen your customers are not exactly rushing out to buy your product, why\nwould you need more brands to satisfy those customers? Logic suggests\nyou would need fewer brands.\n\nBut that\u2019s customer logic. Manufacturer logic is different. If volume is\ngoing nowhere, the manufacturer concludes it needs more brands to\nmaintain or increase sales. When a category is increasing in sales, there are\nopportunities for new brands, but manufacturer logic suggests they\u2019re not\nneeded. \u201cWe are doing great, we don\u2019t need any more brands.\u201d\n\nAs a result, the marketplace is filled with line extensions in areas where\nthey are not needed and is starved for new brands in areas where they are\nneeded. Figure that one out.\n\nAnother reason for the rise in line extensions is a company\u2019s natural instinct\nto copy the competition. Miller\u2019s introduction of Miller Lite was quickly\nfollowed by Schlitz Light, Coors Light, Bud Light, Busch Light, Michelob\nLight, and Pabst Light. The light list is endless.\n\nIt\u2019s painful to remember and so hard to forget. After the introduction of\nMiller Lite, we rushed around the brewing industry with a simple message:\nKeep your beer brand focused on the regular market. That will give you a\nleg up on Joe Sixpack, who consumes an awful lot of beer. (You can see\nhow successful we were with our message.)\n\nWhy did Miller introduce Miller Regular, a brand which most beer drinkers\nhave never heard of? Because Anheuser-Busch has regular Budweiser,\nCoors has regular Coors, and Miller didn\u2019t have a regular beer.\n\nDon\u2019t laugh. This is the way companies think. The competition must know\nsomething we don\u2019t know. Let\u2019s do the same thing.\n\nOne reason 90 percent of all new brands are line extensions is that\nmanagement measures results with the wrong end of the ruler. It measures\nonly the success of the extension. It never measures the erosion of the core\nbrand.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the erosion, it\u2019s also the lost opportunities. Big powerful\nbrands should have market shares approaching 50 percent, like Coca-Cola,\nHeinz, Pop-Tarts, Jell-O, and Gerber\u2019s. But it\u2019s hard to find more than a few\nsuch brands. Most big brands have been line-extended to death.\n\n\u00a2 Budweiser (all varieties combined) has about 30 percent of the beer\nmarket.\n\n\u00a2 Marlboro (a brand that comes in at least a dozen different varieties,\nincluding Marlboro Lights, Marlboro Medium, and Marlboro Menthol)\nhas only 30 percent of the cigarette market.\n\n\u00a2 IBM has only 6 percent of the personal computer market.\n\nWhen Coors was planning the introduction of Coors Light, we asked one of\nits executives, \u201cWhere is the Coors Light business going to come from?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, we\u2019re going to take it away from Budweiser and Miller.\u201d\n\nWhen Budweiser was planning the introduction of Bud Light, the targets\nwere Miller and Coors.\n\nWhen Miller was planning the introduction of Miller Lite, the targets were\nBudweiser and Coors.\n\nMaybe this concept is too complicated for the average CEO to understand,\nbut isn\u2019t the Coors Light drinker more likely to come from Coors? And the\nBud Light drinker from Budweiser? And the Miller Lite drinker from Miller\nHigh Life?\n\nCertainly the numbers substantiate this conclusion. Since the introduction\nof the three lights, the three regular beer brands have all declined\nsubstantially.\n\n(And what can you say about Coors Rocky Mountain Spring Water? Born\nin 1990. Died in 1992. Mourned by no one. Not too many beer drinkers\nwanted to shift from beer to water.)\n\nThe market, you might be thinking, is shifting from regular to light beer.\nThat\u2019s true. But it\u2019s really two markets, and the best way to capture those\ntwo markets is with two brands.\n\nBut there are no major beer brands that are not line-extended, you might\nhave concluded. And you\u2019re right. And what a wonderful opportunity for\nsomeone who understands the laws of branding.\n\nActually, until a short time ago, there was one: Amstel Light, which became\nthe leading brand of imported light beer. So what did Heineken USA, the\nimporter of Amstel Light, do next? It introduced Amstel Bier (regular beer)\nand Amstel 1870 beer.\n\nWho drinks Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi? Do you really suppose that these\ndiet cola drinkers used to drink beer, ginger ale, or orange juice? We don\u2019t.\n\nDiet Coke comes out of Coca-Cola\u2019s hide. Sure, the diet cola market has\nboomed, thanks to the public\u2019s interest in low-calorie products. But what\nCoca-Cola should have done was launch a second brand.\n\nActually it did. After the success of Diet Pepsi, Coca-Cola launched Tab.\nAnd Tab was doing quite well. The day Diet Coke was introduced, Tab was\n\nleading Diet Pepsi in market share by about 32 percent.\n\nNow which is the better name: Diet Pepsi or Tab? If line extension is the\nsuperior way to build a brand, why did Tab lead Diet Pepsi by nearly a\nthird?\n\nOf course, Coke nearly killed Tab by keeping Nutra-sweet out of the brand\nand only using it in Diet Coke. But you can\u2019t squeeze a good idea out of the\nmarketplace. Tab still hangs in there with almost no promotional support.\n\nWhen the low-fat craze hit the cookie market, almost every brand rushed\nout with a line-extended version of its regular cookie. As a matter of fact,\nthe first fat-free cookie and early leader was Nabisco\u2019s Fat Free Fig\nNewtons.\n\nNabisco also launched a new brand of fat-free cookie called SnackWell\u2019s.\nFat Free Fig Newtons were only a modest success, while SnackWell\u2019s\nbecame the seventh-largest-selling grocery item, right behind Diet Coke.\n\nSo what did SnackWell\u2019s do next? You already know the answer to that\nquestion. Put its name on everything except the kitchen sink. Naturally,\nSnackWell\u2019s sales promptly plummeted.\n\nThe issue is clear. It\u2019s the difference between building brands and milking\nbrands. Most managers want to milk. \u201cHow far can we extend the brand?\nLet\u2019s spend some serious research money and find out.\u201d\n\nSterling Drug was a big advertiser and a big buyer of research. Its big brand\nwas Bayer aspirin, but aspirin was losing out to acetaminophen (Tylenol)\nand ibuprofen (Advil).\n\nSo Sterling launched a $116-million advertising and marketing program to\nintroduce a selection of five \u201caspirin-free\u201d products. The Bayer Select line\nincluded headache-pain relief, regular pain relief, nighttime pain relief,\nsinus-pain relief, and a menstrual relief formulation, all of which contained\neither acetaminophen or ibuprofen as the core ingredient.\n\nResults were painful. The first year Bayer Select sold $26 million worth of\npain relievers in a $2.5 billion market, or about 1 percent of the market.\nEven worse, the sales of regular Bayer aspirin kept falling at about 10\npercent a year. Why buy Bayer aspirin if the manufacturer is telling you that\nits \u201cselect\u201d products are better because they are \u201caspirin-free\u201d?\n\nAre consumers stupid or not?\n\nMany manufacturers are their own worst enemies. What are line extensions\nlike light, clear, healthy, and fat-free actually telling you? That the regular\nproducts are not good for you.\n\n\u00a2 Heinz Light ketchup? Don\u2019t you suppose this leads customers to draw\nthe conclusion that ketchup is loaded with calories? (Today, salsa\noutsells ketchup. As night follows day, we are sure to see in the future\na brand called Pace Light salsa.)\n\n\u00a2 Hellmann\u2019s Light mayonnaise? Same question.\n\u00a2 Campbell\u2019s Healthy Request soup? Regular soup is unhealthy?\n\u00a2 Crystal Pepsi? What is wrong with the color of regular Pepsi?\n\nShould Evian launch Sulfate-Free Evian spring water? (Check the label,\nthere are 10 mg of sulfates in a liter of regular Evian. There are probably\npeople out there who would like a sulfate-free version of the brand.)\n\nLet sleeping brands lie. Before you launch your next line extension, ask\nyourself what customers of your current brand will think when they see the\nline extension.\n\nIf the market is moving out from under you, stay where you are and launch\na second brand.

Below is an excerpt from my book titled 'The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding How to Build a Product or Service into a World-Class Brand ', specifically from Chapter '11 THE LAW OF FELLOWSHIP', Section 'In order to build the category, a brand\nshould welcome other brands.'. The original text is: 'Greed often gets in the way of common sense. The dominant brand in a\ncategory often tries to broaden its appeal in order to capture every last bit of\nmarket share.\n\n\u201cIf we served beer and wine,\u201d the CEO of McDonald\u2019s once said, \u201cwe\nmight eventually have 100 percent of the food-service market.\u201d\n\nUnlikely. The law of expansion suggests the opposite. When you broaden\nyour brand, you weaken it. Look what happened when McDonald\u2019s tried to\nbroaden its appeal to the adult market with the Arch Deluxe sandwich. Its\nmarket share fell, and ultimately it was forced to discontinue the product.\n\nWhich brings us to the law of fellowship. Not only should the dominant\nbrand tolerate competitors, it should welcome them. The best thing that\nhappened to Coca-Cola was Pepsi-Cola. (To that end it\u2019s ironic that the\nCoca-Cola Company fought Pepsi-Cola in the courts over the use of \u201cCola\u201d\nin its name. Fortunately for Coke, it lost, creating a category which has\nbeen growing like gang busters ever since.)\n\nChoice stimulates demand. The competition between Coke and Pepsi makes\ncustomers more cola conscious. Per capita cola consumption goes up.\n\nRemember, customers have choices, even when there is no competition.\nThey can choose to drink beer, water, ginger ale, or orange juice instead of\n\na cola. Competition increases the noise level and tends to increase sales in\nthe category.\n\nCompetition also broadens the category while allowing the brands to stay\nfocused. If Coca-Cola appeals to older people and Pepsi-Cola to younger\npeople, the two brands can stay focused (and powerful) while at the same\ntime broadening the market.\n\nCustomers respond to competition because choice is seen as a major\nbenefit. If there is no choice, customers are suspicious. Maybe the category\nhas some flaws? Maybe the price is too high? Who wants to buy a brand if\nyou don\u2019t have another brand to compare it with?\n\nYou seldom see a big, growing, dynamic market without several major\nbrands. Take the office superstore market. There are three big brands\ncompeting tooth and nail for this market: Office Depot, Office Max, and\nStaples.\n\nSo effective has this competition been that the number of independent\noffice stationery stores has declined from about 10,000 in the past decade to\n3,000 stores today.\n\nInstead of welcoming competition, companies often feel threatened because\nthey believe that future market shares will be based on the merits of the\nindividual brands. An even playing field is not what most companies want.\nThey want an unfair advantage, a playing field tilted to their side.\nTherefore, they think, let\u2019s try to drive out competitors before they get too\nestablished.\n\nIn the process, however, they fall victim to the laws of branding. Expansion,\nline extensions, and other strategies that broaden a brand\u2019s appeal will\nultimately weaken the brand.\n\nMarket share is not based on merit, but on the power of the brand in the\nmind. In the long run, a brand is not necessarily a higher-quality product,\nbut a higher-quality name.\n\nOf course, customers can have too much choice. The more brands, the more\nflavors, the more varieties, the more confusion in the category. And the\nlower the per capita consumption.\n\nFor each category, two major brands seem to be ideal. Coca-Cola and\nPepsi-Cola in cola, for example. Listerine and Scope in mouthwash. Kodak\nand Fuji in photographic film. Nintendo and PlayStation in video games.\nDuracell and Energizer in appliance batteries.\n\nWhen there is too much choice, consumption suffers. Take wine, for\nexample. In California alone, there are more than 1,000 wineries and 5,000\nbrands. Wine Spectator magazine publishes an annual issue with rankings of\nsome 24,000 individual wines. (If you drank a bottle a day, it would take\nyou more than sixty-five years to run through the lot. Then you would\nprobably be too old to remember which wine you liked the best.)\n\nWith all that choice, you might think that Americans drink a lot of wine.\nBut we don\u2019t. The per capita consumption of wine in the United States is\none tenth that of France and one ninth that of Italy. Even the average\nGerman drinks three and a half times as much wine as the average\nAmerican.\n\nWith so many small vineyards, so many different varieties, and a handful of\nconnoisseurs with individual opinions about taste, the wine industry has yet\nto see the rise of any major brand. \u201cThat\u2019s just the way wine is,\u201d say\nindustry experts. \u201cWine needs multiple brands, multiple vintages, multiple\nvarieties.\u201d The motto seems to be \u201cevery acre its own brand.\u201d\n\nThat might be the law of wine, but it\u2019s not the law of branding. One day\nsome company will do in wine what Absolut did in vodka and Jack Daniel\u2019s\ndid in whiskey: build a big, powerful, worldwide brand.\n\nYou can also see the law of fellowship at work in the retail arena. Where\none store may not make it, several stores will. Instead of being spread out in\nevery section of a city, used-car dealers are often clustered along\n\u201cautomotive row.\u201d Where one dealer might have had trouble surviving, a\nhandful of dealers are prospering. That\u2019s the power of fellowship.\n\nIn any large city, you can see the law of fellowship in action. Similar\nbusinesses tend to congregate in the same neighborhood. In New York City,\nfor example, you will find the garment district on Seventh Avenue, the\nfinancial district on Wall Street, the diamond district on Forty-seventh\nStreet, advertising agencies on Madison Avenue, theaters on Broadway,\ntheme restaurants on West Fifty-seventh Street, and art galleries in SoHo.\n\nIt makes sense for similar businesses to be located close together. First, a\ngroup of similar businesses attract more customers to an area because there\nis more than one store to shop at. Second, customers can easily comparison\nshop among stores. Customers feel that without competition, companies\nmay take advantage of them and rip them off. (The airlines have a\nreputation for doing this.) Third, having the competition nearby allows\ncompanies to keep an eye on each other. Companies are always anxious to\nkeep track of trends in their industries.\n\nPlanet Hollywood discovered that one of the best locations in a city for its\nrestaurant was across the street from its arch rival, Hard Rock Cafe. People\nattracted to this type of theme restaurant are already drawn to the area\nthanks to Hard Rock and can be enticed to eat at a Planet Hollywood across\nthe street. Similarly, the best location for a Burger King franchise is often\nacross the street from a McDonald\u2019s restaurant.\n\nTake Branson, Missouri, which bills itself as the \u201cmusic show capital of the\nworld.\u201d Where one music theater in a town of 3,706 people might be hard-\npressed to make ends meet, forty music theaters are well and prospering.\nIt\u2019s the power of fellowship.\n\nYour brand should welcome healthy competition. It often brings more\ncustomers into the category.\n\nAnd remember, no brand can ever own the entire market (unless of course it\nis a government-sanctioned monopoly).\n\nRealistically, how much market share can the dominant brand achieve? Our\nresearch indicates that 50 percent is about the upper limit.\n\nFederal Express has a 45 percent share of the domestic overnight package\ndelivery market. Coca-Cola has a 50 percent share of the domestic cola\nmarket. For market shares higher than 50 percent, you need to consider\nlaunching multiple brands. Not just line extensions, but separate individual\nbrands. (See Chapter 15, \u201cThe Law of Siblings.\u201d)\n'. Your task is to understand the content and the underlying message of the original text, rewrite the entire thing while keeping the original meaning remains intact. Expand the content by adding relevant and additional information to make the text more comprehensive, increase the length of text to maximum, and enhance its readability and engagement without altering its fundamental purpose."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Greed often gets in the way of common sense. The dominant brand in a\ncategory often tries to broaden its appeal in order to capture every last bit of\nmarket share.\n\n\u201cIf we served beer and wine,\u201d the CEO of McDonald\u2019s once said, \u201cwe\nmight eventually have 100 percent of the food-service market.\u201d\n\nUnlikely. The law of expansion suggests the opposite. When you broaden\nyour brand, you weaken it. Look what happened when McDonald\u2019s tried to\nbroaden its appeal to the adult market with the Arch Deluxe sandwich. Its\nmarket share fell, and ultimately it was forced to discontinue the product.\n\nWhich brings us to the law of fellowship. Not only should the dominant\nbrand tolerate competitors, it should welcome them. The best thing that\nhappened to Coca-Cola was Pepsi-Cola. (To that end it\u2019s ironic that the\nCoca-Cola Company fought Pepsi-Cola in the courts over the use of \u201cCola\u201d\nin its name. Fortunately for Coke, it lost, creating a category which has\nbeen growing like gang busters ever since.)\n\nChoice stimulates demand. The competition between Coke and Pepsi makes\ncustomers more cola conscious. Per capita cola consumption goes up.\n\nRemember, customers have choices, even when there is no competition.\nThey can choose to drink beer, water, ginger ale, or orange juice instead of\n\na cola. Competition increases the noise level and tends to increase sales in\nthe category.\n\nCompetition also broadens the category while allowing the brands to stay\nfocused. If Coca-Cola appeals to older people and Pepsi-Cola to younger\npeople, the two brands can stay focused (and powerful) while at the same\ntime broadening the market.\n\nCustomers respond to competition because choice is seen as a major\nbenefit. If there is no choice, customers are suspicious. Maybe the category\nhas some flaws? Maybe the price is too high? Who wants to buy a brand if\nyou don\u2019t have another brand to compare it with?\n\nYou seldom see a big, growing, dynamic market without several major\nbrands. Take the office superstore market. There are three big brands\ncompeting tooth and nail for this market: Office Depot, Office Max, and\nStaples.\n\nSo effective has this competition been that the number of independent\noffice stationery stores has declined from about 10,000 in the past decade to\n3,000 stores today.\n\nInstead of welcoming competition, companies often feel threatened because\nthey believe that future market shares will be based on the merits of the\nindividual brands. An even playing field is not what most companies want.\nThey want an unfair advantage, a playing field tilted to their side.\nTherefore, they think, let\u2019s try to drive out competitors before they get too\nestablished.\n\nIn the process, however, they fall victim to the laws of branding. Expansion,\nline extensions, and other strategies that broaden a brand\u2019s appeal will\nultimately weaken the brand.\n\nMarket share is not based on merit, but on the power of the brand in the\nmind. In the long run, a brand is not necessarily a higher-quality product,\nbut a higher-quality name.\n\nOf course, customers can have too much choice. The more brands, the more\nflavors, the more varieties, the more confusion in the category. And the\nlower the per capita consumption.\n\nFor each category, two major brands seem to be ideal. Coca-Cola and\nPepsi-Cola in cola, for example. Listerine and Scope in mouthwash. Kodak\nand Fuji in photographic film. Nintendo and PlayStation in video games.\nDuracell and Energizer in appliance batteries.\n\nWhen there is too much choice, consumption suffers. Take wine, for\nexample. In California alone, there are more than 1,000 wineries and 5,000\nbrands. Wine Spectator magazine publishes an annual issue with rankings of\nsome 24,000 individual wines. (If you drank a bottle a day, it would take\nyou more than sixty-five years to run through the lot.

Below is an excerpt from my book titled 'The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding How to Build a Product or Service into a World-Class Brand ', specifically from Chapter '12 THE LAW OF THE GENERIC', Section 'One of the fastest routes to failure\nis giving a brand a generic name.'. The original text is: 'History often leads us astray. In the past, some of the most successful\ncompanies (and brands) had generic names.\n\n* General Motors, General Electric, General Mills, General Foods,\nGeneral Dynamics.\n\n\u00a2 Standard Oil, Standard Brands, Standard Register Company, Standard\nProducts Company.\n\n\u00a2 American Airlines, American Motors, American Broadcasting\nCompany, American Telephone & Telegraph, American Express,\nAluminum Company of America.\n\n\u00a2 National Broadcasting Company, National Biscuit Company, National\nCar Rental.\n\n\u00a2 International Business Machines, International Paper, International\nHarvester, International Nickel.\n\nSome companies have even tried to combine two or more of these lofty \u201call\nthings to all people\u201d names. The American General Life and Accident\nInsurance Company, for example. (We\u2019re surprised that nobody thought to\nuse \u201cInternational General American Standard Products Company.\u201d)\n\nIn the past, companies thought they needed big, scopy, generic names. And\nthe brand name was almost always the company name. (Today such an\napproach might produce the General Global Corp.) And yet, this naming\nstrategy clearly worked. Why?\n\nYears ago the market was flooded with commodities produced by thousands\nof small companies operating in a single town or region. The big, scopy,\ngeneric names put these small competitors in their place.\n\nMany of these General, Standard, American, National, and International\ncompanies are still operating (and are still successful) today. Some of them\nare among the largest and best-known brands in the world.\n\nThe fact is, these brands/companies are successful in spite of their names.\n\nWe believe the primary reason for these corporate successes is the strategy\nand not the name.\n\n\u00a2 National Biscuit Company was the first national biscuit company.\n\u00a2 General Electric was the first general electric company.\n\n\u00a2 International Harvester was the first international harvester company.\n\nBeing first in the marketplace gave these companies such a head start and\nsuch a powerful presence in the market that it overcame the liability of their\ngeneric names.\n\nWitness the shift from generic (or general) names to specific names:\nNabisco, Alcoa, NBC, GE, ABC, IBM.\n\nThere are many national biscuit companies, but only one Nabisco. There are\nmany aluminum companies in America, but only one Alcoa. There are\nmany national broadcasting companies, but only one NBC.\n\nOf course, we\u2019re sure that NBC always considered itself the National\nBroadcasting Company rather than a \u201cnational broadcasting company.\u201d\n\nAnd therein lies the biggest mistake made when picking brand names. The\nprocess proceeds visually rather than verbally.\n\nExecutives often pass around the boardroom logotypes of prospective brand\nnames, set in type and mounted on foamcore.\n\nBut the vast majority of brand communication takes place verbally, not\nvisually. The average person spends nine times as much time listening to\nradio and television than he or she does reading magazines and newspapers.\n\nFurthermore, in order to give meaning to the printed word, the mind\nprocesses sounds. The printed word is secondary to the sound that it\ngenerates in the reader\u2019s mind. So how can a reader differentiate the sound\nof the word \u201cgeneral\u201d from the word \u201cGeneral\u201d? With great difficulty.\n\nThe problem with a generic brand name is its inability to differentiate the\nbrand from the competition. In the food supplement field, for example, a\nbrand called Nature\u2019s Resource is spending $5 million a year to break into\nthis growing market.\n\nOn the shelves of your local GNC store you\u2019ll also find the following\nproducts:\n\n\u00abNature\u2019s Answer *Nature\u2019s Best\n\n-Nature\u2019s Bounty \u00bbNature\u2019s Gate\n\n\u00abNature\u2019s Herb *Nature\u2019s Plus\n\n-Nature\u2019s Secret *Nature\u2019s Sunshine Products\n-Nature\u2019s Way _\u2014*Nature\u2019s Works\n\nWill any of these generic brands break into the mind and become a major\nbrand? Unlikely.\n\nEven the legendary Lee Iacocca, father of the Mustang and former CEO of\nChrysler Corporation (two powerful name brands), took the generic road\nwhen he launched his own company, EV Global Motors. EV, for electric\nvehicle, is introducing a $995 electric bicycle. We can\u2019t see customers\nasking for an \u201cEV Global bike.\u201d\n\nWhat about a brand name, Lee? Like Schwinn or Trek or Cannondale?\n\nThe high-tech field is loaded with generic names that are unlikely to\ngenerate much in the way of brand identity. Security Software Systems,\nPower and Data Technology, Server Technology. Compare those names to\nMicrosoft, Dell, and Intel, and you can see the power of a brand name over\na generic name.\n\nMcAfee Associates, the leading maker of antivirus software, recently\nbought Network General for $1.3 billion. Guess what it chose for a new\nname?\n\nIt dropped McAfee, the only \u201cname name\u201d it owned in favor of two\ngenerics: Network Associates. It knew it had a name problem so it spent\n$10 million on the company\u2019s first television campaign, including more\nthan a million for a Super Bowl spot.\n\nAs those thirty seconds flew by, did the viewer hear the words \u201cnetwork\nassociates\u201d or \u201cNetwork Associates\u201d? Generic names disappear into the\nether. Only brand names register in the mind.\n\nJust for Men hair coloring is also spending a fortune trying to build its\nbrand. After watching a television commercial, the gray haired-man might\nthink to himself, \u201cWhat is the name of that hair-coloring product that\u2019s just\nfor men?\u201d\n\nNobody is saying that you should always invent a new name for an\nestablished brand, although that\u2019s often a good strategy for a product or\nservice that is truly revolutionary and unlikely to be copied for some time.\nKodak and Xerox are the usual suspects.\n\nWhat you should generally do is take a regular word and use it out of\ncontext to connote the primary attribute of your brand.\n\nBlockbuster Video is a powerful brand name. General Video Rental is not.\n\nHollywood brags about its \u201cblockbusters,\u201d so Blockbuster Video borrowed\nthe term to suggest it rents the best movies.\n\nBudget is a powerful brand name for a car-rental service. The word\nsuggests that it rents cars at low prices. Low-Cost Car Rental is not a good\nbrand name.\n\nService Merchandise is a $4 billion company with a General Video name.\nIt\u2019s too bad. The company\u2019s concept is compelling, but its generic name\ndooms the brand to relative obscurity.\n\nThe Luxury Car Company would have gone nowhere, in our opinion. But\nToyota took the word \u201cluxury,\u201d tweaked a few letters, and came up with\nLexus, a superb brand name for a Japanese luxury car.\n\nSome genius took the name of a specific office product and used it out of\ncontext to come up with Staples, an effective brand name for an office-\nsupplies company. The double entendre is particularly powerful. \u201cBuy your\noffice staples from Staples.\u201d\n\nSometimes you can carve out a brand name by cutting a generic in half.\nThis often has the further advantage of creating a short, distinctive, easy-to-\nremember brand name. Intelligent Chip Company is a lousy brand name,\nbut Intel Corp. is terrific.\n\n\u201cIntelligent Chip inside\u201d is a lousy advertising slogan. All computers have\nintelligent chips inside, but only the top-of-the-line products have \u201cIntel\ninside.\u201d\n\nOne reason that line extensions fare so poorly in the marketplace is that\nthey generally combine a brand name with a generic name. The weak\ngeneric name fails to create the separate identity that is the essence of the\nbranding process. \u201cMichelob Light\u201d is perceived in the mind as \u201cMichelob\nlight,\u201d a watered-down version of the regular beer.\n\nThe mind doesn\u2019t deal in letters or words. It deals in sounds. You can\ncapitalize all you want, but a generic word is a generic word in the mind, no\nmatter how you spell it.\n\nSometimes a company gets lucky. The line extension Vaseline Intensive\nCare skin lotion became the number-one hand lotion brand because the\n\ncustomer inadvertently treated Intensive Care as a brand name, not a\ndescriptive generic name.\n\nHow do we know this to be true? Because customers call the product\nIntensive Care. \u201cHand me the Intensive Care.\u201d\n\nCustomers don\u2019t say, \u201cHand me the Vaseline.\u201d Unless, of course, they want\nthe Vaseline.\n\nOn the other hand, if Vaseline had followed conventional line-extension\nthinking, it would have called the brand Vaseline Heavy-Duty skin lotion.\n\u201cHand me the Heavy Duty\u201d is not something people are likely to say.\n\u201cHeavy duty\u201d is a generic term.\n\nSo why didn\u2019t Chesebrough-Pond\u2019s just call the brand Intensive Care in the\nfirst place? Good question and good thinking. You\u2019re ready for the next law.\n'.

The weak\ngeneric name fails to create the separate identity that is the essence of the\nbranding process. \u201cMichelob Light\u201d is perceived in the mind as \u201cMichelob\nlight,\u201d a watered-down version of the regular beer.\n\nThe mind doesn\u2019t deal in letters or words. It deals in sounds. You can\ncapitalize all you want, but a generic word is a generic word in the mind, no\nmatter how you spell it.\n\nSometimes a company gets lucky. The line extension Vaseline Intensive\nCare skin lotion became the number-one hand lotion brand because the\n\ncustomer inadvertently treated Intensive Care as a brand name, not a\ndescriptive generic name.\n\nHow do we know this to be true? Because customers call the product\nIntensive Care. \u201cHand me the Intensive Care.\u201d\n\nCustomers don\u2019t say, \u201cHand me the Vaseline.\u201d Unless, of course, they want\nthe Vaseline.\n\nOn the other hand, if Vaseline had followed conventional line-extension\nthinking, it would have called the brand Vaseline Heavy-Duty skin lotion.\n\u201cHand me the Heavy Duty\u201d is not something people are likely to say.\n\u201cHeavy duty\u201d is a generic term.\n\nSo why didn\u2019t Chesebrough-Pond\u2019s just call the brand Intensive Care in the\nfirst place? Good question and good thinking. You\u2019re ready for the next law.\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Below is an excerpt from my book titled 'The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding How to Build a Product or Service into a World-Class Brand ', specifically from Chapter '13 THE LAW OF THE COMPANY', Section 'Brands are brands. Companies are\ncompanies. There is a difference.'. The original text is: 'Nothing causes as much confusion in the branding process as the proper use\nof a company name.\n\n\u00a2 Should the company name dominate the brand name? For example:\nMicrosoft dominates Microsoft Word.\n\n\u00a2 Should the brand name dominate the company name? For example:\nTide dominates Procter & Gamble.\n\n\u00a2 Or should they be given equal weight? For example: Gillette Sensor.\n\nThe issue of how to use a company name is at the same time simple and\ncomplicated. Simple, because the laws are so clear-cut. Complicated,\nbecause most companies do not follow the simple laws of branding and end\nup with a system that defies logic and results in endless brand-versus-\ncompany debates.\n\nBrand names should almost always take precedence over company names.\nConsumers buy brands, they don\u2019t buy companies. So when a company\nname is used alone as a brand name (GE, Coca-Cola, IBM, Xerox, Intel),\ncustomers see these names as brands.\n\nWhen you combine a company name with a brand name in a clear and\nconsistent fashion, the brand name is the primary name and the company\n\nname is seen as the secondary name: General Motors Cadillac.\n\nSimple observation will demonstrate how seldom customers will use a\ncompany name. . . when they have been given a viable brand name to use.\n\u201cHow do you like my new Cadillac?\u201d\n\nNobody says, \u201cHow do you like my new General Motors luxury car?\u201d\n\nWith this caveat in mind, a company is a company as long as the name is\nnot being used as a brand. A brand is a brand. There is a difference. A\ncompany is the organization that manufactures or produces the brand. It is\nnot the brand itself. Microsoft isn\u2019t Word, Procter & Gamble isn\u2019t Tide.\nMicrosoft produces many products, one of which is Word. Procter &\nGamble produces many products, one of which is Tide.\n\nWhile this makes sense, it\u2019s not usually the best branding strategy. Unless\nthere are compelling reasons to do otherwise, the best branding strategy\nshould be to use the company name as the brand name.\n\nThe WD-40 Company produces the WD-40 brand. The Zippo Corporation\nproduces the Zippo brand. The Coca-Cola Company produces the Coca-\nCola brand. Neat, simple, straightforward, easy to understand.\n\n1. What\u2019s a Coca-Cola?\n2. What\u2019s a Zippo?\n3. What\u2019s a WD-40?\n\nWhen you are a customer or prospect, the instant answers that come to\nmind are:\n\n1. Cola. 2. Windproof lighter. 3. Lubricating spray.\n\nWhen you are an employee of Coca-Cola, Zippo, or WD-40, on the other\nhand, the answer is usually different. It\u2019s the name on the paycheck. It\u2019s\n\u201cmy company.\u201d\n\nManagers are employees, too. That\u2019s why management is company-\noriented. And customers are brand-oriented.\n\nDoes the consumer care whether Toyota, Honda, or Nissan makes the\nLexus? Probably not. But the president of Toyota USA certainly cares.\n\nDoes the customer care whether Nabisco or Kraft or Keebler makes Oreo\ncookies? Probably not. But the Nabisco marketing manager handling the\nOreo brand certainly does.\n\nDo you really care whether the publisher of this book was HarperBusiness,\nSimon & Schuster, or McGraw-Hill? (Do you even know without looking at\nthe spine?)\n\nBut David Conti does. (He is our editor at HarperBusiness. And a good one,\ntoo.)\n\nThe view from the inside is totally different than the view from the outside.\nManagers must constantly remind themselves that customers care only\nabout brands, not about companies.\n\nIt goes deeper than that. The brand isn\u2019t just the name the manufacturer puts\non the package. It\u2019s the product itself. To a customer, Coca-Cola is, first and\nforemost, a dark, sweet, reddish-brown liquid. The brand name is the word\ncustomers use to describe that liquid. What\u2019s inside the bottle is the most\nimportant aspect of the branding process. Coca-Cola is branding the liquid\nitself.\n\nIt\u2019s not a cola made by the Coca-Cola Company. The cola itself is Coca-\nCola, the real thing. This distinction is at the heart of an effective branding\nstrategy.\n\nA company that truly understands branding from the customer\u2019s point of\nview would have never introduced a product called \u201cNew Coke.\u201d How can\nyou have a new, presumably better Coke? How can the real thing have been\nbad? Why on earth would you ever change it? It\u2019s like introducing New\nGod.\n\nIn the same way, Rolex is not the brand name of an expensive sports watch\nmade by the Rolex Watch Company Ltd. A Rolex is what you wrap around\nyour wrist.\n\n\u00a2 Pop-Tarts are what you put in the toaster.\n\u00a2 Band-Aids are what you put on cuts.\n\n\u00a2 Tylenol is what you take for headaches.\n\nMost issues involving company names versus brand names can be\nsolved by asking yourself two questions:\n\n1. What is the name of the brand?\n\n2. What is the name of the stuff inside the packaging?\n\nBoth names had better be the same or you have big problems.\n\nLet\u2019s explore what happens when you use both the company name and the\nbrand name on the package. Let\u2019s look at Microsoft Excel.\n\nThe \u201cMicrosoft\u201d part of the name is redundant. Nobody but Microsoft\nmakes Excel software. Since customers tend to simplify names as much as\npossible, Microsoft Excel quickly becomes Excel. \u201cLet\u2019s buy Excel.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft Word is another matter. \u201cWord\u201d is a generic word. Furthermore,\nmany of Microsoft\u2019s competitors have used \u201cword\u201d in their product names.\nWordPerfect, WordStar, etc. As a result, customers tend to use the full name\nof the product, \u201cMicrosoft Word.\u201d This is not necessarily good from the\ncompany\u2019s point of view. As a general rule, you want your brand name to\nbe as short and as memorable as possible. (Short names greatly improve\nyour word-of-mouth possibilities.)\n\nWhen customers feel they have to use both your company name and your\nbrand name together, you usually have a branding problem. (Normally\nbecause you used a generic word for your brand name.) Take Campbell\u2019s\nChunky soup, for example.\n\nIs the product Chunky soup or chunky soup? Customers can\u2019t be sure, so\nthey ask for Campbell\u2019s Chunky soup. Campbell should have used a\ndifferent brand name.\n\nTake the Sony Trinitron. Is trinitron a type of cathode-ray tube or is\nTrinitron a brand name for a television set? Customers aren\u2019t sure, so they\nask for a Sony Trinitron.\n\nAs far as the customer is concerned, the easiest, simplest way is the Procter\n& Gamble way. Use just the brand name boldly on the package and relegate\n\u201cThe Procter & Gamble Company\u201d to tiny type at the bottom. That\u2019s how\nthe company name is handled on Bold, Cheer, Ivory, Tide, etc.\n\nBut a case can be made for the middle way. Some of today\u2019s more\nsophisticated, discriminating customers might like to know who makes a\nparticular brand. They won\u2019t, however, use both names together. Nobody\ncalls an Acura a \u201cHonda Acura.\u201d Or a Lincoln a \u201cFord Lincoln.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, there is often interest in the trade (which includes retailers and\ndistributors) about the company behind a brand. For example, whom do we\norder Tide from?\n\nFor many brands one answer is to put the company name in small type\nabove the brand name. Customers who are strongly motivated to use only\nthe brand name will hardly notice the company name. Yet the trade and\ntoday\u2019s more sophisticated customers will be able to easily find the name of\nthe company behind the brand.\n\nThe danger, of course, lies inside the corporation. With this branding\nstrategy, you tend to get inundated with suggestions like, \u201cWhy can\u2019t we\nmake the corporate name larger? We\u2019re wasting all these opportunities to\npromote our stock, improve employee relationships, build a better\nrelationship with the trade.\u201d (On second thought, maybe you should leave\nthe company name off the package entirely.)\n\nLook what happened at Gillette. Both the Trac II and the Atra razors were\nmarketed with the company name the same size as the brand names.\n\nNot a good idea. The brand name should dominate the company name.\n\nWith the Mach 3, Gillette has returned to basics. The Mach 3 name\ndominates.\n\nNo issue in branding is so thoroughly discussed as the proper role and\nfunction of the company name. And yet, in most cases, it\u2019s a nonissue.\n\nThe brand itself should be the focus of your attention. If you have to use the\ncompany name, use it. But do so in a decidedly secondary way.\n'. Your task is to understand the content and the underlying message of the original text, rewrite the entire thing while keeping the original meaning remains intact.

Below is an excerpt from my book titled 'The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding How to Build a Product or Service into a World-Class Brand ', specifically from Chapter '14 THE LAW OF SUBBRANDS', Section 'What branding builds, subbranding\ncan destroy.'. The original text is: 'Management tends to invent terminology in order to give legitimacy to the\nbranding moves it wants to make.\n\n\u00a2 Holiday Inn, the leading hotel/motel operator, wanted to get into the\nupscale hotel segment.\n\n\u00a2 Cadillac, the leading upscale domestic automobile brand, wanted to\nintroduce a smaller car.\n\n\u00a2 Waterford, the leading Irish crystal maker, wanted to market a less\nexpensive line.\n\n\u00a2 Donna Karan, a top designer, wanted to market less costly and more\ncasual clothes.\n\nTypical line-extension strategies would have produced brand names like\nHoliday Inn Deluxe, Cadillac Light, Budget Waterford, and Kasual Karan.\nEven the most callow marketing people would have found these brand\nnames difficult to swallow.\n\nWhat to do? Invent a subbrand. So we have Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza,\nCadillac Catera, Marquis by Waterford, and DKNY. Now we can have our\ncake and eat it, too. We can use our well-known core brand at the same time\nas we launch secondary or subbrands to move into new territory.\n\nBut what sounds right in the boardroom often doesn\u2019t make sense in the\nmarketplace.\n\n\u00a2 Did anybody ever walk into a Holiday Inn and ask the clerk at the\nfront desk: \u201cDon\u2019t you have a more expensive hotel I can stay at?\u201d\n\n\u00a2 Did anybody ever walk into a Cadillac dealership and ask: \u201cDon\u2019t you\nhave any smaller Cadillacs?\u201d (Bigger maybe, but not smaller.)\n\n\u00a2 Did anybody ever walk into Bloomingdale\u2019s and ask the salesperson:\n\u201cDon\u2019t you have any cheap Waterford?\u201d\n\n\u00a2 Did anybody ever walk into a Donna Karan showroom and ask: \u201cThe\nsuits are lovely, but where can I buy her sweatpants?\u201d\n\nThe marketing world is awash in conceptual thinking that has no\nrelationship to the real world. Subbranding is one of those concepts.\n\nCustomer research at Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza produced what you might\nhave expected: \u201cIt\u2019s a nice hotel, but it\u2019s a little expensive for a Holiday\nInn.\u201d The company finally got the message and is in the process of cutting\nthe megabrand connection. From now on, the hotels will be known as\nCrowne Plaza, period.\n\nA Cadillac dealership is the last place in the world where you would look\nfor a small car. First they tried Cimarron, which went nowhere and was\neventually dropped. Naturally, Cadillac didn\u2019t give up. Its latest small-car\nincarnation is called the Cadillac Catera.\n\nOn the other hand, Marquis by Waterford is a big success, but partially at\nthe expense of the high-priced line. You have to wonder if there is a\nGresham\u2019s law of marketing, too. Sooner or later, we expect the Marquis\nline to seriously erode the regular Waterford product.\n\nDonna Karan has gone off in way too many directions. In addition to the\nbasic line, there is Donna Karan menswear, DKNY, DKNY menswear, and\nDKNY kids. The company has also gotten into intimate apparel and beauty\nproducts. Recently, the company sold out to LVMH.\n\nCustomers have a cornucopia of choice. Subbranders assume otherwise.\nWhy would a customer expect Holiday Inn to have an upscale hotel?\nWouldn\u2019t the customer more likely try Hilton, Hyatt, or Marriott first? Why\nspend all that money and still stay at a Holiday Inn! The thinking is, If I am\nforking out the big bucks, I want to stay with a top hotel brand.\n\nSubbranding is an inside-out branding strategy that tries to push the core\nbrand into new directions. It captures management\u2019s attention because of\nwhat it promises, not necessarily because of what it delivers.\n\nIn spite of the subbranding setback at Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza, the\ncompany has moved into Holiday Inn Express, Holiday Inn Select, Holiday\nInn SunSpree Resorts, and Holiday Inn Garden Court.\n\nYou used to know exactly what you would find in a Holiday Inn. In fact,\nthat was the theme of its long-running advertising campaign: \u201cThe best\nsurprise is no surprise.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s a Holiday Inn Select? Go ahead. Book a room and be surprised.\n\nSubbranding has taken its share of criticism, so the marketing establishment\nis rethinking the concept. Leading-edge practitioners today are more likely\nto call the concept a masterbrand or megabrand strategy. It\u2019s especially\nprevalent in the automotive field.\n\n\u201cFord is not our brand. Our brands are: Aspire, Contour, Crown Victoria,\nEscort, Mustang, Probe, Taurus, and Thunderbird.\u201d What\u2019s a Ford then? \u201cA.\nFord is a megabrand.\u201d\n\n\u201cDodge is not our brand. Our brands are: Avenger, Intrepid, Neon Stealth,\nStratus, and Viper.\u201d What\u2019s a Dodge then? \u201cA Dodge is a megabrand.\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t apply your own branding system to a market that sees things\ndifferently. What the manufacturer sees as a brand, the customer sees as a\nmodel. What the manufacturer sees as a megabrand, the customer sees as a\nbrand. (Customers don\u2019t understand the megabrand concept at all.)\n\nEven Keith Crain, publisher of Automotive News, the industry\u2019s bible, is\ndubious of what car-marketing people are trying to do. \u201cA lot of folks out\nthere tell you that individual models, not the nameplates, are the brands. I\ndon\u2019t know of any models that have ads in the Yellow Pages.\u201d\n\nCan a brand be marketed in more than one model? Sure, as long as those\nmodels don\u2019t detract from the essence of the brand, that singular idea or\nconcept that sets it apart from all other brands.\n\nWhen you feel the need to create subbrands, you are chasing the market,\nyou are not building the brand.\n\nThe essence of a brand is some idea or attribute or market segment you can\nown in the mind. Subbranding is a concept that takes the brand in exactly\nthe opposite direction. Subbranding destroys what branding builds.\n\nBranding concepts that are not driven by the marketplace are going to go\nnowhere. Subbranding, masterbranding, and megabranding are not\ncustomer-driven concepts. They have no meaning in the minds of most\nconsumers.\n\nThink simple. Think like a customer and your brand will become more\nsuccessful.\n'.

We can use our well-known core brand at the same time\nas we launch secondary or subbrands to move into new territory.\n\nBut what sounds right in the boardroom often doesn\u2019t make sense in the\nmarketplace.\n\n\u00a2 Did anybody ever walk into a Holiday Inn and ask the clerk at the\nfront desk: \u201cDon\u2019t you have a more expensive hotel I can stay at?\u201d\n\n\u00a2 Did anybody ever walk into a Cadillac dealership and ask: \u201cDon\u2019t you\nhave any smaller Cadillacs?\u201d (Bigger maybe, but not smaller.)\n\n\u00a2 Did anybody ever walk into Bloomingdale\u2019s and ask the salesperson:\n\u201cDon\u2019t you have any cheap Waterford?\u201d\n\n\u00a2 Did anybody ever walk into a Donna Karan showroom and ask: \u201cThe\nsuits are lovely, but where can I buy her sweatpants?\u201d\n\nThe marketing world is awash in conceptual thinking that has no\nrelationship to the real world. Subbranding is one of those concepts.\n\nCustomer research at Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza produced what you might\nhave expected: \u201cIt\u2019s a nice hotel, but it\u2019s a little expensive for a Holiday\nInn.\u201d The company finally got the message and is in the process of cutting\nthe megabrand connection. From now on, the hotels will be known as\nCrowne Plaza, period.\n\nA Cadillac dealership is the last place in the world where you would look\nfor a small car. First they tried Cimarron, which went nowhere and was\neventually dropped. Naturally, Cadillac didn\u2019t give up. Its latest small-car\nincarnation is called the Cadillac Catera.\n\nOn the other hand, Marquis by Waterford is a big success, but partially at\nthe expense of the high-priced line. You have to wonder if there is a\nGresham\u2019s law of marketing, too. Sooner or later, we expect the Marquis\nline to seriously erode the regular Waterford product.\n\nDonna Karan has gone off in way too many directions. In addition to the\nbasic line, there is Donna Karan menswear, DKNY, DKNY menswear, and\nDKNY kids. The company has also gotten into intimate apparel and beauty\nproducts. Recently, the company sold out to LVMH.\n\nCustomers have a cornucopia of choice. Subbranders assume otherwise.\nWhy would a customer expect Holiday Inn to have an upscale hotel?\nWouldn\u2019t the customer more likely try Hilton, Hyatt, or Marriott first? Why\nspend all that money and still stay at a Holiday Inn! The thinking is, If I am\nforking out the big bucks, I want to stay with a top hotel brand.\n\nSubbranding is an inside-out branding strategy that tries to push the core\nbrand into new directions. It captures management\u2019s attention because of\nwhat it promises, not necessarily because of what it delivers.\n\nIn spite of the subbranding setback at Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza, the\ncompany has moved into Holiday Inn Express, Holiday Inn Select, Holiday\nInn SunSpree Resorts, and Holiday Inn Garden Court.\n\nYou used to know exactly what you would find in a Holiday Inn. In fact,\nthat was the theme of its long-running advertising campaign: \u201cThe best\nsurprise is no surprise.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s a Holiday Inn Select? Go ahead. Book a room and be surprised.\n\nSubbranding has taken its share of criticism, so the marketing establishment\nis rethinking the concept. Leading-edge practitioners today are more likely\nto call the concept a masterbrand or megabrand strategy. It\u2019s especially\nprevalent in the automotive field.\n\n\u201cFord is not our brand. Our brands are: Aspire, Contour, Crown Victoria,\nEscort, Mustang, Probe, Taurus, and Thunderbird.\u201d What\u2019s a Ford then? \u201cA.\nFord is a megabrand.\u201d\n\n\u201cDodge is not our brand. Our brands are: Avenger, Intrepid, Neon Stealth,\nStratus, and Viper.\u201d What\u2019s a Dodge then? \u201cA Dodge is a megabrand.\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t apply your own branding system to a market that sees things\ndifferently. What the manufacturer sees as a brand, the customer sees as a\nmodel. What the manufacturer sees as a megabrand, the customer sees as a\nbrand. (Customers don\u2019t understand the megabrand concept at all.)\n\nEven Keith Crain, publisher of Automotive News, the industry\u2019s bible, is\ndubious of what car-marketing people are trying to do. \u201cA lot of folks out\nthere tell you that individual models, not the nameplates, are the brands. I\ndon\u2019t know of any models that have ads in the Yellow Pages.\u201d\n\nCan a brand be marketed in more than one model? Sure, as long as those\nmodels don\u2019t detract from the essence of the brand, that singular idea or\nconcept that sets it apart from all other brands.\n\nWhen you feel the need to create subbrands, you are chasing the market,\nyou are not building the brand.\n\nThe essence of a brand is some idea or attribute or market segment you can\nown in the mind. Subbranding is a concept that takes the brand in exactly\nthe opposite direction. Subbranding destroys what branding builds.\n\nBranding concepts that are not driven by the marketplace are going to go\nnowhere. Subbranding, masterbranding, and megabranding are not\ncustomer-driven concepts. They have no meaning in the minds of most\nconsumers.\n\nThink simple. Think like a customer and your brand will become more\nsuccessful.\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

And perhaps a third, even a fourth brand.\n\nA second-brand strategy is not for every company. If handled incorrectly,\nthe second brand can dilute the power of the first brand and waste\nresources.\n\nYet, in some situations, a family of brands can be developed that will assure\na company\u2019s control of a market for many decades to come.\n\nTake the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company. For more than a hundred years,\nWrigley has dominated the chewing gum market, generating billions of\ndollars of profits. But not with one brand. Today Wrigley has a family of\nbrands.\n\n\u00a2 Big Red (a cinnamon-flavored brand)\n\u00a2 Doublemint (a peppermint-flavored brand)\n\n\u00a2 Extra (a sugar-free brand)\n\n\u00a2 Freedent (a stick-free brand)\n\u00a2 Juicy Fruit (a fruit-flavored brand)\n\u00a2 Spearmint (a spearmint-flavored brand)\n\n\u00a2 Winterfresh (a breath-freshener brand)\n\nThe key to a family approach is to make each sibling a unique individual\nbrand with its own identity. Resist the urge to give the brands a family look\nor a family identity. You want to make each brand as different and distinct\nas possible.\n\nThe Wrigley approach is not perfect. Wrigley\u2019s first three brands (Juicy\nFruit, Spearmint, and Doublemint) are too much like line extensions. They\nneed the Wrigley name to support their generic brand names. Big Red,\nExtra, Freedent, and Winterfresh, however, can stand on their own, each as\ntotally separate brands.\n\nMost managers are too internally focused to see the power of a separate\nidentity. They want to \u201ctake advantage of the equity\u201d their brand already\nowns in the mind in order to successfully launch a new brand.\n\nSo IBM launches brands like the IBM PCjr. And NyQuil launches DayQuil.\nAnd Blockbuster Video launches Blockbuster Music. And Toys \u201cR\u201d Us\nlaunches Babies \u201cR\u201d Us.\n\nTime Inc. became the world\u2019s largest magazine publisher, not by launching\nline extensions of its core brand, but by launching totally separate\npublications. Like Wrigley, Time Inc. has seven publishing powerhouses.\n\n1. Time\n\n2. Fortune (not Time for Business)\n\n3. Life (not Time for Pictures)\n\n4. Sports Illustrated (not Time for Sports)\n\n5. Money (not Time for Finances)\n\n6. People (not Time for Celebrities)\n\n7. Entertainment Weekly (not Time for Entertainment)\n\n(Nobody\u2019s perfect. So now we also have Digital Time, Teen People, and\nSports Illustrated for Kids.)\n\nAnd what about ESPN Magazine? Does anyone except Disney really\nbelieve that ESPN Magazine will score any goals against Sports Illustrated?\nWe certainly don\u2019t. The strength of a brand lies in having a separate, unique\nidentity\u2014not in being associated in the mind with a totally different\ncategory.\n\nHaving a totally separate identity in the mind doesn\u2019t mean creating a\ntotally separate organization to handle each brand. Wm. Wrigley Jr.\nCompany doesn\u2019t have seven separate manufacturing plants or seven\nseparate sales organizations. It has seven brands and one company, one\nsales force, one marketing organization.\n\nWhen General Mills decided to get into the Italian restaurant business, it\ndidn\u2019t start from scratch. It used everything it had learned about the seafood\nrestaurant business to jump-start its Italian sibling. The one thing it did not\ndo was to spin off its Red Lobster name. No Italian Red Lobsters.\n\nGeneral Mills invented a separate brand called Olive Garden. With this\nstrategy, the company was able to create the two largest family-restaurant\nchains in America. (Subsequently, the two chains were spun off into Darden\nRestaurants, Inc., which immediately became the world\u2019s largest casual-\ndining company.)\n\nWhen Sara Lee tried to take its panty hose brand into the supermarket trade,\nit didn\u2019t use its Hanes name. Nor did it call the new brand Hanes II or\nHanes Too.\n\nSara Lee created a separate brand designed for supermarket distribution\ncalled L\u2019eggs. Packaged in a plastic egg, the product became the number-\none supermarket brand and the number-one panty hose brand, with 25\npercent of the total panty hose market.\n\nWhen Black & Decker, the world\u2019s largest power-tool manufacturer, wanted\nto get into the professional power-tool market, it didn\u2019t use the Black &\nDecker name. Nor did it call the new product Black & Decker Pro.\n\nBlack & Decker created a separate brand called DeWalt. In less than three\nyears, DeWalt became a $350 million business, the market leader in\nprofessional tools, and the second-largest power-tool brand after Black &\nDecker.\n\nIn the past, companies have created families of brands based on the\nprinciples behind the law of siblings. As time goes by, they forget why the\nbrands were created in the first place. Instead of maintaining separate\nidentities, the brands are mashed together and a layer of corporate frosting\nadded on top. Instead of becoming stronger, the brands become weaker.\n\nGeneral Motors used to market a phalanx of five brands, each with its own\nidentity. Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick, and Cadillac. Any twelve-\nyear-old kid could spot a Chevy a block away and instantly identify the\nbrand. Or a Pontiac. Or an Oldsmobile. Or a Buick. Or a Cadillac.\n\nHoles in the front fender? That\u2019s a Buick. Fins on the back fenders? That\u2019s a\nCadillac.\n\nNo more. Even if you work for General Motors, we defy you to spot GM\ncars on the street and then correctly identify the brands.\n\nMany CEOs believe that a sibling strategy works best when the\norganization itself is decentralized. \u201cLet the brands fight it out among\nthemselves.\u201d\n\nNot so. That belief is what got General Motors in trouble. Control over the\nbrands (or divisions) was lifted and each division allowed to set its own\ncourse. Results were predictable. Each division broadened the scope of its\nbrand and the world ended up with expensive Chevrolets, cheap Cadillacs,\nand bewildering brand confusion.\n\nA sibling strategy requires more top-management supervision, not less. The\nurgent, long-term need is to maintain the separation between the brands, not\n\nto make them all alike. Human instincts work in the opposite direction.\nResult: All General Motors cars ended up with fins.\n\nNor is there a need to tag the corporate identity on every brand. Does the\ncustomer buy a Lexus because it\u2019s made by Toyota? Or in spite of the fact\nthat it\u2019s made by Toyota?\n\nThe customer buys a Lexus. That\u2019s the power of the Lexus brand. The\ncorporate connection is irrelevant.\n\nIn particular, corporate management should keep the following principles in\nmind when selecting a sibling strategy for its stable of brands.\n\n1. Focus on a common product area. Passenger cars, chewing gum, over-\nthe-counter drugs, these are some common product areas around which\nto build a sibling portfolio.\n\n2. Select a single attribute to segment. Price is the most common, but\nother attributes include distribution, age, calories, sex, flavors. By\nsegmenting a single attribute only, you reduce the potential confusion\nbetween your brands. What you want to avoid is any overlap among\nbrands. Keep each brand unique and special.\n\n3. Set up rigid distinctions among brands. Price is the easiest attribute to\nsegment because you can put specific numbers on each brand. When\nprices overlap, it\u2019s very difficult to keep the brands separate. Most car\nowners confused Oldsmobile and Buick because their price ranges\nwere quite similar.\n\n4. Create different, not similar brand names. You don\u2019t want to create a\nfamily of brands, you want to create a family of different brands. Look\nat some of Chevrolet\u2019s model names: Cavalier, Camaro, Corsica,\nCaprice, Corvette. (Recently they dropped Corsica and Caprice, but\nthose \u201cC\u201d names are still confusing.)\n\nOne reason these model names can\u2019t be brands is the fact that they\nare too similar. If Chevrolet wanted to create brands instead of model\nnames, it should have used distinctive names. Alliteration is the curse\nof a sibling family.\n\n5. Launch a new sibling only when you can create a new category. New\nbrands should not be launched just to fill a hole in the line or to\ncompete directly with an existing competitor. This principle is the one\nmost often violated by even the largest of companies. Coca-Cola\nlaunched Mr. Pibb, not to create a new category, but to block the\ngrowth of Dr Pepper. Coca-Cola launched Fruitopia, not to create a\nnew category, but to block the growth of Snapple. Then they launched\nMello Yello to block the growth of Mountain Dew. That didn\u2019t work,\nso they launched Surge, which didn\u2019t work either. All four brands have\ngone nowhere.\n\n6. Keep control of the sibling family at the highest level. If you don\u2019t,\nyou will find that your powerful, distinctive brands will slowly fall\napart. They will become victims of sibling rivalry, a pattern of\ncorporate behavior that depends upon copying the best features of a\nbrand\u2019s sibling competitors. You\u2019ll end up like General Motors with a\nfamily of brands that all look alike.\n\nA family of sibling brands is not a strategy for every corporation. But where\nit is appropriate, a sibling strategy can be used to dominate a category over\nthe long term.\n'.

Below is an excerpt from my book titled 'The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding How to Build a Product or Service into a World-Class Brand ', specifically from Chapter '16 THE LAW OF SHAPE', Section 'A brand\u2019s logotype should be designed\nto fit the eyes. Both eyes.'. The original text is: 'A logotype is a combination of a trademark, which is a visual symbol of the\nbrand, and the name of the brand set in distinctive type.\n\nLogotypes come in all shapes. Round, square, oval, horizontal, vertical. But\nall shapes are not created equal in the eyes of the consumer.\n\nSince the eyes of your customers are mounted side by side, the ideal shape\nfor a logotype is horizontal. Roughly two and one-fourth units wide and one\nunit high.\n\nThis horizontal shape will provide the maximum impact for your logotype.\nThis is true wherever the logotype is used: on buildings, brochures,\nletterheads, advertisements, or calling cards.\n\nThis horizontal bias is especially important when a logotype is used on a\nretail establishment. In the neon jungle, a vertical logotype is at a severe\ndisadvantage. The Arby\u2019s cowboy-hat logo is an example of the penalty of\nverticality.\n\nOf equal importance to shape is legibility. Logotype designers often go way\noverboard in picking a typeface to express the attribute of a brand rather\nthan its ability to be clearly read.\n\nTypefaces come in thousands of styles and weights, but customers are only\ndimly aware of the differences. To paraphrase David Ogilvy, no woman\nsays, I would have bought that detergent except they had to go and set the\nheadline in Futura Demibold.\n\nWhat typeface does Rolex use in its logotype? Ralph Lauren? Rolls-Royce?\nSerif or sans serif?\n\nThe truth is, the words (Rolex, Ralph Lauren, Rolls-Royce) are what\ncommunicate the power of the brands. The typefaces used in their logotypes\ncan help or hinder the communication process, but only slightly.\n\nOn the other hand, if the typeface is virtually illegible, the logotype has\nlittle or no meaning in the consumer\u2019s mind. Not because of the typeface\nused, but because the prospect can\u2019t read the words. Legibility is the most\nimportant consideration in selecting a typeface used in a logotype.\n\nCertainly, there are perceptual differences in the feelings that typefaces\ncommunicate. Sans serif typefaces look modern; serif typefaces look old-\nfashioned. Bold typefaces look masculine; light typefaces look feminine.\n\nBut these differences become obvious only by exaggeration. Would you\nreally want to set your brand name in black-letter Gothic (the typeface used\nin the New York Times logotype) in order to make your brand look like an\nold, established brand?

Round, square, oval, horizontal, vertical. But\nall shapes are not created equal in the eyes of the consumer.\n\nSince the eyes of your customers are mounted side by side, the ideal shape\nfor a logotype is horizontal. Roughly two and one-fourth units wide and one\nunit high.\n\nThis horizontal shape will provide the maximum impact for your logotype.\nThis is true wherever the logotype is used: on buildings, brochures,\nletterheads, advertisements, or calling cards.\n\nThis horizontal bias is especially important when a logotype is used on a\nretail establishment. In the neon jungle, a vertical logotype is at a severe\ndisadvantage. The Arby\u2019s cowboy-hat logo is an example of the penalty of\nverticality.\n\nOf equal importance to shape is legibility. Logotype designers often go way\noverboard in picking a typeface to express the attribute of a brand rather\nthan its ability to be clearly read.\n\nTypefaces come in thousands of styles and weights, but customers are only\ndimly aware of the differences. To paraphrase David Ogilvy, no woman\nsays, I would have bought that detergent except they had to go and set the\nheadline in Futura Demibold.\n\nWhat typeface does Rolex use in its logotype?

The typefaces used in their logotypes\ncan help or hinder the communication process, but only slightly.\n\nOn the other hand, if the typeface is virtually illegible, the logotype has\nlittle or no meaning in the consumer\u2019s mind. Not because of the typeface\nused, but because the prospect can\u2019t read the words. Legibility is the most\nimportant consideration in selecting a typeface used in a logotype.\n\nCertainly, there are perceptual differences in the feelings that typefaces\ncommunicate. Sans serif typefaces look modern; serif typefaces look old-\nfashioned. Bold typefaces look masculine; light typefaces look feminine.\n\nBut these differences become obvious only by exaggeration.

The original text is: 'Another way to make a brand distinctive is with color. But color is not an\neasy attribute to work with. There are thousands of words to choose from in\norder to create a unique name, but only a handful of colors.\n\nThere are five basic colors (red, orange, yellow, green, and blue) plus the\nneutral colors (black, white, and gray). It\u2019s best to stick to one of these five\nprimary colors rather than an intermediate or mixed color. But which color?\n\nKeep in mind that all colors are not created equal in the eye of the beholder.\nColors on the red end of the spectrum are focused slightly behind the retinas\nin your eyes. Therefore, a red color appears to move toward your eyes while\nyou\u2019re looking at it.\n\nColors on the blue end of the spectrum, on the other hand, are focused\nslightly in front of the retinas in your eyes. A blue color appears to move\naway from you.\n\nBecause of these physical reasons, red is the color of energy and\nexcitement. Red is an in-your-face color. Which is why red is the dominant\ncolor in 45 percent of all national flags. (Blue is a distinct second. Blue\ndominates in less than 20 percent of all flags.)\n\nBlue is the opposite of red. Blue is peaceful and tranquil. Blue is a laid-back\ncolor.\n\nIn the world of brands, red is a retail color used to attract attention. Blue is a\ncorporate color used to communicate stability. For example, Coca-Cola red\nand IBM blue.\n\nThe other primary colors are in between. Orange is more like red than blue.\nGreen is more like blue than red.\n\nYellow is the neutral color. But because it is in the middle of the range of\nwavelengths your eyes can detect, yellow is also the brightest color. (Its\nbrightness is the reason yellow is often used to communicate \u201ccaution,\u201d as\nin yellow lights, yellow lines, yellow signs, etc.)\n\nOver the years, some colors have become identified with various attributes,\noccasions, and movements.\n\n\u00a2 White is the color of purity (as in a white wedding gown).\n\u00a2 Black is the color of luxury (as in Johnnie Walker Black Label).\n\n\u00a2 Blue is the color of leadership (as in the blue ribbon award to the\nwinner of a horse show).\n\n\u00a2 Purple is the color of royalty (as in the expression \u201cborn to the\npurple\u201d).\n\n\u00a2 Green is the color of the environment and health (as in Greenpeace,\nHealthy Choice, and SnackWell\u2019s).\n\nWhen selecting a color for a brand or a logo, managers usually focus on the\nmood they want to establish rather than the unique identity they want to\ncreate. And while mood or tone can be important, other factors should\noverride a choice based on mood alone.\n\nLeaders have first choice. Normally the best color to select is the one that is\nmost symbolic of the category. John Deere is the leading brand of farm\ntractor. Does it surprise you that John Deere picked green, the color of\ngrass, trees, and agriculture, as the brand\u2019s signature color?\n\nFor a tractor company in Brazil, we were asked to develop a brand name\nand color. We picked the name Maxion as the brand name because it\n\nseemed to communicate \u201cpower,\u201d a key attribute in a farm tractor. But what\ncolor should this new tractor brand use?\n\nJohn Deere used green. The second brand in the market used red. So the\ncolor choice was obvious. Maxion became a blue tractor and a blue brand.\n\nIs blue a good color for a farm tractor? No, but it\u2019s more important to create\na separate brand identity than it is to use the right symbolic color.\n\nHertz, the first car-rental brand, picked yellow. So Avis, the second brand,\npicked red. National went with green. (For years, National gave out S&H\nGreen Stamps to car-rental customers, a marketing move that helped\nassociate the National name with the color green.)\n\nThere is a powerful logic for selecting a color that is the opposite of your\nmajor competitors. When you ignore this law of color, you do so at your\nown risk.\n\nCola is a reddish-brown liquid, so the logical color for a cola brand is red.\nWhich is one reason why Coca-Cola has been using red for more than a\nhundred years.\n\nPepsi-Cola made a poor choice. It picked red and blue as the brand\u2019s colors.\nRed to symbolize cola and blue to differentiate the brand from Coca-Cola.\nFor years Pepsi has struggled with a less-than-ideal response to Coke\u2019s\ncolor strategy.\n\nBe honest. In your mind\u2019s eye, doesn\u2019t the world seem to be awash in Coca-\nCola signs? And isn\u2019t it hard to picture many Pepsi-Cola signs? Pepsi is out\nthere, but the lack of a unique differentiating color tends to make Pepsi\ninvisible in a sea of Coca-Cola red.\n\nRecently Pepsi-Cola has seen the light, or rather the color. It is doing what\nit should have done more than fifty years ago. Make the brand\u2019s color the\nopposite of its major competitor\u2019s color.\n\nPepsi-Cola is going blue. Pepsi even went to the expense of painting a\nConcorde supersonic jet blue to carry the color message to bottlers around\n\nthe world.\nBe the opposite. Kodak is yellow, so Fuji is green.\n\nYellow (as in the Golden Arches) is also the color most identified with\nMcDonald\u2019s, although the actual logotype is mostly red. But what color is\nBurger King?\n\nBurger King made the mistake of symbolizing the colors of a hamburger\nrather than picking a color to contrast with the leader. Burger King\ncombined the yellow of a hamburger bun with the orange-red of the meat. A\nneat logotype, but a lousy color choice.\n\nBudweiser is red, so what color should Miller be?\n\nOne of the many problems with the massive line extensions marketed by\nMiller is that they destroy the brand\u2019s color identity. To differentiate the\nMiller line extensions from each other, the brand uses an array of color\ncombinations. In the process Miller misses an opportunity to differentiate\nits core brand from Budweiser, its key competitor.\n\nThink of the unmistakable color of a Tiffany box. By standardizing on a\nsingle color and using it consistently over the years, you can build a\npowerful visual presence in a clutter-filled world. At Christmastime, every\nbrand and retail store uses green and red to celebrate the holiday, from\nM&Ms to Macy\u2019s. Yet Tiffany & Co. sticks to blue, and becomes even\nmore noticeable under the tree as a result.\n\nWomen hug their husbands as soon as they see the robin\u2019s-egg blue box\u2014\nwithout opening it they know it will be wonderful.\n\nYou have probably seen many more Miller cans than Tiffany boxes, but we\nwould bet that you know the hue of a Tiffany box and that you\u2019re not quite\nsure about Miller.\n\nWhile a single color is almost always the best color strategy for a brand,\nsometimes you can make a case for multiple colors. Federal Express, the\nfirst overnight-package-delivery company, wanted its packages to stand out\n\non the recipient\u2019s desk. So it combined the two most shocking colors it\ncould find: orange and purple.\n\nWhen a FedEx package arrives, everybody can see that a FedEx package\nhas arrived. It\u2019s like an orange-and-purple suit in a sea of corporate blue.\n\nColor consistency over the long term can help a brand burn its way into the\nmind.

Below is an excerpt from my book titled 'The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding How to Build a Product or Service into a World-Class Brand ', specifically from Chapter '18 THE LAW OF BORDERS', Section 'There are no barriers to global branding.\nA brand should know no borders.'. The original text is: 'In our consulting work we find that most clients strongly believe two\nthings:\n\n1. Their brands\u2019 market shares cannot be substantially increased in their\nhome countries.\n2. They need to grow.\n\nAs a result of these ironclad beliefs, they insist on expanding their brands\ninto other categories. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way to grow,\u201d they say.\n\nSo they fall victim to the first law of branding, the law of expansion.\n\u201cSure,\u201d they say. \u201cExpanding our line may be dangerous, but it\u2019s the only\nway to grow.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the only way to grow. In fact, the perfect solution to achieving both\ngoals is to build a global brand. That means:\n\n\u00a2 Keep the brand\u2019s narrow focus in its home country.\n\n* Go global.\n\nFor years the magic word on many products has been \u201cimported.\u201d Food,\nbeer, wine, liquor, clothing, automobiles, appliances, and many other items\n\nhave benefited from an imported label. As if crossing a border suddenly\nincreases the value of the brand.\n\nActually, crossing a border often does add value to a brand. Since value lies\nin the mind of the consumer, the perception of where the brand came from\ncan add or subtract value. Does anyone doubt the value of:\n\n\u00a2 Watches from Switzerland\n\n\u00a2 Wines from France\n\n\u00a2 Automobiles from Germany\n\n\u00a2 Electronic products from Japan\n\n\u00a2 Clothing from Italy\n\nWould watches from Albania, wine from Poland, cars from Turkey,\nelectronic products from Russia, or clothing from Portugal have the same\nperceptions? Obviously not.\n\nEvery country has its own unique perceptions. When a brand is in sync with\nits own country\u2019s perceptions, that brand has the possibility of becoming a\nglobal brand.\n\nWherever you live in the world today, chances are high that a significant\nnumber of people are wearing Swiss watches, driving German cars,\ndrinking French wines, playing with Japanese electronic products, and\ndressing in Italian clothes. (Hopefully, not all at the same time.)\n\nIn spite of duties, tariffs, import quotas, inspections, regulations, red tape,\nand petty harassments, the world is becoming one big global market. And\nyour product had better get on the global brandwagon or risk losing out\naltogether.\n\nHeineken NV is the leading brewery in the Netherlands, a small country\nwith a population of only 15 million. Yet by going global Heineken NV has\nbecome the second-largest brewery in the world.\n\nCan any brewery do the same? Of course not. To be successful as a\nworldwide beer brand (or any worldwide brand), you need to do two things:\n\n1. You need to be first.\n\n2. Your product needs to fit the perceptions of its country of origin.\n\nHeineken was the first beer brand to pursue a global strategy. But beer is a\nproduct closely associated with Germany, not Holland.\n\nHeineken got lucky. Holland is close to Germany, both geographically and\nethnically. As a result, many beer drinkers think Heineken is a German\nproduct. (The company has been known to distribute cardboard coasters to\nbars and restaurants with the words \u201cprinted in Germany\u201d featured on the\ncoasters.)\n\nHeineken also got lucky in a second way. Beck\u2019s, its major German\ncompetitor on the global market, is saddled with an English-sounding name.\n\nHeineken got lucky in a third way. The largest-selling beer in Germany is\nWarsteiner. Normally, the leading brand in a country known for the\ncategory can be a big success in the rest of the world. (Witness the success\nof Barilla in the U.S. market with the theme \u201cItaly\u2019s #1 pasta.\u201d) But no\nGerman beer brand starting with \u201cWar\u201d is going to have much of a chance\non the global beer market.\n\nThere are many ways to play the global game. Instead of appealing to the\ncore market, you can appeal to a different segment of the market. Corona\nExtra has become a global force by associating the brand with the boom in\nMexican cuisine. Asahi beer has done the same with Japanese cuisine. And\nTsingtao beer with Chinese cuisine.\n\nCorona Extra is a good example of the skillful use of a country\u2019s perception\nto promote a brand. Because a wedge of citrus was associated with the\ndrinking of Mexican tequila, the importers of Corona Extra used the same\nimagery to launch the brand.\n\nThe toothpick and lime on top of the Corona bottle became a visual symbol\nthat you could see halfway across a bar or restaurant. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d asked\nthe non-Corona-drinking consumer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Corona Extra, the Mexican beer.\u201d So successful was this strategy that\nthe brand became the largest-selling imported beer in the United States,\ntopping even Heineken. In a twist, its American success has stimulated\nsales south of the border, where Corona Extra has become the leading beer\nbrand in Mexico.\n\nThe perception of a country is important. There is no such thing as a global\nbrand with a global perception.\n\n\u00a2 Toyota, Honda, and Nissan are global brands with Japanese\nperceptions.\n\n\u00a2 Compag, Intel, and Microsoft are global brands with American\nperceptions.\n\n\u00a2 Dom P\u00e9rignon, Perrier-Jou\u00e9t, and Chateau Mouton-Rothschild are\nglobal brands with French perceptions.\n\n\u00a2 Gucci, Versace, and Giorgio Armani are global brands with Italian\nperceptions.\n\nWith some 62 percent of its sales and 76 percent of its profits outside of\nNorth America, Coca-Cola insists that it is a global brand, not an American\nbrand. And it is, literally. (Robert Goizueta, Coke\u2019s longtime chief\nexecutive, was from Cuba. Its current CEO, Douglas Daft, is from\nAustralia.)\n\nBut it would be a major marketing mistake for Coca-Cola to abandon its\nAmerican heritage. Every brand (no matter where it is bottled, assembled,\nmanufactured, or produced) has to be from somewhere. As American\nculture (especially in music, film, and television) has permeated the world,\nCoca-Cola has benefited greatly because of its American connection. \u201cIt\u2019s\nthe real thing,\u201d Coke drinkers will say proudly with accents from places far\nand wide.\n\nEvery brand, just like every person, is from somewhere. A fifth-generation\nIrish-American might say he or she is \u201cIrish.\u201d Coca-Cola, bottled in\nMexico, is still a gringo brand. The same holds true for Levi\u2019s, the\nquintessential American brand.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter where your brand is conceived, designed, or produced, its\nname and its connotations determine its geographic perception. Haagen-\nDazs might have been developed in New Jersey, but its origins sound\nScandinavian.\n\nA number of years ago we met with the chairman of the SMH Group, the\ncompany that makes the Swatch watch. \u201cWhat would you think about an\nautomobile made in Switzerland?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cGreat,\u201d we replied. \u201cWe have the perfect advertising headline: Runs like a\nwatch.\u201d\n\n\u201cT\u2019m glad you like the concept,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to call the new\nproduct the Swatch car.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait a minute,\u201d we added. \u201cSwatch is an inexpensive fashion watch you\nwear a few times and throw in the dresser drawer. An automobile is a\nserious product and a serious investment. People define themselves by what\nthey drive. If you want to give your new car a watch name, call it a Rolex.\u201d\n\nBut he didn\u2019t listen. The company used the Swatch name while the car was\nunder development (first in a joint venture with Volkswagen and then later\nwith Mercedes-Benz). Recently, wiser heads prevailed and the name was\nchanged to the Smart car.\n\nSmart thinking. The Smart car is now available in Europe as a fuel-efficient,\nlow-pollution car for congested cities.\n\nThe choice of the Smart name for a global product illustrates a trend in\nglobal branding: the use of English words for brands that may have no\nconnection with the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia,\nor any other English-speaking country.\n\nTake a new energy drink invented in Austria. The amino acid\u2014infused,\ncaffeine-injected, detoxifying, carbonated drink was not called \u201cRoter\nStier.\u201d Instead, the manufacturer used the English words \u201cRed Bull.\u201d\n\nRed Bull has become an \u201cin\u201d drink in Europe and has also become a big\nbrand here in the United States.\n\nThe top three high-end brands of blue jeans ($100 and up) all have English\nnames, but none of them are American. Replay and Diesel are made in Italy.\nAnd Big Star is from France.\n\nEnglish has become the second language of the world. If you are going to\ndevelop a brand name for use on the worldwide market, the name better\nwork in English. It doesn\u2019t have to be an English word, but it should sound\nlike one.\n\nIn addition, care should be taken when translating English slogans into\nother languages. Sometimes the results can be disastrous. For example:\n\u201cCome alive with the Pepsi generation,\u201d translated into Chinese, comes out\nas \u201cPepsi brings your ancestors back from the grave.\u201d\n\nThe Perdue slogan, \u201cIt takes a strong man to make a tender chicken,\u201d\ntranslated into Spanish means: \u201cIt takes an aroused man to make a chicken\naffectionate.\u201d And the Coors beer tag line, \u201cTurn it loose,\u201d in Spanish\nbecomes \u201cSuffer from diarrhea.\u201d\n\nWhile we encourage one global message for a brand, sometimes changes\nmust be made to accommodate languages other than English.\n'.

Expand the content by adding relevant and additional information to make the text more comprehensive, increase the length of text to maximum, and enhance its readability and engagement without altering its fundamental purpose."}, {"role": "user", "content": "In our consulting work we find that most clients strongly believe two\nthings:\n\n1. Their brands\u2019 market shares cannot be substantially increased in their\nhome countries.\n2. They need to grow.\n\nAs a result of these ironclad beliefs, they insist on expanding their brands\ninto other categories. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way to grow,\u201d they say.\n\nSo they fall victim to the first law of branding, the law of expansion.\n\u201cSure,\u201d they say. \u201cExpanding our line may be dangerous, but it\u2019s the only\nway to grow.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the only way to grow. In fact, the perfect solution to achieving both\ngoals is to build a global brand. That means:\n\n\u00a2 Keep the brand\u2019s narrow focus in its home country.\n\n* Go global.\n\nFor years the magic word on many products has been \u201cimported.\u201d Food,\nbeer, wine, liquor, clothing, automobiles, appliances, and many other items\n\nhave benefited from an imported label. As if crossing a border suddenly\nincreases the value of the brand.\n\nActually, crossing a border often does add value to a brand. Since value lies\nin the mind of the consumer, the perception of where the brand came from\ncan add or subtract value. Does anyone doubt the value of:\n\n\u00a2 Watches from Switzerland\n\n\u00a2 Wines from France\n\n\u00a2 Automobiles from Germany\n\n\u00a2 Electronic products from Japan\n\n\u00a2 Clothing from Italy\n\nWould watches from Albania, wine from Poland, cars from Turkey,\nelectronic products from Russia, or clothing from Portugal have the same\nperceptions? Obviously not.\n\nEvery country has its own unique perceptions. When a brand is in sync with\nits own country\u2019s perceptions, that brand has the possibility of becoming a\nglobal brand.\n\nWherever you live in the world today, chances are high that a significant\nnumber of people are wearing Swiss watches, driving German cars,\ndrinking French wines, playing with Japanese electronic products, and\ndressing in Italian clothes. (Hopefully, not all at the same time.)\n\nIn spite of duties, tariffs, import quotas, inspections, regulations, red tape,\nand petty harassments, the world is becoming one big global market. And\nyour product had better get on the global brandwagon or risk losing out\naltogether.\n\nHeineken NV is the leading brewery in the Netherlands, a small country\nwith a population of only 15 million. Yet by going global Heineken NV has\nbecome the second-largest brewery in the world.\n\nCan any brewery do the same? Of course not. To be successful as a\nworldwide beer brand (or any worldwide brand), you need to do two things:\n\n1. You need to be first.\n\n2. Your product needs to fit the perceptions of its country of origin.\n\nHeineken was the first beer brand to pursue a global strategy. But beer is a\nproduct closely associated with Germany, not Holland.\n\nHeineken got lucky. Holland is close to Germany, both geographically and\nethnically. As a result, many beer drinkers think Heineken is a German\nproduct. (The company has been known to distribute cardboard coasters to\nbars and restaurants with the words \u201cprinted in Germany\u201d featured on the\ncoasters.)\n\nHeineken also got lucky in a second way. Beck\u2019s, its major German\ncompetitor on the global market, is saddled with an English-sounding name.\n\nHeineken got lucky in a third way. The largest-selling beer in Germany is\nWarsteiner. Normally, the leading brand in a country known for the\ncategory can be a big success in the rest of the world. (Witness the success\nof Barilla in the U.S. market with the theme \u201cItaly\u2019s #1 pasta.\u201d) But no\nGerman beer brand starting with \u201cWar\u201d is going to have much of a chance\non the global beer market.\n\nThere are many ways to play the global game. Instead of appealing to the\ncore market, you can appeal to a different segment of the market. Corona\nExtra has become a global force by associating the brand with the boom in\nMexican cuisine. Asahi beer has done the same with Japanese cuisine. And\nTsingtao beer with Chinese cuisine.\n\nCorona Extra is a good example of the skillful use of a country\u2019s perception\nto promote a brand.

Another victim of the law\nof consistency.\n\nActually, many Little Caesars stores are drifting back to the two-for-one\nstrategy that the company should never have abandoned in the first place.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s has been a kid-oriented family hamburger place for decades.\n\u201cWhy should we limit ourselves to kid-oriented products? Why not\nintroduce an adult hamburger to compete with Burger King and Wendy\u2019s?\u201d\n\nSo the Arch Deluxe was born. One hundred fifty million dollars\u2019 worth of\nadvertising later, the Arch Deluxe is declared a disaster. And McDonald\u2019s\nquietly decides to drop it from the menu.\n\nNotice one thing. It\u2019s always the product that is declared a failure, never the\nbranding concept. McDonald\u2019s is a kid-oriented family restaurant. In such a\nsetting, an adult hamburger might taste good in the mouth, but it is not\ngoing to taste good in the mind.\n\nRun up a red flag whenever you hear the words: \u201cWhy should we limit\nourselves?\u201d\n\nYou should limit your brand. That\u2019s the essence of branding. Your brand has\nto stand for something both simple and narrow in the mind. This limitation\nis the essential part of the branding process.\n\nLimitation combined with consistency (over decades, not years) is what\nbuilds a brand.\n\nRome wasn\u2019t built in a day. Neither is a brand of Romano cheese.\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

A brand that stands for something\nhas value even if the brand is not particularly well known.\n\nYou can do something with a brand that stands for something. When you\nstand for something, you at least have the opportunity to create a powerful\nbrand. This is especially true in the area of publicity.\n\nWhat\u2019s a Kraft? Who knows? When a brand is just well known but doesn\u2019t\nstand for anything, it doesn\u2019t lend itself to publicity and other branding\ntechniques. It has nowhere to go but down.\n\nWhat\u2019s a Kodak?

Why spend all that money on conventional\nphotography if the market is going digital?

Below is an excerpt from my book titled 'The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding How to Build a Product or Service into a World-Class Brand ', specifically from Chapter '1 THE LAW OF EITHERIOR', Section 'The Internet can be a business\nor a medium, but not both.'. The original text is: 'Putting your brand name on a Website doesn\u2019t make it an Internet brand.\nThere are brands and there are Internet brands, and the two are quite\ndifferent.\n\nIf you want to build an Internet brand, you shouldn\u2019t treat the Internet as a\nmedium, you should treat it as a business.\n\nBut the Internet is a medium, you might be thinking, just like newspapers,\nmagazines, radio, and television. Maybe so, but if you want to build a\npowerful Internet brand, you will have to treat the Internet as an\nopportunity, not as a medium. You will have to treat the Internet as a totally\nnew business where the slate is wiped clean and where endless\nopportunities await those who can be first to create new categories in the\nmind.\n\n\u00a2 It wasn\u2019t ABC, NBC, CNN, the New York Times, the Wall Street\nJournal, Time magazine, Business Week, or Newsweek that created the\nmost successful information site on the Internet. It was Yahoo!\n\n\u00a2 It wasn\u2019t Barnes & Noble, Waldenbooks, or Borders that created the\nmost successful bookseller on the Internet. It was Amazon.com.\n\n\u00a2 It wasn\u2019t Sotheby\u2019s or Christie\u2019s that created the most successful\nauction site on the Internet. It was eBay.\n\n\u00a2 It wasn\u2019t AT&T, Microsoft, or Cablevision that built the most\nsuccessful provider of Internet service. It was America Online.\n\nEveryone knows the Internet will change their business as well as\neverybody else\u2019s business. But how? And what can you do about it? It\u2019s\neasy to err in one of two different ways. You can make either too much of\nthe Internet or too little.\n\n\u2018You make too much of the Net when you assume that it will completely\nreplace traditional ways of doing business. No new medium has ever done\nthat. Television didn\u2019t replace radio. Radio didn\u2019t replace magazines. And\nmagazines didn\u2019t replace newspapers.\n\nYou make too little of the Net when you assume it will not affect your\nbusiness at all. Every new medium has had some effect on every business,\nas it has had on existing media. Radio, for example, was primarily an\nentertainment medium until the arrival of television. Today radio is\nprimarily a music, news, and talk medium.\n\nGreat, you might be thinking. We\u2019ll play the Internet right down the middle.\nWe\u2019ll treat it as another arrow in our marketing quiver. That would be your\nbiggest mistake of all. You fracture your brand when you try to make it an\nInternet brand as well as a physical or real-world brand. No brand can be all\nthings to all people. Yet that is what many Internet experts recommend.\n\nTo quote one Internet guru: \u201cInternet commerce needs to be part of a\n\nbroader electronic business strategy, a strategy that embraces all the ways\nthat you let your customers do business with you electronically: by touch-\ntone phone, by fax, by e-mail, by kiosk, via handhelds, and via the Web.\u201d\n\nMany brand owners follow this strategy. They carry their existing brands\nover to the Internet and wait for miracles to happen. So we have sites like\nthe following:\n\n\u00a2 Levi.com, Dockers.com, Barbie.com\n\n\u00a2 ABC.com, Forbes.com, Washingtonpost.com\n\n\u00a2 Ford.com, GM.com, Daimlerchrysler.com\n\nDoes brand familiarity in the \u201couternet\u201d foster interest in the Internet? A\nstudy by Forrester Research among sixteen- to twenty-two-year-olds says\n\u201cno.\u201d According to the Cambridge, Massachusetts\u2014based firm, \u201cSome of\nthe hottest brands in the off-line world have no online value.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not surprising. Did any nationally recognized newspaper or\nmagazine make the transition to television? No, they were all failures on the\ntube, most notably USA Today and Good Housekeeping. (USA Today on TV\nlost an estimated $15 million the first year and was canceled during its\nsecond season.)\n\nBusiness managers have much in common with military generals who fight\ntheir next war with the previous war\u2019s weapons. Witness the wave of\nWebsites that mimic the real world.\n\nSlate magazine, introduced by Microsoft with a blaze of publicity, is a\ntypical example. Edited by a semicelebrity (Michael Kinsley, made famous\nby CNN\u2019s Crossfire), Slate struggled along as a Web version of a\nconventional magazine, including a conventional subscription price of\n$29.95 a year.\n\nOnly twenty-eight thousand people subscribed. So Slate switched to a more\ntypical Web subscription price, zero dollars a year. Traffic to the Slate site\nzoomed to 2.4 million visitors a month. The question is, how will Microsoft\nmake money by giving away the magazine?\n\nThe obvious answer is with advertising, which we don\u2019t think will work\neither. Salon, another magazine-type periodical, has been published on the\nWeb ever since 1995. In spite of the fact that it has been attracting 2.5\nmillion visitors a month, the publication is still unprofitable. Last year it\nposted revenues of just $3.5 million, mainly from advertising.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the magazine is not a good analogy for the Internet. Nor\nfor that matter are radio, television, books, or newspapers. The Internet is\nthe Internet, a unique new medium with its own unique new needs and\nrequirements. Building a brand on the Internet cannot be done by using\ntraditional brand-building strategies.\n\nOn the Internet, you should start the brand-building process by forgetting\neverything you have learned in the past and asking yourself these two\nquestions:\n\n1. What works on the Internet?\n\n2. What doesn\u2019t work on the Internet?\n\nHopefully these laws will provide the answers you need to build a powerful\nInternet brand. The material is not based on strategies that have worked in\nother media. Rather, it is based on our experience with developing strategies\nfor dozens of Internet start-ups. What worked and what didn\u2019t work.\n\nWhich leads to the first and most crucial decision you must make: For my\nproduct or service, is the Internet going to be a business or a medium?\n\nIf the Internet is going to be a business, then you must start from scratch.\nYou must develop a totally new strategy, a totally new way of doing\nbusiness, and (most important of all) a totally new name.\n\nWho is going to win the Internet book war, Amazon.com,\nBarnesandnoble.com, or Borders.com? Is there any question in your mind\nthat Amazon.com will be the big winner? There shouldn\u2019t be. If the Internet\nis a business, putting your name on both your physical store and your\nWebsite is a serious error.\n\nWho is going to win the Internet bank war, Citibank.com, Chase.com, or\nBankofAmerica.com?\n\nNone of the above. The bank war will be won by one of the Internet-only\nbanks. (Unless, of course, none of the Internet-only banks do a good job of\nbranding.) Why? Banking is going to be a business on the Internet, not a\nmedium.\n\nIf the Internet is going to be a medium, then you can use your existing\nbrand name. The Internet becomes a complement to or replacement for\nexisting media, be they radio, television, direct mail, newspapers, or\nmagazines.\n\nIn truth, the Internet is a good information medium, an electronic library, if\nyou will. Every company that has a sizable business needs a Website to\nkeep its customers and prospects informed about the range of products and\nservices it offers, as well as prices, delivery dates, warranties, colors, sizes,\ncustomer testimonials, and so on.\n\nInstead of asking the customer to shuffle through out-of-date catalogs or\nspec sheets, a well-designed Website can present up-to-date information in\na hierarchical and interactive way. (For the first time, a paperless office is\nwithin the realm of possibility.)\n\nThe Web should simplify many ordinary business transactions. If you want\nto subscribe to Newsweek, once you are connected to your service provider\nyou should be able to type www.newsweek.com into your browser, go to the\nNewsweek site, and subscribe. Inputting your name, address, and credit card\nor bank account number should do it. No cards falling out of the magazine,\nno stamps, no trips to the post office, no phone calls.\n\nIn this example you\u2019ll notice that the product doesn\u2019t change. Newsweek is\nstill a magazine delivered weekly by the U.S. Postal Service. The Internet is\na medium that simplifies the selling of the product. It might also allow you\nto sample the product so you can decide whether or not you want to\nsubscribe.\n\nFor some brands, of course, the Internet will replace existing distribution\nmethods. (Any business that relies heavily on the telephone is a good\ncandidate for moving to the Web. Flowers and pizza delivery are two\nobvious candidates.)\n\nThree big brands that rely heavily on the phone (Dell, Cisco, and Charles\nSchwab) are moving to the Internet using their same names.\n\nDell Computer is in the process of shifting to selling on the Internet. It\nwon\u2019t happen overnight, of course, but you can visualize the day when most\nof Dell\u2019s business will be done on the Net. (Currently the Internet accounts\nfor about 50 percent of the company\u2019s revenues.)\n\nFor Dell the Internet has paid off in more ways than just increased revenues.\nIt has helped the company cut sales and administrative costs from 15\npercent of revenues five years ago to an estimated 9 percent currently.\n\nCisco Systems, the world\u2019s largest supplier of network equipment, has also\nmoved to the Net. Today Cisco conducts more than 75 percent of its\nbusiness over the Internet. The move to the Internet has reduced the lead\ntime needed to fill orders from three weeks to three days. While total\nrevenue has grown 500 percent, the number of employees required to\nservice requests has grown by only 1 percent.\n\nCharles Schwab is also shifting from the phone to the Net. It has become\nthe leading online broker with more than three million Internet accounts\n(and thousands more added daily). Today Schwab handles about 236,000\ntrades a day, 80 percent of which are placed electronically.\n\nInitially, Charles Schwab thought it needed a separate name for its Internet\noperation, so it came up with the \u201ceSchwab\u201d name. Recently the company\nshortened the name to www.Schwab.com.\n\nThe Schwab situation illustrates two important principles. One, the same\nname can be used as long as your business will be moving to the Net. Two,\non the Internet, the shorter the name the better. Charles Schwab is not a\nparticularly long name, but the company decided to shorten it to \u201cSchwab\u201d\non the Web.\n\nIf you have a choice, don\u2019t take a chance on a long name. When prospects\nhave to type a name on a keyboard, they are going to gravitate to the shorter\nnames.\n\nMerrill Lynch is also making a move to the Internet; presumably using both\nits existing name (www.MerrillLynch.com) and its initials (www.ml.com).\nThat is a mistake. Unlike Charles Schwab, Merrill Lynch is not going all the\nway. Its Internet move is only a half step. The firm obviously has no\nintention of giving up the 14,800 well-paid stockbrokers who generate most\nof its business.\n\nThe Merrill Lynch Website could function as an information source for the\ncustomers who do business with its brokers. But not as a separate business.\nIf Merrill Lynch wants to use the Internet as a business, the firm needs to\ncome up with a separate name.\n\nWith 30 to 35 percent of all stock trades by individuals already on the\nInternet, Merrill Lynch is in a different position than Schwab. It only has\nfour choices:\n\n1. Do nothing. Not a bad idea. There will always be people who want the\npersonal attention of a financial consultant. Furthermore, by doing\nnothing Merrill Lynch can portray the negative side of Internet trading.\nIt\u2019s hard to badmouth the Charles Schwab competition when you are\noffering the same services as they are.\n\n2. Make the same move that Charles Schwab did and shift the business to\nthe Internet. It\u2019s probably too late in the game for this to work.\nFurthermore, what does the firm do with its fourteen thousand brokers\nand its reputation for service?\n\n3. Set up an Internet brokerage business with a separate name. This is\nwhat Merrill Lynch should have done . . . years ago.\n\n4. Use the Merrill Lynch name on both businesses, which is what they are\ndoing. This is a \u201cfoot-in-both-camps\u201d strategy that will never work. In\nthe long run it will undermine the reputation of Merrill Lynch. It was\nnot long ago that Merrill\u2019s brokerage chief, John Steffens, publicly\nstated that \u201cthe do-it-yourself model of investing, centered on Internet\ntrading, should be regarded as a serious threat to Americans\u2019 financial\nlives.\u201d\n\nTrust is an important ingredient in any retail business. If your customers\ndon\u2019t trust you, they are unlikely to continue to do business with you. You\nundermine that trust by speaking out of both sides of your mouth. A\ncompany should take a stand and stick with it. That\u2019s the way to build\nrapport with customers over a long period of time. Sometimes it\u2019s more\nimportant to be consistent than to be \u201cright.\u201d\n\nIn any industry, there\u2019s room for multiple approaches, but there may not be\nroom for multiple approaches in the same company under one brand. For\nmany smaller companies, the best strategy might be to move lock, stock,\nand barrel to the Web.\n\nHoover\u2019s, Inc. started out as a bookstore and then a publisher of business\nbooks. Its first book, Hoover\u2019s Handbook 1991: Profiles of Over 500 Major\nCorporations, was an enormous success. The company went on to publish a\nnumber of other business and reference books.\n\nToday, however, Hoover\u2019s, Inc. is primarily an Internet company selling\ncorporate profiles and other reference material to a wide range of\ncompanies and institutions. Eighty-four percent of the company\u2019s revenues\nnow come from its Web services.\n\nProvident American was a small Hartford insurance company that decided\nto jump on the Net. So it sold off its traditional underwriting business and\nsevered its relationships with some twenty thousand agents. Then it\nchanged its name to HealthAxis.com and became an Internet company\nselling health insurance from a variety of major carriers at prices 15 percent\nlower than it had been selling off-line. Recently HealthAxis metamorphosed\ninto an ASP selling insurance technology software on-line.\n\nLarry Latham was an auctioneer specializing in selling repossessed single-\nfamily homes from hotel ballrooms across the country. In spite of booming\nsales of $600 million a year, he decided to shut down his company\u2019s\nfourteen branch offices and move to the Internet. He hired a staff of twenty-\ntwo computer experts and renamed the company \u201cHomebid.com.\u201d In a test\nof the site he sold 136 out of 147 homes over the Web at prices that\naveraged 97 percent of list.\n\nLarger companies are big enough to have the resources to support both an\nInternet business and an off-line business. In general, however, they need to\ndifferentiate between the two by giving their Internet business a different\nname.\n\nAmway, the world\u2019s largest direct-sales company with $3 billion in annual\nsales, decided to take its unique distribution system to the Internet. But not\n\nwith the Amway name. Its new Internet name is Quixtar.com.\n\nProcter & Gamble is using the Web to sell beauty products, but not with Oil\nof Olay or any of its other brand names. Instead, P&G has created a new\nname (Reflect.com) and a new strategy. The site will allow consumers to\n\u201cpersonalize\u201d their selection of beauty products.\n\nHow can you tell whether the Internet is a business or a medium for your\nbrand? You need to ask yourself the following questions:\n\n1. Is the brand tangible or intangible? For tangible products the Internet\ntends to be an information medium. For intangible products, a business.\nIntangible products that are particularly appropriate for Internet\nbranding include banking, insurance, stock brokerage, and the like.\n\nWe expect financial services of all types to move to the Net. The\nsavings can be substantial. American Express estimates that it saves\n$1.00 every time a cardholder checks a balance on the Web rather than\nover the phone.\n\nTravel is another category that is moving to the Web. In the year 2001,\ntravelers spent $14 billion buying tickets on the Internet, amounting to\n14 percent of their total airline spending.\n\n2. Is the brand fashionable or not? For fashionable products the Internet\ntends to be a medium. For other products, a business. Clothing is\ngenerally fashionable, while computers are generally not. Where\nfashion is the primary factor, it\u2019s difficult to imagine much business\ngoing to the Web.\n\nWe don\u2019t predict much success for Nordstromshoes.com, even though\nthe site was launched with a $17 million advertising campaign. The\ncommercials are amusing, but the prospect is unlikely to do much shoe\nbuying on the Internet. There are three major questions a shoe site can\u2019t\nanswer. Will they fit? Will they look good on my feet? Are they going\nto be comfortable?\n\n3. Is the product available in thousands of variations? If so, the Internet\ntends to be a business. Books, for example. It\u2019s hard for an existing\nretail establishment to compete in a category with a bewildering array\nof choices. There\u2019s no way, for example, that a bookstore could stock all\nthe titles available at Amazon.com.\n\nAnother category that seems likely to move to the Web is office\nsupplies. Again, the choices are so overwhelming that no one physical\nstore can carry everything a company might want to buy.\n\nProduct variation is likely to become a major battleground in an\nInternet-dominated economy. Excluding food stores, roughly half the\npeople who shop at any given store today walk out without buying\nanything. The major reason: The store didn\u2019t have in stock the product\nthe customer was looking for.\n\nNow that customers have the ability to find anything they want on the\nWeb, manufacturers need to respond in one of two ways.\n\nIf physical stores are your major distribution channel, then you need to\nreduce the product variety you offer. Compaq\u2019s best response to Dell,\nfor example, would have been to reduce its product line and promote a\nhandful of computer products available off the shelf in retail computer\nstores. When you make too many variations, you can be sure that the\none model the prospect wants won\u2019t be in stock.\n\nIf the Internet is your major distribution channel, then you want to\npromote the wide range of models, sizes, and colors you have available.\n\n4. Is low price a significant factor in the brand\u2019s purchase? If so, the\nInternet tends to be a business\u2014eBay.com and Priceline.com, for\nexample.\n\nThe ability of the buyer to quickly check prices on a large number of\nsites is making the Internet a very price-sensitive medium. There are\neven sites, like MySimon.com and DealTime.com, that will compare\nprices among other sites by sending out robots, or \u201cbots,\u201d to check the\nprices. Heaven help you if you don\u2019t have a competitive price.\n\nBecause of this price pressure, one of the biggest challenges for\nbuilding a brand on the Net is trying to figure out how to make money.\nThis will be a critical issue for many brands.\n\nAutomobiles are another category where the Internet is likely to change\nbuying patterns. Carpoint.msn.com, Autobytel.com, and other car-\nbuying sites are beginning to establish themselves as brands. The reason\nis simple: It\u2019s easy to make price comparisons on the Net. And there\nisn\u2019t any haggling with a salesperson.\n\n5. Are shipping costs a significant factor as compared to the purchase\nprice? If so, the Internet tends to be a medium. Groceries, for example.\nWebvan has already failed and Peapod.com is struggling. It\u2019s unlikely\nthat any mass-market Internet site will be able to build a successful\nbusiness and a successful brand selling groceries.\n\nThe milkman used to deliver fresh milk every morning. We\u2019re sure that\nmany families would like their milk delivered today, but they can\u2019t get\nit. Why? It\u2019s not economical anymore.\n\nThe grocery clerk used to go in the back and get your selections off the\nshelves, but not anymore. Self-service is a lot more economical.\n\nIn the Internet era, are we going to go backward? Is self-service dead?\nWe don\u2019t think so. Yet many marketing experts are saying the opposite.\n\u201cThe grocery store as we know it is going out of business,\u201d said former\nProcter & Gamble brand manager Doug Hall.\n\nFuturist Faith Popcorn goes even further. By the year 2010, she predicts,\n90 percent of all consumer products will be home-delivered. \u201cThey\u2019 ll\nput a refrigerator in your garage and bar code your kitchen. Every week\nthey\u2019ll restock your favorites, without your ever having to reorder.\nThey\u2019ll even pick up your dry cleaning, return your videotapes,\nwhatever you need.\u201d\n\nThe Internet is the biggest technological development of the twentieth\ncentury, but let\u2019s not get carried away. Just because something is\npossible doesn\u2019t make it likely to occur. The grocery business has three\n\nstrikes against it: (1) high selection costs, that is, the costs involved in\npicking and packing products in the warehouse; (2) high delivery costs;\nand (3) low margins. The average supermarket chain makes 1 or 2\npercent net profit on sales.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to see how an Internet company could absorb the additional costs\ninvolved in picking, packing, and delivery and still make money in a low-\nmargin business. A niche market, to be sure, but not a mainstream brand.\n\nHope springs eternal. Venture capitalists doled out an astounding $275\nmillion to launch Webvan, an Internet grocery company. In addition, the\ncompany managed to hire as its chief executive George Shaheen, the former\nhead of Andersen Consulting (now Accenture).\n\nSome consultants claim that you need both an Internet presence and a retail\npresence to be successful in the future, the so-called click and mortar\nstrategy. Otherwise, goes the argument, how could you return items you\nordered on the Net? That\u2019s one reason some experts have foolishly\npredicted that Barnesandnoble.com will eventually outsell Amazon.com.\n\nDon\u2019t believe it. People don\u2019t buy things based on how easy they are to\nreturn. It\u2019s a factor, of course, but not the primary factor in deciding where\nto buy. Reputation, selection, and price are far more important. It\u2019s\nimpossible to build a reputation as a store with great selection and low\nprices if you are schizophrenic, that is, if you have both physical stores and\nInternet sites. All you are doing is confusing people.\n\nWill Sears.com become a big success? Unlikely.\n\nNo one factor, of course, will determine whether your brand should be a\nbusiness on the Internet or whether the Net is just another medium to\npromote your brand. You have to carefully consider all the factors before\nyou decide.\n\nBut decide you should before some other brand beats you to the punch.\n'.

They carry their existing brands\nover to the Internet and wait for miracles to happen. So we have sites like\nthe following:\n\n\u00a2 Levi.com, Dockers.com, Barbie.com\n\n\u00a2 ABC.com, Forbes.com, Washingtonpost.com\n\n\u00a2 Ford.com, GM.com, Daimlerchrysler.com\n\nDoes brand familiarity in the \u201couternet\u201d foster interest in the Internet? A\nstudy by Forrester Research among sixteen- to twenty-two-year-olds says\n\u201cno.\u201d According to the Cambridge, Massachusetts\u2014based firm, \u201cSome of\nthe hottest brands in the off-line world have no online value.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not surprising. Did any nationally recognized newspaper or\nmagazine make the transition to television? No, they were all failures on the\ntube, most notably USA Today and Good Housekeeping. (USA Today on TV\nlost an estimated $15 million the first year and was canceled during its\nsecond season.)\n\nBusiness managers have much in common with military generals who fight\ntheir next war with the previous war\u2019s weapons. Witness the wave of\nWebsites that mimic the real world.\n\nSlate magazine, introduced by Microsoft with a blaze of publicity, is a\ntypical example. Edited by a semicelebrity (Michael Kinsley, made famous\nby CNN\u2019s Crossfire), Slate struggled along as a Web version of a\nconventional magazine, including a conventional subscription price of\n$29.95 a year.\n\nOnly twenty-eight thousand people subscribed. So Slate switched to a more\ntypical Web subscription price, zero dollars a year. Traffic to the Slate site\nzoomed to 2.4 million visitors a month. The question is, how will Microsoft\nmake money by giving away the magazine?\n\nThe obvious answer is with advertising, which we don\u2019t think will work\neither. Salon, another magazine-type periodical, has been published on the\nWeb ever since 1995. In spite of the fact that it has been attracting 2.5\nmillion visitors a month, the publication is still unprofitable. Last year it\nposted revenues of just $3.5 million, mainly from advertising.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the magazine is not a good analogy for the Internet. Nor\nfor that matter are radio, television, books, or newspapers. The Internet is\nthe Internet, a unique new medium with its own unique new needs and\nrequirements. Building a brand on the Internet cannot be done by using\ntraditional brand-building strategies.\n\nOn the Internet, you should start the brand-building process by forgetting\neverything you have learned in the past and asking yourself these two\nquestions:\n\n1. What works on the Internet?\n\n2. What doesn\u2019t work on the Internet?\n\nHopefully these laws will provide the answers you need to build a powerful\nInternet brand. The material is not based on strategies that have worked in\nother media. Rather, it is based on our experience with developing strategies\nfor dozens of Internet start-ups. What worked and what didn\u2019t work.\n\nWhich leads to the first and most crucial decision you must make: For my\nproduct or service, is the Internet going to be a business or a medium?\n\nIf the Internet is going to be a business, then you must start from scratch.\nYou must develop a totally new strategy, a totally new way of doing\nbusiness, and (most important of all) a totally new name.\n\nWho is going to win the Internet book war, Amazon.com,\nBarnesandnoble.com, or Borders.com? Is there any question in your mind\nthat Amazon.com will be the big winner? There shouldn\u2019t be. If the Internet\nis a business, putting your name on both your physical store and your\nWebsite is a serious error.\n\nWho is going to win the Internet bank war, Citibank.com, Chase.com, or\nBankofAmerica.com?\n\nNone of the above. The bank war will be won by one of the Internet-only\nbanks. (Unless, of course, none of the Internet-only banks do a good job of\nbranding.) Why? Banking is going to be a business on the Internet, not a\nmedium.\n\nIf the Internet is going to be a medium, then you can use your existing\nbrand name. The Internet becomes a complement to or replacement for\nexisting media, be they radio, television, direct mail, newspapers, or\nmagazines.\n\nIn truth, the Internet is a good information medium, an electronic library, if\nyou will. Every company that has a sizable business needs a Website to\nkeep its customers and prospects informed about the range of products and\nservices it offers, as well as prices, delivery dates, warranties, colors, sizes,\ncustomer testimonials, and so on.\n\nInstead of asking the customer to shuffle through out-of-date catalogs or\nspec sheets, a well-designed Website can present up-to-date information in\na hierarchical and interactive way. (For the first time, a paperless office is\nwithin the realm of possibility.)\n\nThe Web should simplify many ordinary business transactions. If you want\nto subscribe to Newsweek, once you are connected to your service provider\nyou should be able to type www.newsweek.com into your browser, go to the\nNewsweek site, and subscribe. Inputting your name, address, and credit card\nor bank account number should do it. No cards falling out of the magazine,\nno stamps, no trips to the post office, no phone calls.\n\nIn this example you\u2019ll notice that the product doesn\u2019t change. Newsweek is\nstill a magazine delivered weekly by the U.S. Postal Service. The Internet is\na medium that simplifies the selling of the product. It might also allow you\nto sample the product so you can decide whether or not you want to\nsubscribe.\n\nFor some brands, of course, the Internet will replace existing distribution\nmethods. (Any business that relies heavily on the telephone is a good\ncandidate for moving to the Web. Flowers and pizza delivery are two\nobvious candidates.)\n\nThree big brands that rely heavily on the phone (Dell, Cisco, and Charles\nSchwab) are moving to the Internet using their same names.\n\nDell Computer is in the process of shifting to selling on the Internet. It\nwon\u2019t happen overnight, of course, but you can visualize the day when most\nof Dell\u2019s business will be done on the Net. (Currently the Internet accounts\nfor about 50 percent of the company\u2019s revenues.)\n\nFor Dell the Internet has paid off in more ways than just increased revenues.\nIt has helped the company cut sales and administrative costs from 15\npercent of revenues five years ago to an estimated 9 percent currently.\n\nCisco Systems, the world\u2019s largest supplier of network equipment, has also\nmoved to the Net. Today Cisco conducts more than 75 percent of its\nbusiness over the Internet. The move to the Internet has reduced the lead\ntime needed to fill orders from three weeks to three days. While total\nrevenue has grown 500 percent, the number of employees required to\nservice requests has grown by only 1 percent.\n\nCharles Schwab is also shifting from the phone to the Net. It has become\nthe leading online broker with more than three million Internet accounts\n(and thousands more added daily). Today Schwab handles about 236,000\ntrades a day, 80 percent of which are placed electronically.\n\nInitially, Charles Schwab thought it needed a separate name for its Internet\noperation, so it came up with the \u201ceSchwab\u201d name. Recently the company\nshortened the name to www.Schwab.com.\n\nThe Schwab situation illustrates two important principles. One, the same\nname can be used as long as your business will be moving to the Net. Two,\non the Internet, the shorter the name the better. Charles Schwab is not a\nparticularly long name, but the company decided to shorten it to \u201cSchwab\u201d\non the Web.\n\nIf you have a choice, don\u2019t take a chance on a long name. When prospects\nhave to type a name on a keyboard, they are going to gravitate to the shorter\nnames.\n\nMerrill Lynch is also making a move to the Internet; presumably using both\nits existing name (www.MerrillLynch.com) and its initials (www.ml.com).\nThat is a mistake. Unlike Charles Schwab, Merrill Lynch is not going all the\nway. Its Internet move is only a half step. The firm obviously has no\nintention of giving up the 14,800 well-paid stockbrokers who generate most\nof its business.\n\nThe Merrill Lynch Website could function as an information source for the\ncustomers who do business with its brokers. But not as a separate business.\nIf Merrill Lynch wants to use the Internet as a business, the firm needs to\ncome up with a separate name.\n\nWith 30 to 35 percent of all stock trades by individuals already on the\nInternet, Merrill Lynch is in a different position than Schwab. It only has\nfour choices:\n\n1. Do nothing. Not a bad idea. There will always be people who want the\npersonal attention of a financial consultant. Furthermore, by doing\nnothing Merrill Lynch can portray the negative side of Internet trading.\nIt\u2019s hard to badmouth the Charles Schwab competition when you are\noffering the same services as they are.\n\n2. Make the same move that Charles Schwab did and shift the business to\nthe Internet. It\u2019s probably too late in the game for this to work.\nFurthermore, what does the firm do with its fourteen thousand brokers\nand its reputation for service?\n\n3. Set up an Internet brokerage business with a separate name. This is\nwhat Merrill Lynch should have done . . . years ago.\n\n4. Use the Merrill Lynch name on both businesses, which is what they are\ndoing. This is a \u201cfoot-in-both-camps\u201d strategy that will never work. In\nthe long run it will undermine the reputation of Merrill Lynch. It was\nnot long ago that Merrill\u2019s brokerage chief, John Steffens, publicly\nstated that \u201cthe do-it-yourself model of investing, centered on Internet\ntrading, should be regarded as a serious threat to Americans\u2019 financial\nlives.\u201d\n\nTrust is an important ingredient in any retail business. If your customers\ndon\u2019t trust you, they are unlikely to continue to do business with you. You\nundermine that trust by speaking out of both sides of your mouth. A\ncompany should take a stand and stick with it. That\u2019s the way to build\nrapport with customers over a long period of time. Sometimes it\u2019s more\nimportant to be consistent than to be \u201cright.\u201d\n\nIn any industry, there\u2019s room for multiple approaches, but there may not be\nroom for multiple approaches in the same company under one brand. For\nmany smaller companies, the best strategy might be to move lock, stock,\nand barrel to the Web.\n\nHoover\u2019s, Inc. started out as a bookstore and then a publisher of business\nbooks. Its first book, Hoover\u2019s Handbook 1991: Profiles of Over 500 Major\nCorporations, was an enormous success. The company went on to publish a\nnumber of other business and reference books.\n\nToday, however, Hoover\u2019s, Inc. is primarily an Internet company selling\ncorporate profiles and other reference material to a wide range of\ncompanies and institutions. Eighty-four percent of the company\u2019s revenues\nnow come from its Web services.\n\nProvident American was a small Hartford insurance company that decided\nto jump on the Net. So it sold off its traditional underwriting business and\nsevered its relationships with some twenty thousand agents. Then it\nchanged its name to HealthAxis.com and became an Internet company\nselling health insurance from a variety of major carriers at prices 15 percent\nlower than it had been selling off-line. Recently HealthAxis metamorphosed\ninto an ASP selling insurance technology software on-line.\n\nLarry Latham was an auctioneer specializing in selling repossessed single-\nfamily homes from hotel ballrooms across the country. In spite of booming\nsales of $600 million a year, he decided to shut down his company\u2019s\nfourteen branch offices and move to the Internet. He hired a staff of twenty-\ntwo computer experts and renamed the company \u201cHomebid.com.\u201d In a test\nof the site he sold 136 out of 147 homes over the Web at prices that\naveraged 97 percent of list.\n\nLarger companies are big enough to have the resources to support both an\nInternet business and an off-line business. In general, however, they need to\ndifferentiate between the two by giving their Internet business a different\nname.\n\nAmway, the world\u2019s largest direct-sales company with $3 billion in annual\nsales, decided to take its unique distribution system to the Internet. But not\n\nwith the Amway name. Its new Internet name is Quixtar.com.\n\nProcter & Gamble is using the Web to sell beauty products, but not with Oil\nof Olay or any of its other brand names. Instead, P&G has created a new\nname (Reflect.com) and a new strategy. The site will allow consumers to\n\u201cpersonalize\u201d their selection of beauty products.\n\nHow can you tell whether the Internet is a business or a medium for your\nbrand? You need to ask yourself the following questions:\n\n1. Is the brand tangible or intangible? For tangible products the Internet\ntends to be an information medium. For intangible products, a business.\nIntangible products that are particularly appropriate for Internet\nbranding include banking, insurance, stock brokerage, and the like.\n\nWe expect financial services of all types to move to the Net. The\nsavings can be substantial. American Express estimates that it saves\n$1.00 every time a cardholder checks a balance on the Web rather than\nover the phone.\n\nTravel is another category that is moving to the Web. In the year 2001,\ntravelers spent $14 billion buying tickets on the Internet, amounting to\n14 percent of their total airline spending.\n\n2. Is the brand fashionable or not? For fashionable products the Internet\ntends to be a medium. For other products, a business. Clothing is\ngenerally fashionable, while computers are generally not. Where\nfashion is the primary factor, it\u2019s difficult to imagine much business\ngoing to the Web.\n\nWe don\u2019t predict much success for Nordstromshoes.com, even though\nthe site was launched with a $17 million advertising campaign. The\ncommercials are amusing, but the prospect is unlikely to do much shoe\nbuying on the Internet. There are three major questions a shoe site can\u2019t\nanswer. Will they fit? Will they look good on my feet? Are they going\nto be comfortable?\n\n3. Is the product available in thousands of variations? If so, the Internet\ntends to be a business. Books, for example. It\u2019s hard for an existing\nretail establishment to compete in a category with a bewildering array\nof choices. There\u2019s no way, for example, that a bookstore could stock all\nthe titles available at Amazon.com.\n\nAnother category that seems likely to move to the Web is office\nsupplies. Again, the choices are so overwhelming that no one physical\nstore can carry everything a company might want to buy.\n\nProduct variation is likely to become a major battleground in an\nInternet-dominated economy. Excluding food stores, roughly half the\npeople who shop at any given store today walk out without buying\nanything. The major reason: The store didn\u2019t have in stock the product\nthe customer was looking for.\n\nNow that customers have the ability to find anything they want on the\nWeb, manufacturers need to respond in one of two ways.\n\nIf physical stores are your major distribution channel, then you need to\nreduce the product variety you offer. Compaq\u2019s best response to Dell,\nfor example, would have been to reduce its product line and promote a\nhandful of computer products available off the shelf in retail computer\nstores. When you make too many variations, you can be sure that the\none model the prospect wants won\u2019t be in stock.\n\nIf the Internet is your major distribution channel, then you want to\npromote the wide range of models, sizes, and colors you have available.\n\n4. Is low price a significant factor in the brand\u2019s purchase? If so, the\nInternet tends to be a business\u2014eBay.com and Priceline.com, for\nexample.\n\nThe ability of the buyer to quickly check prices on a large number of\nsites is making the Internet a very price-sensitive medium. There are\neven sites, like MySimon.com and DealTime.com, that will compare\nprices among other sites by sending out robots, or \u201cbots,\u201d to check the\nprices. Heaven help you if you don\u2019t have a competitive price.\n\nBecause of this price pressure, one of the biggest challenges for\nbuilding a brand on the Net is trying to figure out how to make money.\nThis will be a critical issue for many brands.\n\nAutomobiles are another category where the Internet is likely to change\nbuying patterns. Carpoint.msn.com, Autobytel.com, and other car-\nbuying sites are beginning to establish themselves as brands. The reason\nis simple: It\u2019s easy to make price comparisons on the Net. And there\nisn\u2019t any haggling with a salesperson.\n\n5. Are shipping costs a significant factor as compared to the purchase\nprice? If so, the Internet tends to be a medium. Groceries, for example.\nWebvan has already failed and Peapod.com is struggling. It\u2019s unlikely\nthat any mass-market Internet site will be able to build a successful\nbusiness and a successful brand selling groceries.\n\nThe milkman used to deliver fresh milk every morning. We\u2019re sure that\nmany families would like their milk delivered today, but they can\u2019t get\nit. Why? It\u2019s not economical anymore.\n\nThe grocery clerk used to go in the back and get your selections off the\nshelves, but not anymore. Self-service is a lot more economical.\n\nIn the Internet era, are we going to go backward? Is self-service dead?\nWe don\u2019t think so. Yet many marketing experts are saying the opposite.\n\u201cThe grocery store as we know it is going out of business,\u201d said former\nProcter & Gamble brand manager Doug Hall.\n\nFuturist Faith Popcorn goes even further. By the year 2010, she predicts,\n90 percent of all consumer products will be home-delivered. \u201cThey\u2019 ll\nput a refrigerator in your garage and bar code your kitchen. Every week\nthey\u2019ll restock your favorites, without your ever having to reorder.\nThey\u2019ll even pick up your dry cleaning, return your videotapes,\nwhatever you need.\u201d\n\nThe Internet is the biggest technological development of the twentieth\ncentury, but let\u2019s not get carried away. Just because something is\npossible doesn\u2019t make it likely to occur. The grocery business has three\n\nstrikes against it: (1) high selection costs, that is, the costs involved in\npicking and packing products in the warehouse; (2) high delivery costs;\nand (3) low margins. The average supermarket chain makes 1 or 2\npercent net profit on sales.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to see how an Internet company could absorb the additional costs\ninvolved in picking, packing, and delivery and still make money in a low-\nmargin business. A niche market, to be sure, but not a mainstream brand.\n\nHope springs eternal. Venture capitalists doled out an astounding $275\nmillion to launch Webvan, an Internet grocery company. In addition, the\ncompany managed to hire as its chief executive George Shaheen, the former\nhead of Andersen Consulting (now Accenture).\n\nSome consultants claim that you need both an Internet presence and a retail\npresence to be successful in the future, the so-called click and mortar\nstrategy. Otherwise, goes the argument, how could you return items you\nordered on the Net? That\u2019s one reason some experts have foolishly\npredicted that Barnesandnoble.com will eventually outsell Amazon.com.\n\nDon\u2019t believe it. People don\u2019t buy things based on how easy they are to\nreturn. It\u2019s a factor, of course, but not the primary factor in deciding where\nto buy. Reputation, selection, and price are far more important. It\u2019s\nimpossible to build a reputation as a store with great selection and low\nprices if you are schizophrenic, that is, if you have both physical stores and\nInternet sites. All you are doing is confusing people.\n\nWill Sears.com become a big success? Unlikely.\n\nNo one factor, of course, will determine whether your brand should be a\nbusiness on the Internet or whether the Net is just another medium to\npromote your brand. You have to carefully consider all the factors before\nyou decide.\n\nBut decide you should before some other brand beats you to the punch.\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Below is an excerpt from my book titled 'The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding How to Build a Product or Service into a World-Class Brand ', specifically from Chapter '2 THE LAW OF INTERACTIVITY', Section 'Without it, your Website and your\nbrand will go nowhere.'. The original text is: 'Not since television took off in the early fifties has the nation seen such a\ntechnological revolution as the Internet. For a time, Internet usage was\nliterally doubling every month.\n\nThere is a relationship between television and the Internet. Each is a\ncommunications medium. And nothing on earth affects more people in a\nmore powerful way than the introduction of a major new mass-\ncommunications medium.\n\nOver the course of human history, there have been five such introductions:\n\n1. The book\n\n2. The newspaper, or periodical, which includes magazines\n3. Radio\n\n4. Television\n\n5. The Internet\n\n(While the telephone is a communication device and has had a long-lasting\neffect on people\u2019s lives, it does not possess the characteristics of a mass-\ncommunications medium.)\n\nLife gets complicated. The new medium does not replace the old. Rather,\nthe new medium is layered on top of the old media, forever changing and\nmodifying all of the existing media.\n\nThe original mass-communications medium, of course, was the human\nvoice, still an unusually effective way to send a message. Each major\nmedium to follow became powerful in its own right because the\nmedium possessed a unique and highly prized attribute.\n\nThe book multiplied the number of people that could be reached by a\nsingle individual. Not only could millions of people share ideas and\nconcepts, but these ideas could also easily flow from one generation to\nthe next.\n\nThe periodical added the attribute of news. Large numbers of people\ncould share news of the latest events in their city or country and\neventually the world. In essence, the periodical took the printing\nprocess used in book production and greatly sped it up. Where a book\ncould take months to produce (and still does, unfortunately), a\nnewspaper could be produced overnight.\n\nRadio added the attribute of the human voice. News and entertainment\ncould be communicated with emotion and personality. A long line of\ncelebrities have used the emotional power of radio to communicate in\nan exceptionally effective way\u2014Winston Churchill, Franklin D.\nRoosevelt, Rush Limbaugh, Dr. Laura Schlessinger, and Howard\n\nStern, to name a few.\n\nTelevision added the attribute of motion. Radio, with moving pictures,\nif you will. Motion pictures, of course, were the precursor of television\nand still represent much of TV\u2019s content. Movies were, and still are, a\npowerful, emotional medium, but not a mass-communications\nmedium. You have to go to a theater to see a film when it is first\nreleased.\n\nAnd the Internet? What attribute does the Internet bring to the\ncommunications table?\n\nIf the Internet is going to take its place alongside the other major media, it\nwill be because it exploits a totally new attribute.\n\nWe believe that history will rank the Internet as the greatest of all media.\nAnd the reason is simple. The Internet is the only mass-communications\nmedium that allows interactivity. (The organization that was formed to\npromote Internet advertising is called, appropriately enough, the Interactive\nAdvertising Bureau.)\n\nOn the Internet a brand lives or dies in an interactive environment. In the\nlong run, interactivity will define what works on the Internet and what\ndoesn\u2019t work. The secret to branding on the Internet is your ability to\npresent your brand in such a way that your customers and prospects can\ninteract with your message. You\u2019ll have to throw out many of the traditional\nways of brand building.\n\nTake advertising, for example. Will traditional advertising be effective on\nthe Internet? Of course not.\n\nFace the facts. People generally dislike advertising. Why do people love the\nTV remote control or zapper? It allows quick channel surfing when ads\nappear.\n\nWith the Internet, your prospects have total control of what they see, read,\nand hear. Is there any reason to doubt that they won\u2019t turn off your\nadvertising message as soon as it starts?\n\nAlong with advertising, many of the traditional forms of communication are\njust not going to make it on the Net. Take newspapers and magazines as\nanother example. Why would you assume that you could publish a\nsuccessful magazine or newspaper on the Internet? Where is the\ninteractivity?\n\nAbout the only \u201cinteractivity\u201d a newspaper or magazine format allows on\nthe Net is the ability to read stories in any order you choose. But you can do\nthat now with a paper publication. (Many newspaper readers start with the\nsports section. And Playboy \u201creaders\u201d have been known to start with the\ncenterfold.)\n\nPutting a print magazine on radio or television never worked either.\nLiterally dozens of publications tried to take their successful print\nperiodicals into the radio and television arena. They all failed. Why? The\nessence of radio is the human voice and the essence of television is motion.\nA printed piece just sits there; it says nothing and doesn\u2019t move.\n\nSlate isn\u2019t the only Internet magazine that is slowly slipping out of sight.\nSalon magazine was voted the best Website of 1996 by Time magazine, yet\nthe on-line publication continues to lose money: $40 million since its\nfounding in 1995. \u201cThe future of media is on-line,\u201d argues Salon publisher\nMichael O\u2019Donnell. We beg to differ. Print is print; the Internet is the\nInternet. Trying to combine the two is a serious strategic error.\n\nTheStreet.com is a newspaper format trying to make it on the Internet. In\nspite of a raft of publicity generated by its cofounder James Cramer, the site\ncontinues to generate nothing but red ink. In the year 2000, TheStreet.com\nhad $23.3 million in revenues (mostly from advertising) and managed to\nlose $69.1 million.\n\nAdvertising is drying up on the Internet as more and more companies\nrecognize the futility of advertising in an interactive medium. Where do\nInternet sites spend most of their own advertising dollars? Surprisingly, it is\nnot on the Net but in the traditional media of television, newspapers, and\nradio.\n\nOne successful publication on the Web is the Interactive Edition of the Wall\nStreet Journal, which currently has almost 600,000 paying readers. One\nreason for its relative success, of course, is the price. The Interactive\nEdition of the Journal is a big bargain. While the regular paper subscription\ngoes for $175 a year, the Interactive Edition is just $59 a year and only $29\na year if you are already a print subscriber.\n\nWe wonder whether or not Dow Jones would have been better off launching\nan Internet publication under a different name and with greater interactivity.\n\nPerhaps the most successful Internet publication is Consumer Reports\nOnline, with 590,000 subscribers. That makes sense because \u201cinteractivity\u201d\nis an important aspect of how a subscriber might use the on-line\n\npublication. If you want to buy a refrigerator, you can key in \u201crefrigerator\u201d\nand find out what brands the nonprofit organization recommends. Yet the\non-line publication has been a mixed blessing for Consumer Reports. In two\nyears, the number of subscribers to the print publication has dropped from\n4.5 million to 4 million.\n\nIn this connection, look at the success of 60 Minutes, a television show that\nwas number one in the Nielsen ratings for a number of years. Although 60\nMinutes has a magazine-like look, it was created especially for television\nusing a personality-driven format. Furthermore, 60 Minutes did not lock\nitself into an existing magazine name.\n\nWhat works in one medium won\u2019t necessarily work in another. As a matter\nof fact, chances are great that one medium\u2019s success will be another\nmedium\u2019s failure.\n\n\u00a2 What newspaper also became a successful magazine brand? None that\nwe know of. (The Wall Street Journal tinkered with a publication\ncalled the Wall Street Journal Magazine, but the publication went\nnowhere.) The only successful newspaper \u201cmagazines\u201d are the ones\npublished on Sunday and given away free with the papers. Not exactly\nour idea of successful brands.\n\n\u00a2 What successful television brand also became a successful cable\ntelevision brand? None that we know of.\n\nThe big cable television brands\u2014HBO, ESPN, CNN, A&E, MTV, QVC,\nShowtime, and Nickelodeon\u2014were not line extensions of broadcast brands.\nThey were new brands created especially for cable.\n\nYet too many companies lock themselves into the past. They look for ways\nto use yesterday\u2019s name on tomorrow\u2019s medium. News Corp., for example,\nthe owner of TV Guide magazine, is using the TV Guide name on a cable\nchannel as well as an Internet brand called TV Guide Online. Neither\nstrategy is going to work very well.\n\nIf you want to build a brand on the Internet, you need to build a new brand\ndesigned specifically for the new medium. In other words, you have to\n\nbuild interactivity into your site, and you generally need a new name.\n\nIt bears repeating. The difference between the Internet and every other\nmedium is interactivity. Unless your site has this crucial ingredient, it is\ngoing to get lost in cyberspace.\n\nThe competition is intense. There are already many more dotcom Websites\nthan there are registered trademarks filed in the United States.\n\nInteractivity is not just the ability to select from a menu. (You can do that\nwith a book or a magazine by looking at the index. You can also do that\nwith a phone by pressing numbers. You can do that in a restaurant by asking\nfor the wine list.)\n\nInteractivity is the ability to type in your instructions and have the site\ndeliver the information you requested in the form you requested it. Check\nout Amazon.com. Type in a subject and the site will present a list of books\nthat match your category. You can do the same with authors or a title.\n\n(Instead of asking for the wine list, try asking the sommelier for a list of all\nFrench red wines that cost less than $40 a bottle. There\u2019s no interactivity in\na restaurant menu and no sense of humor in a sommelier.)\n\nInteractivity is also the ability of the site to furnish additional information\nbased on your original query. Select a book to purchase at Amazon.com and\nthe site will give you the names of at least three other books bought by\nprevious buyers of the book you ordered.\n\nInteractivity is also the ability to add your own information to the site. The\nbest Internet sites are two-way streets. At Amazon.com you can rate books\nby giving them anywhere from one to five stars, and in addition you can\nsubmit short reviews, which are posted within hours under the book you\nreviewed.\n\nInteractivity is also the ability of a site to handle complex pricing situations\nalmost instantaneously. Take airline tickets, for example. An airline site is\nable to select from a multitude of fares, flights, dates, and conditions and\ngive you a price on the spot, which you can either accept or decline. They\n\ncan even recommend a flight schedule that offers the lowest priced fare.\n(The Cisco site is another Internet operation that makes good use of this on-\nthe-spot pricing technology.)\n\nInteractivity is also the ability of the site to perform a wide variety of tests:\nintelligence tests, driving tests, occupational aptitude tests, psychological\ntests. Some of these areas are going to turn into big brands and big\nbusinesses.\n\nInteractivity is also the ability of the site to conduct auctions of all types.\nPriceline.com and eBay are two big brands that have already taken\nadvantage of this capability. (Currently eBay is worth $12 billion on the\nstock market. And Priceline.com is worth $672 million.)\n\nInteractivity is also the ability of the site to diagnose a situation and suggest\nremedies. We worked with a famous personality to develop a personal\nWebsite. The first screen was going to be a menu of various problems that\nan individual might be experiencing.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do it that way,\u201d we suggested. \u201cMake the screen interactive. Ask the\nperson a series of questions, then let your computer tell the individual what\nhis or her problem might be.\u201d\n\nInteractivity is a powerful metaphor for the patient-doctor or the student-\nteacher relationship.\n\nYou visit a medical doctor and describe your symptoms. The doctor\ndiagnoses your problem and prescribes appropriate treatment. This is the\nkind of interactivity that is possible on the Internet.\n\nWill the Internet spawn successful medical and educational brands? Why, of\ncourse. These are disciplines based on interactivity.\n\nCapellaUniversity.com, for example, offers five hundred courses in forty\nareas of specialization, including an MBA program with extensive\ninstruction in e-business operation and management. You can be sure there\nwill be many more Capellas to come.\n\nContrast correspondence courses by mail with Internet educational\nventures. The best that current correspondence courses can accomplish is a\nweekly or semiweekly dose of interactivity. The Internet can greatly speed\nup the process.\n'. Your task is to understand the content and the underlying message of the original text, rewrite the entire thing while keeping the original meaning remains intact. Expand the content by adding relevant and additional information to make the text more comprehensive, increase the length of text to maximum, and enhance its readability and engagement without altering its fundamental purpose."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Not since television took off in the early fifties has the nation seen such a\ntechnological revolution as the Internet. For a time, Internet usage was\nliterally doubling every month.\n\nThere is a relationship between television and the Internet. Each is a\ncommunications medium. And nothing on earth affects more people in a\nmore powerful way than the introduction of a major new mass-\ncommunications medium.\n\nOver the course of human history, there have been five such introductions:\n\n1. The book\n\n2. The newspaper, or periodical, which includes magazines\n3. Radio\n\n4. Television\n\n5. The Internet\n\n(While the telephone is a communication device and has had a long-lasting\neffect on people\u2019s lives, it does not possess the characteristics of a mass-\ncommunications medium.)\n\nLife gets complicated. The new medium does not replace the old. Rather,\nthe new medium is layered on top of the old media, forever changing and\nmodifying all of the existing media.\n\nThe original mass-communications medium, of course, was the human\nvoice, still an unusually effective way to send a message. Each major\nmedium to follow became powerful in its own right because the\nmedium possessed a unique and highly prized attribute.\n\nThe book multiplied the number of people that could be reached by a\nsingle individual. Not only could millions of people share ideas and\nconcepts, but these ideas could also easily flow from one generation to\nthe next.\n\nThe periodical added the attribute of news. Large numbers of people\ncould share news of the latest events in their city or country and\neventually the world. In essence, the periodical took the printing\nprocess used in book production and greatly sped it up. Where a book\ncould take months to produce (and still does, unfortunately), a\nnewspaper could be produced overnight.\n\nRadio added the attribute of the human voice. News and entertainment\ncould be communicated with emotion and personality. A long line of\ncelebrities have used the emotional power of radio to communicate in\nan exceptionally effective way\u2014Winston Churchill, Franklin D.\nRoosevelt, Rush Limbaugh, Dr. Laura Schlessinger, and Howard\n\nStern, to name a few.\n\nTelevision added the attribute of motion. Radio, with moving pictures,\nif you will. Motion pictures, of course, were the precursor of television\nand still represent much of TV\u2019s content. Movies were, and still are, a\npowerful, emotional medium, but not a mass-communications\nmedium. You have to go to a theater to see a film when it is first\nreleased.\n\nAnd the Internet? What attribute does the Internet bring to the\ncommunications table?\n\nIf the Internet is going to take its place alongside the other major media, it\nwill be because it exploits a totally new attribute.\n\nWe believe that history will rank the Internet as the greatest of all media.\nAnd the reason is simple. The Internet is the only mass-communications\nmedium that allows interactivity. (The organization that was formed to\npromote Internet advertising is called, appropriately enough, the Interactive\nAdvertising Bureau.)\n\nOn the Internet a brand lives or dies in an interactive environment. In the\nlong run, interactivity will define what works on the Internet and what\ndoesn\u2019t work. The secret to branding on the Internet is your ability to\npresent your brand in such a way that your customers and prospects can\ninteract with your message. You\u2019ll have to throw out many of the traditional\nways of brand building.\n\nTake advertising, for example. Will traditional advertising be effective on\nthe Internet? Of course not.\n\nFace the facts. People generally dislike advertising. Why do people love the\nTV remote control or zapper? It allows quick channel surfing when ads\nappear.\n\nWith the Internet, your prospects have total control of what they see, read,\nand hear. Is there any reason to doubt that they won\u2019t turn off your\nadvertising message as soon as it starts?\n\nAlong with advertising, many of the traditional forms of communication are\njust not going to make it on the Net. Take newspapers and magazines as\nanother example. Why would you assume that you could publish a\nsuccessful magazine or newspaper on the Internet? Where is the\ninteractivity?\n\nAbout the only \u201cinteractivity\u201d a newspaper or magazine format allows on\nthe Net is the ability to read stories in any order you choose. But you can do\nthat now with a paper publication. (Many newspaper readers start with the\nsports section. And Playboy \u201creaders\u201d have been known to start with the\ncenterfold.)\n\nPutting a print magazine on radio or television never worked either.\nLiterally dozens of publications tried to take their successful print\nperiodicals into the radio and television arena. They all failed. Why? The\nessence of radio is the human voice and the essence of television is motion.\nA printed piece just sits there; it says nothing and doesn\u2019t move.\n\nSlate isn\u2019t the only Internet magazine that is slowly slipping out of sight.\nSalon magazine was voted the best Website of 1996 by Time magazine, yet\nthe on-line publication continues to lose money: $40 million since its\nfounding in 1995. \u201cThe future of media is on-line,\u201d argues Salon publisher\nMichael O\u2019Donnell. We beg to differ. Print is print; the Internet is the\nInternet. Trying to combine the two is a serious strategic error.\n\nTheStreet.com is a newspaper format trying to make it on the Internet. In\nspite of a raft of publicity generated by its cofounder James Cramer, the site\ncontinues to generate nothing but red ink. In the year 2000, TheStreet.com\nhad $23.3 million in revenues (mostly from advertising) and managed to\nlose $69.1 million.\n\nAdvertising is drying up on the Internet as more and more companies\nrecognize the futility of advertising in an interactive medium. Where do\nInternet sites spend most of their own advertising dollars? Surprisingly, it is\nnot on the Net but in the traditional media of television, newspapers, and\nradio.\n\nOne successful publication on the Web is the Interactive Edition of the Wall\nStreet Journal, which currently has almost 600,000 paying readers. One\nreason for its relative success, of course, is the price. The Interactive\nEdition of the Journal is a big bargain. While the regular paper subscription\ngoes for $175 a year, the Interactive Edition is just $59 a year and only $29\na year if you are already a print subscriber.\n\nWe wonder whether or not Dow Jones would have been better off launching\nan Internet publication under a different name and with greater interactivity.\n\nPerhaps the most successful Internet publication is Consumer Reports\nOnline, with 590,000 subscribers. That makes sense because \u201cinteractivity\u201d\nis an important aspect of how a subscriber might use the on-line\n\npublication. If you want to buy a refrigerator, you can key in \u201crefrigerator\u201d\nand find out what brands the nonprofit organization recommends. Yet the\non-line publication has been a mixed blessing for Consumer Reports. In two\nyears, the number of subscribers to the print publication has dropped from\n4.5 million to 4 million.\n\nIn this connection, look at the success of 60 Minutes, a television show that\nwas number one in the Nielsen ratings for a number of years. Although 60\nMinutes has a magazine-like look, it was created especially for television\nusing a personality-driven format. Furthermore, 60 Minutes did not lock\nitself into an existing magazine name.\n\nWhat works in one medium won\u2019t necessarily work in another. As a matter\nof fact, chances are great that one medium\u2019s success will be another\nmedium\u2019s failure.\n\n\u00a2 What newspaper also became a successful magazine brand? None that\nwe know of. (The Wall Street Journal tinkered with a publication\ncalled the Wall Street Journal Magazine, but the publication went\nnowhere.) The only successful newspaper \u201cmagazines\u201d are the ones\npublished on Sunday and given away free with the papers. Not exactly\nour idea of successful brands.\n\n\u00a2 What successful television brand also became a successful cable\ntelevision brand? None that we know of.\n\nThe big cable television brands\u2014HBO, ESPN, CNN, A&E, MTV, QVC,\nShowtime, and Nickelodeon\u2014were not line extensions of broadcast brands.\nThey were new brands created especially for cable.\n\nYet too many companies lock themselves into the past. They look for ways\nto use yesterday\u2019s name on tomorrow\u2019s medium. News Corp., for example,\nthe owner of TV Guide magazine, is using the TV Guide name on a cable\nchannel as well as an Internet brand called TV Guide Online. Neither\nstrategy is going to work very well.\n\nIf you want to build a brand on the Internet, you need to build a new brand\ndesigned specifically for the new medium. In other words, you have to\n\nbuild interactivity into your site, and you generally need a new name.\n\nIt bears repeating.

Below is an excerpt from my book titled 'The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding How to Build a Product or Service into a World-Class Brand ', specifically from Chapter '3 THE LAW OF THE COMMON NAME', Section 'The kiss of death for an Internet\nbrand is a common name.'. The original text is: 'The most important marketing decision you can make is what to name the\nproduct.\n\nSo we said in Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind, a book published in\n1981. So how does the Internet change the role of the brand name?\n\nIn the positioning age, the name was important. In the Internet age, the\nname is critical.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason for that. In pre-Internet days, a brand always had a visual\ncomponent. While the name was the most important element, the visual also\ninfluenced the brand\u2019s purchase. The shape of a Coca-Cola bottle, the colors\non a box of Kodak film, the typography of an Intel logotype, the look and\nlocation of a McDonald\u2019s restaurant.\n\nThe Internet wipes out the visual. To tap into a Website, you type in a word.\nNo pictures, no colors, no typography, no look, no location.\n\nIf the name is critical, then why are most brand names on the Web so bad?\nThat\u2019s putting it mildly. Most Internet brand names are not bad: They\u2019re\nterrible.\n\nSome typical Internet brands include Advertising.com, Buy.com,\nCommunities.com, Cooking.com, Cruise.com, Desktop.com, eToys.com,\n\nFlower.com, Garden.com, Gear.com, Gifts.com, Hardware.com, Hifi.com,\nHomePage.com, Images.com, Individual.com, iMotors.com,\nIngredients.com, Law.com, Mail.com, Mortgage.com, Office.com,\nPets.com, Phone.com, Postcard.com, Sales.com, Songs.com, Sports.com,\nTickets.com, Vote.com, Weather.com, Wine.com, Women.com.\n\nNone of these are small, insignificant companies. Major corporations or\nventure capitalists have heavily funded them all. Many also tapped into the\nstock market. To cite four examples: Pets.com raised $50 million in an\ninitial public offering, Mortgage.com raised $60 million, iMotors raised\n$137 million, and eToys raised $166 million. All four dotcoms are now\nbankrupt or have shut down operations.\n\nWhat\u2019s wrong with these brand names? They\u2019re all common, or generic,\nnames.\n\nA common noun is a word that designates any one of a class of beings or\nthings. Cars is a common noun.\n\nA proper noun is a word that designates a particular being or thing.\nMercedes-Benz is a proper noun.\n\nTraditionally, brand names have been proper nouns. (If you were a language\npurist or work for the U.S. Trademark Department, you would call brand\nnames \u201cproper adjectives,\u201d as in \u201cMercedes-Benz cars.\u201d But most people\nuse brand names as nouns. They will say, \u201cI drive a Mercedes,\u201d not \u201cI drive\na Mercedes car.\u201d)\n\nThe best-known, most valuable brand names in the world are all proper\nnouns, not common or generic names. There are seventy-five worldwide\nbrands worth more than $1 billion each, according to Interbrand, a brand\nconsulting group. And none of these are common or generic names.\n\nTypical brands on the top seventy-five list include Coca-Cola, Microsoft,\nFord, Disney, Intel, McDonald\u2019s, Marlboro, Nokia, Nescaf\u00e9, Hewlett-\nPackard, Gillette, Kodak, and Sony. (Together, the seventy-five brands,\naccording to Interbrand, are worth an incredible $912.1 billion.)\n\nA few years from now are you likely to find Cola.com, Software.com,\nCars.com, Kids.com, Chips.com, Hamburgers.com, Cigarettes.com,\nCellphones.com, Coffee.com, Computers.com, Razors.com, Photos.com, or\nElectronics.com on the list of the world\u2019s most valuable names? We think\nnot.\n\n\u201cBut the Internet is different\u201d is the cry you hear from thirty-year-old CEOs\nmanaging Internet start-ups. You don\u2019t have to wear suits, you don\u2019t have to\nwear ties, you don\u2019t have to wear shoes, you don\u2019t have to make money,\nyou get stock options worth millions, and you can use generic names for\nyour Websites.\n\nBut is it? Is the Internet really different when it comes to brand names? So\nfar it doesn\u2019t seem to be.\n\u00a2 The leading Internet service provider is not ISP.com. It\u2019s AOL.\n\n\u00a2 The leading search engine on the Net is not Searchengine.com. It\u2019s\nYahoo!\n\n\u00a2 The leading retailer of books on the Net is not Books.com. It\u2019s\nAmazon.com.\n\n\u00a2 The leading job-search site on the Net is not Jobs.com. It\u2019s\nMonster.com.\n\n\u00a2 The leading auction site on the Net is not Auction.com. It\u2019s eBay.\n\n\u00a2 The leading airline-ticket bid site on the Net is not Air-\nlineticketbid.com. It\u2019s Priceline.com.\n\n\u00a2 The leading travel site on the Net is not Travel.com. It\u2019s Expedia.com.\n\n\u00a2 The leading electronic greeting card is not GreetingCard.com. It\u2019s\nBluemountain.com.\n\nAs it happens, there are two Internet names on Interbrand\u2019s list of the\nseventy-five most valuable brands. AOL, worth $4.5 billion, and Yahoo!,\nworth $4.4 billion. You\u2019ll notice that both AOL and Yahoo! are proper\nnouns, not common nouns.\n\nIn spite of all the evidence to the contrary, why do most Internet executives\ncontinue to prefer using common names rather than proper names for their\nWebsites? There are three reasons.\n\n1. When the Internet was new, when there were few sites up and running,\nwhen few people knew the names of any Websites, a common name\nwas an advantage. You wanted to look for a site selling shoes, you typed\n\nin \u201cshoes.com.\u201d\n\nIt was like an old-fashioned grocery store. You wanted crackers, you\nasked for the crackers. You wanted oatmeal cookies, you asked for the\noatmeal cookies. Today, however, there are many brands of cookies and\nmany brands of crackers in a supermarket. You don\u2019t ask for crackers,\nyou ask for Ritz crackers. You don\u2019t ask for oatmeal cookies, you ask\nfor Pepperidge Farm oatmeal cookies.\n\n2. When the Internet was new, many companies jumped on the Internet\nwith common names. After all, a common name was the fastest, most\ndirect way to communicate what the site was all about. The common\nname also made it easier for users to navigate the Net.\n\nThe advantages of a common name lasted for about two weeks as\nthousands and then hundreds of thousands of Internet sites were set up.\nToday, with more than five million dotcoms in operation, the\nadvantages of a common name for an Internet site are nil.\n\n3. Now that the Net has been around for a few years, Internet companies are\nhaving trouble getting beyond the mind-set of those early days. They\nstill think a common name is the best approach. In some ways, this is a\nself-reinforcing situation. As everyone launches common name sites,\nevery newcomer thinks this must be the way to go. And so that\u2019s the\nway they go.\n\nWith his Candid Camera, Allen Funt exploited human nature to do\nwhat others are doing regardless of whether or not it makes sense. His\nfavorite episode involves an elevator where the first person goes into\n\nthe car and faces the front. The next three people, all Candid Camera\nconfederates, get into the elevator and face the rear. By the time the fifth\nperson comes in, the first one feels so uncomfortable that he turns\naround and also faces the rear.\n\nFace the facts. Just because most sites use common names doesn\u2019t mean\nthat a common name is the best strategy for your site. It only means that\nmost Internet operators are under group pressure to conform.\n\nOne of the reasons for the dotcom disaster is the almost universal use of\ncommon-name Websites. Some samples of this common-noun craziness are\nas follows:\n\n\u00a2 In automobiles: AutoConnect.com, Autosite.com, AutoTrader.com,\nAutoweb.com, Cars.com, CarsDirect.com, and CarOrder.com.\n\u00a2 In banking: Ebank.com, Telebank.com, and Netbank.com.\n\n\u00a2 In diamonds: eDiamonds.com, InternetDiamonds.com, and\nWorldDiamonds.com.\n\n\u00a2 In employment: ComputerJobs.com, Gotajob.com, Headhunter.net,\nand Jobs.com.\n\n\u00a2 In facsimile: eFax.com, Fax.com, and Jfax.com.\n\n\u00a2 In finance: 401k.com, eCoverage.com, eCredit.com, Loansdirect.com,\neHealthinsurance.com, eLoan.com, Loanwise.com, Mortgage.com,\nand Studentloan.com.\n\n\u00a2 In furniture: BeHome.com, Decoratewithstyle.com, Ezshop.com,\nFurniture.com, FurnitureFind.com, Furnitureonline.com,\nHousenet.com, and Living.com.\n\n\u00a2 In groceries: Food.com, NetGrocer.com, and HomeGrocer.com.\n\n\u00a2 In health and nutrition: eDiets.com, eNutrition.com, HealthQuick.com,\nand onHealth.com.\n\n\u00a2 In pets: Petco.com, Pets.com, and Petstore.com.\n\n\u00a2 In postage: E-Stamp.com, Stamps.com, and Simplepostage.com.\n\n\u00a2 In prescription drugs: Drugstore.com, YourPharmacy.com, and\nRx.com.\n\n\u00a2 Inreal estate: Cyberhomes.com, eProperty.com,\nGoodhome.com, Homeadvisor.com, Homebid.com, Homegain.com,\nHomes.com, Homeseekers.com, Homestore.com, Myhome.com,\nOurhouse.com, Owners.com, RealEstate.com, and Realtor.com.\n\n\u00a2 In shopping: IStopShop.com, Buy.com, BuyItNow.com,\nNetmarket.com, NowOnSpecial.com, ShopNow.com, and\nShopping.com.\n\n\u00a2 In travel: Cheaptickets.com, Lowestfare.com, TravelHoliday.com, and\nTrip.com.\n\nThese are not generic names picked at random from the millions of dotcoms\non the Internet. Many of these dotcoms are no longer with us, of course, but\nall of them were serious sites backed by serious venture capitalists and\nsupported by millions of dollars\u2019 worth of advertising.\n\n\u00a2 Art.com was spending $18 million a year on advertising.\n\n\u00a2 AutoConnect.com was spending $15 million a year on advertising.\n\n\u00a2 CarsDirect was spending $30 million a year on advertising.\n\n* Drugstore.com was spending $30 million a year on advertising.\n\n\u00a2 Homestore.com was spending $20 million a year on advertising.\n\n\u00a2 Living.com was spending $20 million a year on advertising.\n\n\u00a2 Pets.com was spending $20 million a year on advertising.\n\n\u00a2 Petstore.com was spending $10 million a year on advertising.\n\n\u00a2 RealEstate.com was spending $13 million a year on advertising.\n\n\u00a2 Rx.com was spending $13 million a year on advertising.\n\nThese CommonName.coms were just a small sample of the thousands of\nInternet companies trying to spend their way into the prospect\u2019s mind. For\n\nthe most part it was money down the rat hole. There\u2019s no way that even a\nsmall percentage of these common-name sites could make it.\n\n(It\u2019s a sign of the times that one of the most heavily hyped advertising\nagencies specializing in the Internet field calls itself Agency.com.)\n\nWill some of these generic names be successful? Sure. In the land of the\nblind, the one-eyed man is king. Nobody is going to stop drinking beer\nbecause all of the beer brands use generic names. Nobody is going to stop\nbuying on the Web just because all the Internet brands are generic.\n\nIn the absence of competition, people will buy from a site with a common\nname. But as sites are set up with strong \u201cproper\u201d brand names, the\ncommon-name sites are going to dry up and blow away.\n\nYou have to win in the mind. And the mind treats common or generic\nnames as representative of all the sites in the category. Not just a single site.\n\nIn the human mind all automotive sites are \u201ccar dotcoms.\u201d How could\nCars.com ever establish a singular identity separate from the other car\ndotcoms?\n\nIn the mind all furniture sites are \u201cfurniture dotcoms.\u201d How could\nFurniture.com ever establish a singular identity separate from the rest of the\nfurniture dotcoms?\n\nThe vast majority of brand names on the Web are purely generic names.\nMost of these sites are now bankrupt or out of business.\n\nWhat\u2019s an eToys? An e-toy is a toy purchased on the Internet. An eToys is a\ncompany that sells e-toys on the Internet.\n\nThe name eToys is a weak brand name, yet the stock market thinks\ndifferently. On the first day that eToys went public, the stock price nearly\nquadrupled in value, making the company worth $7.7 billion, 35 percent\ngreater than that of its retail rival, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us Inc. (In its last fiscal year\neToys lost $73 million on revenues of $34.7 million.)\n\nOne of the problems with a common name like eToys is the ability of\ncompetition to jump in the marketplace and claim similar names.\n\n\u00a2 eToy.com\n\n\u00a2 iToy.com\n\n\u00a2 iToys.com\n\n\u00a2 Toy.com\n\n\u00a2 Toys.com\n\n\u00a2 Toystore.com\n\n\u00a2 iToystore.com\n\n\u00a2 eToystore.com\n\nNaturally eToys tried to register these and other similar names. But where\ndo you stop? And how much will it cost? And will the legal system allow\none company to own all the sites with \u201ctoy\u201d in the name?\n\nWhat\u2019s an E*Trade? An e-trade is a stock purchase or sale made on the\nInternet. An E*Trade is a company that handles e-trades on the Internet.\n\nA generic name like E*Trade is weak. The mind thinks verbally, not\nvisually. E-trade is the name of the category, not the company. Furthermore,\nyou can\u2019t use an asterisk in the actual site name. In order to reach E*Trade,\nyou have to type in www.etrade.com.\n\nEven though E*Trade has the enormous advantage of being first on the\nInternet, the company has already fallen to second place in terms of\ncustomer-trading volume online. (Charles Schwab is the leader.)\n\nMassive advertising in the mass media is keeping E*Trade in the game. But\nwith stock trading down, E*Trade has been losing money. In a recent year,\nthe company lost $242 million on revenues of $1.3 billion. How long it can\ncontinue to expand its services while at the same time losing money is a\nquestion that only the future can answer.\n\nHow can we be so sure that proper names will prevail over common names\nas brand names on the Internet? The only proof we can offer you is a\nhundred years of history. In the past century, how many common names\nhave become successful brands?\n\nVery, very few.\n\nFew categories in the outernet, as opposed to the Internet, are dominated by\ngeneric brand names. Invariably they are dominated by proper or \u201cname\u201d\nnames.\n\n\u00a2 In automobiles, we have Ford, Chevrolet, Chrysler, Volvo, and\nMercedes-Benz.\n\n\u00a2 In banking, we have Citibank, Chase Manhattan, and Wells Fargo.\n\n\u00a2 In drugstores, we have CVS, Eckerd, Rite-Aid, Walgreen\u2019s, and Osco.\n\n\u00a2 In furniture, we have Ikea, Ethan Allen, Levitz, Roche-Bobois, and\nMaurice Villency.\n\n\u00a2 In groceries, we have Kroger, Safeway, Winn-Dixie, Publix, and\nPathmark.\n\n\u00a2 In department stores we have Macy\u2019s, Saks Fifth Avenue, Marshall\nField, Nordstrom, and Neiman-Marcus.\n\n\u00a2 In discount stores we have Wal-Mart, Kmart, and Target.\n\nBut the Internet is different, you might be thinking. There must be a reason\nfor the rash of generic names.\n\nThe Internet is different, but the mind of the prospect stays the same. To be\nsuccessful you have to position your brand name in the mind.\n\nWhat managers often forget is that the mind treats a generic or common\nword as the name for a category of things, not as one particular thing or\nbrand.\n\nNo automobile dealer would call his or her dealership \u201cCars.\u201d Why not?\nImagine the following conversation.\n\n\u201cWhere did you buy your new car?\u201d\n\u201cAt Cars\u00ae.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh. What did you say? I asked you what dealership you bought your new\ncar from.\u201d\n\nWith literally thousands of Websites using generic names, you can expect\nthe same type of dialog to occur.\n\n\u201cWhat discount broker do you use on the Internet?\u201d\n\u201cMydiscountbroker.\u201d\n\n\u201cT know, but what\u2019s his name?\u201d\n\u201cMydiscountbroker.\u201d\n\n\u201c] already asked you that.\u201d\n\nThis is not a laughing matter. It demonstrates the way the mind works.\nWords get put into categories. A common name gets put into a different\ncategory than a proper name.\n\nThe comedy team of Abbott and Costello based their classic baseball\nroutine on the confusion that can occur when one class of words is\nsubstituted for another.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see, we have on the bags, Who\u2019s on first. What\u2019s on second. I Don\u2019t\nKnow is on third.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I want to find out. Who\u2019s on first?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d\n\u201cT mean, the fellow\u2019s name?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first baseman?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe guy playing first?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is on first.\u201d\n\n\u201cT\u2019m asking you, who\u2019s on first?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the man\u2019s name.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s who\u2019s name?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d\n\nMany companies in the past hundred years have tried to use common-type\nnouns as brand names in their categories. Just check the trademark register.\nThere\u2019s a host of brand names that have tried to preempt a category by\nusing a common-sounding name. Some examples:\n\n\u00a2 Toast\u2019em toaster pastries\n\n\u00a2 Soft & Dri deodorant\n\n\u00a2 Soft \u2018N Gentle toilet tissue\n\n\u00a2 Soft Shave shaving cream\n\n* Nice \u2018N Soft facial tissues\n\n\u00a2 NA nonalcoholic beer\n\n\u00a2 Baby\u2019s Choice disposable diapers\n\n\u00a2 Kid Care adhesive bandages\n\nTell the truth. Do any of these generic brand names ring a bell with you?\nProbably not. It\u2019s hard to remember a brand that uses a common name.\n\nOne of the best examples of the futility of trying to build a brand with a\ncommon name is Lite, the first light beer. When Miller Brewing introduced\n\nLite beer, there was no \u201cMiller\u201d on the can. And no competitor could use\nthe word \u201cLite\u201d on a beer brand either because Miller owned the trademark.\n\nMiller launched Lite with a massive advertising program and the segment\ntook off. As you might have expected, many competitors jumped in with\ngeneric versions of their own. Schlitz Light, Coors Light, Bud Light.\n\nEven though Miller was first with Lite beer, even though Lite had the\nbenefit of tremendous amounts of advertising and publicity, Miller was\nforced to throw in the towel and rename the product Miller Lite.\n\nYou can see the problem. The beer drinker goes into the bar and says, \u201cGive\nme a Lite beer.\u201d And the bartender says, \u201cFine. What kind of light beer do\nyou want?\u201d\n\nSome categories, of course, are loaded with mostly generic brand names.\n(Group pressure at work.) What is interesting is that in these categories,\ngenerally no one brand will dominate the category. Breakfast cereals are a\ngood example\u2014brands like Corn Flakes, Bran Flakes, Frosted Flakes, and\n100% Granola.\n\nTake the \u201cbran\u201d category. There are dozens of \u201cbran\u201d brands trying to\ncapture the category. Some examples:\n\n\u00a2 Kellogg\u2019s All-Bran\n\n\u00a2 Kellogg\u2019s Bran Flakes\n\n\u00a2 Kellogg\u2019s 40+ Bran Flakes\n\u00a2 Kellogg\u2019s Raisin Bran\n\n\u00a2 Nabisco 100% Bran\n\n\u00a2 Post Bran Flakes\n\n\u00a2 Post Raisin Bran\n\n\u00a2 Total Raisin Bran\n\nAs a result of the overwhelming reliance on common names, the cereal\ncategory has no clear-cut brand leader. The largest-selling cereal brand has\na market share of about 6 percent. (Cheerios is one of the few cereal brands\nthat doesn\u2019t use a common name.)\n\nIf common names don\u2019t work on the outernet, why should they work on the\nInternet? The problem is exactly the same. How do I get the prospect to\nremember my brand name and associate it with some positive attribute?\n\nWhen you use a common name as a brand name, you have little chance to\ndo either. First, the prospect can\u2019t differentiate between your site name and\nthe category name. Second, you can\u2019t associate a specific attribute with the\nname because the name stands for the entire category, not just your site.\n\nSome sites try to solve this problem by combining the attribute with the\ncommon noun. Instead of Books.com, the brand name becomes\nAllBooks4Less.com. Or perhaps Cheaptickets.com or Lowestfare.com.\n\nIronically, this is a branding strategy that can have a modicum of success in\nthe outernet but not on the Internet. If you\u2019re driving down the road and see\na sign that says \u201cAll Books 4 Less,\u201d you know what the store is selling and\nwhy you might want to shop there. (A chain named \u201cAll Books 4 Less,\u201d on\nthe other hand, is still not going to outsell Barnes & Noble, Waldenbooks,\nor Borders.)\n\nOn the Internet you don\u2019t drive down the road and you don\u2019t see the\nAllBooks4Less sign. You are going to have to remember the name and\nthat\u2019s not going to be easy.\n\nYou ask your mind, \u201cWho sells all books for less on the Net?\u201d And the\nanswer comes back \u201cAmazon.com.\u201d\n\nIn the short term, however, many prospects are using search engines to find\nsites that might interest them. So a name like AllBooks4Less.com could\nconceivably attract a fair number of hits. But that\u2019s only in the short term.\n\nThe whole idea of branding, on the Internet or elsewhere, is to burn your\nname in the mind. When you can successfully do that, there\u2019s no need for\n\nthe prospect to use a search engine to find your Website. So in the long run,\nyour Internet brand name will have to stand on its own. And a common\nname is a very weak foundation to stand on.\n\n\u201cCars\u201d is not a good name for an automotive dealership. And Cars.com is\nnot a good name for a Website that sells cars. Neither is\nMydiscountbroker.com a good name for a stockbroker on the Internet.\n\nAnd what do you suppose Internet.com is all about? This is a brand that has\ntwo strikes against it. Internet.com is a common noun used for a Website\nthat tries to appeal to everybody for everything. (You can hear the shouts of\njoy in the corridors at Internet.com. \u201cWow! We were able to register the\nbest name on the Net.\u201d Don\u2019t be too sure.)\n\nWhat\u2019s your own name? Brown, Jones, Smith? Would you consider\nchanging your name to a generic? If you did, a phone conversation might\nsound like this:\n\n\u201cHello, this is Some Person.\u201d\n\n\u201c1 know that, but what\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\nIn spite of our arguments to the contrary, there will be intense pressure\ninside most organizations to take the common-name route. It\u2019s the lemming\neffect. Once the crowd takes off in one direction, everyone just naturally\n\njoins in and follows. There\u2019s some psychological satisfaction in following\nthe crowd. In art, in music, in clothing, and in Internet brand names.\n\n\u201cTt is better for your reputation to fail conventionally,\u201d John Maynard\nKeynes once said, \u201cthan it is to succeed unconventionally.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t say we didn\u2019t warn you.\n'. Your task is to understand the content and the underlying message of the original text, rewrite the entire thing while keeping the original meaning remains intact. Expand the content by adding relevant and additional information to make the text more comprehensive, increase the length of text to maximum, and enhance its readability and engagement without altering its fundamental purpose."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The most important marketing decision you can make is what to name the\nproduct.\n\nSo we said in Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind, a book published in\n1981. So how does the Internet change the role of the brand name?\n\nIn the positioning age, the name was important. In the Internet age, the\nname is critical.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason for that. In pre-Internet days, a brand always had a visual\ncomponent. While the name was the most important element, the visual also\ninfluenced the brand\u2019s purchase. The shape of a Coca-Cola bottle, the colors\non a box of Kodak film, the typography of an Intel logotype, the look and\nlocation of a McDonald\u2019s restaurant.\n\nThe Internet wipes out the visual. To tap into a Website, you type in a word.\nNo pictures, no colors, no typography, no look, no location.\n\nIf the name is critical, then why are most brand names on the Web so bad?\nThat\u2019s putting it mildly. Most Internet brand names are not bad: They\u2019re\nterrible.\n\nSome typical Internet brands include Advertising.com, Buy.com,\nCommunities.com, Cooking.com, Cruise.com, Desktop.com, eToys.com,\n\nFlower.com, Garden.com, Gear.com, Gifts.com, Hardware.com, Hifi.com,\nHomePage.com, Images.com, Individual.com, iMotors.com,\nIngredients.com, Law.com, Mail.com, Mortgage.com, Office.com,\nPets.com, Phone.com, Postcard.com, Sales.com, Songs.com, Sports.com,\nTickets.com, Vote.com, Weather.com, Wine.com, Women.com.\n\nNone of these are small, insignificant companies. Major corporations or\nventure capitalists have heavily funded them all. Many also tapped into the\nstock market. To cite four examples: Pets.com raised $50 million in an\ninitial public offering, Mortgage.com raised $60 million, iMotors raised\n$137 million, and eToys raised $166 million. All four dotcoms are now\nbankrupt or have shut down operations.\n\nWhat\u2019s wrong with these brand names? They\u2019re all common, or generic,\nnames.\n\nA common noun is a word that designates any one of a class of beings or\nthings. Cars is a common noun.\n\nA proper noun is a word that designates a particular being or thing.\nMercedes-Benz is a proper noun.\n\nTraditionally, brand names have been proper nouns. (If you were a language\npurist or work for the U.S. Trademark Department, you would call brand\nnames \u201cproper adjectives,\u201d as in \u201cMercedes-Benz cars.\u201d But most people\nuse brand names as nouns. They will say, \u201cI drive a Mercedes,\u201d not \u201cI drive\na Mercedes car.\u201d)\n\nThe best-known, most valuable brand names in the world are all proper\nnouns, not common or generic names. There are seventy-five worldwide\nbrands worth more than $1 billion each, according to Interbrand, a brand\nconsulting group. And none of these are common or generic names.\n\nTypical brands on the top seventy-five list include Coca-Cola, Microsoft,\nFord, Disney, Intel, McDonald\u2019s, Marlboro, Nokia, Nescaf\u00e9, Hewlett-\nPackard, Gillette, Kodak, and Sony. (Together, the seventy-five brands,\naccording to Interbrand, are worth an incredible $912.1 billion.)\n\nA few years from now are you likely to find Cola.com, Software.com,\nCars.com, Kids.com, Chips.com, Hamburgers.com, Cigarettes.com,\nCellphones.com, Coffee.com, Computers.com, Razors.com, Photos.com, or\nElectronics.com on the list of the world\u2019s most valuable names? We think\nnot.\n\n\u201cBut the Internet is different\u201d is the cry you hear from thirty-year-old CEOs\nmanaging Internet start-ups. You don\u2019t have to wear suits, you don\u2019t have to\nwear ties, you don\u2019t have to wear shoes, you don\u2019t have to make money,\nyou get stock options worth millions, and you can use generic names for\nyour Websites.\n\nBut is it? Is the Internet really different when it comes to brand names? So\nfar it doesn\u2019t seem to be.\n\u00a2 The leading Internet service provider is not ISP.com. It\u2019s AOL.\n\n\u00a2 The leading search engine on the Net is not Searchengine.com. It\u2019s\nYahoo!\n\n\u00a2 The leading retailer of books on the Net is not Books.com. It\u2019s\nAmazon.com.\n\n\u00a2 The leading job-search site on the Net is not Jobs.com. It\u2019s\nMonster.com.\n\n\u00a2 The leading auction site on the Net is not Auction.com. It\u2019s eBay.\n\n\u00a2 The leading airline-ticket bid site on the Net is not Air-\nlineticketbid.com. It\u2019s Priceline.com.\n\n\u00a2 The leading travel site on the Net is not Travel.com. It\u2019s Expedia.com.\n\n\u00a2 The leading electronic greeting card is not GreetingCard.com. It\u2019s\nBluemountain.com.\n\nAs it happens, there are two Internet names on Interbrand\u2019s list of the\nseventy-five most valuable brands. AOL, worth $4.5 billion, and Yahoo!,\nworth $4.4 billion. You\u2019ll notice that both AOL and Yahoo! are proper\nnouns, not common nouns.\n\nIn spite of all the evidence to the contrary, why do most Internet executives\ncontinue to prefer using common names rather than proper names for their\nWebsites? There are three reasons.\n\n1. When the Internet was new, when there were few sites up and running,\nwhen few people knew the names of any Websites, a common name\nwas an advantage. You wanted to look for a site selling shoes, you typed\n\nin \u201cshoes.com.\u201d\n\nIt was like an old-fashioned grocery store. You wanted crackers, you\nasked for the crackers. You wanted oatmeal cookies, you asked for the\noatmeal cookies. Today, however, there are many brands of cookies and\nmany brands of crackers in a supermarket. You don\u2019t ask for crackers,\nyou ask for Ritz crackers. You don\u2019t ask for oatmeal cookies, you ask\nfor Pepperidge Farm oatmeal cookies.\n\n2. When the Internet was new, many companies jumped on the Internet\nwith common names. After all, a common name was the fastest, most\ndirect way to communicate what the site was all about. The common\nname also made it easier for users to navigate the Net.\n\nThe advantages of a common name lasted for about two weeks as\nthousands and then hundreds of thousands of Internet sites were set up.\nToday, with more than five million dotcoms in operation, the\nadvantages of a common name for an Internet site are nil.\n\n3. Now that the Net has been around for a few years, Internet companies are\nhaving trouble getting beyond the mind-set of those early days. They\nstill think a common name is the best approach. In some ways, this is a\nself-reinforcing situation. As everyone launches common name sites,\nevery newcomer thinks this must be the way to go. And so that\u2019s the\nway they go.\n\nWith his Candid Camera, Allen Funt exploited human nature to do\nwhat others are doing regardless of whether or not it makes sense. His\nfavorite episode involves an elevator where the first person goes into\n\nthe car and faces the front. The next three people, all Candid Camera\nconfederates, get into the elevator and face the rear. By the time the fifth\nperson comes in, the first one feels so uncomfortable that he turns\naround and also faces the rear.\n\nFace the facts. Just because most sites use common names doesn\u2019t mean\nthat a common name is the best strategy for your site. It only means that\nmost Internet operators are under group pressure to conform.\n\nOne of the reasons for the dotcom disaster is the almost universal use of\ncommon-name Websites. Some samples of this common-noun craziness are\nas follows:\n\n\u00a2 In automobiles: AutoConnect.com, Autosite.com, AutoTrader.com,\nAutoweb.com, Cars.com, CarsDirect.com, and CarOrder.com.\n\u00a2 In banking: Ebank.com, Telebank.com, and Netbank.com.\n\n\u00a2 In diamonds: eDiamonds.com, InternetDiamonds.com, and\nWorldDiamonds.com.\n\n\u00a2 In employment: ComputerJobs.com, Gotajob.com, Headhunter.net,\nand Jobs.com.\n\n\u00a2 In facsimile: eFax.com, Fax.com, and Jfax.com.\n\n\u00a2 In finance: 401k.com, eCoverage.com, eCredit.com, Loansdirect.com,\neHealthinsurance.com, eLoan.com, Loanwise.com, Mortgage.com,\nand Studentloan.com.\n\n\u00a2 In furniture: BeHome.com, Decoratewithstyle.com, Ezshop.com,\nFurniture.com, FurnitureFind.com, Furnitureonline.com,\nHousenet.com, and Living.com.\n\n\u00a2 In groceries: Food.com, NetGrocer.com, and HomeGrocer.com.\n\n\u00a2 In health and nutrition: eDiets.com, eNutrition.com, HealthQuick.com,\nand onHealth.com.\n\n\u00a2 In pets: Petco.com, Pets.com, and Petstore.com.\n\n\u00a2 In postage: E-Stamp.com, Stamps.com, and Simplepostage.com.\n\n\u00a2 In prescription drugs: Drugstore.com, YourPharmacy.com, and\nRx.com.\n\n\u00a2 Inreal estate: Cyberhomes.com, eProperty.com,\nGoodhome.com, Homeadvisor.com, Homebid.com, Homegain.com,\nHomes.com, Homeseekers.com, Homestore.com, Myhome.com,\nOurhouse.com, Owners.com, RealEstate.com, and Realtor.com.\n\n\u00a2 In shopping: IStopShop.com, Buy.com, BuyItNow.com,\nNetmarket.com, NowOnSpecial.com, ShopNow.com, and\nShopping.com.\n\n\u00a2 In travel: Cheaptickets.com, Lowestfare.com, TravelHoliday.com, and\nTrip.com.\n\nThese are not generic names picked at random from the millions of dotcoms\non the Internet. Many of these dotcoms are no longer with us, of course, but\nall of them were serious sites backed by serious venture capitalists and\nsupported by millions of dollars\u2019 worth of advertising.\n\n\u00a2 Art.com was spending $18 million a year on advertising.\n\n\u00a2 AutoConnect.com was spending $15 million a year on advertising.\n\n\u00a2 CarsDirect was spending $30 million a year on advertising.\n\n* Drugstore.com was spending $30 million a year on advertising.\n\n\u00a2 Homestore.com was spending $20 million a year on advertising.\n\n\u00a2 Living.com was spending $20 million a year on advertising.\n\n\u00a2 Pets.com was spending $20 million a year on advertising.\n\n\u00a2 Petstore.com was spending $10 million a year on advertising.\n\n\u00a2 RealEstate.com was spending $13 million a year on advertising.\n\n\u00a2 Rx.com was spending $13 million a year on advertising.\n\nThese CommonName.coms were just a small sample of the thousands of\nInternet companies trying to spend their way into the prospect\u2019s mind. For\n\nthe most part it was money down the rat hole. There\u2019s no way that even a\nsmall percentage of these common-name sites could make it.\n\n(It\u2019s a sign of the times that one of the most heavily hyped advertising\nagencies specializing in the Internet field calls itself Agency.com.)\n\nWill some of these generic names be successful? Sure. In the land of the\nblind, the one-eyed man is king. Nobody is going to stop drinking beer\nbecause all of the beer brands use generic names. Nobody is going to stop\nbuying on the Web just because all the Internet brands are generic.\n\nIn the absence of competition, people will buy from a site with a common\nname. But as sites are set up with strong \u201cproper\u201d brand names, the\ncommon-name sites are going to dry up and blow away.\n\nYou have to win in the mind. And the mind treats common or generic\nnames as representative of all the sites in the category. Not just a single site.\n\nIn the human mind all automotive sites are \u201ccar dotcoms.\u201d How could\nCars.com ever establish a singular identity separate from the other car\ndotcoms?\n\nIn the mind all furniture sites are \u201cfurniture dotcoms.\u201d How could\nFurniture.com ever establish a singular identity separate from the rest of the\nfurniture dotcoms?\n\nThe vast majority of brand names on the Web are purely generic names.\nMost of these sites are now bankrupt or out of business.\n\nWhat\u2019s an eToys? An e-toy is a toy purchased on the Internet. An eToys is a\ncompany that sells e-toys on the Internet.\n\nThe name eToys is a weak brand name, yet the stock market thinks\ndifferently. On the first day that eToys went public, the stock price nearly\nquadrupled in value, making the company worth $7.7 billion, 35 percent\ngreater than that of its retail rival, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us Inc. (In its last fiscal year\neToys lost $73 million on revenues of $34.7 million.)\n\nOne of the problems with a common name like eToys is the ability of\ncompetition to jump in the marketplace and claim similar names.\n\n\u00a2 eToy.com\n\n\u00a2 iToy.com\n\n\u00a2 iToys.com\n\n\u00a2 Toy.com\n\n\u00a2 Toys.com\n\n\u00a2 Toystore.com\n\n\u00a2 iToystore.com\n\n\u00a2 eToystore.com\n\nNaturally eToys tried to register these and other similar names. But where\ndo you stop? And how much will it cost? And will the legal system allow\none company to own all the sites with \u201ctoy\u201d in the name?\n\nWhat\u2019s an E*Trade? An e-trade is a stock purchase or sale made on the\nInternet. An E*Trade is a company that handles e-trades on the Internet.\n\nA generic name like E*Trade is weak. The mind thinks verbally, not\nvisually. E-trade is the name of the category, not the company. Furthermore,\nyou can\u2019t use an asterisk in the actual site name. In order to reach E*Trade,\nyou have to type in www.etrade.com.\n\nEven though E*Trade has the enormous advantage of being first on the\nInternet, the company has already fallen to second place in terms of\ncustomer-trading volume online. (Charles Schwab is the leader.)\n\nMassive advertising in the mass media is keeping E*Trade in the game. But\nwith stock trading down, E*Trade has been losing money. In a recent year,\nthe company lost $242 million on revenues of $1.3 billion. How long it can\ncontinue to expand its services while at the same time losing money is a\nquestion that only the future can answer.\n\nHow can we be so sure that proper names will prevail over common names\nas brand names on the Internet? The only proof we can offer you is a\nhundred years of history. In the past century, how many common names\nhave become successful brands?\n\nVery, very few.\n\nFew categories in the outernet, as opposed to the Internet, are dominated by\ngeneric brand names. Invariably they are dominated by proper or \u201cname\u201d\nnames.\n\n\u00a2 In automobiles, we have Ford, Chevrolet, Chrysler, Volvo, and\nMercedes-Benz.\n\n\u00a2 In banking, we have Citibank, Chase Manhattan, and Wells Fargo.\n\n\u00a2 In drugstores, we have CVS, Eckerd, Rite-Aid, Walgreen\u2019s, and Osco.\n\n\u00a2 In furniture, we have Ikea, Ethan Allen, Levitz, Roche-Bobois, and\nMaurice Villency.\n\n\u00a2 In groceries, we have Kroger, Safeway, Winn-Dixie, Publix, and\nPathmark.\n\n\u00a2 In department stores we have Macy\u2019s, Saks Fifth Avenue, Marshall\nField, Nordstrom, and Neiman-Marcus.\n\n\u00a2 In discount stores we have Wal-Mart, Kmart, and Target.\n\nBut the Internet is different, you might be thinking. There must be a reason\nfor the rash of generic names.\n\nThe Internet is different, but the mind of the prospect stays the same. To be\nsuccessful you have to position your brand name in the mind.\n\nWhat managers often forget is that the mind treats a generic or common\nword as the name for a category of things, not as one particular thing or\nbrand.\n\nNo automobile dealer would call his or her dealership \u201cCars.\u201d Why not?\nImagine the following conversation.\n\n\u201cWhere did you buy your new car?\u201d\n\u201cAt Cars\u00ae.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh. What did you say? I asked you what dealership you bought your new\ncar from.\u201d\n\nWith literally thousands of Websites using generic names, you can expect\nthe same type of dialog to occur.\n\n\u201cWhat discount broker do you use on the Internet?\u201d\n\u201cMydiscountbroker.\u201d\n\n\u201cT know, but what\u2019s his name?\u201d\n\u201cMydiscountbroker.\u201d\n\n\u201c] already asked you that.\u201d\n\nThis is not a laughing matter. It demonstrates the way the mind works.\nWords get put into categories. A common name gets put into a different\ncategory than a proper name.\n\nThe comedy team of Abbott and Costello based their classic baseball\nroutine on the confusion that can occur when one class of words is\nsubstituted for another.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see, we have on the bags, Who\u2019s on first. What\u2019s on second. I Don\u2019t\nKnow is on third.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I want to find out. Who\u2019s on first?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d\n\u201cT mean, the fellow\u2019s name?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first baseman?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe guy playing first?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is on first.\u201d\n\n\u201cT\u2019m asking you, who\u2019s on first?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the man\u2019s name.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s who\u2019s name?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d\n\nMany companies in the past hundred years have tried to use common-type\nnouns as brand names in their categories. Just check the trademark register.\nThere\u2019s a host of brand names that have tried to preempt a category by\nusing a common-sounding name. Some examples:\n\n\u00a2 Toast\u2019em toaster pastries\n\n\u00a2 Soft & Dri deodorant\n\n\u00a2 Soft \u2018N Gentle toilet tissue\n\n\u00a2 Soft Shave shaving cream\n\n* Nice \u2018N Soft facial tissues\n\n\u00a2 NA nonalcoholic beer\n\n\u00a2 Baby\u2019s Choice disposable diapers\n\n\u00a2 Kid Care adhesive bandages\n\nTell the truth. Do any of these generic brand names ring a bell with you?\nProbably not. It\u2019s hard to remember a brand that uses a common name.\n\nOne of the best examples of the futility of trying to build a brand with a\ncommon name is Lite, the first light beer. When Miller Brewing introduced\n\nLite beer, there was no \u201cMiller\u201d on the can. And no competitor could use\nthe word \u201cLite\u201d on a beer brand either because Miller owned the trademark.\n\nMiller launched Lite with a massive advertising program and the segment\ntook off. As you might have expected, many competitors jumped in with\ngeneric versions of their own. Schlitz Light, Coors Light, Bud Light.\n\nEven though Miller was first with Lite beer, even though Lite had the\nbenefit of tremendous amounts of advertising and publicity, Miller was\nforced to throw in the towel and rename the product Miller Lite.\n\nYou can see the problem. The beer drinker goes into the bar and says, \u201cGive\nme a Lite beer.\u201d And the bartender says, \u201cFine. What kind of light beer do\nyou want?\u201d\n\nSome categories, of course, are loaded with mostly generic brand names.\n(Group pressure at work.) What is interesting is that in these categories,\ngenerally no one brand will dominate the category. Breakfast cereals are a\ngood example\u2014brands like Corn Flakes, Bran Flakes, Frosted Flakes, and\n100% Granola.\n\nTake the \u201cbran\u201d category. There are dozens of \u201cbran\u201d brands trying to\ncapture the category. Some examples:\n\n\u00a2 Kellogg\u2019s All-Bran\n\n\u00a2 Kellogg\u2019s Bran Flakes\n\n\u00a2 Kellogg\u2019s 40+ Bran Flakes\n\u00a2 Kellogg\u2019s Raisin Bran\n\n\u00a2 Nabisco 100% Bran\n\n\u00a2 Post Bran Flakes\n\n\u00a2 Post Raisin Bran\n\n\u00a2 Total Raisin Bran\n\nAs a result of the overwhelming reliance on common names, the cereal\ncategory has no clear-cut brand leader. The largest-selling cereal brand has\na market share of about 6 percent. (Cheerios is one of the few cereal brands\nthat doesn\u2019t use a common name.)\n\nIf common names don\u2019t work on the outernet, why should they work on the\nInternet? The problem is exactly the same. How do I get the prospect to\nremember my brand name and associate it with some positive attribute?\n\nWhen you use a common name as a brand name, you have little chance to\ndo either. First, the prospect can\u2019t differentiate between your site name and\nthe category name. Second, you can\u2019t associate a specific attribute with the\nname because the name stands for the entire category, not just your site.\n\nSome sites try to solve this problem by combining the attribute with the\ncommon noun. Instead of Books.com, the brand name becomes\nAllBooks4Less.com. Or perhaps Cheaptickets.com or Lowestfare.com.\n\nIronically, this is a branding strategy that can have a modicum of success in\nthe outernet but not on the Internet. If you\u2019re driving down the road and see\na sign that says \u201cAll Books 4 Less,\u201d you know what the store is selling and\nwhy you might want to shop there. (A chain named \u201cAll Books 4 Less,\u201d on\nthe other hand, is still not going to outsell Barnes & Noble, Waldenbooks,\nor Borders.)\n\nOn the Internet you don\u2019t drive down the road and you don\u2019t see the\nAllBooks4Less sign. You are going to have to remember the name and\nthat\u2019s not going to be easy.\n\nYou ask your mind, \u201cWho sells all books for less on the Net?\u201d And the\nanswer comes back \u201cAmazon.com.\u201d\n\nIn the short term, however, many prospects are using search engines to find\nsites that might interest them. So a name like AllBooks4Less.com could\nconceivably attract a fair number of hits. But that\u2019s only in the short term.\n\nThe whole idea of branding, on the Internet or elsewhere, is to burn your\nname in the mind. When you can successfully do that, there\u2019s no need for\n\nthe prospect to use a search engine to find your Website. So in the long run,\nyour Internet brand name will have to stand on its own. And a common\nname is a very weak foundation to stand on.\n\n\u201cCars\u201d is not a good name for an automotive dealership. And Cars.com is\nnot a good name for a Website that sells cars. Neither is\nMydiscountbroker.com a good name for a stockbroker on the Internet.\n\nAnd what do you suppose Internet.com is all about? This is a brand that has\ntwo strikes against it. Internet.com is a common noun used for a Website\nthat tries to appeal to everybody for everything. (You can hear the shouts of\njoy in the corridors at Internet.com. \u201cWow! We were able to register the\nbest name on the Net.\u201d Don\u2019t be too sure.)\n\nWhat\u2019s your own name? Brown, Jones, Smith? Would you consider\nchanging your name to a generic? If you did, a phone conversation might\nsound like this:\n\n\u201cHello, this is Some Person.\u201d\n\n\u201c1 know that, but what\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\nIn spite of our arguments to the contrary, there will be intense pressure\ninside most organizations to take the common-name route. It\u2019s the lemming\neffect. Once the crowd takes off in one direction, everyone just naturally\n\njoins in and follows. There\u2019s some psychological satisfaction in following\nthe crowd. In art, in music, in clothing, and in Internet brand names.\n\n\u201cTt is better for your reputation to fail conventionally,\u201d John Maynard\nKeynes once said, \u201cthan it is to succeed unconventionally.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t say we didn\u2019t warn you.\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Below is an excerpt from my book titled 'The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding How to Build a Product or Service into a World-Class Brand ', specifically from Chapter '4 THE LAW OF THE PROPER NAME', Section 'Your name stands alone on the Internet,\nso you'd better have a good one.'. The original text is: 'The torrent of generic brand names on the Internet provides hope for the\nlate starters. If you can launch a Website with a good idea and a good brand\nname, you are in a good long-term position. You can wait until the generic\nsite names drop out of sight and then jump in and win big.\n\nMake no mistake about it. Your name stands alone on the Internet and is by\nfar your most valuable asset. This is one of the major differences between\nthe Internet and the physical world.\n\nIn the physical world, there are many clues to a company\u2019s purpose.\nLocation, window displays, even the size and architecture of the building. A\nhotel looks like a hotel, a bank looks like a bank, and a restaurant looks like\na restaurant.\n\nEven in the industrial field, you seldom are exposed to just the company\u2019s\nname. A brochure or direct-mail piece will usually have pictures that\nestablish the company\u2019s product line or service.\n\nOn the Internet, however, the name stands alone. Until you get to the site,\nyou won\u2019t find any clues to what the site actually does.\n\nIn the physical world, a mediocre name can sometimes work because the\nphysical clues combine to establish the company\u2019s identity. A watch store\nlooks like a watch store.\n\nThe location and visual look of a retail store, for example, can be so unique\nthat customers often forget the store\u2019s name. \u201cIt\u2019s the repair shop at the\ncomer of Eighty-seventh Street and York Avenue.\u201d\n\nEven a droll name can work in a retail environment. \u201cThe Mattress Firm\u201d\nfor a bedding shop, for example. \u201cThe Money Store\u201d for a home-loan\ncompany. \u201cGeneral Nutrition Centers\u201d for a health-supplement store.\nNames like these never stand alone. They always carry a wealth of clues\nthat communicate their real purpose.\n\nIn the electronic world, there are no clues. There are no books in the\nwindow that tell you that Amazon.com is a bookstore. No travel posters that\ntell you that Priceline.com sells airline tickets. No greeting cards that tell\nyou what Bluemountain.com does.\n\nThis is what leads Internet companies astray. Straight into the generic trap.\n\nThe lure of the generic is so powerful that some companies have paid\nenormous sums for names that in the long run will turn out to be useless. A\nLos Angeles company bought Business.com for $7.5 million. (To whom it\nmay concern: If you had bought this book for $18.95, you would have\nsaved yourself $7,499,981.05). Some other recent purchases:\n\n\u00a2 Wine.com was bought for $3 million.\n\n\u00a2 Telephone.com was bought for $1.75 million.\n\n\u00a2 Bingo.com was bought for $1.1 million.\n\n\u00a2 Wallstreet.com was bought for $1.03 million.\n\n\u00a2 Drugs.com was bought for $823,456.\n\n\u00a2 University.com was bought for $530,000.\n\nIt\u2019s worse than tulip mania in Holland or truffle madness in France. The\nlatest bid on the Loans.com name was $3 million. (If you own a common\nInternet name, our advice is to sell it before the mania melts away.)\n\nEven at this early stage, the power of a proper name as opposed to a\ncommon name for an Internet brand has been clearly demonstrated. The big\nearly winners (AOL, Amazon.com, eBay, Priceline.com, Yahoo!) have all\nbeen proper names rather than common names.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of confusion on this issue. People see a name like Priceline\nand assume it\u2019s a common or generic name, but it\u2019s not. The generic name\nfor the category is \u201ctickets\u201d or really \u201cname-your-own-price airline tickets.\u201d\nTickets.com is a common name used for a Website that, in our opinion, is\nnot going to take off.\n\n(\u201cPrice\u201d and \u201cline\u201d are common words, of course, but they are used out of\ncontext and in combination to create the proper name \u201cPriceline,\u201d which\nbecomes an effective Internet brand name.)\n\nEvery common name can also be a proper name if used to identify a single\nperson, place, or thing. Bird is a common name, but it\u2019s also a proper name,\nas in Larry Bird or Tweety Bird.\n\nWhen you are choosing a brand name for your Website, the first thing to\nask yourself is, what\u2019s the generic name for the category? Then that\u2019s the\none name you don\u2019t want to use for your site.\n\nInvariably a singular proper name will turn out to be a better name for your\nsite than a generic.\n\niVillage.com, for example, is a better name for a Website devoted to women\nthan Women.com. (Yes, there is a Website called Women.com, and it spent\nmillions to promote its name before selling out to a rival.\n\nAshton.com is a better name for a Website that sells luxury goods than\nCyberluxury.com, eLuxury.com, or Firstjewelry.com.\n\nIn the physical world, the same branding principles apply. The proper name\nis superior to the common or generic name.\n\n\u00a2 McDonald\u2019s is a better name than Burger King.\n\n\u00a2 Hertz is a better name than National Car Rental. (All the car rental\nnames you see in an airline terminal are national car rental companies,\nbut there\u2019s only one Hertz.)\n\n\u00a2 Time is a better name than Newsweek or U.S. News & World Report.\n\n\u00a2 Kraft is a better name than General Foods, so when Kraft General\nFoods decided to simplify their name, they called the company Kraft\nand not General Foods.\n\nThere are degrees of commonness, of course. \u201cBurger King\u201d is not a totally\ncommon name. The Hamburger Place would be a totally common name for\na fast-food establishment that features burgers.\n\nThere are degrees of properness, too. McDonald\u2019s and Hertz are more\n\u201cproper\u201d than Time magazine. Time is a common name used out of context\nto create a proper name.\n\nIn the same way, Amazon and Yahoo! are more \u201cproper\u201d than Priceline and\neBay, which are common words used out of context. (All distinctions are\nrelative, of course. Even Amazon and Yahoo! can be common words. A\nyahoo is a brutish creature and an amazon is a tall, vigorous, strong-willed\nwoman.)\n\nSo how \u201cproper\u201d should your Website name be?\n\nIt all depends. First, and most important of all, you want your Website name\nto be perceived as a proper name. Then hopefully you want your name to be\nmore \u201cproper\u201d than your competitors\u2019. But you also want to consider other\nfactors.\n\n1. THE NAME SHOULD BE SHORT.\n\nIn general, the shorter the better. Shortness is an attribute even more\nimportant for an Internet brand than an outernet brand.\n\nYou have to keyboard the Website name into your computer. That\u2019s why the\nsite name should be both short and easy to spell.\n\nMany Internet brands have two strikes against them. They are both too\ngeneric and too long. As a result, they are hard to remember and hard to\nspell. Some examples:\n\n\u00a2 Artsourceonline.com.\n\n\u00a2 Dotcomdirectory.com\n\n\u00a2 eBusinessisbusiness.com\n\n\u00a2 Expressautoparts.com\n\n\u00a2 Interactivebrokers.com\n\n\u00a2 GiftCertificates.com\n\n\u00a2 OnlineOfficeSupplies.com\n\n\u00a2 Treasurechestonline.com\n\nStarting with the generic name for the category and condensing it is a good\nway to kill two birds with one stone. You create a proper name that\u2019s also\nshort and easy to spell. CNET.com, for example, took the generic term\n\u201ccomputer network\u201d and shortened it to CNET, creating a short, proper\nname that\u2019s also easy to spell.\n\nSandoz needed a brand name for its over-the-counter flu therapy product.\nSo the company reversed the word order and condensed the name to\nTheraFlu. The product went on to become the leading brand in its category.\n\nNabisco needed a brand name for its vanilla wafers, so it called them Nilla.\nAnd the powerful brand name Jell-O is just a shortened version of gelatin\ndessert.\n\nNabisco itself is a brand name constructed by condensing its former generic\nname, National Biscuit Company. (There are many national biscuit\ncompanies, but only one Nabisco.)\n\nBarnesandnoble.com finally threw in the towel on their long, difficult-to-\nspell name and shortened it to bn.com.\n\nMorgan Stanley Dean Witter is an enormously successful financial\ncompany, but Morganstanleydeanwitter.com is not going to make it on the\nInternet. The company shortened the name to msdw.com.\n\n(The names bn.com and msdw.com are not good either, because they are\nhard to remember.)\n\nThe well-known consulting firm Booz Allen & Hamilton obviously\ncouldn\u2019t use its long, complicated name on the Internet, so the firm\nlaunched Bah.com. (Not a particularly euphonious choice.) And what about\nnames like Deloitte & Touche? Or PricewaterhouseCoopers?\n\nThe Internet will force many companies to take another look at their names.\nThis is true even for companies for which the Internet is a medium and not\na business. Instead of launching Bah.com, perhaps Booz Allen & Hamilton\nshould have changed the consulting firm\u2019s name to Booz Allen and\nlaunched a site called BoozAllen.com.\n\nAnd what about names like: Allegheny, Allegheny Teledyne, Allegiance,\nAnheuser-Busch, Bausch & Lomb, Canandaigua Brands, Di Giorgio,\nHamnischfeger, Hayes Lemmerz, Heilig-Meyers, Leucadia National, Marsh\n& McClennan, Phillips-Van Heusen, Rohm & Haas, Schering-Plough,\nSmurfit-Stone, Sodexho Marriott Services, Synovus Financial, Tecumseh\nProducts, TIAA-CREF, Transmontaigne, Wachovia, Wackenhut,\nWeyerhauser.\n\nAll of these companies will have difficulty transferring their names to the\nInternet. And these are not small companies either. They are all ranked in\nFortune magazine\u2019s list of the one thousand largest American companies.\n\nBecause of the Internet, many companies will have to simplify their names.\nYou have to misspell a name and address pretty badly before the Postal\n\nService will refuse to deliver your letter. To reach a Website, however, you\nhave to be perfect. You can\u2019t drop one of the periods or leave out a hyphen.\n\nOne way to have your cake and eat it too is by using both a name anda\nnickname on the Web. Charles Schwab is the leading discount brokerage\n\nfirm, but on the Web the company uses both CharlesSchwab.com and\nSchwab.com, although it promotes only Schwab.com.\n\nAsk Jeeves is one of the leading search-engine sites on the Internet, but it\nwisely operates with two site names: AskJeeves.com and Ask.com.\n\nWhen you have to choose between several brand names that seem equally\ngood, the smartest name to pick is usually the one that also has a good\nnickname.\n\nPeople feel closer to a brand when they are able to use the brand\u2019s\nnickname instead of its full name.\n\n\u00a2 Beemer, not BMW\n\n\u00a2 Chevy, not Chevrolet\n\n* Coke, not Coca-Cola\n\n\u00a2 Bud, not Budweiser\n\n\u00a2 FedEx, not Federal Express\n\n* Mac, not Macintosh\n\n2. THE NAME SHOULD BE SIMPLE.\n\nSimple is not the same as short. Simplicity has to do with the alphabetical\nconstruction of the brand name. A simple word uses only a few letters of\nthe alphabet and arranges them in combinations that repeat themselves.\n\nSchwab is a short name (six letters), but it is not a simple name because it\nuses six letters of the alphabet. This is one reason that Schwab is not a\nparticularly easy name to spell.\n\nMississippi is a long name (eleven letters), but it is also a simple name\nbecause it uses only four letters of the alphabet. Which is why most people\ncan spell Mississippi.\n\nCoca-Cola is both a short name and simple name. Although the name has\neight letters, it is formed by using only four letters of the alphabet.\n\nFurthermore, the name repeats the \u201cco\u201d syllable.\n\nPepsi-Cola, on the other hand, is a much more complicated name than\nCoca-Cola. Pepsi-Cola uses eight letters of the alphabet to form a nine-\nletter word.\n\nAutobytel.com, for example, suffers from the same problem. Like the\nPepsi-Cola name, it takes eight letters of the alphabet to form the name.\nFurthermore, how do you \u201cparse\u201d the name? Is it Auto by Tel or Auto\nBytel? And what is a Bytel anyway?\n\nEven though the Autobytel Website has a proper name, along with an early\nlead in the car category, we don\u2019t believe it will become the premier site in\nits category.\n\nSome people have criticized Nissan\u2019s decision to change its U.S. brand\nfrom Datsun to Nissan. But from a brand-name point of view, Nissan is the\nsuperior name. Although both brand names use six letters, the Datsun name\nrequires six letters of the alphabet and the Nissan name only four. (You\nhardly hear anyone use the Datsun name anymore.)\n\n3. THE NAME SHOULD SUGGEST THE CATEGORY.\n\nHere\u2019s the paradox. To become a big brand on the Web, you need a proper\nname. On the other hand, the name should suggest the category without\nfalling into the generic name trap.\n\nThis is not an easy line to walk. Shortening the generic name is one way to\nachieve both objectives (CNET, Nilla, and Jell-O, for example).\n\nAnother approach is to add an \u201coff-the-wall\u201d word to the name of the\ncategory. PlanetRx, for example. (We would have preferred a different word\nthan planet, which has been overused. In addition to the ailing Planet\nHollywood chain, there are two other would-be planet brands on the\nInternet: Pet Planet and Planet Outdoors.)\n\nDrugDepot.com might also have been a better name for an Internet\ndrugstore than either Drugs.com or Drugstore.com. It\u2019s alliterative and\n\nmimics both the Home Depot and the Office Depot brands in the physical\nworld.\n\nWe helped a company that was planning to sell advertising specialties on\nthe Web come up with the name BrandBuilders.com. (The company sells\nhats, T-shirts, pens, binders, and other material used in corporate brand-\nbuilding projects.) Then we agreed with the client to make the name more\nfinger friendly by shortening it to Branders.com.\n\n4. THE NAME SHOULD BE UNIQUE.\n\nUnique is the key characteristic that makes a name memorable. This is true\nfor all brand names, especially those used on the Web. AskJeeves.com and\nDrKoop.com are two Internet brand names that are both unique and\nmemorable.\n\nNo name, of course, is totally unique unless you create it from scratch, like\nAcura, Lexus, Kodak, or Xerox.\n\nAskJeeves.com is associated with the butler and DrKoop.com with the\nformer surgeon general of the United States. But these are singular\nindividuals who are not going to be confused with the Websites that carry\ntheir names.\n\nAs a matter of fact, both individuals suggest the functions of their sites\u2014\nAsk Jeeves for finding information and Dr. Koop for medical information.\n\nBut how unique is More.com, a site that spent $20 million to tell you they\nsell health, beauty, and wellness products? Or MyWay.com or\nCheckOut.com or Individual.com or Owners.com or YouDecide.com or\nIndulge.com or This.com or Respond.com? Or any of a hundred different\nsites being backed by millions of dollars\u2019 worth of venture capital and\npromoted with millions of dollars\u2019 worth of advertising?\n\nA Waltham, Massachusetts, company spent $20 million in television and\nradio advertisements to launch a gift-buying service called Send.com. How\nis anyone going to remember the name?\n\nLet\u2019s say you wanted to buy a present for your friend Charlie for Christmas.\nDo you go to Buy.com, Present.com, Gift.com, or what?\n\nBy definition a common or generic name is not unique. It does not refer to a\nspecific person, place, or thing like a proper name does. Therefore, a\ncommon name used as a Website name for the generic category is not\nmemorable.\n\n5. THE NAME SHOULD BE ALLITERATIVE.\n\nWhy do you think children move their lips when they read? They are\nconverting the visual symbols represented by the letters and words into\nsounds that can be processed by their brains. The mind works with the\nsounds of words, not with the visuals and their shapes.\n\nWhen you grow up, you learn not to move your lips when you\u2019re reading.\nBut this doesn\u2019t change the way your mind works. It still works with the\nsounds of words.\n\nIf you want people to remember something, rhyme it for them. \u201cIf the glove\ndon\u2019t fit, you must acquit.\u201d\n\nFogdog.com is an improvement over the brand\u2019s original name, which was\nSportsite.com.\n\nAlliteration is another sure-fire way to improve your brand\u2019s memorability.\nMany real-world brand names are alliterative. Some examples:\n\n\u00a2 Bed, Bath & Beyond\n\u00a2 Blockbuster\n\n\u00a2 Big Bertha\n\n* Coca-Cola\n\n\u00a2 Dirt Devil\n\n\u00a2 Volvo\n\n\u00a2 Weight Watchers\n\nIn our search of active, well-promoted Internet brands, we could find very\nfew that used alliteration. (One of the reasons we liked BrandBuilders as a\nname was its alliteration.)\n\nThe same principle applies with babies. Give your newborn kid a head start.\nPick a first name that\u2019s alliterative with your last name. It\u2019s a fact that many\nfamous celebrities have alliterative names: Alan Alda, Ronald Reagan,\nRobert Redford, Tina Turner, Marilyn Monroe, Charlie Chaplin, Sharon\nStone, Greta Garbo, Doris Day, Sylvester Stallone, Susan Sarandon, Ted\nTurner, Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck.\n\n6. THE NAME SHOULD BE SPEAKABLE.\n\nWhen was the last time you bought something because you read an\nadvertisement or a news item about it? Many people are hard put to\nremember a single item they bought because of an ad.\n\nDoes this mean that advertising is ineffective? Not necessarily. Most people\nbuy products or services because they hear about these things from friends,\nneighbors, or relatives.\n\nWord of mouth is the most effective medium in your entire communications\narsenal. But how does the first mouth get the word to pass along? From\npublicity or advertising, of course.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, there are ten word-of-mouth recommendations for\nevery publicity or advertising \u201chit.\u201d This ten-to-one ratio holds for many\ndifferent products and services.\n\nAs effective as word of mouth is, you can\u2019t build a brand by mouth alone.\nYou have got to give that first mouth something to work with.\nUnfortunately, too many companies use Internet brand names that are\nunspeakable. And many others are common names that discourage word-of-\nmouth usage.\n\n\u201cWhere did you buy your new computer?\u201d\n\n\u201cTt was Onsale.\u201d\n\n\u201c1 know you got a good deal, but where?\u201d\n\u201cOnsale.\u201d\n\nOnsale.com might be a difficult name to use in ordinary conversation, but\nmany other Websites are even worse. They\u2019re also hard to pronounce and\nspell. Some examples: Entrepreneur.com, Concierge.com,\nCyberluxury.com, Onvia.com, imandi.com, Brodia.com, iWon.com,\niOwn.com, Richoshet.com, zUniversity.com, Shabang.com, uBid.com,\nCozone.com, GiftEmporia.com, iParty.com, eHow.com, Travelocity.com,\nAdornis.com, 2Key.com.\n\nWhen someone recommends a physical brand or a real-world retail store,\nyou don\u2019t have to remember exactly how to spell the name in order to find\nthe store. Is it Abercrombie & Fitch or Abacromby & Finch? It doesn\u2019t\nmatter in the mall; it does matter on the Web.\n\nThat\u2019s why an Internet brand should always try to line up all possible\nspelling variations of its name. 2Key and TwoKey, for example.\n\n(Roughly 10 percent of the buying public suffers from some form of\ndyslexia. Why write off\u2014or rather, spell off\u2014the dyslexia market?)\n\nAnother problem is the mixing of letters and numbers. Very few outernet\nbrands use both. (We could think of only 3M, 3Com, and 1-800-\nFLOWERS.)\n\nQuite a few Internet brands, on the other hand, make this mistake:\n1stBuy.com, 123greetings.com, 123tel.com, How2.com,\nNet2phonedirect.com, Pop2it.com, Click2Asia.com, Shop2give.com,\nMP3.com, 4anything.com, 4charity.com, Fax4Free.com, Opus360.com,\n800.com, 911gifts.com.\n\nWhy do most people find it easier to remember their phone number than\ntheir license plate number, even though they are both about the same\nlength? Because license plates usually use both numbers and letters, which\nmakes them much more difficult to recall. While the combination can\nsometimes make cute vanity plates (321GO), they make poor brand names.\n\nAnd did you ever try to remember a Canadian postal code like H3B 2Y7? A\nmixture of letters and numbers is usually much harder to recall than either\nletters or numbers alone.\n\nOne of the reasons that companies select unspeakable brand names has to\ndo with the selection process.\n\nMost brand names are selected visually, usually from a list of names printed\non oversized sheets of white paper pasted on cardboard.\n\nThat\u2019s not the way prospects deal with brand names. They usually hear\nthem verbally from friends, neighbors, relatives, and coworkers. Even the\nmedia exposure of brand names is heavily weighted to verbal rather than\nvisual media. Nearly 90 percent of the average person\u2019s media time is spent\nlistening to radio or television versus less than 10 percent reading\nnewspapers or magazines.\n\nIn case you\u2019re wondering, the words you hear in a television commercial\nare far more likely to make an impression in your mind than the words you\nread on the screen. (The spoken word conveys emotion and secondary\nmeanings, while the printed word just sits emotionless on the page or on the\nTV screen.)\n\nWhen you select a brand name, you should listen to the proposed name\nbeing spoken, and not just stare at the word on a board. You can\u2019t hear\ncapital letters or the sound of a circle \u00ae. To be effective, a brand name\nneeds to sound like a proper name or a word that conjures up a particular\nWebsite, not just a generic category.\n\n7. THE NAME SHOULD BE SHOCKING.\n\nIf you want prospects to remember your Internet brand, you need to make\nthe name itself \u201cshocking.\u201d\n\nThe best brand names have always had an element of shock or surprise.\nDieHard, the largest selling automobile battery, for example. Haagen-Dazs,\nthe leading premium ice cream. Diesel, the fashionable brand of jeans.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to go overboard and make the name so shocking that it offends\npeople. FUBU is a brand name that comes close to the edge, although\nyounger people are usually more tolerant of truly shocking names.\n\nPeople sometimes ask us why we call our laws \u201cimmutable.\u201d Aren\u2019t some\nof your laws mutable? Maybe so, we reply, but to make it in the book\nbusiness you need a shocking title. The 22 Generally Accepted Laws of\nBranding is just not going to go anywhere at Barnes & Noble, Borders, or\nAmazon.com.\n\nOne of the most difficult tasks in public relations is getting a business book\nreviewed in the media. We\u2019re going to try as hard as possible, but the odds\nare that this book will probably be the eighth book we have written that will\nnot be reviewed by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBut the Journal did review a book entitled Leadership Secrets of Attila the\nHun. Four hundred years from now, will the 25th-century Wall Street\nJournal review a digital book entitled Leadership Secrets of Adolf Hitler?\nCould be.\n\nAn element of \u201cshock\u201d makes a name more memorable because it puts the\npower of emotion to work. To a certain extent, you remember events in\nyour own life based on the degree of emotional involvement. Your\ngraduation day, your wedding day, the day John F. Kennedy was shot, the\nday the Twin Towers were destroyed.\n\nYou may have taken dozens of vacations in your lifetime, most of which\nremain in your mind as fuzzy memories. The vacations you will never\nforget, however, are the ones that contain strong emotional elements. An\nautomobile accident, an overturned sailboat, the day you stepped on a sea\nurchin.\n\nYou see the same pattern on the Internet. Common names like Cooking.com\nand Furniture.com are bland and carry no shock or emotional involvement.\nThey\u2019re hard to remember.\n\nIt\u2019s names that have a bit of bite to them that will turn out to be the better\nbrand names on the Internet. Names like Yahoo! and Amazon.com. These\n\nare names that stir up some emotional response.\n\nOne good branding strategy for any Internet company is to immediately\nlock the \u201cshocking\u201d name into both the category and the benefit.\nAmazon.com has promoted itself as \u201cEarth\u2019s biggest bookstore.\u201d This\nstrategy works on several levels. The Amazon is the Earth\u2019s \u201cbiggest\u201d river,\nand the alliteration of \u201cbiggest bookstore\u201d makes the phrase more\nmemorable.\n\nIf you don\u2019t lock your shocking name into either a category or a benefit,\nyou waste the power of the name. We always thought that Prodigy was a\ngood name for an Internet service provider, but not for a general site.\nProdigy, in our opinion, should have been directed at children.\n\nOther memorable names are MotleyFool and EarthLink. (Although when\nEarthlink acquired MindSpring, it should have used the MindSpring name,\nwhich is more shocking.) Also memorable because they are shocking are\nHotmail, the most popular free e-mail service, and Monster.com, the\nleading Website for job listings.\n\n8. THE NAME SHOULD BE PERSONALIZED.\n\nObviously, every Internet brand cannot accommodate all of these eight\nnaming strategies, including personalization. But when the situation allows\nit, you should consider naming your site after an individual.\n\nThis strategy has a number of advantages. First of all, it assures you a\nWebsite with a proper name rather than a common name. Second, it\nenhances the publicity potential of your site.\n\nMany real-world brands have evolved from individuals. Ford, Chrysler,\nChevrolet, Pontiac, Olds(mobile), Buick, Cadillac, Calvin Klein, Ralph\nLauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Donna Karan, Liz Claiborne, L.L. Bean, Boeing,\nForbes, Goodyear, Gillette, Heinz, Hertz, and Orville Redenbacher, to name\na few.\n\nInitially Dell Computer sold its products under the PC Limited brand name.\nBut ultimately the company realized that the proper name (Dell) was much\n\nstronger than the generic name (PC Limited), so it switched.\n\nYou enhance the publicity potential of a brand when you use the founder\u2019s\nname as the brand name. Look at all the publicity Michael Dell has\nreceived, publicity that directly benefits the brand. His competitor Mr.\nCompaq seldom gets mentioned.\n\nAnd where would the Trump brands be without The Donald? Nowhere,\nbecause Donald doesn\u2019t like to spend money when he can get something for\nfree. Don\u2019t knock PR. Donald Trump\u2019s whirlwind activities on behalf of his\nbrands are what has made them successful.\n\nBrands are cold, silent, and lifeless. Only a person can articulate the brand\u2019s\nstrategy, position, and objectives. The media want to interview people, not\nbrands. And whenever possible, the media want to interview the CEO, not\nthe brand manager.\n\nRelax and enjoy it. If you are the CEO and you want your brand to become\nfamous, you have to become famous, too. The most famous brands usually\nalso have celebrity CEOs. Microsoft and Bill Gates. Sun Microsystems and\nScott McNealey. Oracle and Larry Ellison. Apple and Steve Jobs.\n\nSame on the Internet. AOL and Steve Case. Amazon.com and Jeff Bezos.\nYahoo! and Jerry Yang and David Filo.\n\nSimplify things. Make it easy for both your prospects and the media to\nassociate the chief executive with the Website. Give them both the same\nname.\n\n\u00a2 Donald Trump and Trump.com\n\n\u00a2 Michael Dell and Dell.com\n\n\u00a2 Charles Schwab and Schwab.com\nAll branding work starts with the name. If you pick a name that matches\n\nmost of these eight naming strategies, then you will be well on your way to\nbuilding a successful Internet brand.\n'. Your task is to understand the content and the underlying message of the original text, rewrite the entire thing while keeping the original meaning remains intact. Expand the content by adding relevant and additional information to make the text more comprehensive, increase the length of text to maximum, and enhance its readability and engagement without altering its fundamental purpose."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The torrent of generic brand names on the Internet provides hope for the\nlate starters. If you can launch a Website with a good idea and a good brand\nname, you are in a good long-term position. You can wait until the generic\nsite names drop out of sight and then jump in and win big.\n\nMake no mistake about it. Your name stands alone on the Internet and is by\nfar your most valuable asset. This is one of the major differences between\nthe Internet and the physical world.\n\nIn the physical world, there are many clues to a company\u2019s purpose.\nLocation, window displays, even the size and architecture of the building. A\nhotel looks like a hotel, a bank looks like a bank, and a restaurant looks like\na restaurant.\n\nEven in the industrial field, you seldom are exposed to just the company\u2019s\nname. A brochure or direct-mail piece will usually have pictures that\nestablish the company\u2019s product line or service.\n\nOn the Internet, however, the name stands alone. Until you get to the site,\nyou won\u2019t find any clues to what the site actually does.\n\nIn the physical world, a mediocre name can sometimes work because the\nphysical clues combine to establish the company\u2019s identity. A watch store\nlooks like a watch store.\n\nThe location and visual look of a retail store, for example, can be so unique\nthat customers often forget the store\u2019s name. \u201cIt\u2019s the repair shop at the\ncomer of Eighty-seventh Street and York Avenue.\u201d\n\nEven a droll name can work in a retail environment. \u201cThe Mattress Firm\u201d\nfor a bedding shop, for example. \u201cThe Money Store\u201d for a home-loan\ncompany. \u201cGeneral Nutrition Centers\u201d for a health-supplement store.\nNames like these never stand alone. They always carry a wealth of clues\nthat communicate their real purpose.\n\nIn the electronic world, there are no clues. There are no books in the\nwindow that tell you that Amazon.com is a bookstore. No travel posters that\ntell you that Priceline.com sells airline tickets. No greeting cards that tell\nyou what Bluemountain.com does.\n\nThis is what leads Internet companies astray. Straight into the generic trap.\n\nThe lure of the generic is so powerful that some companies have paid\nenormous sums for names that in the long run will turn out to be useless. A\nLos Angeles company bought Business.com for $7.5 million. (To whom it\nmay concern: If you had bought this book for $18.95, you would have\nsaved yourself $7,499,981.05). Some other recent purchases:\n\n\u00a2 Wine.com was bought for $3 million.\n\n\u00a2 Telephone.com was bought for $1.75 million.\n\n\u00a2 Bingo.com was bought for $1.1 million.\n\n\u00a2 Wallstreet.com was bought for $1.03 million.\n\n\u00a2 Drugs.com was bought for $823,456.\n\n\u00a2 University.com was bought for $530,000.\n\nIt\u2019s worse than tulip mania in Holland or truffle madness in France. The\nlatest bid on the Loans.com name was $3 million. (If you own a common\nInternet name, our advice is to sell it before the mania melts away.)\n\nEven at this early stage, the power of a proper name as opposed to a\ncommon name for an Internet brand has been clearly demonstrated. The big\nearly winners (AOL, Amazon.com, eBay, Priceline.com, Yahoo!) have all\nbeen proper names rather than common names.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of confusion on this issue. People see a name like Priceline\nand assume it\u2019s a common or generic name, but it\u2019s not. The generic name\nfor the category is \u201ctickets\u201d or really \u201cname-your-own-price airline tickets.\u201d\nTickets.com is a common name used for a Website that, in our opinion, is\nnot going to take off.\n\n(\u201cPrice\u201d and \u201cline\u201d are common words, of course, but they are used out of\ncontext and in combination to create the proper name \u201cPriceline,\u201d which\nbecomes an effective Internet brand name.)\n\nEvery common name can also be a proper name if used to identify a single\nperson, place, or thing. Bird is a common name, but it\u2019s also a proper name,\nas in Larry Bird or Tweety Bird.\n\nWhen you are choosing a brand name for your Website, the first thing to\nask yourself is, what\u2019s the generic name for the category? Then that\u2019s the\none name you don\u2019t want to use for your site.\n\nInvariably a singular proper name will turn out to be a better name for your\nsite than a generic.\n\niVillage.com, for example, is a better name for a Website devoted to women\nthan Women.com. (Yes, there is a Website called Women.com, and it spent\nmillions to promote its name before selling out to a rival.\n\nAshton.com is a better name for a Website that sells luxury goods than\nCyberluxury.com, eLuxury.com, or Firstjewelry.com.\n\nIn the physical world, the same branding principles apply. The proper name\nis superior to the common or generic name.\n\n\u00a2 McDonald\u2019s is a better name than Burger King.\n\n\u00a2 Hertz is a better name than National Car Rental. (All the car rental\nnames you see in an airline terminal are national car rental companies,\nbut there\u2019s only one Hertz.)\n\n\u00a2 Time is a better name than Newsweek or U.S. News & World Report.\n\n\u00a2 Kraft is a better name than General Foods, so when Kraft General\nFoods decided to simplify their name, they called the company Kraft\nand not General Foods.\n\nThere are degrees of commonness, of course. \u201cBurger King\u201d is not a totally\ncommon name. The Hamburger Place would be a totally common name for\na fast-food establishment that features burgers.\n\nThere are degrees of properness, too. McDonald\u2019s and Hertz are more\n\u201cproper\u201d than Time magazine. Time is a common name used out of context\nto create a proper name.\n\nIn the same way, Amazon and Yahoo! are more \u201cproper\u201d than Priceline and\neBay, which are common words used out of context. (All distinctions are\nrelative, of course. Even Amazon and Yahoo! can be common words. A\nyahoo is a brutish creature and an amazon is a tall, vigorous, strong-willed\nwoman.)\n\nSo how \u201cproper\u201d should your Website name be?\n\nIt all depends. First, and most important of all, you want your Website name\nto be perceived as a proper name. Then hopefully you want your name to be\nmore \u201cproper\u201d than your competitors\u2019. But you also want to consider other\nfactors.\n\n1. THE NAME SHOULD BE SHORT.\n\nIn general, the shorter the better. Shortness is an attribute even more\nimportant for an Internet brand than an outernet brand.\n\nYou have to keyboard the Website name into your computer. That\u2019s why the\nsite name should be both short and easy to spell.\n\nMany Internet brands have two strikes against them. They are both too\ngeneric and too long. As a result, they are hard to remember and hard to\nspell. Some examples:\n\n\u00a2 Artsourceonline.com.\n\n\u00a2 Dotcomdirectory.com\n\n\u00a2 eBusinessisbusiness.com\n\n\u00a2 Expressautoparts.com\n\n\u00a2 Interactivebrokers.com\n\n\u00a2 GiftCertificates.com\n\n\u00a2 OnlineOfficeSupplies.com\n\n\u00a2 Treasurechestonline.com\n\nStarting with the generic name for the category and condensing it is a good\nway to kill two birds with one stone. You create a proper name that\u2019s also\nshort and easy to spell. CNET.com, for example, took the generic term\n\u201ccomputer network\u201d and shortened it to CNET, creating a short, proper\nname that\u2019s also easy to spell.\n\nSandoz needed a brand name for its over-the-counter flu therapy product.\nSo the company reversed the word order and condensed the name to\nTheraFlu. The product went on to become the leading brand in its category.\n\nNabisco needed a brand name for its vanilla wafers, so it called them Nilla.\nAnd the powerful brand name Jell-O is just a shortened version of gelatin\ndessert.\n\nNabisco itself is a brand name constructed by condensing its former generic\nname, National Biscuit Company. (There are many national biscuit\ncompanies, but only one Nabisco.)\n\nBarnesandnoble.com finally threw in the towel on their long, difficult-to-\nspell name and shortened it to bn.com.\n\nMorgan Stanley Dean Witter is an enormously successful financial\ncompany, but Morganstanleydeanwitter.com is not going to make it on the\nInternet. The company shortened the name to msdw.com.\n\n(The names bn.com and msdw.com are not good either, because they are\nhard to remember.)\n\nThe well-known consulting firm Booz Allen & Hamilton obviously\ncouldn\u2019t use its long, complicated name on the Internet, so the firm\nlaunched Bah.com. (Not a particularly euphonious choice.) And what about\nnames like Deloitte & Touche? Or PricewaterhouseCoopers?\n\nThe Internet will force many companies to take another look at their names.\nThis is true even for companies for which the Internet is a medium and not\na business. Instead of launching Bah.com, perhaps Booz Allen & Hamilton\nshould have changed the consulting firm\u2019s name to Booz Allen and\nlaunched a site called BoozAllen.com.\n\nAnd what about names like: Allegheny, Allegheny Teledyne, Allegiance,\nAnheuser-Busch, Bausch & Lomb, Canandaigua Brands, Di Giorgio,\nHamnischfeger, Hayes Lemmerz, Heilig-Meyers, Leucadia National, Marsh\n& McClennan, Phillips-Van Heusen, Rohm & Haas, Schering-Plough,\nSmurfit-Stone, Sodexho Marriott Services, Synovus Financial, Tecumseh\nProducts, TIAA-CREF, Transmontaigne, Wachovia, Wackenhut,\nWeyerhauser.\n\nAll of these companies will have difficulty transferring their names to the\nInternet. And these are not small companies either. They are all ranked in\nFortune magazine\u2019s list of the one thousand largest American companies.\n\nBecause of the Internet, many companies will have to simplify their names.\nYou have to misspell a name and address pretty badly before the Postal\n\nService will refuse to deliver your letter. To reach a Website, however, you\nhave to be perfect. You can\u2019t drop one of the periods or leave out a hyphen.\n\nOne way to have your cake and eat it too is by using both a name anda\nnickname on the Web. Charles Schwab is the leading discount brokerage\n\nfirm, but on the Web the company uses both CharlesSchwab.com and\nSchwab.com, although it promotes only Schwab.com.\n\nAsk Jeeves is one of the leading search-engine sites on the Internet, but it\nwisely operates with two site names: AskJeeves.com and Ask.com.\n\nWhen you have to choose between several brand names that seem equally\ngood, the smartest name to pick is usually the one that also has a good\nnickname.\n\nPeople feel closer to a brand when they are able to use the brand\u2019s\nnickname instead of its full name.\n\n\u00a2 Beemer, not BMW\n\n\u00a2 Chevy, not Chevrolet\n\n* Coke, not Coca-Cola\n\n\u00a2 Bud, not Budweiser\n\n\u00a2 FedEx, not Federal Express\n\n* Mac, not Macintosh\n\n2. THE NAME SHOULD BE SIMPLE.\n\nSimple is not the same as short. Simplicity has to do with the alphabetical\nconstruction of the brand name. A simple word uses only a few letters of\nthe alphabet and arranges them in combinations that repeat themselves.\n\nSchwab is a short name (six letters), but it is not a simple name because it\nuses six letters of the alphabet. This is one reason that Schwab is not a\nparticularly easy name to spell.\n\nMississippi is a long name (eleven letters), but it is also a simple name\nbecause it uses only four letters of the alphabet. Which is why most people\ncan spell Mississippi.\n\nCoca-Cola is both a short name and simple name. Although the name has\neight letters, it is formed by using only four letters of the alphabet.\n\nFurthermore, the name repeats the \u201cco\u201d syllable.\n\nPepsi-Cola, on the other hand, is a much more complicated name than\nCoca-Cola. Pepsi-Cola uses eight letters of the alphabet to form a nine-\nletter word.\n\nAutobytel.com, for example, suffers from the same problem. Like the\nPepsi-Cola name, it takes eight letters of the alphabet to form the name.\nFurthermore, how do you \u201cparse\u201d the name? Is it Auto by Tel or Auto\nBytel? And what is a Bytel anyway?\n\nEven though the Autobytel Website has a proper name, along with an early\nlead in the car category, we don\u2019t believe it will become the premier site in\nits category.\n\nSome people have criticized Nissan\u2019s decision to change its U.S. brand\nfrom Datsun to Nissan. But from a brand-name point of view, Nissan is the\nsuperior name. Although both brand names use six letters, the Datsun name\nrequires six letters of the alphabet and the Nissan name only four. (You\nhardly hear anyone use the Datsun name anymore.)\n\n3. THE NAME SHOULD SUGGEST THE CATEGORY.\n\nHere\u2019s the paradox. To become a big brand on the Web, you need a proper\nname. On the other hand, the name should suggest the category without\nfalling into the generic name trap.\n\nThis is not an easy line to walk. Shortening the generic name is one way to\nachieve both objectives (CNET, Nilla, and Jell-O, for example).\n\nAnother approach is to add an \u201coff-the-wall\u201d word to the name of the\ncategory. PlanetRx, for example. (We would have preferred a different word\nthan planet, which has been overused. In addition to the ailing Planet\nHollywood chain, there are two other would-be planet brands on the\nInternet: Pet Planet and Planet Outdoors.)\n\nDrugDepot.com might also have been a better name for an Internet\ndrugstore than either Drugs.com or Drugstore.com. It\u2019s alliterative and\n\nmimics both the Home Depot and the Office Depot brands in the physical\nworld.\n\nWe helped a company that was planning to sell advertising specialties on\nthe Web come up with the name BrandBuilders.com. (The company sells\nhats, T-shirts, pens, binders, and other material used in corporate brand-\nbuilding projects.) Then we agreed with the client to make the name more\nfinger friendly by shortening it to Branders.com.\n\n4. THE NAME SHOULD BE UNIQUE.\n\nUnique is the key characteristic that makes a name memorable. This is true\nfor all brand names, especially those used on the Web. AskJeeves.com and\nDrKoop.com are two Internet brand names that are both unique and\nmemorable.\n\nNo name, of course, is totally unique unless you create it from scratch, like\nAcura, Lexus, Kodak, or Xerox.\n\nAskJeeves.com is associated with the butler and DrKoop.com with the\nformer surgeon general of the United States. But these are singular\nindividuals who are not going to be confused with the Websites that carry\ntheir names.\n\nAs a matter of fact, both individuals suggest the functions of their sites\u2014\nAsk Jeeves for finding information and Dr. Koop for medical information.\n\nBut how unique is More.com, a site that spent $20 million to tell you they\nsell health, beauty, and wellness products? Or MyWay.com or\nCheckOut.com or Individual.com or Owners.com or YouDecide.com or\nIndulge.com or This.com or Respond.com? Or any of a hundred different\nsites being backed by millions of dollars\u2019 worth of venture capital and\npromoted with millions of dollars\u2019 worth of advertising?\n\nA Waltham, Massachusetts, company spent $20 million in television and\nradio advertisements to launch a gift-buying service called Send.com. How\nis anyone going to remember the name?\n\nLet\u2019s say you wanted to buy a present for your friend Charlie for Christmas.\nDo you go to Buy.com, Present.com, Gift.com, or what?\n\nBy definition a common or generic name is not unique. It does not refer to a\nspecific person, place, or thing like a proper name does. Therefore, a\ncommon name used as a Website name for the generic category is not\nmemorable.\n\n5. THE NAME SHOULD BE ALLITERATIVE.\n\nWhy do you think children move their lips when they read? They are\nconverting the visual symbols represented by the letters and words into\nsounds that can be processed by their brains. The mind works with the\nsounds of words, not with the visuals and their shapes.\n\nWhen you grow up, you learn not to move your lips when you\u2019re reading.\nBut this doesn\u2019t change the way your mind works. It still works with the\nsounds of words.\n\nIf you want people to remember something, rhyme it for them. \u201cIf the glove\ndon\u2019t fit, you must acquit.\u201d\n\nFogdog.com is an improvement over the brand\u2019s original name, which was\nSportsite.com.\n\nAlliteration is another sure-fire way to improve your brand\u2019s memorability.\nMany real-world brand names are alliterative. Some examples:\n\n\u00a2 Bed, Bath & Beyond\n\u00a2 Blockbuster\n\n\u00a2 Big Bertha\n\n* Coca-Cola\n\n\u00a2 Dirt Devil\n\n\u00a2 Volvo\n\n\u00a2 Weight Watchers\n\nIn our search of active, well-promoted Internet brands, we could find very\nfew that used alliteration. (One of the reasons we liked BrandBuilders as a\nname was its alliteration.)\n\nThe same principle applies with babies. Give your newborn kid a head start.\nPick a first name that\u2019s alliterative with your last name. It\u2019s a fact that many\nfamous celebrities have alliterative names: Alan Alda, Ronald Reagan,\nRobert Redford, Tina Turner, Marilyn Monroe, Charlie Chaplin, Sharon\nStone, Greta Garbo, Doris Day, Sylvester Stallone, Susan Sarandon, Ted\nTurner, Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck.\n\n6. THE NAME SHOULD BE SPEAKABLE.\n\nWhen was the last time you bought something because you read an\nadvertisement or a news item about it? Many people are hard put to\nremember a single item they bought because of an ad.\n\nDoes this mean that advertising is ineffective? Not necessarily. Most people\nbuy products or services because they hear about these things from friends,\nneighbors, or relatives.\n\nWord of mouth is the most effective medium in your entire communications\narsenal. But how does the first mouth get the word to pass along? From\npublicity or advertising, of course.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, there are ten word-of-mouth recommendations for\nevery publicity or advertising \u201chit.\u201d This ten-to-one ratio holds for many\ndifferent products and services.\n\nAs effective as word of mouth is, you can\u2019t build a brand by mouth alone.\nYou have got to give that first mouth something to work with.\nUnfortunately, too many companies use Internet brand names that are\nunspeakable. And many others are common names that discourage word-of-\nmouth usage.\n\n\u201cWhere did you buy your new computer?\u201d\n\n\u201cTt was Onsale.\u201d\n\n\u201c1 know you got a good deal, but where?\u201d\n\u201cOnsale.\u201d\n\nOnsale.com might be a difficult name to use in ordinary conversation, but\nmany other Websites are even worse. They\u2019re also hard to pronounce and\nspell. Some examples: Entrepreneur.com, Concierge.com,\nCyberluxury.com, Onvia.com, imandi.com, Brodia.com, iWon.com,\niOwn.com, Richoshet.com, zUniversity.com, Shabang.com, uBid.com,\nCozone.com, GiftEmporia.com, iParty.com, eHow.com, Travelocity.com,\nAdornis.com, 2Key.com.\n\nWhen someone recommends a physical brand or a real-world retail store,\nyou don\u2019t have to remember exactly how to spell the name in order to find\nthe store. Is it Abercrombie & Fitch or Abacromby & Finch? It doesn\u2019t\nmatter in the mall; it does matter on the Web.\n\nThat\u2019s why an Internet brand should always try to line up all possible\nspelling variations of its name. 2Key and TwoKey, for example.\n\n(Roughly 10 percent of the buying public suffers from some form of\ndyslexia. Why write off\u2014or rather, spell off\u2014the dyslexia market?)\n\nAnother problem is the mixing of letters and numbers. Very few outernet\nbrands use both. (We could think of only 3M, 3Com, and 1-800-\nFLOWERS.)\n\nQuite a few Internet brands, on the other hand, make this mistake:\n1stBuy.com, 123greetings.com, 123tel.com, How2.com,\nNet2phonedirect.com, Pop2it.com, Click2Asia.com, Shop2give.com,\nMP3.com, 4anything.com, 4charity.com, Fax4Free.com, Opus360.com,\n800.com, 911gifts.com.\n\nWhy do most people find it easier to remember their phone number than\ntheir license plate number, even though they are both about the same\nlength? Because license plates usually use both numbers and letters, which\nmakes them much more difficult to recall. While the combination can\nsometimes make cute vanity plates (321GO), they make poor brand names.\n\nAnd did you ever try to remember a Canadian postal code like H3B 2Y7? A\nmixture of letters and numbers is usually much harder to recall than either\nletters or numbers alone.\n\nOne of the reasons that companies select unspeakable brand names has to\ndo with the selection process.\n\nMost brand names are selected visually, usually from a list of names printed\non oversized sheets of white paper pasted on cardboard.\n\nThat\u2019s not the way prospects deal with brand names. They usually hear\nthem verbally from friends, neighbors, relatives, and coworkers. Even the\nmedia exposure of brand names is heavily weighted to verbal rather than\nvisual media. Nearly 90 percent of the average person\u2019s media time is spent\nlistening to radio or television versus less than 10 percent reading\nnewspapers or magazines.\n\nIn case you\u2019re wondering, the words you hear in a television commercial\nare far more likely to make an impression in your mind than the words you\nread on the screen. (The spoken word conveys emotion and secondary\nmeanings, while the printed word just sits emotionless on the page or on the\nTV screen.)\n\nWhen you select a brand name, you should listen to the proposed name\nbeing spoken, and not just stare at the word on a board. You can\u2019t hear\ncapital letters or the sound of a circle \u00ae. To be effective, a brand name\nneeds to sound like a proper name or a word that conjures up a particular\nWebsite, not just a generic category.\n\n7. THE NAME SHOULD BE SHOCKING.\n\nIf you want prospects to remember your Internet brand, you need to make\nthe name itself \u201cshocking.\u201d\n\nThe best brand names have always had an element of shock or surprise.\nDieHard, the largest selling automobile battery, for example. Haagen-Dazs,\nthe leading premium ice cream. Diesel, the fashionable brand of jeans.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to go overboard and make the name so shocking that it offends\npeople. FUBU is a brand name that comes close to the edge, although\nyounger people are usually more tolerant of truly shocking names.\n\nPeople sometimes ask us why we call our laws \u201cimmutable.\u201d Aren\u2019t some\nof your laws mutable? Maybe so, we reply, but to make it in the book\nbusiness you need a shocking title. The 22 Generally Accepted Laws of\nBranding is just not going to go anywhere at Barnes & Noble, Borders, or\nAmazon.com.\n\nOne of the most difficult tasks in public relations is getting a business book\nreviewed in the media. We\u2019re going to try as hard as possible, but the odds\nare that this book will probably be the eighth book we have written that will\nnot be reviewed by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBut the Journal did review a book entitled Leadership Secrets of Attila the\nHun. Four hundred years from now, will the 25th-century Wall Street\nJournal review a digital book entitled Leadership Secrets of Adolf Hitler?\nCould be.\n\nAn element of \u201cshock\u201d makes a name more memorable because it puts the\npower of emotion to work. To a certain extent, you remember events in\nyour own life based on the degree of emotional involvement. Your\ngraduation day, your wedding day, the day John F. Kennedy was shot, the\nday the Twin Towers were destroyed.\n\nYou may have taken dozens of vacations in your lifetime, most of which\nremain in your mind as fuzzy memories. The vacations you will never\nforget, however, are the ones that contain strong emotional elements. An\nautomobile accident, an overturned sailboat, the day you stepped on a sea\nurchin.\n\nYou see the same pattern on the Internet. Common names like Cooking.com\nand Furniture.com are bland and carry no shock or emotional involvement.\nThey\u2019re hard to remember.\n\nIt\u2019s names that have a bit of bite to them that will turn out to be the better\nbrand names on the Internet. Names like Yahoo! and Amazon.com. These\n\nare names that stir up some emotional response.\n\nOne good branding strategy for any Internet company is to immediately\nlock the \u201cshocking\u201d name into both the category and the benefit.\nAmazon.com has promoted itself as \u201cEarth\u2019s biggest bookstore.\u201d This\nstrategy works on several levels. The Amazon is the Earth\u2019s \u201cbiggest\u201d river,\nand the alliteration of \u201cbiggest bookstore\u201d makes the phrase more\nmemorable.\n\nIf you don\u2019t lock your shocking name into either a category or a benefit,\nyou waste the power of the name. We always thought that Prodigy was a\ngood name for an Internet service provider, but not for a general site.\nProdigy, in our opinion, should have been directed at children.\n\nOther memorable names are MotleyFool and EarthLink. (Although when\nEarthlink acquired MindSpring, it should have used the MindSpring name,\nwhich is more shocking.) Also memorable because they are shocking are\nHotmail, the most popular free e-mail service, and Monster.com, the\nleading Website for job listings.\n\n8. THE NAME SHOULD BE PERSONALIZED.\n\nObviously, every Internet brand cannot accommodate all of these eight\nnaming strategies, including personalization. But when the situation allows\nit, you should consider naming your site after an individual.\n\nThis strategy has a number of advantages. First of all, it assures you a\nWebsite with a proper name rather than a common name. Second, it\nenhances the publicity potential of your site.\n\nMany real-world brands have evolved from individuals. Ford, Chrysler,\nChevrolet, Pontiac, Olds(mobile), Buick, Cadillac, Calvin Klein, Ralph\nLauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Donna Karan, Liz Claiborne, L.L. Bean, Boeing,\nForbes, Goodyear, Gillette, Heinz, Hertz, and Orville Redenbacher, to name\na few.\n\nInitially Dell Computer sold its products under the PC Limited brand name.\nBut ultimately the company realized that the proper name (Dell) was much\n\nstronger than the generic name (PC Limited), so it switched.\n\nYou enhance the publicity potential of a brand when you use the founder\u2019s\nname as the brand name. Look at all the publicity Michael Dell has\nreceived, publicity that directly benefits the brand. His competitor Mr.\nCompaq seldom gets mentioned.\n\nAnd where would the Trump brands be without The Donald? Nowhere,\nbecause Donald doesn\u2019t like to spend money when he can get something for\nfree. Don\u2019t knock PR. Donald Trump\u2019s whirlwind activities on behalf of his\nbrands are what has made them successful.\n\nBrands are cold, silent, and lifeless. Only a person can articulate the brand\u2019s\nstrategy, position, and objectives. The media want to interview people, not\nbrands. And whenever possible, the media want to interview the CEO, not\nthe brand manager.\n\nRelax and enjoy it. If you are the CEO and you want your brand to become\nfamous, you have to become famous, too. The most famous brands usually\nalso have celebrity CEOs. Microsoft and Bill Gates. Sun Microsystems and\nScott McNealey. Oracle and Larry Ellison. Apple and Steve Jobs.\n\nSame on the Internet. AOL and Steve Case. Amazon.com and Jeff Bezos.\nYahoo! and Jerry Yang and David Filo.\n\nSimplify things. Make it easy for both your prospects and the media to\nassociate the chief executive with the Website. Give them both the same\nname.\n\n\u00a2 Donald Trump and Trump.com\n\n\u00a2 Michael Dell and Dell.com\n\n\u00a2 Charles Schwab and Schwab.com\nAll branding work starts with the name. If you pick a name that matches\n\nmost of these eight naming strategies, then you will be well on your way to\nbuilding a successful Internet brand.\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Below is an excerpt from my book titled 'The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding How to Build a Product or Service into a World-Class Brand ', specifically from Chapter '5 THE LAW OF SINGULARITY', Section 'At all costs you should avoid being\nsecond in your category.'. The original text is: 'There\u2019s one big difference between branding on the Internet and branding in\nthe real world.\n\nIn the real world, there is always room for a number two brand.\n\n\u00a2 Duracell and Energizer\n\u00a2 Kodak and Fuji\n\n\u00a2 Hertz and Avis\n\n\u00a2 Nike and Reebok\n\n\u00a2 Goodyear and Michelin\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why number two brands can lead a healthy life on the\nouternet. They serve a need, not just for the consumer, but also for the trade.\n\nWould a supermarket just stock Coca-Cola and not a second brand? No.\nThe second brand gives the supermarket some leverage against the leader.\n\u201cIf Coca-Cola won\u2019t participate in our weekly promotion, we\u2019ll ask Pepsi-\nCola.\u201d\n\nThe unspoken implication of every request made by the trade is, if you turn\nthis deal down, we\u2019|I offer it to your competitor. The number two brand fills\n\nareal need for the trade.\n\nWould airline terminal management sign an exclusive deal with Hertz, the\nleading car rental brand? Not if they wanted to have some leverage on the\nnumber of cars available for rent, the hours of service, the pricing, and so\n\nforth.\n\nSay there\u2019s a McDonald\u2019s on the comer of a highly desirable fast-food site.\nThe real-estate developer across the street can\u2019t sell the site to Mickey D, so\nhe or she turns to Burger King.\n\nThe airline terminal, the supermarket, the drugstore, the mall operator, even\nthe real-estate developer\u2014all come between the customer and the brand.\nThese middlemen, or the trade if you will, have a strong need for number\ntwo brands, even if the number two brand is essentially the same. It\u2019s not a\nproduct need. It\u2019s a leverage need.\n\nYou find a similar need in the industrial field; most companies insist on \u201ca\nsecond source of supply.\u201d What if their primary supplier is out on strike? If\na company didn\u2019t have a second source of supply for a particular part, it\nmight have to shut down its production line.\n\n\u201cNothing comes between me and my Calvins,\u201d Brooke Shields once said.\nOn the Internet nothing comes between the customer and the brand. There\nare no middlemen, no trade, no real estate developers, no need for leverage\nagainst the leader. It\u2019s what Bill Gates calls \u201cfriction-free capitalism.\u201d\n\nAs a result, the Internet is more like a football game or a political contest.\nIt\u2019s the Law of Singularity. Second place is no place.\n\nOr as a Nike television commercial once said about the Olympics, \u201cyou\ndon\u2019t win silver, you lose gold.\u201d On the Internet, there are no silver or\nbronze medals.\n\nOn the Internet, monopolies will rule. There is no room on the Internet for\nnumber-two brands. The Internet will operate more like the computer\nsoftware industry, in which every category tends to be dominated by a\nsingle brand.\n\n\u00a2 In PC operating systems, it\u2019s Windows.\n\n\u00a2 In PC word-processing software, it\u2019s Word.\n\n\u00a2 In PC spreadsheet software, it\u2019s Excel.\n\n\u00a2 In PC presentation software, it\u2019s PowerPoint.\n\u00a2 In PC accounting software, it\u2019s Quicken.\n\n\u00a2 In PC tax-preparation software, it\u2019s TurboTax.\n\nMichael Mauboussin, chief investment strategist at Credit Suisse First\nBoston, found that Internet sites adhere to a mathematical valuation system\nso rigid, it resembles patterns found in nature. The pattern suggests that\nthere may be fewer ultimate winners than many investors expect.\n\nAs some sites get bigger, Mr. Mauboussin argues, they attract more users,\nand the more users they attract, the richer and more useful they become,\nattracting more users. This produces a \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d outcome: a handful\nof Websites with almost all the business, and the rest with next to nothing;\nie., the Law of Singularity.\n\nOne of the many advantages of friction-free retailing is that there is no one\nin between the customer and the manufacturer taking a cut of the\ntransaction. The price you pay for the lack of friction, however, is the\nvirtual disappearance of the second brand.\n\nFor many products, it\u2019s the retailer that is responsible for the strength of the\nsecond brand. No retailer wants to be totally dependent on a single brand in\neach category. To do so would be to put the retailer at the mercy of the\nmanufacturer. The second brand keeps the first brand honest.\n\nFor the most part, there seems to be a cordial relationship between\nmanufacturers and retailers, but despite the surface friendliness, there are\noften deep disagreements about prices, payment terms, stocking fees, co-op\nadvertising allowances, and return privileges. In the retail world, you don\u2019t\nfight fire with fire. You fight fire with a second brand.\n\nOn the Web the situation is different. The real world is the second brand.\nWhen Amazon.com offers best-sellers at 40 percent off, the book buyer\nmentally compares the Amazon deal with the 30 percent off one can find at\nmost brick-and-mortar bookstores.\n\nWhen Barnesandnoble.com (now bn.com) says \u201cme, too,\u201d the prospect\nyawns. There just isn\u2019t any reason to switch, unless Amazon.com suffers a\nbreakdown in service or pricing.\n\nThere\u2019s another reason why the Web puts the second brand under pressure.\nIn the physical world, one brand\u2019s success creates a trend in the opposite\ndirection. This is especially true for a fashion-oriented brand.\n\n\u201cNo one goes there anymore,\u201d said Yogi Berra. \u201cIt\u2019s getting too popular.\u201d\nNot as many people wear Ralph Lauren anymore either; it was getting too\npopular. Now a lot of folks are into Tommy Hilfiger.\n\nIf it\u2019s Tommy today, you can be sure that tomorrow it will be somebody\ntotally different. That\u2019s the power of the second-brand approach.\n\nBut the Web lacks the visibility of the physical world. If everyone bought\ntheir books from Amazon.com, how would you know? It\u2019s this lack of\nvisibility that mutes the backlash against a brand leader.\n\nIn reality, of course, there are many second brands on the Internet. Not only\nseconds, but thirds, fourths, fifths, and even sixths. In furniture for example,\nwe have Behome.com, Decoratewithstyle.com, Dwr.com, Furniture.com,\nFurnitureFind.com, Furnitureonline.com, HomeDecorators.com,\nHomePortfolio.com, Housenet.com, Living.com, and many more that we\ndon\u2019t know about.\n\nDoes this mean that the furniture category is different from books? That the\nfurniture category might have many brands, but that the book category will\nbe dominated by one brand, presumably Amazon.com?\n\nNot at all. It only means that there is no clear-cut furniture leader today. But\ntomorrow is another matter. In all likelihood, one furniture brand will get\n\nout in front of the pack and go on to dominate the category. What happened\nin books is likely to happen in furniture.\n\nHistory sheds some light on this process. In 1910, there were 508 American\nautomobile companies. Today there are just two: General Motors and Ford.\n\nIn 1985, there were almost a hundred companies making disk drives. Today,\ntwo companies, Quantum and Seagate, dominate the disk-drive market on a\nworldwide basis.\n\nIn 1990, there were some two hundred companies making personal\ncomputers. Today, two brands (Compaq and Dell) dominate the category.\n\nIn the real world, we call this process \u201cthe law of duality.\u201d In the long run,\ntwo brands will dominate the category, putting the third brand under\nenormous pressure.\n\n\u00a2 Compag and Dell dominate the personal-computer market, putting the\nIBM brand under pressure. IBM, which was losing millions on\npersonal computers, recently announced that they would withdraw\nfrom the retail market.\n\n\u00a2 Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola dominate the cola market, putting the\nsqueeze on the Royal Crown brand. RC Cola has been steadily losing\nmarket share.\n\n\u00a2 Kodak and Fuji dominate the photographic film market, virtually\nshutting out Agfa and driving the brand off most shelves.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t get any better for a brand buried in the pack. As time goes on,\nopportunities disappear. The leaders become more fixed in their positions.\nThe longer a brand remains an also-ran, the less likely it is to catch up.\n\nSubstitute \u201csingularity\u201d for duality and you have a long-term picture of the\nInternet. Friction-free retailing has eliminated the function of the second\nbrand.\n\nTake books, for example. Will either Borders.com or bn.com overtake\nAmazon.com? Unlikely, unless Amazon.com makes a major mistake.\n\nWill either Borders.com or bn.com close the gap with Amazon.com? That\u2019s\nunlikely, too. What is far more likely to happen is that Amazon.com will\nincrease its share of the online book market, putting severe pressure on both\nBorders.com and bn.com. The law of singularity at work.\n\nBut stay tuned. Amazon.com is in the process of making that major mistake\nthat will open the door for its book competitors (see the Law of Vanity).\n\nIs there any hope for a brand buried in second place? Of course there is. But\nthe highest form of strategic thinking is to first look at your situation with a\ncold eye.\n\nThe impossible is impossible. If it\u2019s going to be impossible to make\nprogress head-on against an Amazon.com, then you must back off and try a\ndifferent approach.\n\nWhat might that approach be? If the laws of branding are immutable (and\nwe think they are), then you must do exactly the same thing that\nAmazon.com did. You must be first in a new category.\n\nYou can always create an opportunity to be first in a new category by\nnarrowing your focus and by appealing to a segment of the market. It\u2019s as\nsimple as that.\n\nInstead of duplicating Amazon.com\u2019s site, a better strategy for bn.com\nwould have been to narrow the focus and specialize in a category of books.\nBusiness books, for example.\n\nWhich brings up the Law of Either/Or. If the Web was going to be a\nbusiness for Borders and Barnes & Noble, then they would have needed\ndifferent names on their Websites. With the same names, it is harder to\ncreate identities on the Web that are distinct and different from their\nidentities in the physical world. Line extension strikes again.\n\nActually a number of Internet companies are trying to compete with\nAmazon.com by doing exactly as we have just suggested, by narrowing\ntheir focus.\n\n\u00a2 Alibris.com in the used-book category.\n\u00a2 Medsite.com in the medical-book category.\n\n\u00a2 Varsitybooks.com in the textbook category.\n\nIn each of these categories, of course, there are a number of other Internet\nbrands. So which brand will be the winner in each category? It won\u2019t\nnecessarily be the brand that was first in the marketplace. It won\u2019t\nnecessarily be the brand that was first to become profitable. The winner will\nbe the first brand to establish a dominant position in the prospect\u2019s mind.\nThen the Law of Singularity will take over and dampen the market shares of\nthe runners-up. Nothing succeeds like success.\n\nWhen building an Internet brand, you have to think category first and brand\nsecond. Customers are not primarily interested in companies, in brands, or\neven in Websites. They are primarily interested in categories. They are not\nprimarily interested in buying a Volvo, for example. They buy a Volvo in\norder to get a safe car. Volvo is the leader in a mental category called \u201csafe\ncars.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s a Chevrolet? In truth, a Chevrolet is a large, small, cheap, expensive\ncar or truck. One reason for the continuing decline of Chevrolet sales is the\nfact that General Motors has neglected to define the mental category that\nChevrolet is supposed to occupy.\n\nIf you want to be the leader in a category, you first have to tell the prospect\nwhat the category is. Take a two-page advertisement from a recent issue of\n\nthe Harvard Business Review. There were only fifteen words in the entire\nad and here is every one of them.\n\nThe internet is a blank canvas.\nYou hold the brush.\nintendchange.com\n\nintendchange\n\nimage \u00a2 build \u00ab reinvent\n\nWill the reader of this Intendchange.com advertisement have any idea what\nthe category is? We doubt it. Which might be one reason the Website folded\nin July 2000. It never hurts to tell the reader exactly where to file your\nbrand name in the mind. Books, auctions, whatever.\n\n\u201cEarth\u2019s biggest bookstore\u201d not only stakes out a category for Amazon.com,\nbut also makes a strong claim for leadership in the category. \u201cImage, build,\nreinvent\u201d does neither.\n\nIn summary, don\u2019t get discouraged if you\u2019re not the dominant brand in a\ncategory. Just channel your branding efforts in a different direction. Just\nnarrow your focus.\n\nYou can always create a powerful brand by narrowing the focus on the\nleader. The Internet is an enormous medium. The opportunities to narrow\nthe focus are astronomical.\n\nIn the real world, many narrowly focused brands have been extraordinarily\nsuccessful in competing with market leaders.\n\nBack in the early eighties, IBM was the most powerful company in the\nworld. It made the most money and had the best reputation. IBM was also\nthe first company to introduce a serious 16-bit office personal computer, the\nIBM PC. So is IBM the leader in PCs today? No, Dell Computer is.\n\nUnlike IBM, Dell made only one product (personal computers) marketed to\none segment (the business community) and sold through one distribution\nchannel (direct to customers). Yet today Dell outsells all other competitors\nin personal computers. Less often yields much more.\n\nWhat Dell did in personal computers, Sun Microsystems did in\nworkstations. By focusing on UNIX workstations, Sun built a powerful\nbrand and a profitable company. You don\u2019t have to have a full line to be\nsuccessful.\n\nWhen the Web matures, of course, there will be opportunities for number-\ntwo brands. Until that day arrives, you need to be the leading brand in your\ncategory or look for an opportunity to narrow the focus in order to create a\nnew category you can be the leader in.\n'.

Not if they wanted to have some leverage on the\nnumber of cars available for rent, the hours of service, the pricing, and so\n\nforth.\n\nSay there\u2019s a McDonald\u2019s on the comer of a highly desirable fast-food site.\nThe real-estate developer across the street can\u2019t sell the site to Mickey D, so\nhe or she turns to Burger King.\n\nThe airline terminal, the supermarket, the drugstore, the mall operator, even\nthe real-estate developer\u2014all come between the customer and the brand.\nThese middlemen, or the trade if you will, have a strong need for number\ntwo brands, even if the number two brand is essentially the same. It\u2019s not a\nproduct need. It\u2019s a leverage need.\n\nYou find a similar need in the industrial field; most companies insist on \u201ca\nsecond source of supply.\u201d What if their primary supplier is out on strike? If\na company didn\u2019t have a second source of supply for a particular part, it\nmight have to shut down its production line.\n\n\u201cNothing comes between me and my Calvins,\u201d Brooke Shields once said.\nOn the Internet nothing comes between the customer and the brand. There\nare no middlemen, no trade, no real estate developers, no need for leverage\nagainst the leader. It\u2019s what Bill Gates calls \u201cfriction-free capitalism.\u201d\n\nAs a result, the Internet is more like a football game or a political contest.\nIt\u2019s the Law of Singularity. Second place is no place.\n\nOr as a Nike television commercial once said about the Olympics, \u201cyou\ndon\u2019t win silver, you lose gold.\u201d On the Internet, there are no silver or\nbronze medals.\n\nOn the Internet, monopolies will rule. There is no room on the Internet for\nnumber-two brands. The Internet will operate more like the computer\nsoftware industry, in which every category tends to be dominated by a\nsingle brand.\n\n\u00a2 In PC operating systems, it\u2019s Windows.\n\n\u00a2 In PC word-processing software, it\u2019s Word.\n\n\u00a2 In PC spreadsheet software, it\u2019s Excel.\n\n\u00a2 In PC presentation software, it\u2019s PowerPoint.\n\u00a2 In PC accounting software, it\u2019s Quicken.\n\n\u00a2 In PC tax-preparation software, it\u2019s TurboTax.\n\nMichael Mauboussin, chief investment strategist at Credit Suisse First\nBoston, found that Internet sites adhere to a mathematical valuation system\nso rigid, it resembles patterns found in nature. The pattern suggests that\nthere may be fewer ultimate winners than many investors expect.\n\nAs some sites get bigger, Mr. Mauboussin argues, they attract more users,\nand the more users they attract, the richer and more useful they become,\nattracting more users. This produces a \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d outcome: a handful\nof Websites with almost all the business, and the rest with next to nothing;\nie., the Law of Singularity.\n\nOne of the many advantages of friction-free retailing is that there is no one\nin between the customer and the manufacturer taking a cut of the\ntransaction. The price you pay for the lack of friction, however, is the\nvirtual disappearance of the second brand.\n\nFor many products, it\u2019s the retailer that is responsible for the strength of the\nsecond brand. No retailer wants to be totally dependent on a single brand in\neach category. To do so would be to put the retailer at the mercy of the\nmanufacturer. The second brand keeps the first brand honest.\n\nFor the most part, there seems to be a cordial relationship between\nmanufacturers and retailers, but despite the surface friendliness, there are\noften deep disagreements about prices, payment terms, stocking fees, co-op\nadvertising allowances, and return privileges. In the retail world, you don\u2019t\nfight fire with fire. You fight fire with a second brand.\n\nOn the Web the situation is different. The real world is the second brand.\nWhen Amazon.com offers best-sellers at 40 percent off, the book buyer\nmentally compares the Amazon deal with the 30 percent off one can find at\nmost brick-and-mortar bookstores.\n\nWhen Barnesandnoble.com (now bn.com) says \u201cme, too,\u201d the prospect\nyawns. There just isn\u2019t any reason to switch, unless Amazon.com suffers a\nbreakdown in service or pricing.\n\nThere\u2019s another reason why the Web puts the second brand under pressure.\nIn the physical world, one brand\u2019s success creates a trend in the opposite\ndirection. This is especially true for a fashion-oriented brand.\n\n\u201cNo one goes there anymore,\u201d said Yogi Berra. \u201cIt\u2019s getting too popular.\u201d\nNot as many people wear Ralph Lauren anymore either; it was getting too\npopular. Now a lot of folks are into Tommy Hilfiger.\n\nIf it\u2019s Tommy today, you can be sure that tomorrow it will be somebody\ntotally different. That\u2019s the power of the second-brand approach.\n\nBut the Web lacks the visibility of the physical world. If everyone bought\ntheir books from Amazon.com, how would you know? It\u2019s this lack of\nvisibility that mutes the backlash against a brand leader.\n\nIn reality, of course, there are many second brands on the Internet. Not only\nseconds, but thirds, fourths, fifths, and even sixths. In furniture for example,\nwe have Behome.com, Decoratewithstyle.com, Dwr.com, Furniture.com,\nFurnitureFind.com, Furnitureonline.com, HomeDecorators.com,\nHomePortfolio.com, Housenet.com, Living.com, and many more that we\ndon\u2019t know about.\n\nDoes this mean that the furniture category is different from books? That the\nfurniture category might have many brands, but that the book category will\nbe dominated by one brand, presumably Amazon.com?\n\nNot at all. It only means that there is no clear-cut furniture leader today. But\ntomorrow is another matter. In all likelihood, one furniture brand will get\n\nout in front of the pack and go on to dominate the category. What happened\nin books is likely to happen in furniture.\n\nHistory sheds some light on this process. In 1910, there were 508 American\nautomobile companies. Today there are just two: General Motors and Ford.\n\nIn 1985, there were almost a hundred companies making disk drives. Today,\ntwo companies, Quantum and Seagate, dominate the disk-drive market on a\nworldwide basis.\n\nIn 1990, there were some two hundred companies making personal\ncomputers. Today, two brands (Compaq and Dell) dominate the category.\n\nIn the real world, we call this process \u201cthe law of duality.\u201d In the long run,\ntwo brands will dominate the category, putting the third brand under\nenormous pressure.\n\n\u00a2 Compag and Dell dominate the personal-computer market, putting the\nIBM brand under pressure. IBM, which was losing millions on\npersonal computers, recently announced that they would withdraw\nfrom the retail market.\n\n\u00a2 Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola dominate the cola market, putting the\nsqueeze on the Royal Crown brand. RC Cola has been steadily losing\nmarket share.\n\n\u00a2 Kodak and Fuji dominate the photographic film market, virtually\nshutting out Agfa and driving the brand off most shelves.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t get any better for a brand buried in the pack. As time goes on,\nopportunities disappear. The leaders become more fixed in their positions.\nThe longer a brand remains an also-ran, the less likely it is to catch up.\n\nSubstitute \u201csingularity\u201d for duality and you have a long-term picture of the\nInternet. Friction-free retailing has eliminated the function of the second\nbrand.\n\nTake books, for example. Will either Borders.com or bn.com overtake\nAmazon.com? Unlikely, unless Amazon.com makes a major mistake.\n\nWill either Borders.com or bn.com close the gap with Amazon.com? That\u2019s\nunlikely, too. What is far more likely to happen is that Amazon.com will\nincrease its share of the online book market, putting severe pressure on both\nBorders.com and bn.com. The law of singularity at work.\n\nBut stay tuned. Amazon.com is in the process of making that major mistake\nthat will open the door for its book competitors (see the Law of Vanity).\n\nIs there any hope for a brand buried in second place? Of course there is. But\nthe highest form of strategic thinking is to first look at your situation with a\ncold eye.\n\nThe impossible is impossible. If it\u2019s going to be impossible to make\nprogress head-on against an Amazon.com, then you must back off and try a\ndifferent approach.\n\nWhat might that approach be? If the laws of branding are immutable (and\nwe think they are), then you must do exactly the same thing that\nAmazon.com did. You must be first in a new category.\n\nYou can always create an opportunity to be first in a new category by\nnarrowing your focus and by appealing to a segment of the market. It\u2019s as\nsimple as that.\n\nInstead of duplicating Amazon.com\u2019s site, a better strategy for bn.com\nwould have been to narrow the focus and specialize in a category of books.\nBusiness books, for example.\n\nWhich brings up the Law of Either/Or. If the Web was going to be a\nbusiness for Borders and Barnes & Noble, then they would have needed\ndifferent names on their Websites. With the same names, it is harder to\ncreate identities on the Web that are distinct and different from their\nidentities in the physical world. Line extension strikes again.\n\nActually a number of Internet companies are trying to compete with\nAmazon.com by doing exactly as we have just suggested, by narrowing\ntheir focus.\n\n\u00a2 Alibris.com in the used-book category.\n\u00a2 Medsite.com in the medical-book category.\n\n\u00a2 Varsitybooks.com in the textbook category.\n\nIn each of these categories, of course, there are a number of other Internet\nbrands. So which brand will be the winner in each category? It won\u2019t\nnecessarily be the brand that was first in the marketplace. It won\u2019t\nnecessarily be the brand that was first to become profitable. The winner will\nbe the first brand to establish a dominant position in the prospect\u2019s mind.\nThen the Law of Singularity will take over and dampen the market shares of\nthe runners-up. Nothing succeeds like success.\n\nWhen building an Internet brand, you have to think category first and brand\nsecond. Customers are not primarily interested in companies, in brands, or\neven in Websites. They are primarily interested in categories. They are not\nprimarily interested in buying a Volvo, for example. They buy a Volvo in\norder to get a safe car. Volvo is the leader in a mental category called \u201csafe\ncars.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s a Chevrolet? In truth, a Chevrolet is a large, small, cheap, expensive\ncar or truck. One reason for the continuing decline of Chevrolet sales is the\nfact that General Motors has neglected to define the mental category that\nChevrolet is supposed to occupy.\n\nIf you want to be the leader in a category, you first have to tell the prospect\nwhat the category is. Take a two-page advertisement from a recent issue of\n\nthe Harvard Business Review. There were only fifteen words in the entire\nad and here is every one of them.\n\nThe internet is a blank canvas.\nYou hold the brush.\nintendchange.com\n\nintendchange\n\nimage \u00a2 build \u00ab reinvent\n\nWill the reader of this Intendchange.com advertisement have any idea what\nthe category is? We doubt it. Which might be one reason the Website folded\nin July 2000. It never hurts to tell the reader exactly where to file your\nbrand name in the mind. Books, auctions, whatever.\n\n\u201cEarth\u2019s biggest bookstore\u201d not only stakes out a category for Amazon.com,\nbut also makes a strong claim for leadership in the category. \u201cImage, build,\nreinvent\u201d does neither.\n\nIn summary, don\u2019t get discouraged if you\u2019re not the dominant brand in a\ncategory. Just channel your branding efforts in a different direction. Just\nnarrow your focus.\n\nYou can always create a powerful brand by narrowing the focus on the\nleader. The Internet is an enormous medium. The opportunities to narrow\nthe focus are astronomical.\n\nIn the real world, many narrowly focused brands have been extraordinarily\nsuccessful in competing with market leaders.\n\nBack in the early eighties, IBM was the most powerful company in the\nworld. It made the most money and had the best reputation. IBM was also\nthe first company to introduce a serious 16-bit office personal computer, the\nIBM PC. So is IBM the leader in PCs today? No, Dell Computer is.\n\nUnlike IBM, Dell made only one product (personal computers) marketed to\none segment (the business community) and sold through one distribution\nchannel (direct to customers). Yet today Dell outsells all other competitors\nin personal computers. Less often yields much more.\n\nWhat Dell did in personal computers, Sun Microsystems did in\nworkstations. By focusing on UNIX workstations, Sun built a powerful\nbrand and a profitable company. You don\u2019t have to have a full line to be\nsuccessful.\n\nWhen the Web matures, of course, there will be opportunities for number-\ntwo brands. Until that day arrives, you need to be the leading brand in your\ncategory or look for an opportunity to narrow the focus in order to create a\nnew category you can be the leader in.\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Below is an excerpt from my book titled 'The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding How to Build a Product or Service into a World-Class Brand ', specifically from Chapter '6 THE LAW OF INTERNET ADVERTISING', Section 'Advertising off the Net will be a lot bigger\nthan advertising on the Net.'. The original text is: 'Death and taxes used to be the only certainties in life. Today you can add\none more: advertising.\n\nAdvertising messages are ubiquitous. Everywhere you turn you\u2019ll find an\nadvertising message. From television to taxicabs to T-shirts. From\nbillboards to buses to bathrooms. (Now you can\u2019t even take a leak without\nbeing exposed to advertising.) In some circles, elevators are considered the\nnext fast-rising advertising medium.\n\nEvery major auto race, golf tournament, and tennis tournament has a\ncorporate sponsor. All the bowl games are already taken, from the Hooters\nHula Bowl in Hawaii to the AT&T Rose Bowl in Pasadena to the Nokia\nSugar Bowl in New Orleans.\n\nSports arenas around the country are rapidly selling their names for\nadvertising purposes. In San Francisco, Candlestick Park is now 3Com\nStadium. The Washington Redskins\u2019 Landover Stadium is now FedEx\nField. Internet companies are also getting into the act. The Baltimore\nRavens sold the naming rights for their National Football League stadium to\nPSINet in a twenty-year deal for $105 million.\n\nBut the mother of all naming deals happened in Atlanta. Naming rights for\nthe city\u2019s new basketball and hockey stadium were sold to Philips NV ina\n\npackage deal estimated to be worth $200 million over twenty years. (The\nnew Philips Arena cost only $140.5 million to build.)\n\nWhen the name on the stadium is worth more than the physical stadium\nitself, you know that we live in an advertising-oriented world.\n\nThe traditional media, of course, have been saturated with advertising for as\nlong as we can remember.\n\nThe average magazine is 60 percent advertising. The average newspaper is\n70 percent advertising. But print media are at least partially supported by\nsubscribers. Radio and broadcast television are almost totally supported by\nthe advertising revenues they generate.\n\nAnd they generate a lot of revenue. In a recent year, advertisers spent $49\nbillion on broadcast TV advertising and $17 billion on radio advertising.\n\nCable television was once touted as the first ad-free communications\nmedium, but that didn\u2019t last very long. Today cable TV is almost as\nsaturated with advertising as regular TV.\n\nWith billions and billions of advertising dollars chasing every available\nmedium, you can\u2019t blame the Internet folks for trying to tap into this\ntreasure trove. The Internet was going to be another advertising medium,\nbut bigger and better and eventually more rewarding than television.\n\nInitially, at least, advertising supported all the commercial Websites. The\ngame plan was simple: \u201cWe will give away the content in order to draw\ntraffic, which we can then use to sell advertising.\u201d Exactly the way\ntelevision and radio currently work.\n\nSo we had free browsers, free search engines, free electronic mail, free\nelectronic greeting cards, free Internet access. Even free phone calls and\nfree tax returns.\n\nInstead of paying America Online $23.90 a month, you used to be able to\nsign up with NetZero and get ten hours of Internet service per month for\nnothing. The catch: You had to fill out a questionnaire that revealed your\n\ndemographic information and agree to put up with an onslaught of\nadvertising messages. (Today NetZero has merged with Juno and changed\nits name to United Online, and it charges $9.95 a month.)\n\nThere was even free beer on the Net. Miller Brewing gave away two\nmillion electronic coupons each good for one six-pack of any Miller beer\nbrand.\n\nThe great Internet giveaway reached its zenith when a company called Free-\nPC announced a plan to give away ten thousand Compaq computers that\npermanently display on-screen ads. More than a million people volunteered\nto take one.\n\nIf \u201cfree\u201d isn\u2019t a big enough come-on, how about \u201cpay\u201d? A number of\nWebsites offered to pay you for exposing yourself to advertising while you\nsurfed the Net.\n\nAllAdvantage.com offered to pay you fifty cents an hour (up to ten hours a\nmonth). MyPoints.com gave you either cash or points that could be\nexchanged for things like free movie rentals, gift certificates, ski-lift tickets,\neven exotic vacations. (Surf the Web today, surf Hawaii tomorrow.)\n\nMany Websites featured giveaways of one kind or another. PlanetRx.com\ngave away 672 Palm V organizers (one an hour, every day, for four weeks).\nLycos.com is a portal that had a Lucky Numbers Game you could play up to\nfour times a day. Just pick six numbers and cross your fingers. You could\nhave won one of 5,000 prizes, including a grand prize of $5 million.\n\nThe really big money was being thrown around by the CBS-backed Website\niWon.com. The portal was giving away $10,000 a day, $1 million a month,\nand a cool $10 million on tax day, April 15, 2000. (Get it? I won.)\n\nWhat the giveaway had to do with the Website remains a mystery. Unlike\nYoubet.com, iWon.com is not a gambling site. Rather, it is a portal that\noffers e-mail, search services, and online shopping, as well as content from\nCBS Websites including SportsLine USA and MarketWatch.com. All\nfinanced with $100 million of CBS money.\n\nBesides the giveaways, many sites spent a fortune on launch parties.\nPixelon.com, a California company that planned to introduce a new\nInternet-broadcast technology, raised $23 million of venture capital and\nthen promptly spent $10 million of that on a launch party. Called iBash \u201999,\nthe day-long Las Vegas party was headlined by The Who, along with other\nacts that included Kiss, Natalie Cole, the Dixie Chicks, Tony Bennett, and\nLeAnn Rimes.\n\nIt won\u2019t surprise you to learn that Pixelon.com is no longer with us. It did\nsurprise the investors, however, when they found out that the founder was a\nconvicted con artist and a fugitive from the law.\n\nThis flurry of spending was designed to attract millions of Web visitors who\ncould then be sold off to companies as advertising chattel. As a matter of\nfact, Internet operators were drooling over the advertising riches soon to fall\ntheir way. Forrester Research, a high-tech consulting firm, predicted that\nadvertising spending on the Internet would jump from $2 billion in 1999 to\n$22 billion in 2004, or 8 percent of total spending. This would mean that\nthe Internet passed the magazine medium and was neck and neck with\nradio.\n\nDon\u2019t believe a word of it. The Internet would be the first new medium that\nwill not be dominated by advertising.\n\nLet us repeat that statement. The Internet will be the first new medium that\nwill not be dominated by advertising, and the reason is simple.\n\nThe Internet is interactive. For the first time, the user is in charge, not the\nowner of the medium. The user can decide where to go, what to look at, and\nwhat to read. At many sites, the user can decide how to pick and arrange the\nmaterial to best fit that user\u2019s needs.\n\nAdvertising is not something that people look forward to. They tend to have\nan underlying resentment toward advertising. They see it as an intrusion\ninto their space, an invasion of their privacy. \u201cJunk mail\u201d is the popular\nterm for direct-mail advertising.\n\n(If magazines were interactive, the first thing readers would do is to put all\nthe editorial material up front and all the advertising in the back.)\n\nInitially, of course, people were curious about this new medium called the\nInternet. And they were happy to click on banner ads to see what the buzz\nwas all about.\n\nBut things are changing. Surveys show that the number of people who click\non Internet ads has been dropping steadily. According to\nNielsen/NetRatings, which tracks the effectiveness of Internet advertising,\nthe click rate in two years dropped from 1.35 percent to 0.3 percent.\n\nInternet advertising rates have also been dropping, not a sign of a healthy\nmedium. According to one research firm, the cost for banner ads has\ndropped from $20 per thousand last year to about $10 per thousand this\nyear.\n\nFor a number of years, the largest advertiser on the Internet has been\nGeneral Motors, which is currently spending about $50 million a year on\nWeb advertising, or about\n\n2 percent of its annual advertising budget. (All this advertising didn\u2019t help\nGM much. Its share of the domestic automobile market has declined to 27\npercent, its lowest level since the thirties.)\n\nOne indication of the user\u2019s attitude toward Internet advertising is the rapid\nrise of ad-blocking software. Known by names like At Guard, Junkbuster\nProxy, Intermute, and Web Washer, these programs work by blocking ads\nbefore they appear on the user\u2019s screen. Often they speed up computer\nperformance because they skip the files that contain ads loaded with\ngraphics, making page loading far quicker.\n\nEven the $3 billion of current Internet advertising is a dubious number. It\nincludes commissions paid to such companies as Doubleclick, the leading\nseller of advertising on the Net.\n\nDoubleclick is aptly named. Instead of the traditional advertising agency\u2019s\n15 percent commission, Doubleclick takes 35 percent to 50 percent of the\n\nInternet advertising it sells. Maybe Tripleclick would be a more appropriate\nname.\n\nNot all Internet advertising revenues represent real money either. Some sites\nswap advertising with each other, allowing each dotcom to book ad\nrevenues. (The kid who trades a $50,000 dog for two $25,000 cats isn\u2019t\nreally receiving $50,000 in revenue.)\n\nDon\u2019t be misled either by the apparent analogies with the print and\nbroadcast media. The Internet is not just another medium. If it were, it\nwould not be the revolutionary medium that many people, including us,\nbelieve it is going to be. As such, you should expect to see a revolution, not\njust a replay of the past.\n\nWas television a revolutionary new medium? Not really. Did it change your\nlife in any significant way? Not really. Even television\u2019s highly touted home\nshopping networks didn\u2019t amount to very much. \u201cRadio with pictures\u201d was\nthe judgment of many commentators.\n\nYou can\u2019t have it both ways. The Internet cannot be a revolutionary new\nmedium that operates in exactly the same way as traditional media. Where\u2019s\nthe revolution?\n\nIt\u2019s staring us in the face. The Internet is interactive, and that\u2019s the\nrevolutionary aspect of the medium. For the first time the target is in\ncharge, not the shooter. And what the target definitely does not want is\nmore advertising arrows shot in its direction.\n\nWhat people do want is information. Prices, sizes, weights, shipping dates,\nproduct comparisons. All presented in an interactive format.\n\nWe\u2019re not negative about advertising. Quite the contrary. The Internet will\ncontinue to spawn an enormous increase in advertising volume, except that\nit will be off the Net rather than on the Net. This advertising will be \u201ctune-\nin\u2019\u201d\u2014or rather \u201ctype-in\u201d\u2014advertising that will direct you to the names of\nspecific Internet sites.\n\nFor a couple of years, the Internet drove up advertising on the outernet,\nespecially on radio and television. Radio, in particular, was red-hot, with\nthree years of double-digit increases in a row.\n\nThen the dotcom disaster hit, followed by the terrorist attacks, and all\nadvertising expenditures are down. But we expect that as the economy\nimproves, advertising volume will increase, with dotcoms making a strong\ncomeback.\n\nSuper Bowl Sunday was a particular favorite of Internet advertisers. Of the\n36 companies that bought advertising time on Super Bowl XXXIV, 17, or\nalmost half, were dotcoms. The NFL extravaganza didn\u2019t come cheap,\neither. The average cost for a thirty-second commercial was more than $2\nmillion, an increase of 25 percent over Super Bowl XXXIII.\n\nThe reason the Internet has resulted in dramatic increases in outernet\nadvertising has to do with the nature of the human mind.\n\nOne of the most remarkable characteristics of the human mind is its ability\nto forget.\n\nSome things, of course, are never forgotten. A cruel insult in high school.\nGetting dumped by a lover. Being fired from a job. It all depends on the\nemotional impact of the event.\n\nA person who can remember all the details of an embarrassing event that\nhappened several decades ago might easily forget the underwear brand he\nor she put on this morning.\n\nAn Internet brand suffers from this ability of the mind to forget in two\ndifferent ways. First, the brand is invisible on a daily basis. Many brands in\nthe physical world benefit from a daily dose of visual reinforcement. Shell,\nStarbucks, Mobil, Coca-Cola, McDonald\u2019s, Tylenol. There are literally\nthousands of brands that a person will regularly see on the highways, in the\nsupermarkets, in the drugstores.\n\nAn Internet brand, on the other hand, will never suddenly appear before you\nunless you summon it to do so. Out of sight, out of mind.\n\nSecond, an Internet brand (like most brands) suffers from a lack of\nemotional involvement. Some people fall in love with their brands. Most do\nnot.\n\nFor most people a brand is nothing more than a guarantee of quality and a\nsystem for saving time. A way of making sure that the products you buy are\ndecent without having to spend an inordinate amount of time comparing\none product with another. Not too many people fall in love with a bottle of\nHeinz ketchup. Which is why Heinz needs the visibility on supermarket\nshelves and restaurant tables to keep the brand alive.\n\nWhat does an Internet brand need to do to stay alive? It also needs visibility\nin the real, or physical, world.\n\nThe best and most cost-effective way to achieve visibility is with publicity.\nThe first brand in a new Internet category is generally blessed by a blizzard\nof publicity. Amazon.com, Priceline.com, and Bluemountain.com are prime\nexamples.\n\nSome sites are capable of generating publicity on a continuing basis. The\ncrazy auctions that happen every day on eBay are an endless source of\nstories. A recent headline in the National Enquirer: \u201cHe buys $3 pickle jar\nat garage sale & sells it for $44,000.\u201d (On eBay, naturally.)\n\nThe Internet itself will spawn an enormous increase in PR activity. \u201cJust as\nnetwork TV built the advertising business,\u201d says Ray Gaulke, former\npresident of the Public Relations Society of America, \u201cthe Internet\ntechnology has the capacity to dramatically build the PR business.\u201d\n\nSooner or later, however, many Internet brands will exhaust their publicity\npotential. At this point they will need to shift their emphasis from publicity\nto advertising. How else are you going to keep an invisible Internet brand\nalive?\n\nPublicity first, advertising second is the general rule, and it applies to all\nbranding programs, especially for Internet brands. (A much more detailed\ndiscussion of the relationship between publicity and advertising is contained\nin this book under the Law of Publicity and the Law of Advertising.)\n\nAs the Internet grows up, you are going to see an explosion in outernet\nadvertising. And much of this advertising will be directed at creating\ncustomers for Internet brands.\n\nIn particular, radio will turn out to be the primary medium for dotcom\nadvertising. Radio\u2019s perceived negative, the lack of visuals, is not a\ndisadvantage for an Internet brand. There are no visual attributes of an\nInternet brand. No yellow flesh that helps identify Perdue chicken. No\nradiator grills that do the same for Mercedes-Benz automobiles. The only\nthing your mind needs to remember to log on to a site is the name.\n\nOn the Internet the name is everything. A verbal medium like radio is\nperfect for driving an Internet name into the mind. Advertising might be\nvitally important for driving prospects to your site, but once they get there\nyou can forget about using them as human fodder for your advertising\nmessages.\n\nOn the Internet, interactivity is king. Advertising is something that\nprospects put up with, not something they search out. Interactivity gives\nthem a choice, and in our opinion most people will use this choice to turn\noff the advertising and turn on the information.\n\nIf you want to build a brand on the Net, forget about trying to attract\nadvertising to your Website.\n\nMake your brand a source of information that prospects cannot find\nelsewhere. Or a place to buy things they cannot find elsewhere. Or a place\nto buy things at prices they cannot find elsewhere. Or a place to meet\npeople they cannot meet elsewhere.\n\nDon\u2019t make your site an excuse to run advertising that people have already\nseen in newspapers and magazines or heard on radio or TV.\n\nThe Internet is a revolutionary new interactive medium. And when people\ninteract with advertising, they generally turn it off.\n'. Your task is to understand the content and the underlying message of the original text, rewrite the entire thing while keeping the original meaning remains intact. Expand the content by adding relevant and additional information to make the text more comprehensive, increase the length of text to maximum, and enhance its readability and engagement without altering its fundamental purpose."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Death and taxes used to be the only certainties in life. Today you can add\none more: advertising.\n\nAdvertising messages are ubiquitous. Everywhere you turn you\u2019ll find an\nadvertising message. From television to taxicabs to T-shirts. From\nbillboards to buses to bathrooms. (Now you can\u2019t even take a leak without\nbeing exposed to advertising.) In some circles, elevators are considered the\nnext fast-rising advertising medium.\n\nEvery major auto race, golf tournament, and tennis tournament has a\ncorporate sponsor. All the bowl games are already taken, from the Hooters\nHula Bowl in Hawaii to the AT&T Rose Bowl in Pasadena to the Nokia\nSugar Bowl in New Orleans.\n\nSports arenas around the country are rapidly selling their names for\nadvertising purposes. In San Francisco, Candlestick Park is now 3Com\nStadium. The Washington Redskins\u2019 Landover Stadium is now FedEx\nField. Internet companies are also getting into the act. The Baltimore\nRavens sold the naming rights for their National Football League stadium to\nPSINet in a twenty-year deal for $105 million.\n\nBut the mother of all naming deals happened in Atlanta. Naming rights for\nthe city\u2019s new basketball and hockey stadium were sold to Philips NV ina\n\npackage deal estimated to be worth $200 million over twenty years. (The\nnew Philips Arena cost only $140.5 million to build.)\n\nWhen the name on the stadium is worth more than the physical stadium\nitself, you know that we live in an advertising-oriented world.\n\nThe traditional media, of course, have been saturated with advertising for as\nlong as we can remember.\n\nThe average magazine is 60 percent advertising. The average newspaper is\n70 percent advertising. But print media are at least partially supported by\nsubscribers. Radio and broadcast television are almost totally supported by\nthe advertising revenues they generate.\n\nAnd they generate a lot of revenue. In a recent year, advertisers spent $49\nbillion on broadcast TV advertising and $17 billion on radio advertising.\n\nCable television was once touted as the first ad-free communications\nmedium, but that didn\u2019t last very long. Today cable TV is almost as\nsaturated with advertising as regular TV.\n\nWith billions and billions of advertising dollars chasing every available\nmedium, you can\u2019t blame the Internet folks for trying to tap into this\ntreasure trove. The Internet was going to be another advertising medium,\nbut bigger and better and eventually more rewarding than television.\n\nInitially, at least, advertising supported all the commercial Websites. The\ngame plan was simple: \u201cWe will give away the content in order to draw\ntraffic, which we can then use to sell advertising.\u201d Exactly the way\ntelevision and radio currently work.\n\nSo we had free browsers, free search engines, free electronic mail, free\nelectronic greeting cards, free Internet access. Even free phone calls and\nfree tax returns.\n\nInstead of paying America Online $23.90 a month, you used to be able to\nsign up with NetZero and get ten hours of Internet service per month for\nnothing. The catch: You had to fill out a questionnaire that revealed your\n\ndemographic information and agree to put up with an onslaught of\nadvertising messages. (Today NetZero has merged with Juno and changed\nits name to United Online, and it charges $9.95 a month.)\n\nThere was even free beer on the Net. Miller Brewing gave away two\nmillion electronic coupons each good for one six-pack of any Miller beer\nbrand.\n\nThe great Internet giveaway reached its zenith when a company called Free-\nPC announced a plan to give away ten thousand Compaq computers that\npermanently display on-screen ads. More than a million people volunteered\nto take one.\n\nIf \u201cfree\u201d isn\u2019t a big enough come-on, how about \u201cpay\u201d? A number of\nWebsites offered to pay you for exposing yourself to advertising while you\nsurfed the Net.\n\nAllAdvantage.com offered to pay you fifty cents an hour (up to ten hours a\nmonth). MyPoints.com gave you either cash or points that could be\nexchanged for things like free movie rentals, gift certificates, ski-lift tickets,\neven exotic vacations. (Surf the Web today, surf Hawaii tomorrow.)\n\nMany Websites featured giveaways of one kind or another. PlanetRx.com\ngave away 672 Palm V organizers (one an hour, every day, for four weeks).\nLycos.com is a portal that had a Lucky Numbers Game you could play up to\nfour times a day. Just pick six numbers and cross your fingers. You could\nhave won one of 5,000 prizes, including a grand prize of $5 million.\n\nThe really big money was being thrown around by the CBS-backed Website\niWon.com. The portal was giving away $10,000 a day, $1 million a month,\nand a cool $10 million on tax day, April 15, 2000. (Get it? I won.)\n\nWhat the giveaway had to do with the Website remains a mystery. Unlike\nYoubet.com, iWon.com is not a gambling site. Rather, it is a portal that\noffers e-mail, search services, and online shopping, as well as content from\nCBS Websites including SportsLine USA and MarketWatch.com. All\nfinanced with $100 million of CBS money.\n\nBesides the giveaways, many sites spent a fortune on launch parties.\nPixelon.com, a California company that planned to introduce a new\nInternet-broadcast technology, raised $23 million of venture capital and\nthen promptly spent $10 million of that on a launch party. Called iBash \u201999,\nthe day-long Las Vegas party was headlined by The Who, along with other\nacts that included Kiss, Natalie Cole, the Dixie Chicks, Tony Bennett, and\nLeAnn Rimes.\n\nIt won\u2019t surprise you to learn that Pixelon.com is no longer with us. It did\nsurprise the investors, however, when they found out that the founder was a\nconvicted con artist and a fugitive from the law.\n\nThis flurry of spending was designed to attract millions of Web visitors who\ncould then be sold off to companies as advertising chattel. As a matter of\nfact, Internet operators were drooling over the advertising riches soon to fall\ntheir way. Forrester Research, a high-tech consulting firm, predicted that\nadvertising spending on the Internet would jump from $2 billion in 1999 to\n$22 billion in 2004, or 8 percent of total spending. This would mean that\nthe Internet passed the magazine medium and was neck and neck with\nradio.\n\nDon\u2019t believe a word of it. The Internet would be the first new medium that\nwill not be dominated by advertising.\n\nLet us repeat that statement. The Internet will be the first new medium that\nwill not be dominated by advertising, and the reason is simple.\n\nThe Internet is interactive. For the first time, the user is in charge, not the\nowner of the medium. The user can decide where to go, what to look at, and\nwhat to read. At many sites, the user can decide how to pick and arrange the\nmaterial to best fit that user\u2019s needs.\n\nAdvertising is not something that people look forward to. They tend to have\nan underlying resentment toward advertising. They see it as an intrusion\ninto their space, an invasion of their privacy. \u201cJunk mail\u201d is the popular\nterm for direct-mail advertising.\n\n(If magazines were interactive, the first thing readers would do is to put all\nthe editorial material up front and all the advertising in the back.)\n\nInitially, of course, people were curious about this new medium called the\nInternet. And they were happy to click on banner ads to see what the buzz\nwas all about.\n\nBut things are changing. Surveys show that the number of people who click\non Internet ads has been dropping steadily. According to\nNielsen/NetRatings, which tracks the effectiveness of Internet advertising,\nthe click rate in two years dropped from 1.35 percent to 0.3 percent.\n\nInternet advertising rates have also been dropping, not a sign of a healthy\nmedium. According to one research firm, the cost for banner ads has\ndropped from $20 per thousand last year to about $10 per thousand this\nyear.\n\nFor a number of years, the largest advertiser on the Internet has been\nGeneral Motors, which is currently spending about $50 million a year on\nWeb advertising, or about\n\n2 percent of its annual advertising budget. (All this advertising didn\u2019t help\nGM much. Its share of the domestic automobile market has declined to 27\npercent, its lowest level since the thirties.)\n\nOne indication of the user\u2019s attitude toward Internet advertising is the rapid\nrise of ad-blocking software. Known by names like At Guard, Junkbuster\nProxy, Intermute, and Web Washer, these programs work by blocking ads\nbefore they appear on the user\u2019s screen. Often they speed up computer\nperformance because they skip the files that contain ads loaded with\ngraphics, making page loading far quicker.\n\nEven the $3 billion of current Internet advertising is a dubious number. It\nincludes commissions paid to such companies as Doubleclick, the leading\nseller of advertising on the Net.\n\nDoubleclick is aptly named. Instead of the traditional advertising agency\u2019s\n15 percent commission, Doubleclick takes 35 percent to 50 percent of the\n\nInternet advertising it sells. Maybe Tripleclick would be a more appropriate\nname.\n\nNot all Internet advertising revenues represent real money either. Some sites\nswap advertising with each other, allowing each dotcom to book ad\nrevenues. (The kid who trades a $50,000 dog for two $25,000 cats isn\u2019t\nreally receiving $50,000 in revenue.)\n\nDon\u2019t be misled either by the apparent analogies with the print and\nbroadcast media. The Internet is not just another medium. If it were, it\nwould not be the revolutionary medium that many people, including us,\nbelieve it is going to be. As such, you should expect to see a revolution, not\njust a replay of the past.\n\nWas television a revolutionary new medium? Not really. Did it change your\nlife in any significant way? Not really. Even television\u2019s highly touted home\nshopping networks didn\u2019t amount to very much. \u201cRadio with pictures\u201d was\nthe judgment of many commentators.\n\nYou can\u2019t have it both ways. The Internet cannot be a revolutionary new\nmedium that operates in exactly the same way as traditional media. Where\u2019s\nthe revolution?\n\nIt\u2019s staring us in the face. The Internet is interactive, and that\u2019s the\nrevolutionary aspect of the medium. For the first time the target is in\ncharge, not the shooter. And what the target definitely does not want is\nmore advertising arrows shot in its direction.\n\nWhat people do want is information. Prices, sizes, weights, shipping dates,\nproduct comparisons. All presented in an interactive format.\n\nWe\u2019re not negative about advertising. Quite the contrary. The Internet will\ncontinue to spawn an enormous increase in advertising volume, except that\nit will be off the Net rather than on the Net. This advertising will be \u201ctune-\nin\u2019\u201d\u2014or rather \u201ctype-in\u201d\u2014advertising that will direct you to the names of\nspecific Internet sites.\n\nFor a couple of years, the Internet drove up advertising on the outernet,\nespecially on radio and television. Radio, in particular, was red-hot, with\nthree years of double-digit increases in a row.\n\nThen the dotcom disaster hit, followed by the terrorist attacks, and all\nadvertising expenditures are down. But we expect that as the economy\nimproves, advertising volume will increase, with dotcoms making a strong\ncomeback.\n\nSuper Bowl Sunday was a particular favorite of Internet advertisers. Of the\n36 companies that bought advertising time on Super Bowl XXXIV, 17, or\nalmost half, were dotcoms. The NFL extravaganza didn\u2019t come cheap,\neither. The average cost for a thirty-second commercial was more than $2\nmillion, an increase of 25 percent over Super Bowl XXXIII.\n\nThe reason the Internet has resulted in dramatic increases in outernet\nadvertising has to do with the nature of the human mind.\n\nOne of the most remarkable characteristics of the human mind is its ability\nto forget.\n\nSome things, of course, are never forgotten. A cruel insult in high school.\nGetting dumped by a lover. Being fired from a job. It all depends on the\nemotional impact of the event.\n\nA person who can remember all the details of an embarrassing event that\nhappened several decades ago might easily forget the underwear brand he\nor she put on this morning.\n\nAn Internet brand suffers from this ability of the mind to forget in two\ndifferent ways. First, the brand is invisible on a daily basis. Many brands in\nthe physical world benefit from a daily dose of visual reinforcement. Shell,\nStarbucks, Mobil, Coca-Cola, McDonald\u2019s, Tylenol. There are literally\nthousands of brands that a person will regularly see on the highways, in the\nsupermarkets, in the drugstores.\n\nAn Internet brand, on the other hand, will never suddenly appear before you\nunless you summon it to do so. Out of sight, out of mind.\n\nSecond, an Internet brand (like most brands) suffers from a lack of\nemotional involvement. Some people fall in love with their brands. Most do\nnot.\n\nFor most people a brand is nothing more than a guarantee of quality and a\nsystem for saving time. A way of making sure that the products you buy are\ndecent without having to spend an inordinate amount of time comparing\none product with another. Not too many people fall in love with a bottle of\nHeinz ketchup. Which is why Heinz needs the visibility on supermarket\nshelves and restaurant tables to keep the brand alive.\n\nWhat does an Internet brand need to do to stay alive? It also needs visibility\nin the real, or physical, world.\n\nThe best and most cost-effective way to achieve visibility is with publicity.\nThe first brand in a new Internet category is generally blessed by a blizzard\nof publicity. Amazon.com, Priceline.com, and Bluemountain.com are prime\nexamples.\n\nSome sites are capable of generating publicity on a continuing basis. The\ncrazy auctions that happen every day on eBay are an endless source of\nstories. A recent headline in the National Enquirer: \u201cHe buys $3 pickle jar\nat garage sale & sells it for $44,000.\u201d (On eBay, naturally.)\n\nThe Internet itself will spawn an enormous increase in PR activity. \u201cJust as\nnetwork TV built the advertising business,\u201d says Ray Gaulke, former\npresident of the Public Relations Society of America, \u201cthe Internet\ntechnology has the capacity to dramatically build the PR business.\u201d\n\nSooner or later, however, many Internet brands will exhaust their publicity\npotential. At this point they will need to shift their emphasis from publicity\nto advertising. How else are you going to keep an invisible Internet brand\nalive?\n\nPublicity first, advertising second is the general rule, and it applies to all\nbranding programs, especially for Internet brands. (A much more detailed\ndiscussion of the relationship between publicity and advertising is contained\nin this book under the Law of Publicity and the Law of Advertising.)\n\nAs the Internet grows up, you are going to see an explosion in outernet\nadvertising. And much of this advertising will be directed at creating\ncustomers for Internet brands.\n\nIn particular, radio will turn out to be the primary medium for dotcom\nadvertising. Radio\u2019s perceived negative, the lack of visuals, is not a\ndisadvantage for an Internet brand. There are no visual attributes of an\nInternet brand. No yellow flesh that helps identify Perdue chicken. No\nradiator grills that do the same for Mercedes-Benz automobiles. The only\nthing your mind needs to remember to log on to a site is the name.\n\nOn the Internet the name is everything. A verbal medium like radio is\nperfect for driving an Internet name into the mind. Advertising might be\nvitally important for driving prospects to your site, but once they get there\nyou can forget about using them as human fodder for your advertising\nmessages.\n\nOn the Internet, interactivity is king. Advertising is something that\nprospects put up with, not something they search out. Interactivity gives\nthem a choice, and in our opinion most people will use this choice to turn\noff the advertising and turn on the information.\n\nIf you want to build a brand on the Net, forget about trying to attract\nadvertising to your Website.\n\nMake your brand a source of information that prospects cannot find\nelsewhere. Or a place to buy things they cannot find elsewhere. Or a place\nto buy things at prices they cannot find elsewhere. Or a place to meet\npeople they cannot meet elsewhere.\n\nDon\u2019t make your site an excuse to run advertising that people have already\nseen in newspapers and magazines or heard on radio or TV.\n\nThe Internet is a revolutionary new interactive medium. And when people\ninteract with advertising, they generally turn it off.\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Below is an excerpt from my book titled 'The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding How to Build a Product or Service into a World-Class Brand ', specifically from Chapter '7 THE LAW OF GLOBALISM', Section 'The Internet will demolish all barriers,\nall boundaries, all borders.'. The original text is: 'One of the major factors driving the global economy of the nineties was the\ncollapse of communism in the late eighties. Instead of a world divided into\narmed camps, everybody was suddenly in the same boat.\n\nInstead of trading insults, the major countries of the globe started to trade\nproducts and services.\n\nBut what caused the fall of communism? In our opinion, it wasn\u2019t the\nmassive military buildup in the West, although that might have been\nnecessary for defensive purposes. In our opinion, it was television.\n\nIf you visited the USSR before its fall, you know that the population was\nunder intense publicity pressure to believe that everything was superior in\nthe Union of Socialist Soviet Republics. Free health care, jobs for all,\nhousing for everybody.\n\nTo the outsider, it wasn\u2019t true. There were a lot of rubles, but nothing to\nbuy, as one look at the mostly empty shelves in the stores would have told\nyou. Not to mention the long line whenever a store got a shipment of a\ndesirable item.\n\nSoviet authorities, of course, blocked Western newspapers and magazines\nfrom crossing their borders, but they couldn\u2019t block Western television\nsignals.\n\nTelevision brought truth to the Soviet people. When they were able to see\nthe profusion of goods and services in the Western countries, they lost their\nfaith in communism.\n\n\u201cThe medium is the message\u201d is the famous dictum of Marshall McLuhan.\nIf you define \u201cmessage\u201d simply as \u201ccontent\u201d or \u201cinformation,\u201d McLuhan\npointed out, you miss one of the most important features of any medium: its\npower to change the course and functioning of human relations and\nactivities.\n\nThe message of the television medium was \u201ccapitalism.\u201d As long as the\nSoviet Union was infiltrated by television signals from the West, there was\nno way to keep communism alive. It had to give way to a market-driven\neconomy based on a free-enterprise system. TV literally helped change the\ncourse of human history.\n\nWhat is the \u201cmessage\u201d of the Internet medium? We believe the message is\n\u201cglobalism.\u201d Ultimately, the Internet will drive the citizens of the world into\none interconnected global economy. \u201cThe global village,\u201d in Marshall\nMcLuhan\u2019s vocabulary.\n\nIt may well be that the biggest trend of the twenty-first century will turn out\nto be globalism. What the Internet hath wrought is the global village. The\nmedium, after all, is the message.\n\nAmerica, with 59 percent of all homes connected, is the dominant dog in\nInternet usage. Thirty-six percent of the world\u2019s Internet population lives in\nthe United States. But there are other countries where Internet usage is\nactually higher. Canada has 60 percent of all homes connected. Sweden has\n65 percent. If our domestic experience is any guide, usage should explode\nin every developed country of the world. When that happens, the world will\nbecome one big global marketplace.\n\nThe potential is awesome. America is by far the largest economy in the\nworld with the greatest output of goods and services and the highest\nstandard of living. Yet the United States accounts for less than 5 percent of\nthe world\u2019s population, a percentage that declines annually.\n\nIf you\u2019re a businessperson in America, where does the real opportunity lie?\nIn the domestic market or in the 95 percent of the world that doesn\u2019t live in\none of the fifty states?\n\nObviously the global market is going to be far more important than the\ndomestic market to the success of almost every American company. It\nwon\u2019t happen overnight, but it will happen.\n\nThere\u2019s a long way to go. Currently the United States exports only 11\npercent of its gross domestic product. (It also exports capital to other\ncountries, where the money is used to build plants, distribution systems, and\nmost important of all, brands.)\n\nWhat makes the American economic system so globally powerful is not the\nphysical products or the plants or the systems, it\u2019s the brands themselves:\nMicrosoft, Intel, Dell, Cisco, Coca-Cola, Hertz. These and other American\nbrands dominate a host of categories on the worldwide scene.\n\nThis is not a one-way street, however. The Internet is not just an\nopportunity to export American brands and American cultures overseas.\nThe opposite is also likely to happen. It\u2019s already happened in many\ncategories.\n\n\u00a2 While McDonald\u2019s has carried American fast food around the world,\nthe truth is that a large number of Americans are eating Italian,\nMexican, Chinese, French, and Japanese food.\n\n\u00a2 While Disney has just signed a deal for a new theme park in Hong\nKong, the truth is that the most popular characters among the kiddie\ncrowd in America are not Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck. They\u2019re\nPok\u00e9mon characters from Japan.\n\n\u00a2 Starbucks is a European-style coffee house blended with an American\nbrand name.\n\n\u00a2 Evian from France started the trend toward branded bottled water,\nwhich has become an enormous category in the United States.\n\n\u00a2 Volkswagen from Germany and Toyota from Japan started the trend\ntoward small cars in America.\n\n\u00a2 Mercedes-Benz and BMW from Germany started the trend toward\nsmall ultraluxury cars in the U.S.\n\n\u00a2 At the high end of the market, wine from France, watches from\nSwitzerland, and clothing from Italy have had a major impact in the\nAmerican market.\n\nAmerica has always been a melting pot for people, but it has also become a\nmelting pot for products from around the world. With the rise of the\nInternet, that trend is going to accelerate. The medium is the message.\n\nMany Websites here in America already do a considerable amount of\nbusiness outside the United States. With the purchase of two European\ncompetitors, Amazon.com has become the leading online bookseller in the\nUK and Germany. Sales outside the United States currently account for 22\npercent of Amazon\u2019s sales.\n\nThis is a drop in the bucket. The potential is much, much greater. What the\npostal service did for the Sears, Roebuck catalog, the Internet will do for the\nAmerican business community. Or, for that matter, any business operating\nin any country anywhere in the world. The Internet turns the world into one\ngiant shopping mall.\n\nBut like in any shopping mall, you can\u2019t win with just a better product or\nservice. You need a better brand.\n\nThe long-term winners on the Internet will be those brands that can\ntranscend borders. This is another knock on generic names.\n\nWhat does Furniture.com mean in South America? It certainly doesn\u2019t\nmean muebles, the Spanish word for furniture. Or mobilidrio, the\nPortuguese word for the same thing.\n\nAmazon.com means books in virtually every country of the world. But\nBooks.com means books only in the 6 percent of the world where English is\nthe native language.\n\nAs the world moves toward a global marketplace, won\u2019t companies need to\nget rid of their national identities and move toward brands with global\nidentities?\n\nNot necessarily. Every brand, including global brands, needs to come from\nsomewhere. In other words, even a global brand needs a national identity.\n\n\u00a2 Burger King is a global brand with an American identity.\n\u00a2 Volvo is a global brand with a Swedish identity.\n\n\u00a2 Rolex is a global brand with a Swiss identity.\n\nLike a person, every brand needs to come from somewhere. No matter\nwhere the brand is made, marketed, or sold.\n\nA Nissan made in America by American workers is still a Japanese brand of\nautomobile. A Nike made in Malaysia by Malaysian workers is still an\nAmerican athletic-shoe brand.\n\nWhat\u2019s more important, the product or the brand? The fact that a product\ncan maintain a national identity when the product in question has never set\nfoot in that country should tell you that the brand is more important.\n\nGlobal brand builders should keep in mind that national identity is a two-\nedged sword. It can help or hurt your brand, depending upon the category.\n\nAmerican personal computers (built in Asia or with Asian parts) are\npowerful brands on the global marketplace. American automobiles, no\nmatter where they are built, are mediocre brands everywhere except in\nAmerica.\n\nWhat the global market is telling us is that Americans know how to build\ncomputers but don\u2019t know how to build cars. Is it true? It doesn\u2019t matter.\nWhen it comes to building brands, perception is more important than\nreality.\n\nIt\u2019s hard enough to change the perception of a company. It\u2019s impossible for\none company to change the perception of a country. When you launch your\n\nInternet brand, you should try to match your product or service with your\ncountry\u2019s perception.\n\n\u00a2 If we wanted to set up a clothing site on the Internet, we would\nprobably move to Italy and give the site an Italian name.\n\n\u00a2 If we wanted to sell wine on the Net, we would move to France.\n\n\u00a2 If we wanted to sell watches on the Net, we would move to\nSwitzerland.\n\nAt least that\u2019s the theory. In practice it\u2019s different. Knowing something\nabout government regulations for wine in France, we would probably\nchoose Chile or Australia instead.\n\nDon\u2019t overlook the less developed countries of the world. These nations\nrepresent tremendous opportunities for global brand builders wherever they\nare located. In the less developed countries, retail margins are often higher,\nfewer products are available, and even fewer products are on display.\n\nFor people in some of these countries, many Internet sites will look like the\nSears, Roebuck catalog at Wal-Mart prices.\n\nIs it unfair to take advantage of people in developing nations? If offering a\nbetter selection of better products at lower prices is unfair, then we don\u2019t\nknow the meaning of the word.\n\nShipping the products (or perhaps we should say \u201cflying\u201d the products) isn\u2019t\ngoing to be the problem you might think it is. The postal service will\nairmail a copy of the book you are reading to an address in Europe for less\nthan $10, which is about the retail margin of this book in a domestic\nbookstore. And costs are bound to come down dramatically as globalism\ncatches fire and demand for air shipments soars.\n\nOne real barrier to globalism is red tape\u2014taxes, duties, customs forms, and\npaperwork in general. These are the things that are going to clog up the\nsystem and slow it down. But you can\u2019t stop progress. In time, the paper\nbarriers will come down, too.\n\nAnother barrier to globalism is language. The first decision a global brand\nbuilder must make is the language question. Do you use English, or do you\ntranslate your site into various different languages? Do you set up totally\ndifferent sites for different countries? Yahoo! launched Yahoo! en Espajiol\nin 1998 and Yahoo! Brazil in 1999. Today Yahoo! has twenty-three\ndifferent country sites.\n\nThe translation problem can be daunting. How many different languages\nand/or countries sites should you develop? There are literally thousands of\nlanguages in use by the 6 billion people in the world. If you count only the\nlanguages used by a significant number of people (say a million or more),\nthere are still 220 different languages. To be a truly global brand, you would\nneed Websites in a substantial percentage of those 220 languages.\n\nComplicating this decision is the long-term trend toward English as the\nsecond language of the world. In many countries, English is already the\nlanguage of business.\n\n(The Scandinavian region of a European company, for example, will\ninevitably hold its meetings in English. Representatives from Norway,\nSweden, Finland, and Denmark may not understand one another when they\nspeak their native languages, but they all know English.)\n\nIn the long term you are likely to find successful examples of both single-\nlanguage and multiple-language sites. Either strategy can work. It all\ndepends upon the type of product or the type of service offered.\n\nFor high-tech products and services or for brands appealing to the high-end\nsegment of the market, the single-language strategy might be best.\nCisco.com is an example.\n\nFor low-tech products and services or for brands appealing to the\nmainstream market, a multiple-language strategy might be best. Yahoo! en\nEspafiol is an example.\n\n(While the thinking at Yahoo! is sound, one part of its strategy is flawed.\nThe line extension name creates the impression that Yahoo! en Espajiol is\nnot an authentic brand. Rather, it\u2019s a gringo brand in disguise.)\n\nKeep in mind, however, a basic tenet of marketing: There is never only one\nway to do anything. Most people prefer brands, but there is still a market\nfor private labels. Most people prefer specialty stores, but there still is a\nmarket for department stores. Most people prefer caffeinated cola, regular\nbeer, and coffee, but there is still a market for decaffeinated cola, light beer,\nand tea.\n\nWhichever language decision you make, you can be sure there will be at\nleast one competitor going in the opposite direction. So be it. You can\u2019t\nappeal to everyone. There is never only one way to do anything.\n\nIf you must err, however, err on the side of an English-only site. It will\nseem more upscale and chic. Time will also be on your side. Every day\nmore than ten thousand people in non-English-speaking countries learn to\nspeak the English language. Furthermore, English is the language of more\nthan 80 percent of the information stored on computers.\n\nThere is also a worldwide trend toward the use of English-sounding brand\nnames, even when those brands are sold primarily in non-English-speaking\ncountries.\n\n\u00a2 Hollywood is a brand name for a Brazilian cigarette and also for a\nFrench chewing gum.\n\u00a2 Montana is a brand name for a Mexican cigarette.\n\n\u00a2 Red Bull is a brand name for an Austrian energy drink that has become\na worldwide brand.\n\n\u00a2 Boxman is a brand name for a Swedish online music company.\n\n\u00a2 StarMedia is a brand name for a Spanish- and Portuguese-language\nWeb portal.\n\nTake a walk down the main shopping street of almost any major city in the\nworld. A substantial number of locally owned stores selling locally made\ngoods mostly to local people will have English names.\n\nIn Copenhagen, for example, we noticed that about half the stores on the\nmain shopping street use English names. Some of these are franchise\noperations like McDonald\u2019s, Subway, and Athlete\u2019s Foot. But most are\nlocally owned stores with names like Inspiration, Planet Football, and\nLondon House.\n\nIn a Tel Aviv mall, we noticed five stores in a row with the following\nnames: Gold Shop, Happy Tie, Happytime, Royalty, and Make Up Forever.\n\nThe trend to English names will obviously benefit all U.S. brands. Before\nyou decide to go with a multiple-language approach, ask yourself whether\nthis trend will make a single-language (English) approach your best overall\nchoice for the future.\n\nSome people think that globalism will be more of a cultural problem than a\nlanguage problem. That you have to adapt your product or service to the\ncultures of the countries you are going to sell in. We disagree.\n\nHow did Coca-Cola, McDonald\u2019s, Levi Strauss, and Subway adapt their\nbrands to local cultural standards? They didn\u2019t, and they greatly benefited\nbecause they didn\u2019t.\n\nThe medium is the message. And the message is the homogenization of\ncultures around the world. That\u2019s what globalism is all about. That\u2019s neither\ngood nor bad. That\u2019s a fact.\n\nWhen StarMedia was trying to raise capital to launch the first global\nInternet portal in Spanish and Portuguese, the company got the usual\narguments.\n\n\u201cLatinos like to have personal contact with each other. Nobody\u2019s going to\nchat online. People want to talk on the phone. Latin Americans are so\ndifferent from each other, no Argentine will ever want to talk to somebody\nfrom Peru.\u201d\n\nStarMedia, of course, became a roaring success. Latinos did learn to chat\nonline. People are more alike than different, even though the culture crowd\nlikes to pretend otherwise.\n\nGlobalism has benefited from a number of technological developments,\nnotably the jet plane and the facsimile machine. But these developments\npale in comparison with the changes the Internet will bring.\n\nSo fasten your seat belts and get ready for the ride of your life.\n'.

Instead of a world divided into\narmed camps, everybody was suddenly in the same boat.\n\nInstead of trading insults, the major countries of the globe started to trade\nproducts and services.\n\nBut what caused the fall of communism? In our opinion, it wasn\u2019t the\nmassive military buildup in the West, although that might have been\nnecessary for defensive purposes. In our opinion, it was television.\n\nIf you visited the USSR before its fall, you know that the population was\nunder intense publicity pressure to believe that everything was superior in\nthe Union of Socialist Soviet Republics. Free health care, jobs for all,\nhousing for everybody.\n\nTo the outsider, it wasn\u2019t true. There were a lot of rubles, but nothing to\nbuy, as one look at the mostly empty shelves in the stores would have told\nyou. Not to mention the long line whenever a store got a shipment of a\ndesirable item.\n\nSoviet authorities, of course, blocked Western newspapers and magazines\nfrom crossing their borders, but they couldn\u2019t block Western television\nsignals.\n\nTelevision brought truth to the Soviet people. When they were able to see\nthe profusion of goods and services in the Western countries, they lost their\nfaith in communism.\n\n\u201cThe medium is the message\u201d is the famous dictum of Marshall McLuhan.\nIf you define \u201cmessage\u201d simply as \u201ccontent\u201d or \u201cinformation,\u201d McLuhan\npointed out, you miss one of the most important features of any medium: its\npower to change the course and functioning of human relations and\nactivities.\n\nThe message of the television medium was \u201ccapitalism.\u201d As long as the\nSoviet Union was infiltrated by television signals from the West, there was\nno way to keep communism alive. It had to give way to a market-driven\neconomy based on a free-enterprise system. TV literally helped change the\ncourse of human history.\n\nWhat is the \u201cmessage\u201d of the Internet medium? We believe the message is\n\u201cglobalism.\u201d Ultimately, the Internet will drive the citizens of the world into\none interconnected global economy. \u201cThe global village,\u201d in Marshall\nMcLuhan\u2019s vocabulary.\n\nIt may well be that the biggest trend of the twenty-first century will turn out\nto be globalism. What the Internet hath wrought is the global village. The\nmedium, after all, is the message.\n\nAmerica, with 59 percent of all homes connected, is the dominant dog in\nInternet usage. Thirty-six percent of the world\u2019s Internet population lives in\nthe United States. But there are other countries where Internet usage is\nactually higher. Canada has 60 percent of all homes connected. Sweden has\n65 percent. If our domestic experience is any guide, usage should explode\nin every developed country of the world. When that happens, the world will\nbecome one big global marketplace.\n\nThe potential is awesome. America is by far the largest economy in the\nworld with the greatest output of goods and services and the highest\nstandard of living. Yet the United States accounts for less than 5 percent of\nthe world\u2019s population, a percentage that declines annually.\n\nIf you\u2019re a businessperson in America, where does the real opportunity lie?\nIn the domestic market or in the 95 percent of the world that doesn\u2019t live in\none of the fifty states?\n\nObviously the global market is going to be far more important than the\ndomestic market to the success of almost every American company. It\nwon\u2019t happen overnight, but it will happen.\n\nThere\u2019s a long way to go. Currently the United States exports only 11\npercent of its gross domestic product. (It also exports capital to other\ncountries, where the money is used to build plants, distribution systems, and\nmost important of all, brands.)\n\nWhat makes the American economic system so globally powerful is not the\nphysical products or the plants or the systems, it\u2019s the brands themselves:\nMicrosoft, Intel, Dell, Cisco, Coca-Cola, Hertz. These and other American\nbrands dominate a host of categories on the worldwide scene.\n\nThis is not a one-way street, however. The Internet is not just an\nopportunity to export American brands and American cultures overseas.\nThe opposite is also likely to happen. It\u2019s already happened in many\ncategories.\n\n\u00a2 While McDonald\u2019s has carried American fast food around the world,\nthe truth is that a large number of Americans are eating Italian,\nMexican, Chinese, French, and Japanese food.\n\n\u00a2 While Disney has just signed a deal for a new theme park in Hong\nKong, the truth is that the most popular characters among the kiddie\ncrowd in America are not Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck. They\u2019re\nPok\u00e9mon characters from Japan.\n\n\u00a2 Starbucks is a European-style coffee house blended with an American\nbrand name.\n\n\u00a2 Evian from France started the trend toward branded bottled water,\nwhich has become an enormous category in the United States.\n\n\u00a2 Volkswagen from Germany and Toyota from Japan started the trend\ntoward small cars in America.\n\n\u00a2 Mercedes-Benz and BMW from Germany started the trend toward\nsmall ultraluxury cars in the U.S.\n\n\u00a2 At the high end of the market, wine from France, watches from\nSwitzerland, and clothing from Italy have had a major impact in the\nAmerican market.\n\nAmerica has always been a melting pot for people, but it has also become a\nmelting pot for products from around the world. With the rise of the\nInternet, that trend is going to accelerate. The medium is the message.\n\nMany Websites here in America already do a considerable amount of\nbusiness outside the United States. With the purchase of two European\ncompetitors, Amazon.com has become the leading online bookseller in the\nUK and Germany. Sales outside the United States currently account for 22\npercent of Amazon\u2019s sales.\n\nThis is a drop in the bucket. The potential is much, much greater. What the\npostal service did for the Sears, Roebuck catalog, the Internet will do for the\nAmerican business community. Or, for that matter, any business operating\nin any country anywhere in the world. The Internet turns the world into one\ngiant shopping mall.\n\nBut like in any shopping mall, you can\u2019t win with just a better product or\nservice. You need a better brand.\n\nThe long-term winners on the Internet will be those brands that can\ntranscend borders. This is another knock on generic names.\n\nWhat does Furniture.com mean in South America? It certainly doesn\u2019t\nmean muebles, the Spanish word for furniture. Or mobilidrio, the\nPortuguese word for the same thing.\n\nAmazon.com means books in virtually every country of the world. But\nBooks.com means books only in the 6 percent of the world where English is\nthe native language.\n\nAs the world moves toward a global marketplace, won\u2019t companies need to\nget rid of their national identities and move toward brands with global\nidentities?\n\nNot necessarily. Every brand, including global brands, needs to come from\nsomewhere. In other words, even a global brand needs a national identity.\n\n\u00a2 Burger King is a global brand with an American identity.\n\u00a2 Volvo is a global brand with a Swedish identity.\n\n\u00a2 Rolex is a global brand with a Swiss identity.\n\nLike a person, every brand needs to come from somewhere. No matter\nwhere the brand is made, marketed, or sold.\n\nA Nissan made in America by American workers is still a Japanese brand of\nautomobile. A Nike made in Malaysia by Malaysian workers is still an\nAmerican athletic-shoe brand.\n\nWhat\u2019s more important, the product or the brand? The fact that a product\ncan maintain a national identity when the product in question has never set\nfoot in that country should tell you that the brand is more important.\n\nGlobal brand builders should keep in mind that national identity is a two-\nedged sword. It can help or hurt your brand, depending upon the category.\n\nAmerican personal computers (built in Asia or with Asian parts) are\npowerful brands on the global marketplace. American automobiles, no\nmatter where they are built, are mediocre brands everywhere except in\nAmerica.\n\nWhat the global market is telling us is that Americans know how to build\ncomputers but don\u2019t know how to build cars. Is it true? It doesn\u2019t matter.\nWhen it comes to building brands, perception is more important than\nreality.\n\nIt\u2019s hard enough to change the perception of a company. It\u2019s impossible for\none company to change the perception of a country. When you launch your\n\nInternet brand, you should try to match your product or service with your\ncountry\u2019s perception.\n\n\u00a2 If we wanted to set up a clothing site on the Internet, we would\nprobably move to Italy and give the site an Italian name.\n\n\u00a2 If we wanted to sell wine on the Net, we would move to France.\n\n\u00a2 If we wanted to sell watches on the Net, we would move to\nSwitzerland.\n\nAt least that\u2019s the theory. In practice it\u2019s different. Knowing something\nabout government regulations for wine in France, we would probably\nchoose Chile or Australia instead.\n\nDon\u2019t overlook the less developed countries of the world. These nations\nrepresent tremendous opportunities for global brand builders wherever they\nare located. In the less developed countries, retail margins are often higher,\nfewer products are available, and even fewer products are on display.\n\nFor people in some of these countries, many Internet sites will look like the\nSears, Roebuck catalog at Wal-Mart prices.\n\nIs it unfair to take advantage of people in developing nations? If offering a\nbetter selection of better products at lower prices is unfair, then we don\u2019t\nknow the meaning of the word.\n\nShipping the products (or perhaps we should say \u201cflying\u201d the products) isn\u2019t\ngoing to be the problem you might think it is. The postal service will\nairmail a copy of the book you are reading to an address in Europe for less\nthan $10, which is about the retail margin of this book in a domestic\nbookstore. And costs are bound to come down dramatically as globalism\ncatches fire and demand for air shipments soars.\n\nOne real barrier to globalism is red tape\u2014taxes, duties, customs forms, and\npaperwork in general. These are the things that are going to clog up the\nsystem and slow it down. But you can\u2019t stop progress. In time, the paper\nbarriers will come down, too.\n\nAnother barrier to globalism is language. The first decision a global brand\nbuilder must make is the language question. Do you use English, or do you\ntranslate your site into various different languages? Do you set up totally\ndifferent sites for different countries? Yahoo! launched Yahoo! en Espajiol\nin 1998 and Yahoo! Brazil in 1999. Today Yahoo! has twenty-three\ndifferent country sites.\n\nThe translation problem can be daunting. How many different languages\nand/or countries sites should you develop? There are literally thousands of\nlanguages in use by the 6 billion people in the world. If you count only the\nlanguages used by a significant number of people (say a million or more),\nthere are still 220 different languages. To be a truly global brand, you would\nneed Websites in a substantial percentage of those 220 languages.\n\nComplicating this decision is the long-term trend toward English as the\nsecond language of the world. In many countries, English is already the\nlanguage of business.\n\n(The Scandinavian region of a European company, for example, will\ninevitably hold its meetings in English. Representatives from Norway,\nSweden, Finland, and Denmark may not understand one another when they\nspeak their native languages, but they all know English.)\n\nIn the long term you are likely to find successful examples of both single-\nlanguage and multiple-language sites. Either strategy can work. It all\ndepends upon the type of product or the type of service offered.\n\nFor high-tech products and services or for brands appealing to the high-end\nsegment of the market, the single-language strategy might be best.\nCisco.com is an example.\n\nFor low-tech products and services or for brands appealing to the\nmainstream market, a multiple-language strategy might be best. Yahoo! en\nEspafiol is an example.\n\n(While the thinking at Yahoo! is sound, one part of its strategy is flawed.\nThe line extension name creates the impression that Yahoo! en Espajiol is\nnot an authentic brand. Rather, it\u2019s a gringo brand in disguise.)\n\nKeep in mind, however, a basic tenet of marketing: There is never only one\nway to do anything. Most people prefer brands, but there is still a market\nfor private labels. Most people prefer specialty stores, but there still is a\nmarket for department stores. Most people prefer caffeinated cola, regular\nbeer, and coffee, but there is still a market for decaffeinated cola, light beer,\nand tea.\n\nWhichever language decision you make, you can be sure there will be at\nleast one competitor going in the opposite direction. So be it. You can\u2019t\nappeal to everyone. There is never only one way to do anything.\n\nIf you must err, however, err on the side of an English-only site. It will\nseem more upscale and chic.

Below is an excerpt from my book titled 'The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding How to Build a Product or Service into a World-Class Brand ', specifically from Chapter '8 THE LAW OF TIME', Section 'Just do it. You have to be fast. You have\nto be first. You have to be focused.'. The original text is: 'Haste makes waste, but waste is often the most important ingredient in a\nsuccessful Internet launch.\n\nIf you want to be successful in business . . . in branding . . . in life. . . you\nhave to get into the mind first. Notice we said \u201cmind,\u201d not \u201cmarketplace.\u201d\n\nBeing first in the marketplace doesn\u2019t buy you anything except a license to\ntry to get in the mind first. If you throw away that opportunity by being too\nconcerned with getting all the details right, you\u2019ll never get it back.\n(Perfection in infinite time is worth nothing.)\n\nWhat many managers are calling \u201cthe first-mover advantage\u201d is a myth.\nThere is no automatic advantage to being the first mover in a category\nunless you can make effective use of the extra time to work your way into\nthe prospect\u2019s mind.\n\nA strategy that many large companies use effectively is to quickly jump on\nan idea developed by a smaller company. With its greater resources, the\nlarger company can often win \u201cthe battle of the mind\u201d and create the\nperception that it was first in the marketplace.\n\nIf you are the CEO of a smaller company, beware. You need to move\nexceptionally fast. Be quick or be dead. Marketplace Darwinism is survival\nof the fastest.\n\nFirst in the mind doesn\u2019t mean \u201cearly\u201d in the mind either. Too many\ncompanies are satisfied with being \u201cone of the first\u201d brands in the category.\nThat\u2019s not the same as getting into the mind first and creating the perception\nthat you are the leader.\n\n\u00a2 Yahoo! was introduced in 1994 as the first search engine on the\nInternet. Today Yahoo! is the leading search engine and second only to\nAOL in the rankings of most-visited Websites.\n\n\u00a2 eBay was introduced in 1995 as the first auction site on the Internet.\nToday eBay is by far the leading auction site on the Net, with 264\nmillion items listed for sale last year in some eight thousand product\ncategories.\n\n\u00a2 Amazon.com was introduced in 1995 as the first bookstore on the\nInternet. Currently the company sells almost $2 billion dollars\u2019 worth\nof books a year, many times that of its nearest competitor,\nBarnesandnoble.com. Jeff Bezos, Amazon.com\u2019s founder, was named\nTime magazine\u2019s person of the year for 1999.\n\n\u00a2 Bluemountain.com was introduced in 1996 as the first electronic\ngreeting-card site. Currently the site receives 10 million unique visitors\na month, more than all its competitors combined. The site was sold for\n$780 million to Excite @ Home, who recently resold it to American\nGreetings.\n\n\u00a2 Priceline.com was introduced in 1998 as the first company to sell\nairline tickets on the Internet with a \u201cname-your-own-price\u201d bidding\nsystem. Today Priceline.com is far and away the leading site on the\nWeb for discount airline tickets and hotel rooms. Every seven seconds,\nsomeone names their own price at Priceline.com.\n\nFive companies, five brands, five Internet \u201cfirsts.\u201d And five market leaders\nwhose brands dominate their categories.\n\nWere Yahoo!, eBay, Amazon.com, Bluemountain.com, and Priceline.com\nliterally first in their categories? Amazon.com was not, and we\u2019re not sure\nabout the other four.\n\nWhat you can be sure about is that the ideas for these sites occurred to\nmany other people at about the same time. History shows that ideas tend to\narrive in a variety of minds at approximately the same time.\n\nThe automobile was \u201cinvented\u201d in Germany at about the same time as\nentrepreneurs in France, England, Italy, and America were working on\nmany of the same self-propelled concepts.\n\nThe airplane was \u201cinvented\u201d in America, but many French people thought\nthe airplane was invented in France until they read about the Wright\nbrothers accomplishing the same feat several years earlier.\n\nWould we still think the world is flat if it weren\u2019t for Christopher\nColumbus? Of course not. Somebody else would have discovered America\nand realized the world was round.\n\nWould we still be communicating with smoke signals if it weren\u2019t for\nAlexander Graham Bell? Of course not. Somebody else would have\ninvented the telephone.\n\nWould we still be using Thermofax copiers if it weren\u2019t for Chester\nCarlson? Of course not. Somebody else would have invented xerography.\n\nThere\u2019s a big difference between having an idle thought on a Sunday\nafternoon and having a successful brand on the Internet on Monday\nmorning. Ideas (and those idle thoughts that initiate them) are a dime a\ndozen. It takes hard work and, even more important, a sense of urgency to\nput an idea to work on the Net.\n\nYou can\u2019t dawdle. By this we mean endless testing, focus groups, market\nsurveys. This is a particular problem for an Internet brand.\n\nWhy were most of the successful Internet sites launched by small, venture-\ncapital-backed companies rather than Fortune 500 firms? A big company\nhates to do anything without first amassing a mound of market research.\n\nThe Internet is moving too fast to be measured. It\u2019s a new industry.\nKnowledge is scarce. Few people know what they want, what they would\n\nuse, what they would be willing to pay for . . . until they are given a real-\nworld choice.\n\nBig companies often fail to exploit new opportunities because they are\n\u201cperfectionists.\u201d They won\u2019t release a new product, a new service, or an\nInternet site \u201cuntil we get it right.\u201d\n\nGetting it right makes no sense from a branding point of view. Anything\nworth doing is worth doing in a half-assed way. Anything not worth doing\nis not worth doing in a perfect way.\n\nTake Yahoo!, the most valuable brand on the Internet. Yahoo! is basically a\nsearch engine. It will find whatever you want to find on the Internet.\n\nYahoo! is the top search engine in almost every major country in the world.\nIt generates 40 percent of all search referrals worldwide.\n\nDid Yahoo! develop its own search-engine technology? No. In order to\nmove rapidly, it outsourced its search-engine technology, first from Open\nSource, then from AltaVista, before finally settling on Inktomi.\n\nThe leading search engine didn\u2019t develop its own search-engine\ntechnology? Does that surprise you? It shouldn\u2019t. You don\u2019t win by being\nbetter. You win by being first. Yahoo! succeeded because they \u201crushed the\nnet.\u201d\n\nOne of the abiding myths of American business is that you win by being\nbetter. Management commits billions of dollars in their search for better\nproducts or services to market. They \u201cbenchmark\u201d their existing products\nand services against their major competitors. No new product or service\ngets launched unless it has a significant, tangible advantage.\n\nResult: Nine out of ten new products fail. Why? Not, in our opinion,\nbecause of a quality deficiency. It\u2019s because of a timing deficiency. They\ndidn\u2019t get that new product or service out in the marketplace fast enough.\n\nBig companies often lack a sense of urgency when it comes to introducing\nnew products or new ideas. Sometimes you can detect that in their public\n\nstatements. \u201cMaybe we are relatively late,\u201d said Rupert Murdoch, CEO of\nNews Corp., when he recently announced the company\u2019s first Internet\ninvestment, \u201cbut only by a year or two.\u201d\n\nOnly by a year or two? In less than two years, Priceline.com went from\nnothing to market leadership of a new category on the Internet.\n\nCarpe diem. Where would Microsoft be today if Bill Gates hadn\u2019t dropped\nout of Harvard in his freshman year to go to Albuquerque, New Mexico, to\ndevelop an operating system for the world\u2019s first personal computer?\n\nCarpe diem. Where would Dell Computer be today if Michael Dell hadn\u2019t\ndropped out of the University of Texas in his sophomore year to start a\ncompany selling computers directly to businesses.\n\nCarpe diem. Today is the best day of your life to launch an Internet\ncompany based on a new idea or concept. One that nobody else is using.\n\nHave you ever heard of NorthernLight.com? You\u2019re not alone. More than\n99 percent of Web users are not familiar with the site.\n\nNorthern Light Technology LLC was the largest search engine on the\nInternet, in the sense that it indexed some 330 million Web pages. That\u2019s far\nmore than Yahoo!, Excite, Lycos, or Infoseek. Plus Northern Light\ncompiled the contents of some six thousand full-text sources such as\nbusiness magazines, trade journals, medical publications, investment\ndatabases, and news wires.\n\nThe problem wasn\u2019t the site. The problem was the timing. Northern Light\ndidn\u2019t get tuned on until three years after the Yahoo! launch. That\u2019s much\ntoo late. Not only was Yahoo! gathering momentum, but the new search site\nalso had to compete with AltaVista, Excite, Infoseek, and Lycos.\n\nThe problem wasn\u2019t the money. Northern Light was financed with $50\nmillion in venture capital, far more than Yahoo! had to work with.\n\nIt\u2019s bad enough to start in second place. It\u2019s worse to start at the back of the\npack. In many situations it\u2019s almost hopeless.\n\nSo what do you do if you\u2019re late? Too many managers put on their Avis hats\nand say \u201cWe have to try harder.\u201d Not good enough. (Remember the Law of\nSingularity.)\n\nParadoxically, it\u2019s never too late. But you can\u2019t launch in the year 2003 a\ngreat idea, circa 1995. If you get into the game late, you have to narrow\nyour focus. Michael Dell was late, very late, into personal computers. So he\ndecided to focus on selling personal computers by telephone. A good\nstrategy. Today Dell Computer is the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of\npersonal computers.\n\nMichael Dell didn\u2019t make the same mistake when the Internet arrived. His\ncompany was the first to sell personal computers on the Web. Also a good\nstrategy.\n\nNor is it ever enough just to move rapidly without a basically good idea.\nTime Warner was one of the first companies to set up an Internet site.\nHence the name, Pathfinder.\n\nBut what\u2019s a Pathfinder? At first the site was nothing more than a collection\nof information pulled from various Time Warner magazines: Time, People,\nFortune, Money, Entertainment Weekly, and others. After the purchase of\nTurner Broadcasting System, the company added CNN, CNNsi and CNNfn\nto the site. They even managed to sell American Express on listing Travel\n& Leisure magazine on the site as well as Asia Week, a Hong Kong\npublication, now deceased.\n\nAfter investing a reported $75 million in the site, Time Warner recently shut\nit down. What\u2019s a Pathfinder? The only meaning the name had was that it\nwas a site for Time Warner publications. But few people care who publishes\na magazine (unless John F. Kennedy Jr. is involved, and as soon as he was\ngone, George magazine was gone, too). They only care about the magazine\nitself.\n\nNobody reads Fortune because Time Warner publishes it. They read\nFortune in spite of the fact that Time Warner publishes it. The name of the\ncompany that publishes the magazine is irrelevant to the average reader.\nFortune is the brand, not Time Warner.\n\nAfter Time Wamer gave up on Pathfinder, the company retreated to\nindividual sites for each of its major publications. Also not a good strategy.\n(Line-extension sites of magazine brands might be good for selling a few\nsubscriptions, but they are not the way to build a powerful presence on the\nWeb.)\n\nTime Warner bills itself as the \u201cworld\u2019s foremost media company.\u201d How\ncould two yahoos from Stanford beat the world\u2019s foremost media company?\n\nEasy. All you need to do is to get your strategy right and your timing right.\nBoth are required. One without the other won\u2019t work.\n\nP.S.: You probably noticed that it was AOL that took over Time Warner and\nnot vice versa.\n'. Your task is to understand the content and the underlying message of the original text, rewrite the entire thing while keeping the original meaning remains intact. Expand the content by adding relevant and additional information to make the text more comprehensive, increase the length of text to maximum, and enhance its readability and engagement without altering its fundamental purpose."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Haste makes waste, but waste is often the most important ingredient in a\nsuccessful Internet launch.\n\nIf you want to be successful in business . . . in branding . . . in life. . . you\nhave to get into the mind first. Notice we said \u201cmind,\u201d not \u201cmarketplace.\u201d\n\nBeing first in the marketplace doesn\u2019t buy you anything except a license to\ntry to get in the mind first. If you throw away that opportunity by being too\nconcerned with getting all the details right, you\u2019ll never get it back.\n(Perfection in infinite time is worth nothing.)\n\nWhat many managers are calling \u201cthe first-mover advantage\u201d is a myth.\nThere is no automatic advantage to being the first mover in a category\nunless you can make effective use of the extra time to work your way into\nthe prospect\u2019s mind.\n\nA strategy that many large companies use effectively is to quickly jump on\nan idea developed by a smaller company. With its greater resources, the\nlarger company can often win \u201cthe battle of the mind\u201d and create the\nperception that it was first in the marketplace.\n\nIf you are the CEO of a smaller company, beware. You need to move\nexceptionally fast. Be quick or be dead. Marketplace Darwinism is survival\nof the fastest.\n\nFirst in the mind doesn\u2019t mean \u201cearly\u201d in the mind either. Too many\ncompanies are satisfied with being \u201cone of the first\u201d brands in the category.\nThat\u2019s not the same as getting into the mind first and creating the perception\nthat you are the leader.\n\n\u00a2 Yahoo! was introduced in 1994 as the first search engine on the\nInternet. Today Yahoo! is the leading search engine and second only to\nAOL in the rankings of most-visited Websites.\n\n\u00a2 eBay was introduced in 1995 as the first auction site on the Internet.\nToday eBay is by far the leading auction site on the Net, with 264\nmillion items listed for sale last year in some eight thousand product\ncategories.\n\n\u00a2 Amazon.com was introduced in 1995 as the first bookstore on the\nInternet. Currently the company sells almost $2 billion dollars\u2019 worth\nof books a year, many times that of its nearest competitor,\nBarnesandnoble.com. Jeff Bezos, Amazon.com\u2019s founder, was named\nTime magazine\u2019s person of the year for 1999.\n\n\u00a2 Bluemountain.com was introduced in 1996 as the first electronic\ngreeting-card site. Currently the site receives 10 million unique visitors\na month, more than all its competitors combined. The site was sold for\n$780 million to Excite @ Home, who recently resold it to American\nGreetings.\n\n\u00a2 Priceline.com was introduced in 1998 as the first company to sell\nairline tickets on the Internet with a \u201cname-your-own-price\u201d bidding\nsystem. Today Priceline.com is far and away the leading site on the\nWeb for discount airline tickets and hotel rooms. Every seven seconds,\nsomeone names their own price at Priceline.com.\n\nFive companies, five brands, five Internet \u201cfirsts.\u201d And five market leaders\nwhose brands dominate their categories.\n\nWere Yahoo!, eBay, Amazon.com, Bluemountain.com, and Priceline.com\nliterally first in their categories? Amazon.com was not, and we\u2019re not sure\nabout the other four.\n\nWhat you can be sure about is that the ideas for these sites occurred to\nmany other people at about the same time. History shows that ideas tend to\narrive in a variety of minds at approximately the same time.\n\nThe automobile was \u201cinvented\u201d in Germany at about the same time as\nentrepreneurs in France, England, Italy, and America were working on\nmany of the same self-propelled concepts.\n\nThe airplane was \u201cinvented\u201d in America, but many French people thought\nthe airplane was invented in France until they read about the Wright\nbrothers accomplishing the same feat several years earlier.\n\nWould we still think the world is flat if it weren\u2019t for Christopher\nColumbus? Of course not. Somebody else would have discovered America\nand realized the world was round.\n\nWould we still be communicating with smoke signals if it weren\u2019t for\nAlexander Graham Bell? Of course not. Somebody else would have\ninvented the telephone.\n\nWould we still be using Thermofax copiers if it weren\u2019t for Chester\nCarlson? Of course not. Somebody else would have invented xerography.\n\nThere\u2019s a big difference between having an idle thought on a Sunday\nafternoon and having a successful brand on the Internet on Monday\nmorning. Ideas (and those idle thoughts that initiate them) are a dime a\ndozen. It takes hard work and, even more important, a sense of urgency to\nput an idea to work on the Net.\n\nYou can\u2019t dawdle. By this we mean endless testing, focus groups, market\nsurveys. This is a particular problem for an Internet brand.\n\nWhy were most of the successful Internet sites launched by small, venture-\ncapital-backed companies rather than Fortune 500 firms? A big company\nhates to do anything without first amassing a mound of market research.\n\nThe Internet is moving too fast to be measured. It\u2019s a new industry.\nKnowledge is scarce. Few people know what they want, what they would\n\nuse, what they would be willing to pay for . . . until they are given a real-\nworld choice.\n\nBig companies often fail to exploit new opportunities because they are\n\u201cperfectionists.\u201d They won\u2019t release a new product, a new service, or an\nInternet site \u201cuntil we get it right.\u201d\n\nGetting it right makes no sense from a branding point of view. Anything\nworth doing is worth doing in a half-assed way. Anything not worth doing\nis not worth doing in a perfect way.\n\nTake Yahoo!, the most valuable brand on the Internet. Yahoo! is basically a\nsearch engine. It will find whatever you want to find on the Internet.\n\nYahoo! is the top search engine in almost every major country in the world.\nIt generates 40 percent of all search referrals worldwide.\n\nDid Yahoo! develop its own search-engine technology? No. In order to\nmove rapidly, it outsourced its search-engine technology, first from Open\nSource, then from AltaVista, before finally settling on Inktomi.\n\nThe leading search engine didn\u2019t develop its own search-engine\ntechnology? Does that surprise you? It shouldn\u2019t. You don\u2019t win by being\nbetter. You win by being first. Yahoo! succeeded because they \u201crushed the\nnet.\u201d\n\nOne of the abiding myths of American business is that you win by being\nbetter. Management commits billions of dollars in their search for better\nproducts or services to market. They \u201cbenchmark\u201d their existing products\nand services against their major competitors. No new product or service\ngets launched unless it has a significant, tangible advantage.\n\nResult: Nine out of ten new products fail. Why? Not, in our opinion,\nbecause of a quality deficiency. It\u2019s because of a timing deficiency. They\ndidn\u2019t get that new product or service out in the marketplace fast enough.\n\nBig companies often lack a sense of urgency when it comes to introducing\nnew products or new ideas. Sometimes you can detect that in their public\n\nstatements. \u201cMaybe we are relatively late,\u201d said Rupert Murdoch, CEO of\nNews Corp., when he recently announced the company\u2019s first Internet\ninvestment, \u201cbut only by a year or two.\u201d\n\nOnly by a year or two?

Below is an excerpt from my book titled 'The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding How to Build a Product or Service into a World-Class Brand ', specifically from Chapter '9 THE LAW OF VANITY', Section 'The biggest mistake of all is believing\nyou can do anything.'. The original text is: 'Success in business doesn\u2019t just show up on the bottom line of the profit-\nand-loss column; it also goes to the top. Success in business inflates the\negos of top management.\n\nSupremely successful companies believe they can do anything. They can\nlaunch any product into any market. They can make any merger work. It\u2019s\njust a question of having the willpower and the resources to throw into the\ntask. What is it that we want to do? is the question that management usually\nasks itself.\n\nHistory hasn\u2019t been kind to this type of thinking. Overconfident\nmanagement has been responsible for most of the marketing disasters of the\npast decades.\n\n\u00a2 General Electric couldn\u2019t crack the mainframe computer market in\nspite of its reputation for brilliant management.\n\n\u00a2 Sears, Roebuck\u2019s \u201csocks and stocks\u201d strategy of selling brokerage\naccounts, insurance, and real estate in its retail stores went nowhere.\n\n\u00a2 Xerox couldn\u2019t duplicate its copier success in computers.\n\n\u00a2 IBM, on the other hand, couldn\u2019t extend its computer success to\ncopiers.\n\n\u00a2 Kodak lost its focus when it tried to get into instant photography.\n\n\u00a2 Polaroid, on the other hand, fared no better in conventional 35mm\nfilm.\n\nGet the picture? As soon as a company is successful in one area, it tries to\nmove into another. Generally with little or no success.\n\nThe problem is usually not the new product or service being offered. Xerox\nmay well have had the best computer product on the market. The problem is\nin the mind of the prospect. \u201cWhat does a copier company know about\ncomputers?\u201d\n\nIn other words, the problem is not a product problem, it\u2019s a perception\nproblem. The most difficult problem in business today is trying to change a\nperception that exists in the mind of a customer or prospect. Once a\nperception is strongly held in the mind, it can almost never be changed.\n(Anybody who has ever been married knows the difficulty of changing a\nperception in another person\u2019s mind.)\n\nWhat\u2019s a Cadillac? In the mind of the car buyer, it\u2019s a \u201cbig car.\u201d But the\nmarket started shifting to smaller cars. So naturally Cadillac tried to sell a\nsmall Cadillac called the Catera, with very little success. On the other hand,\nthe Cadillac Escalade, a big SUV, looks like it is going to be an enormous\nsuccess.\n\nWhat\u2019s a Volkswagen? In the mind of the car buyer, it\u2019s a \u201csmall car.\u201d But\nits customers now have families. So naturally Volkswagen tried to sell a\nlarger Volkswagen called the Passat, with very little success.\n\nCadillac couldn\u2019t sell small Cadillacs. And Volkswagen couldn\u2019t sell big\nVolkswagens.\n\nOnce you stand for something in the prospect\u2019s mind, it\u2019s hard to change\nwhat you stand for. Volkswagen stands for small. Cadillac stands for big.\nCan you change these perceptions? (And, furthermore, why would you\nwant to?)\n\nUnlikely. Yet they keep trying. Before the Catera launch, Cadillac tried\nselling the Cimarron, another smaller Cadillac. Predictably the Cimarron\n\nalso never got out of the garage.\n\nThe folks at Lincoln ought to be laughing at Cadillac\u2019s predicament, but\nthey\u2019re not. They too are busy introducing the new small Lincoln (LS for\nLincoln Small, of course).\n\nMeanwhile the three-and-a-half-ton Lincoln Navigator is doing great. When\na new product matches the perceptions that already exist in the mind, the\nnew product can be exceedingly successful.\n\nWhen Volkswagen brought back the Beetle, their original small car, sales\nexploded. As you might expect, the success of the New Beetle also went to\ntheir heads. There\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t sell $60,000 cars with the\nVolkswagen name on them, said one VW executive recently. Yes, there is.\nPeople won\u2019t buy them.\n\nWill the online world be any different than the off-line world? We think not.\nTo be successful on the Internet you still have to do business with human\nminds. Once you stand for something in a mind, it\u2019s hard to change the\nperception of what you stand for.\n\nAmazon.com was the first Internet site to sell books and music CDs. The\nsite is a roaring success, with current sales of $3.1 billion annually (albeit\nwith losses in the past year of $567 million).\n\nSo what is Amazon.com doing next? You know what they\u2019re doing next.\nThey\u2019re in the process of turning themselves into a \u201cdestination site\u201d where\ncustomers can find anything they could possibly want.\n\n\u00a2 DVDs and videotapes\n\n\u00a2 Electronics and software\n\n\u00a2 Toys and video games\n\n\u00a2 Home improvement products\n\n\u00a2 A gift-registry system\n\n\u00a2 E-cards\n\n\u00a2 Auctions, including a joint venture with Sotheby\u2019s (Amazon spent $45\nmillion for a 1.7 percent stake in Sotheby\u2019s)\n\n\u00a2 zShops, where thousands of small merchants can do business under the\nAmazon.com banner\n\n\u00a2 Credit cards in a cobranded arrangement with NextCard Inc.\n(Amazon.com also spent $22.5 million for a warrant that lets it acquire\n9.9 percent of the credit-card company)\n\n\u00a2 Automobiles in a deal with CarsDirect.com\n\nWow! What a list. But, hey, if you\u2019re \u201cperson of the year,\u201d you ought to be\nable to do all of these things.\n\nAmazon.com used to use the theme \u201cEarth\u2019s Biggest Bookstore.\u201d No\nlonger. They\u2019ve changed it. The new theme is \u201cEarth\u2019s Biggest Selection.\u201d\n\nPerson of the year Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon.com, says, \u201cIt\u2019s very natural\nfor a customer to wonder, can you really be the best place to buy music,\nbooks, and electronics? In the physical world, the answer is almost always\nno. But on the Internet all the physical constraints go away.\u201d (A sign of the\ntimes: The company recently registered \u201cAmazoneverywhere.net as a\nWebsite name.)\n\nAll the physical constraints may go away on the Internet, but what about the\nmental constraints? What about the mind of the prospect? What\u2019s an\nAmazon.com?\n\nIf Xerox is copiers, IBM is computers, Cadillac is big cars, and Volkswagen\nis small cars, then Amazon.com is an Internet bookstore.\n\nIf Amazon.com is an Internet bookstore, then how come the site has also\nbeen able to successfully sell music CDs? And if they can successfully sell\nmusic CDs, why can\u2019t they also sell toys and electronics?\n\nLook around your community at big bookstores like Borders or\nWaldenbooks. Do they sell toys and electronics? No. But they do sell music\nCDs. Ergo: The customer associates music CDs with bookstores.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason for Amazon not to sell other merchandise,\u201d said Bill\nGates recently. Yes, there is. It\u2019s called \u201cperception,\u201d and it\u2019s a critical\nattribute of the human mind. Amazon.com means Internet bookstore. Not\nauctions, gifts, home-improvement products, toys, video games, electronics,\nsoftware, DVDs, or videotapes.\n\nYou see Amazon.com thinking all over the physical world. Blockbuster\nmeans video rentals. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for Blockbuster Video not to sell\nother merchandise,\u201d someone at corporate headquarters probably muttered\nto themselves a number of years ago. So Blockbuster Music was born.\n\nAfter years of losses, the company finally faced the music and spun off the\ndivision in 1999. The new name: Wherehouse Music.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see more Amazon-like cases in which a company that is strong in\none online area expands its product offerings,\u201d adds Bill Gates. Sure, you\nwill. Line extension is very popular in corporate America, almost as popular\nas stock options and corporate jets. Both feed the corporate ego.\n\nWhat is terribly confusing is the fact that line extension can work . . . in the\nshort term. But almost never in the long term.\n\nThis is especially true if you are the first in a new category. When you are\nthe first, when you dominate a new category, you can be successful in the\nshort term taking the line-extension route. You may pay the price later, but\nyou can easily fool yourself into thinking that you are going in the right\ndirection when you broaden your approach.\n\nTake Yahoo!, for example. Incredibly the company\u2019s mission statement is\n\u201cto be all things to all people\u201d (a phrase reportedly repeated as a mantra by\nmany Yahoo! executives).\n\nStarting as a search engine on the Internet, Yahoo! has now expanded its\nWebsite to include the following features: auctions, calendars, chat rooms,\nclassifieds, e-mail, games, maps, news, pager services, people searches,\npersonals, radio, shopping, sports, stock quotes, weather reports, and yellow\n\npages.\n\nTo further its goal of being all things to all people, Yahoo! has also spent a\nsmall fortune on a raft of acquisitions.\n\n\u00a2 $5 billion for Broadcast.com, a service that delivers audio and video\nover the Internet\n\n\u00a2 $3.7 billion for GeoCities, a home-page service\n\n\u00a2 $130 million for Encompass, a technology company that makes\nsoftware to more easily link consumers to Internet services\n\n\u00a2 $80 million for Online Anywhere, a technology that allows the\ncompany to deliver information and services to a wide variety of non-\nPC devices\n\nIs Yahoo! successful? (Silly question, the company is worth $11 billion on\nthe stock market.)\n\nSure, Yahoo! is successful, but the brand had the enormous advantage of\nbeing the first search engine on the Internet. As a result, Yahoo! received an\ninordinate amount of publicity.\n\nYahoo! became a celebrity brand. In one seventeen-month period, in six\nthousand different news media, Yahoo! received an astounding forty-five\nthousand citations, far greater than any other Internet site.\n\nNothing succeeds like excess. With enough favorable media mentions,\nMussolini Merlot might become a popular brand of Italian wine.\n\nBut nothing lasts forever. The media will move on to the next hot Internet\nbrand, leaving Yahoo! in the uncomfortable position of having to spend its\nown money to communicate its identity.\n\nWhat\u2019s a Yahoo!? Not an easy question to answer when you are \u201call things\nto all people.\u201d\n\nLeaders tend to self-destruct when they blow themselves up. When you try\nto be everything, you end up being nothing.\n\nApple started as a personal computer hardware company, then moved into\nsoftware, operating systems, and personal digital assistants. Apple lost its\nway, its CEO, and almost its entire existence until Steve Jobs retook the\nreins and refocused Apple on its core business, easy-to-use and \u201cinsanely\ngreat\u201d personal computers.\n\nBut everybody wants to grow, and you can\u2019t blame them. So what should an\nInternet brand like Amazon.com do? There are five fundamental branding\nstrategies for a leader in any category.\n\n1. KEEP YOUR BRAND FOCUSED.\n\nThere are more than 22 million dotcom sites registered on the Internet, and\nyou want your site to stand for more than one thing? Amazon.com should\nstay focused on books and music CDs. After all, the site accounts for just 8\npercent of the $25 billion book market in the United States.\n\n2. INCREASE YOUR SHARE OF THE MARKET.\n\nThe time to think about getting into another business is after you dominate\nthe business you\u2019re already in. Until Amazon.com has at least 25 percent of\nthe book market, it should stick to its knitting. Its short-term strategy should\nfocus on finding ways to increase its 8 percent market share.\n\n3. EXPAND YOUR MARKET.\n\nLeaders should figure out how to expand their market, knowing that many\nof the benefits of a larger market will flow to them. What about book clubs,\nchat rooms with authors, and other book-building activities, including\nAmazon-sponsored seminars by famous authors?\n\n4. GO GLOBAL.\n\nSure, the Internet is a worldwide information and communications network\nalready, but Amazon.com\u2019s share of the book market outside the United\nStates is minuscule. (Currently the company sells only 22 percent of its\nbooks overseas.)\n\nAmazon.com should make a major effort to reach customers in the rest of\nthe world. As English becomes the business language of the world, the\nmarket for books in English should skyrocket.\n\nWhy stop at English? Amazon.com should take its Internet expertise into all\nthe major languages of the world.\n\nThinking often stops at the border. The most successful companies today\ntreat the world as their oyster.\n\n5. DOMINATE THE CATEGORY.\n\nFor a leading brand, a 25 percent market share should be a conservative\ngoal. With a quarter of the U.S. book market, Amazon.com would rack up\nsales of $6.3 billion, enough to put the company on the Fortune 500 list,\nahead of such companies as Southwest Airlines, Avon Products, Campbell\nSoup, Sherwin-Williams, Ryder Systems, Nordstrom, Owens Corning,\nBlack & Decker, and Hershey Foods.\n\nNothing works in branding as well as market domination. Coca-Cola in\ncola, Hertz in car rentals, Budweiser in beer, Goodyear in tires, Microsoft in\npersonal computer operating systems, Intel in microprocessors, Cisco in\nnetworking equipment, Oracle in database software, Intuit in personal\nfinance software.\n\nAmazon.com has a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to dominate the book\nbusiness on a worldwide scale. Why throw away this opportunity in order to\nchase a dozen other markets, none of which they are likely to dominate?\n\nStill, when the vanity bug bites you, it\u2019s hard to resist. \u201cWe can get into\nthese other markets. We have the products, we have the people, we have the\nsystems, we have the momentum, and we have the esprit de corps. Why\nnot?\u201d\n\nWhy not? You may have everything going for you, including the products,\nthe people, and the systems, but you lack one thing. You lack the\nperception.\n\nThe issue in branding, Internet or otherwise, always boils down to the same\nthing: product versus perception.\n\nMany managers believe it\u2019s only necessary to deliver a better product or\nservice to win. But brands like Coca-Cola, Hertz, Budweiser, and Goodyear\nare strong not because they have the best product or service (although they\nmight have) but because they are market leaders that dominate their\ncategories.\n\nWhich scenario seems more likely, A or B?\n\nScenario A: The company creates a better product or service and\nconsequently achieves market leadership.\n\nScenario B: The company achieves market leadership (usually by being\nfirst in a new category) and then subsequently achieves the perception\nof having the better product or service.\n\nLogic suggests Scenario A, but history is overwhelmingly on the side of\nScenario B. Leadership first, perception second.\n\nAltaVista bills itself as \u201cthe most powerful and useful guide to the Net.\u201d We\nhave no reason to doubt their claim. But is this enough to enable AltaVista\nto wrestle the portal leadership away from Yahoo!? Not in our opinion.\n\nLeadership first, perception second. To try to reverse this sequence is\nalmost impossible.\n\nWhat if you do everything right? What if you are the first in a new category\nand subsequently go on to dominate that category domestically? Then you\nshould try to expand the market in the U.S. at the same time that you take\nyour brand to the global market.\n\nCoca-Cola did all of these things. But what\u2019s next? Are there no second acts\nin branding history?\n\nMost assuredly there are. A company can do two things at once (keep a\nnarrow focus and expand its business) by the simple strategy of launching a\n\nsecond, or even a third and fourth, brand.\n\n* Coca-Cola owns Coca-Cola, the leading cola, and Sprite, the leading\nlemon-lime soda.\n\n\u00a2 Anheuser-Busch owns Budweiser, the leading regular beer; Michelob,\nthe leading premium beer; and Busch, the leading low-price beer.\n\n\u00a2 Darden Restaurants owns Olive Garden, the leading Italian restaurant\nchain, and Red Lobster, the leading seafood restaurant chain. (Darden\nis the world\u2019s largest casual dining company.)\n\n\u00a2 Toyota also owns Lexus.\n\u00a2 Black & Decker also owns DeWalt.\n\u00a2 Levi Strauss owns both Levi\u2019s and Dockers.\n\n\u00a2 The Gap also owns Banana Republic and Old Navy.\n\nAmerica Online is using the same multiple-brand strategy on the Internet.\nAOL is its premium brand for which subscribers pay $23.90 a month. The\nservice includes nineteen separate topic channels, fifteen thousand chat\nrooms, and ICQ, a popular instant messaging capability. CompuServe is the\ncompany\u2019s value brand. It\u2019s a good deal. For $19.95 a month, CompuServe\ngives you everything AOL gives you except for the AOL e-mail address.\n\nInstead of launching second brands, however, most companies take the\nvanity route instead. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with our name? We\u2019re famous. Why do\nwe need a second brand? We can use our own name on that line extension.\u201d\n\nSome companies that practice line extension seem to be successful, at least\nin the short term. Microsoft is a good example.\n\nAfter dominating the personal computer operating system business,\nMicrosoft has gone into a raft of different businesses, all under the\nMicrosoft name. \u201cIf Microsoft can do it, why can\u2019t we?\u201d is a constant\nrefrain of our consulting clients.\n\nOur answer: You\u2019re not Microsoft. When you have 95 percent of a market,\nwhen you are worth $332 billion on the stock market, you are extremely\npowerful. You can do almost anything and still appear to be successful.\n\nLeadership changes the rules of the game. Try telling your spouse, \u201cIf Bill\nClinton can do it, why can\u2019t I?\u201d\n\nMost CEOs are not Bill Clinton either. They are not the former leader of the\nmost powerful country in the world. They have to follow ordinary rules.\n\nLeaders, especially dominant leaders like Microsoft, can break all the laws\nand still stay on top .. . for now.\n\nLook again at Yahoo!, a company that is following the Microsoft game\nplan. Former CEO Timothy Koogle said: \u201cIn online commerce and\nshopping you can expect to see us extend aggressively by broadening and\ndeepening the range of consumer buying, transaction, and fulfillment\nservices we provide across all major categories.\u201d (Maybe this is one reason\nthat Koogle is gone.)\n\nDon\u2019t be too critical of Yahoo!\u2019s behavior. You only live once. Being young\nand rich and foolish is a lot more fun than being old and wise.\n\nMany sites are going in the same direction, but without Yahoo!\u2019s powerful\nbrand-name recognition. They include Buy.com, Shopping.com,\nShopnow.com, and a host of other copycat sites. \u201cAnything you want to\nbuy, we can get it for you at a discount.\u201d\n\nWhat does a site like BuyItNow.com sell? Jewelry, consumer electronics,\ntoys, kitchen equipment, home decorating products, sporting goods, tools,\npet supplies, garden supplies, gifts, luxury items. \u201cYou name it, we\u2019ve got\nit.\u201d(It should come as no surprise that BuyItNow.com is no longer with us.)\n\nSnap.com goes one step further. Not only can you buy everything by\nvisiting the Snap site, but you can buy it from any store. \u201cAny product. Any\nstore. Any time. Snap shopping\u201d is the theme. Vanity is working overtime at\nSnap.com.\n\nAs Internet fever cools down, as the Internet becomes just one of the places\nyou can go to buy things, those generic sites that sell everything to\neverybody are unlikely to be with us. Yahoo!, on the other hand, is in no\ndanger because it has a powerful, dominant position in the portal category.\nAs does Amazon.com in the books and music category.\n\nA question remains for leader brands like Yahoo! and Amazon.com. Would\nthese companies have been better off with a multiple-brand strategy rather\nthan a line-extension strategy?\n\nWe think so. But it is getting harder and harder to find leaders that want to\nintroduce second brands.\n\nTheir vanity leads them astray.\n'.

Success in business inflates the\negos of top management.\n\nSupremely successful companies believe they can do anything. They can\nlaunch any product into any market. They can make any merger work. It\u2019s\njust a question of having the willpower and the resources to throw into the\ntask. What is it that we want to do? is the question that management usually\nasks itself.\n\nHistory hasn\u2019t been kind to this type of thinking. Overconfident\nmanagement has been responsible for most of the marketing disasters of the\npast decades.\n\n\u00a2 General Electric couldn\u2019t crack the mainframe computer market in\nspite of its reputation for brilliant management.\n\n\u00a2 Sears, Roebuck\u2019s \u201csocks and stocks\u201d strategy of selling brokerage\naccounts, insurance, and real estate in its retail stores went nowhere.\n\n\u00a2 Xerox couldn\u2019t duplicate its copier success in computers.\n\n\u00a2 IBM, on the other hand, couldn\u2019t extend its computer success to\ncopiers.\n\n\u00a2 Kodak lost its focus when it tried to get into instant photography.\n\n\u00a2 Polaroid, on the other hand, fared no better in conventional 35mm\nfilm.\n\nGet the picture? As soon as a company is successful in one area, it tries to\nmove into another. Generally with little or no success.\n\nThe problem is usually not the new product or service being offered. Xerox\nmay well have had the best computer product on the market. The problem is\nin the mind of the prospect. \u201cWhat does a copier company know about\ncomputers?\u201d\n\nIn other words, the problem is not a product problem, it\u2019s a perception\nproblem. The most difficult problem in business today is trying to change a\nperception that exists in the mind of a customer or prospect. Once a\nperception is strongly held in the mind, it can almost never be changed.\n(Anybody who has ever been married knows the difficulty of changing a\nperception in another person\u2019s mind.)\n\nWhat\u2019s a Cadillac? In the mind of the car buyer, it\u2019s a \u201cbig car.\u201d But the\nmarket started shifting to smaller cars. So naturally Cadillac tried to sell a\nsmall Cadillac called the Catera, with very little success. On the other hand,\nthe Cadillac Escalade, a big SUV, looks like it is going to be an enormous\nsuccess.\n\nWhat\u2019s a Volkswagen? In the mind of the car buyer, it\u2019s a \u201csmall car.\u201d But\nits customers now have families. So naturally Volkswagen tried to sell a\nlarger Volkswagen called the Passat, with very little success.\n\nCadillac couldn\u2019t sell small Cadillacs. And Volkswagen couldn\u2019t sell big\nVolkswagens.\n\nOnce you stand for something in the prospect\u2019s mind, it\u2019s hard to change\nwhat you stand for. Volkswagen stands for small. Cadillac stands for big.\nCan you change these perceptions? (And, furthermore, why would you\nwant to?)\n\nUnlikely. Yet they keep trying. Before the Catera launch, Cadillac tried\nselling the Cimarron, another smaller Cadillac. Predictably the Cimarron\n\nalso never got out of the garage.\n\nThe folks at Lincoln ought to be laughing at Cadillac\u2019s predicament, but\nthey\u2019re not. They too are busy introducing the new small Lincoln (LS for\nLincoln Small, of course).\n\nMeanwhile the three-and-a-half-ton Lincoln Navigator is doing great. When\na new product matches the perceptions that already exist in the mind, the\nnew product can be exceedingly successful.\n\nWhen Volkswagen brought back the Beetle, their original small car, sales\nexploded. As you might expect, the success of the New Beetle also went to\ntheir heads. There\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t sell $60,000 cars with the\nVolkswagen name on them, said one VW executive recently. Yes, there is.\nPeople won\u2019t buy them.\n\nWill the online world be any different than the off-line world? We think not.\nTo be successful on the Internet you still have to do business with human\nminds. Once you stand for something in a mind, it\u2019s hard to change the\nperception of what you stand for.\n\nAmazon.com was the first Internet site to sell books and music CDs. The\nsite is a roaring success, with current sales of $3.1 billion annually (albeit\nwith losses in the past year of $567 million).\n\nSo what is Amazon.com doing next? You know what they\u2019re doing next.\nThey\u2019re in the process of turning themselves into a \u201cdestination site\u201d where\ncustomers can find anything they could possibly want.\n\n\u00a2 DVDs and videotapes\n\n\u00a2 Electronics and software\n\n\u00a2 Toys and video games\n\n\u00a2 Home improvement products\n\n\u00a2 A gift-registry system\n\n\u00a2 E-cards\n\n\u00a2 Auctions, including a joint venture with Sotheby\u2019s (Amazon spent $45\nmillion for a 1.7 percent stake in Sotheby\u2019s)\n\n\u00a2 zShops, where thousands of small merchants can do business under the\nAmazon.com banner\n\n\u00a2 Credit cards in a cobranded arrangement with NextCard Inc.\n(Amazon.com also spent $22.5 million for a warrant that lets it acquire\n9.9 percent of the credit-card company)\n\n\u00a2 Automobiles in a deal with CarsDirect.com\n\nWow! What a list. But, hey, if you\u2019re \u201cperson of the year,\u201d you ought to be\nable to do all of these things.\n\nAmazon.com used to use the theme \u201cEarth\u2019s Biggest Bookstore.\u201d No\nlonger. They\u2019ve changed it. The new theme is \u201cEarth\u2019s Biggest Selection.\u201d\n\nPerson of the year Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon.com, says, \u201cIt\u2019s very natural\nfor a customer to wonder, can you really be the best place to buy music,\nbooks, and electronics? In the physical world, the answer is almost always\nno. But on the Internet all the physical constraints go away.\u201d (A sign of the\ntimes: The company recently registered \u201cAmazoneverywhere.net as a\nWebsite name.)\n\nAll the physical constraints may go away on the Internet, but what about the\nmental constraints? What about the mind of the prospect? What\u2019s an\nAmazon.com?\n\nIf Xerox is copiers, IBM is computers, Cadillac is big cars, and Volkswagen\nis small cars, then Amazon.com is an Internet bookstore.\n\nIf Amazon.com is an Internet bookstore, then how come the site has also\nbeen able to successfully sell music CDs? And if they can successfully sell\nmusic CDs, why can\u2019t they also sell toys and electronics?\n\nLook around your community at big bookstores like Borders or\nWaldenbooks. Do they sell toys and electronics? No. But they do sell music\nCDs. Ergo: The customer associates music CDs with bookstores.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason for Amazon not to sell other merchandise,\u201d said Bill\nGates recently. Yes, there is. It\u2019s called \u201cperception,\u201d and it\u2019s a critical\nattribute of the human mind. Amazon.com means Internet bookstore. Not\nauctions, gifts, home-improvement products, toys, video games, electronics,\nsoftware, DVDs, or videotapes.\n\nYou see Amazon.com thinking all over the physical world. Blockbuster\nmeans video rentals. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for Blockbuster Video not to sell\nother merchandise,\u201d someone at corporate headquarters probably muttered\nto themselves a number of years ago. So Blockbuster Music was born.\n\nAfter years of losses, the company finally faced the music and spun off the\ndivision in 1999. The new name: Wherehouse Music.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see more Amazon-like cases in which a company that is strong in\none online area expands its product offerings,\u201d adds Bill Gates. Sure, you\nwill. Line extension is very popular in corporate America, almost as popular\nas stock options and corporate jets. Both feed the corporate ego.\n\nWhat is terribly confusing is the fact that line extension can work . . . in the\nshort term. But almost never in the long term.\n\nThis is especially true if you are the first in a new category. When you are\nthe first, when you dominate a new category, you can be successful in the\nshort term taking the line-extension route. You may pay the price later, but\nyou can easily fool yourself into thinking that you are going in the right\ndirection when you broaden your approach.\n\nTake Yahoo!, for example. Incredibly the company\u2019s mission statement is\n\u201cto be all things to all people\u201d (a phrase reportedly repeated as a mantra by\nmany Yahoo! executives).\n\nStarting as a search engine on the Internet, Yahoo! has now expanded its\nWebsite to include the following features: auctions, calendars, chat rooms,\nclassifieds, e-mail, games, maps, news, pager services, people searches,\npersonals, radio, shopping, sports, stock quotes, weather reports, and yellow\n\npages.\n\nTo further its goal of being all things to all people, Yahoo! has also spent a\nsmall fortune on a raft of acquisitions.\n\n\u00a2 $5 billion for Broadcast.com, a service that delivers audio and video\nover the Internet\n\n\u00a2 $3.7 billion for GeoCities, a home-page service\n\n\u00a2 $130 million for Encompass, a technology company that makes\nsoftware to more easily link consumers to Internet services\n\n\u00a2 $80 million for Online Anywhere, a technology that allows the\ncompany to deliver information and services to a wide variety of non-\nPC devices\n\nIs Yahoo! successful? (Silly question, the company is worth $11 billion on\nthe stock market.)\n\nSure, Yahoo! is successful, but the brand had the enormous advantage of\nbeing the first search engine on the Internet. As a result, Yahoo! received an\ninordinate amount of publicity.\n\nYahoo! became a celebrity brand. In one seventeen-month period, in six\nthousand different news media, Yahoo! received an astounding forty-five\nthousand citations, far greater than any other Internet site.\n\nNothing succeeds like excess. With enough favorable media mentions,\nMussolini Merlot might become a popular brand of Italian wine.\n\nBut nothing lasts forever. The media will move on to the next hot Internet\nbrand, leaving Yahoo! in the uncomfortable position of having to spend its\nown money to communicate its identity.\n\nWhat\u2019s a Yahoo!? Not an easy question to answer when you are \u201call things\nto all people.\u201d\n\nLeaders tend to self-destruct when they blow themselves up. When you try\nto be everything, you end up being nothing.\n\nApple started as a personal computer hardware company, then moved into\nsoftware, operating systems, and personal digital assistants. Apple lost its\nway, its CEO, and almost its entire existence until Steve Jobs retook the\nreins and refocused Apple on its core business, easy-to-use and \u201cinsanely\ngreat\u201d personal computers.\n\nBut everybody wants to grow, and you can\u2019t blame them.

Coca-Cola in\ncola, Hertz in car rentals, Budweiser in beer, Goodyear in tires, Microsoft in\npersonal computer operating systems, Intel in microprocessors, Cisco in\nnetworking equipment, Oracle in database software, Intuit in personal\nfinance software.\n\nAmazon.com has a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to dominate the book\nbusiness on a worldwide scale.

Jewelry, consumer electronics,\ntoys, kitchen equipment, home decorating products, sporting goods, tools,\npet supplies, garden supplies, gifts, luxury items. \u201cYou name it, we\u2019ve got\nit.\u201d(It should come as no surprise that BuyItNow.com is no longer with us.)\n\nSnap.com goes one step further. Not only can you buy everything by\nvisiting the Snap site, but you can buy it from any store. \u201cAny product. Any\nstore. Any time. Snap shopping\u201d is the theme. Vanity is working overtime at\nSnap.com.\n\nAs Internet fever cools down, as the Internet becomes just one of the places\nyou can go to buy things, those generic sites that sell everything to\neverybody are unlikely to be with us. Yahoo!, on the other hand, is in no\ndanger because it has a powerful, dominant position in the portal category.\nAs does Amazon.com in the books and music category.\n\nA question remains for leader brands like Yahoo! and Amazon.com. Would\nthese companies have been better off with a multiple-brand strategy rather\nthan a line-extension strategy?\n\nWe think so.

Technologies don\u2019t converge. They diverge. Yet the\nhype marches on.\n\nAccording to famous futurist Faith Popcorn, \u201cSomeday in the near future\nT\u2019'll be watching Ally McBeal. I like the outfit she\u2019s wearing. So I put my\nhand on the TV screen and she\u2019!] interrupt the program and say, \u2018Faith, do\nyou like what I\u2019m wearing?\u2019 \u2018Yeah,\u2019 I\u2019ll say. \u2018I like your suit.\u2019 And she\u2019ll\nsay, \u2018Here are the colors it comes in.\u2019 I\u2019ll tell Ally that I\u2019ll take just navy or\nblack, maybe both. And she\u2019!l say, \u2018No you won\u2019t, Faith. You\u2019ve already\ngot too many navy and black outfits in your closet right now. I think you\nshould try red this time.\u2019 And I\u2019ll say okay, and the next day the red suit is\ndelivered, in my size, to my home.\u201d\n\nWhen asked how soon this would happen, the famous futurist replied,\n\u201cWithin the next five years.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t hold your breath. Ally McBeal will be lucky if her TV show is still\non in five years, never mind her personal shopping advice service.\n\nWhile television sets and telephones are supposedly becoming computers,\ncomputers are supposedly becoming appliances that can receive television\nand radio programming as well as telephone calls.\n\nBroadcast.com, for example, offers live broadcasts of more than thirty\ntelevision stations and 370 radio stations. All available on your computer\nthrough the magic of the Internet. Meanwhile, rival Real Networks has put\ntogether more than 1,100 live stations on their lineup. Competitor InterVU\nhas put together a network focused on business services.\n\nWill people watch television programming on their computers? Sure, some\npeople will, but most television viewing is likely to continue to be done on\nTV sets.\n\nThe truth is, technologies diverge. They don\u2019t converge. A quick look at\nhistory validates the division theory.\n\n\u00a2 Radio used to be just radio. Today we have AM radio and FM radio.\nWe also have portable radios, car radios, headset radios, clock radios,\ncable radio, and satellite radio. Radio didn\u2019t combine with another\nmedium. It diverged.\n\n\u00a2 Television used to be just television. Today we have broadcast TV,\ncable TV, satellite TV, pay-per-view TV. Television didn\u2019t combine\nwith another medium. It diverged.\n\n\u00a2 The telephone used to be just the telephone. Today we have regular\ntelephones, cordless telephones, car phones, cell phones, and satellite\nphones. Also analog and digital phones. The telephone didn\u2019t combine\nwith another communications technology. It diverged.\n\n\u00a2 The computer used to be just a computer. Today we have mainframe\ncomputers, midrange computers, minicomputers, network computers,\npersonal computers, notebook computers, and handheld computers.\nThe computer didn\u2019t combine with another technology. It diverged.\n\nPeople often confuse what\u2019s possible with what\u2019s practical. After Neil\nArmstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the moon in 1969, the media were\n\nfilled with stories about future colonists in space. Where they would live.\nWhat they would eat. How they would work.\n\n(The moon is a great place to visit, but how many people would want to live\nthere?)\n\nWhat\u2019s possible won\u2019t happen just because it\u2019s possible. It also has to be\npractical. A computer and TV combination would seem like a natural, but\nApple, Toshiba, Gateway, and others have launched combination products\nthat failed.\n\nRecently Philips went one step further. In addition to a computer and a\ntelevision tuner, the Philips DVX8000 features an FM/AM radio and a\nCD/DVD player. What more could you want?\n\nSimplicity, ease of use, reliability, light weight, protection against early\nobsolescence, and low cost, for example.\n\nInstead of accessing the Internet from your home television set, it is much\nmore likely that you will someday have an Internet appliance. An electronic\nmachine devoted to Internet connections only, especially for e-mail use.\n\nActually, there are a number of such products on the market, ranging in\nprice from $100 to $200 plus the service fee. They include the MailStation\nby Cidco, TelMail by Sharp Electronic, the MailBug by Landel Telecom,\nand the PostBox from VTech Industries. (The BlackBerry is another\ndivergence device that has quite a few enthusiastic users.)\n\nWhy are divergence products generally winners and convergence products\ngenerally losers? One reason is that convergence products are always a\ncompromise. The Intel microprocessor inside the Philips DVX8000 should\nbe good for three years or so. The home-theater half of the machine should\nlast twenty years.\n\nBefore televisions combine with computers, you would think TV sets would\ncombine with videocassette recorders. You can buy combination TV/VCRs,\nof course, but most people don\u2019t. Recently we visited a consumer\nelectronics store that had a wall full of such products.\n\n\u201cHow are sales of your combination television/VCRs?\u201d we asked the clerk.\n\u201cTnfinitesimal,\u201d he replied.\n\nNor are many combination washer/dryers sold. Or microwave/stoves. Or\ntelephone/telephone answering machines. Or copier/printer/fax machines.\n\nThe one glimmer of hope for the convergence concept is the clock radio.\nEnthusiasts are fond of citing the clock radio as a brilliant example of the\npower of convergence thinking. But in some ways, a clock radio is not a\ndual function device at all. Rather, it\u2019s a single-function music alarm clock,\na way of getting you out of bed in the morning without the shock of an\nearth-shattering noise. Not many people use their clock radios as a way to\nplay the radio.\n\nOther than the clock radio, the history of convergence products has been\nrather dismal. After World War II, the two biggest industries in America\nwere the automotive industry and the airplane industry. Sure enough,\npundits thought that the car was going to converge with the plane.\n\nIn 1946, Ted Hall introduced his Flying Car, which was received by a\nwildly enthusiastic public. Roads soon would become obsolete, traffic jams\na thing of the past. You could go anywhere, anytime, with complete\nfreedom of movement. Every major aircraft manufacturer in America hoped\nto cash in on Hall\u2019s invention. The lucky buyer was Convair.\n\nIn July of that year, Convair introduced Hall\u2019s flight of fancy as the Convair\nModel 118 ConvAirCar. Company management confidently predicted\nminimum sales of 160,000 units a year. The price was $1,500 plus an extra\ncharge for the wings, which would also be available for rental at any\nairport.\n\nIn spite of the hype, only two ConvAirCars were ever built. Both are now\nsaid to rest in a warehouse in El Cajon, California.\n\nThree years later, Moulton Taylor introduced the Aerocar, a sporty runabout\nwith detachable wings and tail. The Aerocar received a tremendous amount\nof publicity at the time. The Ford Motor Company considered mass-\n\nproducing it. But Taylor\u2019s Aerocar met with the same predictable fate as\nHall\u2019s Flying Car.\n\nIt\u2019s divergence that almost always triumphs, not convergence. Today we\nhave many types of airplanes (jet planes, prop planes, helicopters) and\nmany types of automobiles (sedans, convertibles, station wagons, sport\nutility vehicles), but almost no flying cars.\n\nWould-be convergenists should also study the combination automobile/boat\nintroduced with great fanfare by Amphicar, a German company. Like all\nconvergence products, the Amphicar performed neither function very well.\n\u201cDrives like a boat, floats like a car,\u201d was the buyers\u2019 verdict.\n\nBad ideas never really die. Paul Moller has spent thirty-five years\ndeveloping the Skycar, a personal flying machine that is as easy to use as a\ncar. Today, $50 million, forty-three patents, and three wives later, his dream\nis ready for liftoff.\n\nDon\u2019t laugh. What will look foolish several decades from now is often\ntaken seriously today. As recently as June 24, 1999, the Wall Street Journal\nran a major article on Moller\u2019s sky dream on the front page of its\nMarketplace section. (Professor Moller has taken seventy-two orders, with a\n$5,000 deposit, for the Skycar.)\n\nWhat motivates Moller also motivates Microsoft. The company poured\nmillions of dollars into WebTV, a major effort to turn America\u2019s 100 million\ntelevision-owning households into Internet explorers.\n\nSure, WebTV is closing in on 1 percent of the market, but does any\nconvergence product have much of a future?\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of evidence that mixing \u201cinteractivity,\u201d an Internet attribute,\nwith the \u201cpassivity\u201d of the television experience just isn\u2019t going to work.\nTime Warner introduced the Full Service Network, the first digital\ninteractive TV network, in Orlando, Florida, in 1994 and shut it down two\nyears later.\n\nA company called ACTV was founded in 1989 to bring interactive TV to\nthe public. On average the company has lost $7 million a year for the past\ndecade. Finally, ACTV is rolling out its first product in partnership with\nFox Sports. For $10 a month, Fox fans will be able to use their remote\ncontrol to click on to different camera angles, pull up stats, or cut to instant\nreplays at any time during the game.\n\nWill the average couch potato want to put down his Bud Light long enough\nto change the camera angle? We don\u2019t think so. At least not when it\u2019s third\ndown and goal to go for the home team.\n\nTV directors get paid big bucks to do that for us. Why would the average\nviewer want to do it for nothing?\n\nNot only that. Spending the time figuring out the best camera angle will\ncause the watcher to miss the play. Not to mention the frustrations of the\nother people in the room who do not have the remote control in their hands.\n\nTechnology tends to triumph over logic. \u201cIf you build it, they will come.\u201d\nBill Gates, the manager of the high-technology team, is getting his players\ninvolved in convergence in a big way. In addition to his WebTV investment,\nGates put $5 billion of Microsoft\u2019s money into AT&T to help the company\npurchase a cable TV operation. In return, AT&T has agreed to license a\nminimum of five million copies of Microsoft\u2019s Windows CE operating\nsystem.\n\nThe two companies hoped that a General Instrument set-top box, the DTC-\n5000, would be the entry point for all the digital information flowing into\nthe home. In addition to five hundred channels of interactive cable, the\nDTC-5000 would also handle telephone service, video on demand, stereo\naudio, video games, and Internet access.\n\nRecently AT&T backed out of its commitment to Microsoft, leaving\n240,000 of those advanced set-top boxes gathering dust in a warehouse.\n\nThe Skycar, the Amphicar, the set-top box. Billions of dollars have been\nwasted chasing the convergence dream. But why do we make such a federal\ncase out of the convergence follies?\n\nBecause brands cannot be built with convergence thinking. Unless you can\nclearly see the fallacy behind the convergence concept, you are unlikely to\nbuild a successful Internet brand. Most Internet ideas, most Internet brands,\nmost Internet companies are based on convergence concepts. That\u2019s why\nmost Internet brands are likely to fail.\n\n\u00a2 What if you could find home selection, home buying, home selling,\nand home mortgages at one-easy-to-use Website?

Another client that needs to get\nthe convergence speech.)\n\nWe get our hair cut and our clothes dry-cleaned at two different places, but\nwe\u2019re quite sure that doesn\u2019t spell \u201copportunity\u201d for some would-be\nentrepreneur. (We used to get our hair cut and our nails done at one place.\nNow we go to two different places. That\u2019s divergence in action.)\n\nWhy do things divide? Divergence is consistent with the laws of nature,\nconvergence is not.\n\nIn physics, for instance, the law of entropy says the degree of disorder in a\nclosed system always increases. By contrast, a pattern of convergence\nwould make things more orderly.\n\nIn biology, the law of evolution holds that new species are created by\ndivergence of a single species. Convergence, instead, suggests that the\ncombining of two species will yield a new one.\n\nInvariably in nature you see things divide and not converge. We have\nhundreds of varieties of dogs and hundreds of varieties of cats, but very few\ncatdogs, or chickenducks, or horsecows.\n\nA company goes against the laws of nature when it tries to build an Internet\nbrand on the convergence concept. \u201cAre you getting three different kinds of\nelectronic messages\u2014voice-mail, e-mail, and fax?

They include the MailStation\nby Cidco, TelMail by Sharp Electronic, the MailBug by Landel Telecom,\nand the PostBox from VTech Industries. (The BlackBerry is another\ndivergence device that has quite a few enthusiastic users.)\n\nWhy are divergence products generally winners and convergence products\ngenerally losers? One reason is that convergence products are always a\ncompromise. The Intel microprocessor inside the Philips DVX8000 should\nbe good for three years or so. The home-theater half of the machine should\nlast twenty years.\n\nBefore televisions combine with computers, you would think TV sets would\ncombine with videocassette recorders. You can buy combination TV/VCRs,\nof course, but most people don\u2019t. Recently we visited a consumer\nelectronics store that had a wall full of such products.\n\n\u201cHow are sales of your combination television/VCRs?\u201d we asked the clerk.\n\u201cTnfinitesimal,\u201d he replied.\n\nNor are many combination washer/dryers sold. Or microwave/stoves. Or\ntelephone/telephone answering machines. Or copier/printer/fax machines.\n\nThe one glimmer of hope for the convergence concept is the clock radio.\nEnthusiasts are fond of citing the clock radio as a brilliant example of the\npower of convergence thinking. But in some ways, a clock radio is not a\ndual function device at all. Rather, it\u2019s a single-function music alarm clock,\na way of getting you out of bed in the morning without the shock of an\nearth-shattering noise. Not many people use their clock radios as a way to\nplay the radio.\n\nOther than the clock radio, the history of convergence products has been\nrather dismal. After World War II, the two biggest industries in America\nwere the automotive industry and the airplane industry. Sure enough,\npundits thought that the car was going to converge with the plane.\n\nIn 1946, Ted Hall introduced his Flying Car, which was received by a\nwildly enthusiastic public. Roads soon would become obsolete, traffic jams\na thing of the past. You could go anywhere, anytime, with complete\nfreedom of movement. Every major aircraft manufacturer in America hoped\nto cash in on Hall\u2019s invention. The lucky buyer was Convair.\n\nIn July of that year, Convair introduced Hall\u2019s flight of fancy as the Convair\nModel 118 ConvAirCar. Company management confidently predicted\nminimum sales of 160,000 units a year. The price was $1,500 plus an extra\ncharge for the wings, which would also be available for rental at any\nairport.\n\nIn spite of the hype, only two ConvAirCars were ever built. Both are now\nsaid to rest in a warehouse in El Cajon, California.\n\nThree years later, Moulton Taylor introduced the Aerocar, a sporty runabout\nwith detachable wings and tail. The Aerocar received a tremendous amount\nof publicity at the time. The Ford Motor Company considered mass-\n\nproducing it. But Taylor\u2019s Aerocar met with the same predictable fate as\nHall\u2019s Flying Car.\n\nIt\u2019s divergence that almost always triumphs, not convergence. Today we\nhave many types of airplanes (jet planes, prop planes, helicopters) and\nmany types of automobiles (sedans, convertibles, station wagons, sport\nutility vehicles), but almost no flying cars.\n\nWould-be convergenists should also study the combination automobile/boat\nintroduced with great fanfare by Amphicar, a German company. Like all\nconvergence products, the Amphicar performed neither function very well.\n\u201cDrives like a boat, floats like a car,\u201d was the buyers\u2019 verdict.\n\nBad ideas never really die. Paul Moller has spent thirty-five years\ndeveloping the Skycar, a personal flying machine that is as easy to use as a\ncar. Today, $50 million, forty-three patents, and three wives later, his dream\nis ready for liftoff.\n\nDon\u2019t laugh. What will look foolish several decades from now is often\ntaken seriously today. As recently as June 24, 1999, the Wall Street Journal\nran a major article on Moller\u2019s sky dream on the front page of its\nMarketplace section. (Professor Moller has taken seventy-two orders, with a\n$5,000 deposit, for the Skycar.)\n\nWhat motivates Moller also motivates Microsoft. The company poured\nmillions of dollars into WebTV, a major effort to turn America\u2019s 100 million\ntelevision-owning households into Internet explorers.\n\nSure, WebTV is closing in on 1 percent of the market, but does any\nconvergence product have much of a future?\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of evidence that mixing \u201cinteractivity,\u201d an Internet attribute,\nwith the \u201cpassivity\u201d of the television experience just isn\u2019t going to work.\nTime Warner introduced the Full Service Network, the first digital\ninteractive TV network, in Orlando, Florida, in 1994 and shut it down two\nyears later.\n\nA company called ACTV was founded in 1989 to bring interactive TV to\nthe public. On average the company has lost $7 million a year for the past\ndecade. Finally, ACTV is rolling out its first product in partnership with\nFox Sports. For $10 a month, Fox fans will be able to use their remote\ncontrol to click on to different camera angles, pull up stats, or cut to instant\nreplays at any time during the game.\n\nWill the average couch potato want to put down his Bud Light long enough\nto change the camera angle? We don\u2019t think so. At least not when it\u2019s third\ndown and goal to go for the home team.\n\nTV directors get paid big bucks to do that for us. Why would the average\nviewer want to do it for nothing?\n\nNot only that. Spending the time figuring out the best camera angle will\ncause the watcher to miss the play. Not to mention the frustrations of the\nother people in the room who do not have the remote control in their hands.\n\nTechnology tends to triumph over logic. \u201cIf you build it, they will come.\u201d\nBill Gates, the manager of the high-technology team, is getting his players\ninvolved in convergence in a big way. In addition to his WebTV investment,\nGates put $5 billion of Microsoft\u2019s money into AT&T to help the company\npurchase a cable TV operation. In return, AT&T has agreed to license a\nminimum of five million copies of Microsoft\u2019s Windows CE operating\nsystem.\n\nThe two companies hoped that a General Instrument set-top box, the DTC-\n5000, would be the entry point for all the digital information flowing into\nthe home. In addition to five hundred channels of interactive cable, the\nDTC-5000 would also handle telephone service, video on demand, stereo\naudio, video games, and Internet access.\n\nRecently AT&T backed out of its commitment to Microsoft, leaving\n240,000 of those advanced set-top boxes gathering dust in a warehouse.\n\nThe Skycar, the Amphicar, the set-top box. Billions of dollars have been\nwasted chasing the convergence dream. But why do we make such a federal\ncase out of the convergence follies?\n\nBecause brands cannot be built with convergence thinking. Unless you can\nclearly see the fallacy behind the convergence concept, you are unlikely to\nbuild a successful Internet brand. Most Internet ideas, most Internet brands,\nmost Internet companies are based on convergence concepts. That\u2019s why\nmost Internet brands are likely to fail.\n\n\u00a2 What if you could find home selection, home buying, home selling,\nand home mortgages at one-easy-to-use Website? (Homeadvisor.com)\n\n\u00a2 What if you could use your computer to listen to radio broadcasts? All\nyou need are speakers or headphones and audio software.\n(Spinner.com, Imagineradio.com, Netradio.com)\n\n\u00a2 What if you could use your computer to watch television broadcasts?\n(WinTV, AT1 Technologies)\n\n\u00a2 What if you could use your mobile phone to surf the Web, send and\nreceive e-mail, and transfer data to a PC? (NeoPoint, Nextel, Sprint\nPCS)\n\n\u00a2 What if you could use your computer to listen to music? (MP3.com)\n\n\u201cPeople used to have to go to three or four different places to get something\ndone\u201d is the premise of many of our clients. \u201cWith our new Website, they\u2019 ll\nbe able to do one-stop shopping.\u201d (Whoops. Another client that needs to get\nthe convergence speech.)\n\nWe get our hair cut and our clothes dry-cleaned at two different places, but\nwe\u2019re quite sure that doesn\u2019t spell \u201copportunity\u201d for some would-be\nentrepreneur. (We used to get our hair cut and our nails done at one place.\nNow we go to two different places. That\u2019s divergence in action.)\n\nWhy do things divide? Divergence is consistent with the laws of nature,\nconvergence is not.\n\nIn physics, for instance, the law of entropy says the degree of disorder in a\nclosed system always increases. By contrast, a pattern of convergence\nwould make things more orderly.\n\nIn biology, the law of evolution holds that new species are created by\ndivergence of a single species. Convergence, instead, suggests that the\ncombining of two species will yield a new one.\n\nInvariably in nature you see things divide and not converge. We have\nhundreds of varieties of dogs and hundreds of varieties of cats, but very few\ncatdogs, or chickenducks, or horsecows.\n\nA company goes against the laws of nature when it tries to build an Internet\nbrand on the convergence concept. \u201cAre you getting three different kinds of\nelectronic messages\u2014voice-mail, e-mail, and fax? Fine, we can fix that for\nyou.\u201d\n\nThese new all-in-one services are called \u201cunified messaging sites.\u201d Instead\nof having to dial into your voice-mail, open your e-mail, or check your fax\nmachine, you just go to the sponsor\u2019s Web page and get all your messages\n(Messagesclick.com, Onebox.com, Telebot.com, mReach.com).\n\nWhat\u2019s wrong with a unified messaging service? Nothing, except it drives\nlike a boat and floats like a car.\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Below is an excerpt from my book titled 'The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding How to Build a Product or Service into a World-Class Brand ', specifically from Chapter '11 THE LAW OF TRANSFORMATION', Section 'The Internet revolution will transform\nall aspects of our lives.'. The original text is: 'In business there is never only one way to do anything.\n\u00a2 Some people prefer to shop in specialty stores, some people in\ndepartment stores.\n\n\u00a2 Some people prefer to shop in supermarkets, some in neighborhood\nstores.\n\n\u00a2 Some people love shopping malls, some don\u2019t.\n\u00a2 Some people love to buy from catalogs, some don\u2019t.\n\n\u00a2 Some people go to Wal-Mart because the prices are low. Some people\ngo to Neiman-Marcus because the prices are high.\n\n\u00a2 Some people will turn to the Internet for much of their shopping,\ninformation, and communication needs. Some people won\u2019t.\n\n\u00a2 Some products and services will be sold or distributed primarily over\nthe Internet. Some products and services won\u2019t.\n\nIf your product or service is in the latter category, you might think that you\nhave nothing to gain from the Net. But, in our opinion, you would be\nwrong.\n\nThe Internet will affect your business whether you jump on the Web or not.\nWhat changes will the Internet bring to your business and your life? The\nfuture is always fuzzy, but here are some predictions.\n\n1. PAPER DIRECTORIES ARE DOOMED.\n\nYou won\u2019t be surprised to learn that the Encyclopaedia Britannica,\npublished since 1768, will no longer be available in a paper version. From\nnow on the encyclopedia will only be available online or on CD-ROM.\n\nThe companies that publish \u201cyellow pages\u201d telephone directories ought to\nbe concerned. The fingers that used to go walking though those directories\nare now moving to the keyboard.\n\n\u201cInformation at your fingertips,\u201d said Microsoft in its early advertising\nefforts. And it\u2019s true. The plumber, the electrician, the veterinarian, and the\nauto dealer can be more quickly found and evaluated on an electronic\ndirectory than on a paper one.\n\nWhat will happen to the $12 billion that companies spend annually on\nyellow-pages advertising? Good question. We\u2019d be concerned if we made\nour living publishing or selling space in a paper directory.\n\nPaper directories are doomed because of the interactivity of the Internet.\nThe user can manipulate a single computer database in literally thousands\nof ways.\n\nFurthermore, the database can be updated daily, even hourly. A typical\n\u201cyellow pages\u201d directory comes out once a year and is out-of-date the day it\nlands on your doorstep.\n\nEven some great paper institutions are going to have trouble competing in\nthe future. The 116-year-old full Oxford English Dictionary could cease to\nexist after it goes online on a subscription basis. The dictionary, which runs\nto twenty volumes and costs $2,900, is a dinosaur in the Internet age.\n\n2. PAPER CATALOGS FACE AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE.\n\nMailboxes across the county are stuffed with countless catalogs every day.\nAccording to one estimate, 17.6 billion catalogs were mailed in the U.S. last\nyear. That\u2019s sixty-four catalogs for every man, woman, and child.\n\nThat may change. Catalogs of all types will find themselves under severe\nelectronic competition. There are a number of reasons why a Web catalog is\nsuperior to a paper one.\n\nAn electronic catalog can be interactive. You can sort by types, by sizes, by\ncolors, by prices, by weights, and so on. Think Amazon.com, for example.\nYou can sort by author, by title, by subject, by category. In contrast, a paper\ncatalog of books is so impractical that few are printed and distributed,\nexcept for narrow selections.\n\nFurthermore, an electronic catalog is much less expensive to distribute.\nOnce the material is composed in an electronic format, the cost of\ndistribution is essentially zero. Manufacturing a paper catalog, however, can\nbe costly. Just to print those 17.6 billion mail-order missiles requires 3.35\nmillion tons of paper.\n\nSo what do you do if you\u2019re L.L. Bean? Good question.\n\nSales have been essentially flat at L.L. Bean for the last few years. That\nputs pressure on the bottom line because the company prints and mails\ncatalogs thirty times a year. And printing and mailing costs continue to rise.\n\nSo L.L. Bean opens up a Website to sell the same merchandise found in the\ncatalog. Is this a good idea or not?\n\nYes and no. In general, when you broaden the scope of a brand, you weaken\nthe brand. In the long run, multiple distribution channels substantially\nincrease costs and do not do much to increase sales.\n\nA fully functioning Website with computer hardware and service people\nbacked by a programming staff is not an inexpensive proposition.\n\nTo get the company moving again, L.L. Bean is opening a chain of retail\nstores, in addition to its nine factory outlet stores. Outlets are one thing,\n\nthey help you get rid of leftovers. When you open retail stores, however,\nyou are competing directly with yourself, never a good idea.\n\nA better solution for L.L. Bean and other catalog companies is to shift the\nentire operation to the Web. Don\u2019t try to maintain two expensive\ndistribution channels for a brand whose market is limited.\n\nYou can\u2019t do this overnight. You need transition time. We would gradually\nreduce the number of catalogs mailed and shift some of the savings into\npublicity and advertising programs for the Website. You need a way to drive\nprospects to your site.\n\nOne of the major advantages of ordering products from a computer rather\nthan from a catalog is the interactivity of the Website. You know instantly\nwhether or not the product is in stock in the color and size you want.\n\nThis, of course, is only a theoretical advantage. Many sites have yet to\nintegrate their warehousing operations with their order-entry systems. When\nyou call to order from a catalog, inevitably at least one of the items you\nwant is out of stock or back-ordered.\n\nShould every catalog company shift to the Web? Of course not. There is\nnever only one way to do anything. For certain products in certain\ncategories, the better strategy might be to remain a catalog-only company.\nAs catalog mailings taper off, the remaining companies in the field will find\nthat their individual catalogs have become more productive.\n\n3. THE ELABORATE FULL-COLOR BROCHURE WILL BECOME EXCEEDINGLY RARE.\n\nMany companies will rethink their use of expensive brochures, which are\nvirtually out-of-date the day they come off the press. It\u2019s a lot more efficient\nto let a prospect stroll through your Website to look at the same\ninformation.\n\nIf something catches the prospect\u2019s eye, they can always print out the page\nusing one of the many inexpensive color printers now on the market.\n\nOne way to promote a seminar, for example, is to send out inexpensive\nmass mailings (postcards maybe) and then invite prospects to get all the\ndetails on your Website.\n\nAnnual reports of corporations are another category of printed brochure that\nis headed for extinction. It may take a while, however, for the Securities and\nExchange Commission to change the regulations that govern their use.\n\n4. CLASSIFIED ADVERTISING WILL SHIFT TO THE WEB.\n\nA big chunk of newspapers\u2019 revenues comes from their classified\nadvertising. This is a category that will come under immense pressure from\nthe Web. Houses, apartments, and job listings, in particular.\n\nTake the help-wanted category, for example. The first Website to tackle this\ncategory was Monster.com, which today leads the Web in online job\nlistings.\n\nMonster.com boasts 800,000 job ads and a database of 16 million resumes.\nWhat\u2019s more, Monster.com is profitable, having racked up twelve\nconsecutive profitable quarters. In a recent quarter, the site generated $33\nmillion in operating profit on $129 million in revenue.\n\nLong term, the Internet will seriously erode classified advertising, a major\nsource of local newspaper revenues. What should the Daily Bugle do about\nthis?\n\nIn retrospect the answer is easy. Open a job-listing Website before\nMonster.com came on the scene. Who knows more about the help-wanted\nmarket than the newspaper industry? The companies that spend money\ntoday with Monster.com have been their customers for years.\n\nThat\u2019s the way it often is. The people who know the most about a given\nmarket or industry are often the least likely to see change coming. The\nmotto of many major corporations is: \u201cHear no change. See no change.\nSpeak no change.\u201d\n\n5. THE POSTAL SERVICE WON'T BE DELIVERING AS MUCH MAIL.\n\nThe words \u201cLetter Carrier\u201d used to be prominently displayed on postal\nservice uniforms. No more. Today the average letter carrier doesn\u2019t carry\nvery many letters. That business has gone electronic, either to phone,\nfacsimile, or e-mail.\n\nIn a recent year, more than four trillion e-mail messages were sent, more\nthan forty times the 99.7 billion pieces of first-class mail delivered by the\npostal service.\n\nThe largest segment of first-class mail today is bills, invoices, and financial\nstatements. The sending and paying of bills alone accounts for $17 billion,\n\nor almost 30 percent of the postal service\u2019s revenue. That segment is going\nto be especially vulnerable to the Internet.\n\nLook at what happens when a company bills a customer for a product or\nservice the customer has ordered\u2014for example, a telephone company\u2019s\nmonthly phone bill.\n\nThe telephone company\u2019s mainframe computer prints out an invoice, which\nis stuffed into an envelope, and first-class postage is applied. After the\npostal service delivers the bill, the customer writes a check, puts it in the\nreturn envelope, and adds a first-class postage stamp. After the postal\nservice delivers the envelope, the phone company opens the envelope and\ndeposits the check in its bank account. (So far the roundtrip postage alone\nhas cost sixty-eight cents, minus the postal service\u2019s small discount for\npresorted first-class mail.)\n\nWhat happens next is the interesting part. The bank\u2019s computers make an\nupward adjustment in the amount of money in the phone company\u2019s\naccount and a downward adjustment in the amount of money in the\ncustomer\u2019s account. (This, of course, is the case when both the seller and\nbuyer use the same bank. Otherwise some transactions between banks are\nnecessary.)\n\nAll that paperwork, all that postage, all that human effort just to shift a\nnumber in a computer from Column A to Column B.\n\nPeople forget that money, for the most part, is not steel engravings printed\non paper. It\u2019s not even gold in a vault. Money is electronic bits of\ninformation stored on computers around the world. To shift money from\none account to another, you shift the bits.\n\nThe sending and paying of bills online is an idea whose time has come. We\nforesee a constant rise in electronic banking and a constant decline in the\nnumber of pieces of first-class mail sent and received. This is a trend that\ncan\u2019t be stopped.\n\nIf you think that can\u2019t happen soon, look at the phenomenal rise in e-mail,\nwhich is increasing at the rate of almost 50 percent a year. Can e-banking be\nfar behind?\n\nAccording to a recent report issued by the General Accounting Office, \u201cThe\nPostal Service may be nearing the end of an era.\u201d\n\n6. FINANCIAL SERVICES OF ALL TYPES WILL SHIFT TO THE WEB.\n\nBecause money is nothing more than bits on a computer, the entire financial\nservices industry is headed for the Internet.\n\nIt just makes sense to have your bank account in your bedroom or office,\nwhere you can check invoices, pay bills, shift funds, and borrow money, all\nby manipulating bits on a bank\u2019s computer.\n\nThe computer revolutionized the banking industry once before with the\nintroduction of the automated teller machine. What the ATM has started, the\ncomputer (in combination with the Internet) will finish. There\u2019s no reason\nwhy banking and most financial transactions, including insurance and stock\nbrokerage, should not be handled on the Internet.\n\nShifting financial transactions to the Internet can result in substantial\nsavings. It costs, on average, one-tenth as much for a bank to handle a\nfinancial transaction on the Web as it does on an ATM machine. And one-\nfortieth as much on the Web as with a teller in the bank itself.\n\nThat\u2019s the tip of the financial iceberg. The real savings will come from\ninvoicing and bill paying. About seventy billion checks are issued in the\nUnited States every year. (That\u2019s 260 checks for every person.) Much of\nthis paper blizzard can be easily moved to the Net, saving money and\nimproving the record keeping of both businesses and individuals.\n\nOne concern, of course, is the inability of your computer to deal out real\nmoney the way an ATM machine does. But this might not turn out to be\nmuch of a problem. Paper money is declining in importance as more people\nshift to credit, debit, and check cards for the bulk of their purchases.\n\nYou can spend a week on the road (and we have) without using paper\nmoney, with the exception of small bills for tips, taxis, and newspapers.\nAnd even taxicab companies are starting to take credit cards.\n\nIt will probably be some time before bell-men at hotels or porters at airports\nswipe credit cards. (With credit cards, they would have to declare all of\ntheir tip income on their tax returns.)\n\n7. THE PARCEL DELIVERY BUSINESS WILL SOAR.\n\nThe Internet will greatly stimulate business for all of the parcel delivery\ncompanies. UPS (United Parcel Service) might want to consider changing\nits name to IPS (Internet Parcel Service).\n\nAs a result of the increases in parcel volume, you can expect delivery prices\nto hold steady or even decline.\n\nThe weak link in the system is the front door of the customer. With so many\nDINK (double income, no kids) families in the country, many customers\nwill not be home when the delivery person arrives.\n\nSome companies are already working on this problem. Smartbox, for\nexample, is a locked, reinforced box that comes in various sizes and sits\noutside your home. To allow access to all delivery services, the device will\nbe wired to the Internet. When the box owner makes an online purchase,\nspecial software will create and transmit a code for each order. A delivery\n\ndriver can punch in the code on a keypad to unlock the box and make the\ndelivery.\n\n8. INTERNET RETAILING WILL BECOME A PRICE GAME.\n\nWill most products be bought in cyberspace? Probably not. But the Internet\nwill drastically change the focus of most retailers.\n\nSome retailers are worried. Home Depot, which is on the verge of selling its\nown products over the Internet, is rapping the knuckles of suppliers that\nhave similar dreams. The retailer recently sent a letter to all of its vendors\ntelling them to think twice before selling their tools and equipment directly\nto consumers through their Websites.\n\n\u201cWe think it is shortsighted for vendors to ignore the added value that our\nretail stores contribute to the sales of their products,\u201d stated the Home\nDepot letter.\n\nThe company is worried that their vendors will sell products on the Web at\nprices lower than Home Depot. And they should be worried. The Internet is\ninherently a less expensive way to distribute a product or service.\n\nThe retail price game causes many problems for manufacturers. Retailers\noften demand exclusivity in their territories so they can advertise \u201cthe\nlowest price in town.\u201d Manufacturers go along with these demands by\nproducing a bewildering variety of models, colors, and sizes. (Mattress and\nbedding makers are notorious in this respect.)\n\nWal-Mart and the mass merchandisers are known for demanding special\nsizes so they can get bigger discounts and customers can\u2019t as easily\ncompare prices with the same products at other retail stores. Then there are\nspecial purchases, end-of-product runs, obsolete products, manufacturers\u2019\nseconds, and a host of other strategies for generating low prices on the retail\nfloor. There are also gray-market products brought in from other countries.\n(Which is why you might see a Mach 3 razor in Costco with the package\nprinted in French.)\n\nThe Internet will change the nature of retailing by pulling the plug on many\nof these \u201cprice\u201d promotions. If all the customer really wants is the absolute\nlowest price, then the place to shop is the Net.\n\nInstead of reading a lot of different ads or driving from store to store, a\nprospect can sit down at a keyboard and quickly compare prices on a\nsimilar item from a large number of sources.\n\nFurthermore, you can also use an \u201cagent\u201d to help you. Agent companies\nlike ClickTheButton, DealPilot, and RUSure have developed software that\nwill scan various shopping sites for price and delivery data, then sort the\ninformation (most often by price).\n\nDealTime.com, for example, advertises that it helps you find \u201cexactly what\nyou want, at the price you want, wherever you want.\u201d BookPricer.com will\nhelp you find \u201cthe lowest price for any book in under 30 seconds.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of books, Amazon.com was discounting bestsellers by up to 40\npercent. Booksamillion.com knocks 46 percent off bestsellers. (Some\npublishers don\u2019t give their own authors that big a discount. We should\nknow.)\n\nThen there\u2019s Buy.com with the tag line \u201cThe lowest prices on Earth.\u201d The\ncompany is ruthlessly committed to being the price leader, even if this\nmeans losing money on every sale. Its technology searches competitors\u2019\nsites to make sure Buy.com has the lowest prices on the Web. Recently the\nPalm III Organizer sold for $249 on Buy.com, $330 at CompUSA, and\n$369 at the manufacturer\u2019s own Website.\n\nBuy.com was the fastest-growing company in U.S. history. Unfortunately, it\nhasn\u2019t figured out how to make money. In a recent year the company did\n$788 million in sales, yet managed to lose $133 million. Will Buy.com\nbecome Bankrupt.com?\n\nAnd look at the personal computer market. With Dell and Gateway doing a\nbig business on the Web, physical retailers selling PCs have been under\npressure.\n\nCompUSA, the only physical retailer devoted mainly to personal\ncomputers, closed 14 of its 211 superstores. The Good Guys, which\noperates eighty consumer electronics stores in the West, announced that it\nwas leaving the PC business altogether.\n\nBear with us. Physical retailing has nothing to fear from the Internet. But it\nhas to change its current emphasis on low price. It has to find a new focus.\n\n9, OUTERNET RETAILING WILL BECOME A\nSERVICE GAME.\n\nJust as the rise of national brands put pressure on Sears to change its\nstrategy, the rise of the Internet will put pressure on retailers to change their\nstrategies, too.\n\nWhat retail strategies will work in the shadow of the Internet? We believe\nthe successful retailer of the future will need to play a service game, not a\nprice game. What you might call the Nordstrom approach. (There\u2019s no way\na physical retailer can compete with an Internet retailer on price.)\n\nThe successful outernet retailer of the future will have to emphasize the\ntwin aspects of the physical experience: Touch and Time, or what we have\nbeen calling \u201cT \u2018n\u2019 T.\u201d\n\nThe Touch aspect of the T \u2018n\u2019 T strategy involves the ability of the prospect\nto hold, feel, taste, smell, handle, and try the product, not just see and read\nabout it. (After all, you can see the product in full color on the Internet.)\n\nMany retailers will have to make their stores a lot more \u201ctouch\u201d friendly.\nToo many products are locked in glass cabinets or entombed in packaging\nthat greatly discourages handling.\n\nIn this connection, Saturn\u2019s success in creating a more customer-friendly\nenvironment is a good pattern for many traditional retailers to adopt.\n\nThe Sharper Image also places a high value on the touch aspect of its stores.\nCustomers are encouraged to touch and try the variety of electronic devices\nin the store.\n\nThe Sephora cosmetic chain is another example of the future of retailing.\nWith its attractive environment, helpful staff, and complete lines, Sephora\nprovides everything a cosmetic buyer might want\u2014except low prices. If\nyou want the absolute lowest cosmetic price, you\u2019ll have to go to the Net.\n\nMotion-picture exhibitors have gone through this same process as they have\nupgraded their facilities to compete with HBO, Showtime, and free movies\non television. Now you will find smaller theaters, larger, more comfortable\nseats, multiplex screens. Even the popcorn is getting better.\n\nPrice isn\u2019t everything. You can drink beer cheaper at home, but every night\nthe bars in our neighborhood are filled with twentysomethings spending\ntheir bundles on Bud Light.\n\nThe Time aspect of the T \u2018n\u2019 T strategy seems obvious. Unlike on the Net,\nyou save time when you buy from a physical retailer because you don\u2019t\nhave to wait for FedEx or UPS to deliver your purchase.\n\nYet, the time half of an effective T \u2018n\u2019 T strategy is more subtle than that. In\ntheory you don\u2019t wait for your purchases when you buy at retail. But in\npractice the prospect is often frustrated because the store is out of stock.\n\u201cCome back next week when our new shipment will be in.\u201d\n\nThe customer of the future will not tolerate a physical retailer with frequent\nout-of-stock problems. Many of these problems, of course, stem from the\nretailer\u2019s emphasis on low price, which leads to special deals and special\npurchases. Abandoning a low-price strategy means that a retailer can\nconcentrate on keeping its inventory up-to-date and complete.\n\nNot counting supermarkets, convenience stores, and similar establishments,\nroughly half the prospects walk out of a general retail store without buying\nanything. The major reason is that the store didn\u2019t have in stock what the\ncustomer wanted.\n\nMost business will probably not be conducted over the Web. But the\nInternet revolution will force every business to adjust its strategy. From a\nprice game to a service game. T \u2018n\u2019 T, if you will.\n\n10. INTERNET SEARCH ENGINES WILL DECLINE\nIN IMPORTANCE.\n\nSearch engines like Yahoo! are busy adding functions when they should be\nbattening down the hatches for the rough water ahead. Search engines (or\nportals) are going to be less important in the future than they were in the\npast.\n\nThink of it this way. People get to know the Internet brands they want to do\nbusiness with. When they do, they will go straight to the site instead of\nmaking a detour through a search engine. If we want to buy a book, we go\nto Amazon.com. We don\u2019t go to Yahoo! to find out who on the Net sells\nbooks.\n\nThis view of the future is consistent with one\u2019s own personal experience in\nthe real world. Let\u2019s say you move to a new community. You might pick up\nthe yellow pages (paper search engine) every time you go out shopping.\nAfter you become familiar with the stores in your new community, you\nmake most of your trips without first consulting the yellow pages.\n\nYahoo! is the welcome wagon on the Internet. Great for the new arrival, but\nless important for the experienced Internet user.\n\n11. THE INTERNET WILL CHANGE MANY ASPECTS OF THE TELEPHONE INDUSTRY.\n\nIn many ways, the Internet and the telephone are similar. Both are\ninformation and communications media, but the percentages are different.\n\nIf the Internet is 80 percent information and 20 percent communications,\nthe telephone is the opposite. Twenty percent information and 80 percent\ncommunications.\n\nThe information segment of the telephone medium is a large business in\n\nitself even though it accounts for only 20 percent or so of all phone calls.\nThe visible symbol of this information segment, of course, is the yellow\n\npages. \u201cLet your fingers do the walking.\u201d\n\nThat will change. The Internet will become a direct competitor to the\ntelephone. (Fortunately for the phone companies, most people will continue\n\nto use phone lines to connect to the Internet.)\n\nOn the communications side, e-mail will replace many phone and fax calls.\nOn the information side, the Net will become an electronic yellow pages.\n\nWhat television did to radio, the Internet will do to the telephone. TV\nvirtually wiped out entertainment on radio. The Internet will do the same\nfor information on the telephone. Forget 777-FILM and the ten minutes it\ntakes to get playing times for your favorite movie.\n\nFor many people the change couldn\u2019t come too soon. How many hours have\nyou spent punching in numbers trying to reach someone in Corporate\nAmerica to help you? The automated call-routing systems used by most\nnational companies are a disgrace.\n\nFirst they answer your call with a variety of options. After punching in an\nendless series of numbers, you get the following message: \u201cAll of our\nrepresentatives are currently helping other customers; the next available\nagent will be with you shortly.\u201d\n\nBy removing the human interface, the Internet promises to greatly speed up\nthe information functions formerly handled on the phone.\n\nAirline reservations, movie tickets, reservations for rock concerts and\nsporting events, and restaurant hours and reservations are just some of the\ninformation-related transactions that will be moving from the phone to the\nNet.\n\n12. THERE WILL BE SPEED BUMPS ON THE INTERNET.\n\nIn spite of our rosy predictions, the Internet faces two speed bumps in the\nnear future.\n\nOne is the Internet bubble itself. Just because two guys under thirty start a\nWebsite with $30 million in venture-capital funds doesn\u2019t automatically\nmake the site worth $3 billion. The bubble has burst.\n\nIn spite of its enormous acceptance, it\u2019s going to be difficult to make money\non the Net. The Internet is a high-volume, low-margin medium. In other\nwords, a price game. Investors didn\u2019t truly understand the nature of this\nmedium. While the Internet is wildly popular, it will not be wildly\nprofitable. And profit is what Wall Street ultimately seeks.\n\nThe Internet will survive and prosper. But many Internet companies will\nnot.\n\nThe second speed bump along the way is the tax issue. Currently there is a\nmoratorium on state and federal taxes.\n\nThat will change. The 46 states, 4,831 cities, and 1,151 counties that impose\nsales taxes are not going to give the Internet a free ride forever. Sooner or\nlater they are going to want their cut.\n\nThe computer we recently purchased on the Net would have cost $111.72\nmore (to cover taxes) if bought locally. Sooner or later, the governor, the\nmayor, or the county tax commissioner is going to want to get his or her\nhands on that $111.72. You can count on it.\n\nWhat\u2019s next? What will come after the Internet? What will be the\ntechnological revolution of the first decade of the next millennium? Who\nknows?\n\n\u00a2 It could be the optical computer with photons carrying the ball in place\nof electrons. Such a development could drastically reduce the size and\nincrease the speed and memory capacities of all computing devices,\nmaking a mockery of Moore\u2019s law.\n\n\u00a2 It could be a new engine, light in weight, highly efficient, and\nultrapowerful. Such a development could revolutionize the\ntransportation industries: automotive, aircraft, shipping, railroad.\n\n\u00a2 It could be a new development in genetics, especially in the field of\nagriculture. Such a development could revolutionize the way crops are\nplanted, grown, and harvested.\n\nWhatever the future brings, you can be sure of one thing: It will be a\ndestabilizing development. It will change the way you manage your\nbusiness and the way you build your brands.\n\nAnd there will be more immutable laws of branding.\n'.

Some products and services won\u2019t.\n\nIf your product or service is in the latter category, you might think that you\nhave nothing to gain from the Net. But, in our opinion, you would be\nwrong.\n\nThe Internet will affect your business whether you jump on the Web or not.\nWhat changes will the Internet bring to your business and your life? The\nfuture is always fuzzy, but here are some predictions.\n\n1. PAPER DIRECTORIES ARE DOOMED.\n\nYou won\u2019t be surprised to learn that the Encyclopaedia Britannica,\npublished since 1768, will no longer be available in a paper version. From\nnow on the encyclopedia will only be available online or on CD-ROM.\n\nThe companies that publish \u201cyellow pages\u201d telephone directories ought to\nbe concerned. The fingers that used to go walking though those directories\nare now moving to the keyboard.\n\n\u201cInformation at your fingertips,\u201d said Microsoft in its early advertising\nefforts. And it\u2019s true. The plumber, the electrician, the veterinarian, and the\nauto dealer can be more quickly found and evaluated on an electronic\ndirectory than on a paper one.\n\nWhat will happen to the $12 billion that companies spend annually on\nyellow-pages advertising? Good question. We\u2019d be concerned if we made\nour living publishing or selling space in a paper directory.\n\nPaper directories are doomed because of the interactivity of the Internet.\nThe user can manipulate a single computer database in literally thousands\nof ways.\n\nFurthermore, the database can be updated daily, even hourly. A typical\n\u201cyellow pages\u201d directory comes out once a year and is out-of-date the day it\nlands on your doorstep.\n\nEven some great paper institutions are going to have trouble competing in\nthe future. The 116-year-old full Oxford English Dictionary could cease to\nexist after it goes online on a subscription basis. The dictionary, which runs\nto twenty volumes and costs $2,900, is a dinosaur in the Internet age.\n\n2. PAPER CATALOGS FACE AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE.\n\nMailboxes across the county are stuffed with countless catalogs every day.\nAccording to one estimate, 17.6 billion catalogs were mailed in the U.S. last\nyear. That\u2019s sixty-four catalogs for every man, woman, and child.\n\nThat may change. Catalogs of all types will find themselves under severe\nelectronic competition. There are a number of reasons why a Web catalog is\nsuperior to a paper one.\n\nAn electronic catalog can be interactive. You can sort by types, by sizes, by\ncolors, by prices, by weights, and so on. Think Amazon.com, for example.\nYou can sort by author, by title, by subject, by category. In contrast, a paper\ncatalog of books is so impractical that few are printed and distributed,\nexcept for narrow selections.\n\nFurthermore, an electronic catalog is much less expensive to distribute.\nOnce the material is composed in an electronic format, the cost of\ndistribution is essentially zero. Manufacturing a paper catalog, however, can\nbe costly. Just to print those 17.6 billion mail-order missiles requires 3.35\nmillion tons of paper.\n\nSo what do you do if you\u2019re L.L. Bean? Good question.\n\nSales have been essentially flat at L.L. Bean for the last few years. That\nputs pressure on the bottom line because the company prints and mails\ncatalogs thirty times a year. And printing and mailing costs continue to rise.\n\nSo L.L. Bean opens up a Website to sell the same merchandise found in the\ncatalog. Is this a good idea or not?\n\nYes and no. In general, when you broaden the scope of a brand, you weaken\nthe brand. In the long run, multiple distribution channels substantially\nincrease costs and do not do much to increase sales.\n\nA fully functioning Website with computer hardware and service people\nbacked by a programming staff is not an inexpensive proposition.\n\nTo get the company moving again, L.L. Bean is opening a chain of retail\nstores, in addition to its nine factory outlet stores. Outlets are one thing,\n\nthey help you get rid of leftovers. When you open retail stores, however,\nyou are competing directly with yourself, never a good idea.\n\nA better solution for L.L. Bean and other catalog companies is to shift the\nentire operation to the Web. Don\u2019t try to maintain two expensive\ndistribution channels for a brand whose market is limited.\n\nYou can\u2019t do this overnight. You need transition time. We would gradually\nreduce the number of catalogs mailed and shift some of the savings into\npublicity and advertising programs for the Website. You need a way to drive\nprospects to your site.\n\nOne of the major advantages of ordering products from a computer rather\nthan from a catalog is the interactivity of the Website. You know instantly\nwhether or not the product is in stock in the color and size you want.\n\nThis, of course, is only a theoretical advantage. Many sites have yet to\nintegrate their warehousing operations with their order-entry systems. When\nyou call to order from a catalog, inevitably at least one of the items you\nwant is out of stock or back-ordered.\n\nShould every catalog company shift to the Web? Of course not. There is\nnever only one way to do anything. For certain products in certain\ncategories, the better strategy might be to remain a catalog-only company.\nAs catalog mailings taper off, the remaining companies in the field will find\nthat their individual catalogs have become more productive.\n\n3. THE ELABORATE FULL-COLOR BROCHURE WILL BECOME EXCEEDINGLY RARE.\n\nMany companies will rethink their use of expensive brochures, which are\nvirtually out-of-date the day they come off the press. It\u2019s a lot more efficient\nto let a prospect stroll through your Website to look at the same\ninformation.\n\nIf something catches the prospect\u2019s eye, they can always print out the page\nusing one of the many inexpensive color printers now on the market.\n\nOne way to promote a seminar, for example, is to send out inexpensive\nmass mailings (postcards maybe) and then invite prospects to get all the\ndetails on your Website.\n\nAnnual reports of corporations are another category of printed brochure that\nis headed for extinction. It may take a while, however, for the Securities and\nExchange Commission to change the regulations that govern their use.\n\n4. CLASSIFIED ADVERTISING WILL SHIFT TO THE WEB.\n\nA big chunk of newspapers\u2019 revenues comes from their classified\nadvertising. This is a category that will come under immense pressure from\nthe Web. Houses, apartments, and job listings, in particular.\n\nTake the help-wanted category, for example. The first Website to tackle this\ncategory was Monster.com, which today leads the Web in online job\nlistings.\n\nMonster.com boasts 800,000 job ads and a database of 16 million resumes.\nWhat\u2019s more, Monster.com is profitable, having racked up twelve\nconsecutive profitable quarters. In a recent quarter, the site generated $33\nmillion in operating profit on $129 million in revenue.\n\nLong term, the Internet will seriously erode classified advertising, a major\nsource of local newspaper revenues. What should the Daily Bugle do about\nthis?\n\nIn retrospect the answer is easy. Open a job-listing Website before\nMonster.com came on the scene. Who knows more about the help-wanted\nmarket than the newspaper industry? The companies that spend money\ntoday with Monster.com have been their customers for years.\n\nThat\u2019s the way it often is. The people who know the most about a given\nmarket or industry are often the least likely to see change coming. The\nmotto of many major corporations is: \u201cHear no change. See no change.\nSpeak no change.\u201d\n\n5. THE POSTAL SERVICE WON'T BE DELIVERING AS MUCH MAIL.\n\nThe words \u201cLetter Carrier\u201d used to be prominently displayed on postal\nservice uniforms. No more. Today the average letter carrier doesn\u2019t carry\nvery many letters. That business has gone electronic, either to phone,\nfacsimile, or e-mail.\n\nIn a recent year, more than four trillion e-mail messages were sent, more\nthan forty times the 99.7 billion pieces of first-class mail delivered by the\npostal service.\n\nThe largest segment of first-class mail today is bills, invoices, and financial\nstatements. The sending and paying of bills alone accounts for $17 billion,\n\nor almost 30 percent of the postal service\u2019s revenue. That segment is going\nto be especially vulnerable to the Internet.\n\nLook at what happens when a company bills a customer for a product or\nservice the customer has ordered\u2014for example, a telephone company\u2019s\nmonthly phone bill.\n\nThe telephone company\u2019s mainframe computer prints out an invoice, which\nis stuffed into an envelope, and first-class postage is applied. After the\npostal service delivers the bill, the customer writes a check, puts it in the\nreturn envelope, and adds a first-class postage stamp. After the postal\nservice delivers the envelope, the phone company opens the envelope and\ndeposits the check in its bank account. (So far the roundtrip postage alone\nhas cost sixty-eight cents, minus the postal service\u2019s small discount for\npresorted first-class mail.)\n\nWhat happens next is the interesting part. The bank\u2019s computers make an\nupward adjustment in the amount of money in the phone company\u2019s\naccount and a downward adjustment in the amount of money in the\ncustomer\u2019s account. (This, of course, is the case when both the seller and\nbuyer use the same bank. Otherwise some transactions between banks are\nnecessary.)\n\nAll that paperwork, all that postage, all that human effort just to shift a\nnumber in a computer from Column A to Column B.\n\nPeople forget that money, for the most part, is not steel engravings printed\non paper. It\u2019s not even gold in a vault. Money is electronic bits of\ninformation stored on computers around the world. To shift money from\none account to another, you shift the bits.\n\nThe sending and paying of bills online is an idea whose time has come. We\nforesee a constant rise in electronic banking and a constant decline in the\nnumber of pieces of first-class mail sent and received. This is a trend that\ncan\u2019t be stopped.\n\nIf you think that can\u2019t happen soon, look at the phenomenal rise in e-mail,\nwhich is increasing at the rate of almost 50 percent a year. Can e-banking be\nfar behind?\n\nAccording to a recent report issued by the General Accounting Office, \u201cThe\nPostal Service may be nearing the end of an era.\u201d\n\n6. FINANCIAL SERVICES OF ALL TYPES WILL SHIFT TO THE WEB.\n\nBecause money is nothing more than bits on a computer, the entire financial\nservices industry is headed for the Internet.\n\nIt just makes sense to have your bank account in your bedroom or office,\nwhere you can check invoices, pay bills, shift funds, and borrow money, all\nby manipulating bits on a bank\u2019s computer.\n\nThe computer revolutionized the banking industry once before with the\nintroduction of the automated teller machine. What the ATM has started, the\ncomputer (in combination with the Internet) will finish. There\u2019s no reason\nwhy banking and most financial transactions, including insurance and stock\nbrokerage, should not be handled on the Internet.\n\nShifting financial transactions to the Internet can result in substantial\nsavings. It costs, on average, one-tenth as much for a bank to handle a\nfinancial transaction on the Web as it does on an ATM machine. And one-\nfortieth as much on the Web as with a teller in the bank itself.\n\nThat\u2019s the tip of the financial iceberg. The real savings will come from\ninvoicing and bill paying. About seventy billion checks are issued in the\nUnited States every year. (That\u2019s 260 checks for every person.) Much of\nthis paper blizzard can be easily moved to the Net, saving money and\nimproving the record keeping of both businesses and individuals.\n\nOne concern, of course, is the inability of your computer to deal out real\nmoney the way an ATM machine does. But this might not turn out to be\nmuch of a problem. Paper money is declining in importance as more people\nshift to credit, debit, and check cards for the bulk of their purchases.\n\nYou can spend a week on the road (and we have) without using paper\nmoney, with the exception of small bills for tips, taxis, and newspapers.\nAnd even taxicab companies are starting to take credit cards.\n\nIt will probably be some time before bell-men at hotels or porters at airports\nswipe credit cards. (With credit cards, they would have to declare all of\ntheir tip income on their tax returns.)\n\n7. THE PARCEL DELIVERY BUSINESS WILL SOAR.\n\nThe Internet will greatly stimulate business for all of the parcel delivery\ncompanies. UPS (United Parcel Service) might want to consider changing\nits name to IPS (Internet Parcel Service).\n\nAs a result of the increases in parcel volume, you can expect delivery prices\nto hold steady or even decline.\n\nThe weak link in the system is the front door of the customer. With so many\nDINK (double income, no kids) families in the country, many customers\nwill not be home when the delivery person arrives.\n\nSome companies are already working on this problem. Smartbox, for\nexample, is a locked, reinforced box that comes in various sizes and sits\noutside your home. To allow access to all delivery services, the device will\nbe wired to the Internet. When the box owner makes an online purchase,\nspecial software will create and transmit a code for each order. A delivery\n\ndriver can punch in the code on a keypad to unlock the box and make the\ndelivery.\n\n8. INTERNET RETAILING WILL BECOME A PRICE GAME.\n\nWill most products be bought in cyberspace? Probably not. But the Internet\nwill drastically change the focus of most retailers.\n\nSome retailers are worried. Home Depot, which is on the verge of selling its\nown products over the Internet, is rapping the knuckles of suppliers that\nhave similar dreams. The retailer recently sent a letter to all of its vendors\ntelling them to think twice before selling their tools and equipment directly\nto consumers through their Websites.\n\n\u201cWe think it is shortsighted for vendors to ignore the added value that our\nretail stores contribute to the sales of their products,\u201d stated the Home\nDepot letter.\n\nThe company is worried that their vendors will sell products on the Web at\nprices lower than Home Depot. And they should be worried. The Internet is\ninherently a less expensive way to distribute a product or service.\n\nThe retail price game causes many problems for manufacturers. Retailers\noften demand exclusivity in their territories so they can advertise \u201cthe\nlowest price in town.\u201d Manufacturers go along with these demands by\nproducing a bewildering variety of models, colors, and sizes. (Mattress and\nbedding makers are notorious in this respect.)\n\nWal-Mart and the mass merchandisers are known for demanding special\nsizes so they can get bigger discounts and customers can\u2019t as easily\ncompare prices with the same products at other retail stores. Then there are\nspecial purchases, end-of-product runs, obsolete products, manufacturers\u2019\nseconds, and a host of other strategies for generating low prices on the retail\nfloor. There are also gray-market products brought in from other countries.\n(Which is why you might see a Mach 3 razor in Costco with the package\nprinted in French.)\n\nThe Internet will change the nature of retailing by pulling the plug on many\nof these \u201cprice\u201d promotions. If all the customer really wants is the absolute\nlowest price, then the place to shop is the Net.\n\nInstead of reading a lot of different ads or driving from store to store, a\nprospect can sit down at a keyboard and quickly compare prices on a\nsimilar item from a large number of sources.\n\nFurthermore, you can also use an \u201cagent\u201d to help you. Agent companies\nlike ClickTheButton, DealPilot, and RUSure have developed software that\nwill scan various shopping sites for price and delivery data, then sort the\ninformation (most often by price).\n\nDealTime.com, for example, advertises that it helps you find \u201cexactly what\nyou want, at the price you want, wherever you want.\u201d BookPricer.com will\nhelp you find \u201cthe lowest price for any book in under 30 seconds.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of books, Amazon.com was discounting bestsellers by up to 40\npercent. Booksamillion.com knocks 46 percent off bestsellers. (Some\npublishers don\u2019t give their own authors that big a discount. We should\nknow.)\n\nThen there\u2019s Buy.com with the tag line \u201cThe lowest prices on Earth.\u201d The\ncompany is ruthlessly committed to being the price leader, even if this\nmeans losing money on every sale. Its technology searches competitors\u2019\nsites to make sure Buy.com has the lowest prices on the Web. Recently the\nPalm III Organizer sold for $249 on Buy.com, $330 at CompUSA, and\n$369 at the manufacturer\u2019s own Website.\n\nBuy.com was the fastest-growing company in U.S. history. Unfortunately, it\nhasn\u2019t figured out how to make money. In a recent year the company did\n$788 million in sales, yet managed to lose $133 million. Will Buy.com\nbecome Bankrupt.com?\n\nAnd look at the personal computer market. With Dell and Gateway doing a\nbig business on the Web, physical retailers selling PCs have been under\npressure.\n\nCompUSA, the only physical retailer devoted mainly to personal\ncomputers, closed 14 of its 211 superstores. The Good Guys, which\noperates eighty consumer electronics stores in the West, announced that it\nwas leaving the PC business altogether.\n\nBear with us. Physical retailing has nothing to fear from the Internet. But it\nhas to change its current emphasis on low price. It has to find a new focus.\n\n9, OUTERNET RETAILING WILL BECOME A\nSERVICE GAME.\n\nJust as the rise of national brands put pressure on Sears to change its\nstrategy, the rise of the Internet will put pressure on retailers to change their\nstrategies, too.\n\nWhat retail strategies will work in the shadow of the Internet? We believe\nthe successful retailer of the future will need to play a service game, not a\nprice game. What you might call the Nordstrom approach. (There\u2019s no way\na physical retailer can compete with an Internet retailer on price.)\n\nThe successful outernet retailer of the future will have to emphasize the\ntwin aspects of the physical experience: Touch and Time, or what we have\nbeen calling \u201cT \u2018n\u2019 T.\u201d\n\nThe Touch aspect of the T \u2018n\u2019 T strategy involves the ability of the prospect\nto hold, feel, taste, smell, handle, and try the product, not just see and read\nabout it. (After all, you can see the product in full color on the Internet.)\n\nMany retailers will have to make their stores a lot more \u201ctouch\u201d friendly.\nToo many products are locked in glass cabinets or entombed in packaging\nthat greatly discourages handling.\n\nIn this connection, Saturn\u2019s success in creating a more customer-friendly\nenvironment is a good pattern for many traditional retailers to adopt.\n\nThe Sharper Image also places a high value on the touch aspect of its stores.\nCustomers are encouraged to touch and try the variety of electronic devices\nin the store.\n\nThe Sephora cosmetic chain is another example of the future of retailing.\nWith its attractive environment, helpful staff, and complete lines, Sephora\nprovides everything a cosmetic buyer might want\u2014except low prices. If\nyou want the absolute lowest cosmetic price, you\u2019ll have to go to the Net.\n\nMotion-picture exhibitors have gone through this same process as they have\nupgraded their facilities to compete with HBO, Showtime, and free movies\non television. Now you will find smaller theaters, larger, more comfortable\nseats, multiplex screens. Even the popcorn is getting better.\n\nPrice isn\u2019t everything. You can drink beer cheaper at home, but every night\nthe bars in our neighborhood are filled with twentysomethings spending\ntheir bundles on Bud Light.\n\nThe Time aspect of the T \u2018n\u2019 T strategy seems obvious. Unlike on the Net,\nyou save time when you buy from a physical retailer because you don\u2019t\nhave to wait for FedEx or UPS to deliver your purchase.\n\nYet, the time half of an effective T \u2018n\u2019 T strategy is more subtle than that. In\ntheory you don\u2019t wait for your purchases when you buy at retail. But in\npractice the prospect is often frustrated because the store is out of stock.\n\u201cCome back next week when our new shipment will be in.\u201d\n\nThe customer of the future will not tolerate a physical retailer with frequent\nout-of-stock problems. Many of these problems, of course, stem from the\nretailer\u2019s emphasis on low price, which leads to special deals and special\npurchases. Abandoning a low-price strategy means that a retailer can\nconcentrate on keeping its inventory up-to-date and complete.\n\nNot counting supermarkets, convenience stores, and similar establishments,\nroughly half the prospects walk out of a general retail store without buying\nanything. The major reason is that the store didn\u2019t have in stock what the\ncustomer wanted.\n\nMost business will probably not be conducted over the Web. But the\nInternet revolution will force every business to adjust its strategy. From a\nprice game to a service game. T \u2018n\u2019 T, if you will.\n\n10. INTERNET SEARCH ENGINES WILL DECLINE\nIN IMPORTANCE.\n\nSearch engines like Yahoo! are busy adding functions when they should be\nbattening down the hatches for the rough water ahead. Search engines (or\nportals) are going to be less important in the future than they were in the\npast.\n\nThink of it this way. People get to know the Internet brands they want to do\nbusiness with. When they do, they will go straight to the site instead of\nmaking a detour through a search engine. If we want to buy a book, we go\nto Amazon.com. We don\u2019t go to Yahoo! to find out who on the Net sells\nbooks.\n\nThis view of the future is consistent with one\u2019s own personal experience in\nthe real world. Let\u2019s say you move to a new community. You might pick up\nthe yellow pages (paper search engine) every time you go out shopping.\nAfter you become familiar with the stores in your new community, you\nmake most of your trips without first consulting the yellow pages.\n\nYahoo! is the welcome wagon on the Internet. Great for the new arrival, but\nless important for the experienced Internet user.\n\n11. THE INTERNET WILL CHANGE MANY ASPECTS OF THE TELEPHONE INDUSTRY.\n\nIn many ways, the Internet and the telephone are similar. Both are\ninformation and communications media, but the percentages are different.\n\nIf the Internet is 80 percent information and 20 percent communications,\nthe telephone is the opposite. Twenty percent information and 80 percent\ncommunications.\n\nThe information segment of the telephone medium is a large business in\n\nitself even though it accounts for only 20 percent or so of all phone calls.\nThe visible symbol of this information segment, of course, is the yellow\n\npages. \u201cLet your fingers do the walking.\u201d\n\nThat will change. The Internet will become a direct competitor to the\ntelephone. (Fortunately for the phone companies, most people will continue\n\nto use phone lines to connect to the Internet.)\n\nOn the communications side, e-mail will replace many phone and fax calls.\nOn the information side, the Net will become an electronic yellow pages.\n\nWhat television did to radio, the Internet will do to the telephone. TV\nvirtually wiped out entertainment on radio. The Internet will do the same\nfor information on the telephone. Forget 777-FILM and the ten minutes it\ntakes to get playing times for your favorite movie.\n\nFor many people the change couldn\u2019t come too soon. How many hours have\nyou spent punching in numbers trying to reach someone in Corporate\nAmerica to help you? The automated call-routing systems used by most\nnational companies are a disgrace.\n\nFirst they answer your call with a variety of options. After punching in an\nendless series of numbers, you get the following message: \u201cAll of our\nrepresentatives are currently helping other customers; the next available\nagent will be with you shortly.\u201d\n\nBy removing the human interface, the Internet promises to greatly speed up\nthe information functions formerly handled on the phone.\n\nAirline reservations, movie tickets, reservations for rock concerts and\nsporting events, and restaurant hours and reservations are just some of the\ninformation-related transactions that will be moving from the phone to the\nNet.\n\n12. THERE WILL BE SPEED BUMPS ON THE INTERNET.\n\nIn spite of our rosy predictions, the Internet faces two speed bumps in the\nnear future.\n\nOne is the Internet bubble itself. Just because two guys under thirty start a\nWebsite with $30 million in venture-capital funds doesn\u2019t automatically\nmake the site worth $3 billion. The bubble has burst.\n\nIn spite of its enormous acceptance, it\u2019s going to be difficult to make money\non the Net. The Internet is a high-volume, low-margin medium. In other\nwords, a price game. Investors didn\u2019t truly understand the nature of this\nmedium. While the Internet is wildly popular, it will not be wildly\nprofitable. And profit is what Wall Street ultimately seeks.\n\nThe Internet will survive and prosper. But many Internet companies will\nnot.\n\nThe second speed bump along the way is the tax issue. Currently there is a\nmoratorium on state and federal taxes.\n\nThat will change. The 46 states, 4,831 cities, and 1,151 counties that impose\nsales taxes are not going to give the Internet a free ride forever. Sooner or\nlater they are going to want their cut.\n\nThe computer we recently purchased on the Net would have cost $111.72\nmore (to cover taxes) if bought locally. Sooner or later, the governor, the\nmayor, or the county tax commissioner is going to want to get his or her\nhands on that $111.72. You can count on it.\n\nWhat\u2019s next? What will come after the Internet? What will be the\ntechnological revolution of the first decade of the next millennium? Who\nknows?\n\n\u00a2 It could be the optical computer with photons carrying the ball in place\nof electrons. Such a development could drastically reduce the size and\nincrease the speed and memory capacities of all computing devices,\nmaking a mockery of Moore\u2019s law.\n\n\u00a2 It could be a new engine, light in weight, highly efficient, and\nultrapowerful. Such a development could revolutionize the\ntransportation industries: automotive, aircraft, shipping, railroad.\n\n\u00a2 It could be a new development in genetics, especially in the field of\nagriculture. Such a development could revolutionize the way crops are\nplanted, grown, and harvested.\n\nWhatever the future brings, you can be sure of one thing: It will be a\ndestabilizing development. It will change the way you manage your\nbusiness and the way you build your brands.\n\nAnd there will be more immutable laws of branding.\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}
