Below is an excerpt from my book titled '48 Laws of Power', specifically from Chapter '48 Laws of Power', Section '48 Laws of Power'. The original text is: '48 Laws of Power\n\nLAW 1\n\nNEVER OUTSHINE THE MASTER\n\nAlways make those above you feel comfortably superior. In your\ndesire to please or impress them, do not go\n\ntoo far in displaying your talents or you might accomplish the\noppositeinspire fear and insecurity. Make\n\nyour masters appear more brilliant than they are and you will\nattain the heights of power.\n\nLAW 2\n\nNEVER PUT TOO MUCH TRUST IN FRIENDS, LEARN\nHOW TO USE ENEMIES\n\nBe wary of friendsthey will betray you more quickly, for they are\neasily aroused to envy. They also become spoiled and tyrannical. But\nhire a former enemy and he will be more loyal than a friend, because\nhe has more to prove. In fact, you have more to fear from friends than\nfrom enemies. If you have no enemies, find a way to make them.\n\nLAW 3\n\nCONCEAL YOUR INTENTIONS\n\nKeep people off-balance and in the dark by never revealing the\npurpose behind your actions. If they have no\n\nclue what you are up to, they cannot prepare a defense. Guide\nthem far enough down the wrong path, envelop\n\nthem in enough smoke, and by the time they realize your\nintentions, it will be too late.\n\nLAW 4\n\nALWAYS SAY LESS THAN NECESSARY\n\nWhen you are trying to impress people with words, the more you\nsay, the more common you appear, and the less in control. Even if you\nare saying something banal, it will seem original if you make it vague,\nopen-ended, and sphinxlike. Powerful people impress and intimidate\nby saying less. The more you say, the more likely you are to say\nsomething foolish.\n\nLAW 5\n\nSO MUCH DEPENDS ON REPUTATIONGUARD IT WITH\nYOUR LIFE\n\nReputation is the cornerstone of power. Through reputation alone\nyou can intimidate and win; once it slips, however, you are vulnerable,\nand will be attacked on all sides. Make your reputation unassailable.\nAlways be alert to potential attacks and thwart them before they\nhappen. Meanwhile, learn to destroy your enemies by opening holes in\ntheir own reputations. Then stand aside and let public opinion hang\nthem.\n\nLAW 6\n\nCOURT ATTENTION AT ALL COST\n\nEverything is judged by its appearance; what is unseen counts for\nnothing. Never let yourself get lost in the\n\ncrowd, then, or buried in oblivion. Stand out. Be conspicuous, at\nall cost. Make yourself a magnet of attention\n\nby appearing larger, more colorful, more mysterious than the\nbland and timid masses.\n\nLAW 7\n\nGET OTHERS TO DO THE WORK FOR YOU, BUT ALWAYS\nTAKE THE CREDIT\n\nUse the wisdom, knowledge, and legwork of other people to\nfurther your own cause. Not only will such assistance save you\nvaluable time and energy, it will give you a godlike aura of efficiency\nand speed. In the end your helpers will be forgotten and you will be\nremembered. Never do yourself what others can do for you.\n\nLAW 8\n\nMAKE OTHER PEOPLE COME TO YOUUSE BAIT IF\nNECESSARY\n\nWhen you force the other person to act, you are the one in\ncontrol. It is always better to make your opponent\n\ncome to you, abandoning his own plans in the process. Lure him\nwith fabulous gainsthen attack. You hold\n\nthe cards.\n\nLAW 9\n\nWIN THROUGH YOUR ACTIONS, NEVER THROUGH\nARGUMENT Any momentary triumph you think you have gained\n\nthrough argument is really a Pyrrhic victory: The resentment and ill\nwill you stir up is stronger and lasts longer than any momentary\nchange of opinion. It is much more powerful to get others to agree\nwith you through your actions, without saying a word. Demonstrate,\ndo not explicate.\n\nLAW 10\n\nINFECTION: AVOID THE UNHAPPY AND UNLUCKY\n\nYou can die from someone else's miseryemotional states are as\ninfectious as diseases. You may feel you are\n\nhelping the drowning man but you are only precipitating your\nown disaster. The unfortunate sometimes draw\n\nmisfortune on themselves; they will also draw it on you.\nAssociate with the happy and fortunate instead.\n\nLAW 11\n\nLEARN TO KEEP PEOPLE DEPENDENT ON YOU\n\nTo maintain your independence you must always be needed and\nwanted. The more you are relied on, the more\n\nfreedom you have. Make people depend on you for their\nhappiness and prosperity and you have nothing to fear.\n\nNever teach them enough so that they can do without you.\n\nLAW 12\n\nUSE SELECTIVE HONESTY AND GENEROSITY TO\nDISARM YOUR VICTIM\n\nOne sincere and honest move will cover over dozens of dishonest\nones. Open-hearted gestures of honesty and generosity bringdown the\nguard of even the most suspicious people. Once your selective honesty\nopens a hole in their armor, you can deceive and manipulate them at\nwill. A timely gifta Trojan horsewill serve the same purpose.\n\nLAW 13\n\nWHEN ASKING FOR HELP, APPEAL TO PEOPLE'S SELF-\nINTEREST, NEVER TO THEIR MERCY OR GRATITUDE If you\nneed to turn to an ally for help, do not bother to remind him of your\npast assistance and good deeds. He will find a way to ignore you.\nInstead, uncover something in your request, or in your alliance with\nhim, that will benefit him, and emphasize it out of all proportion. He\nwill respond enthusiastically when he sees something to be gained for\nhimself.\n\nLAW 14\n\nPOSE AS A FRIEND, WORK AS A SPY\n\nKnowing about your rival is critical. Use spies to gather valuable\ninformation that will keep you a step ahead.\n\nBetter still: Play the spy yourself. In polite social encounters,\nlearn to probe. Ask indirect questions to get people\n\nto reveal their weaknesses and intentions. There is no occasion\nthat is not an opportunity for artful spying.\n\nLAW 15\n\nCRUSH YOUR ENEMY TOTALLY\n\nAll great leaders since Moses have known that a feared enemy\nmust be crushed completely. (Sometimes they have learned this the\nhard way.) If one ember is left alight, no matter how dimly it smolders,\nafire will eventually break out. More is lost through stopping halfway\nthan through total annihilation: The enemy will recover, and will seek\nrevenge. Crush him, not only in body but in spirit.\n\nLAW 16\n\nUSE ABSENCE TO INCREASE RESPECT AND HONOR\n\nToo much circulation makes the price go down: The more you are\nseen and heard from, the more common you appear. If you are already\nestablished in a group, temporary withdrawal from it will make you\nmore talked about, even more admired. You must learn when to leave.\nCreate value through scarcity.\n\nLAW 17\n\nKEEP OTHERS IN SUSPENDED TERROR: CULTIVATE AN\nAIR OF UNPREDICTABILITY\n\nHumans are creatures of habit with an insatiable need to see\nfamiliarity in other people's actions. Your predictability gives them a\nsense of control. Tum the tables: Be deliberately unpredictable.\nBehavior that seems to have no consistency or purpose will keep them\noff-balance, and they will wear themselves out trying to explain your\nmoves. Taken to an extreme, this strategy can intimidate and terrorize.\n\nLAW 18\n\nDO NOT BUILD FORTRESSES TO PROTECT\nYOURSELFISOLATION IS DANGEROUS\n\nThe world is dangerous and enemies are everywhereeveryone has\nto protect themselves. A fortress seems the safest. But isolation\n\nexposes you to more dangers than it protects you fromit cuts you off\nfrom valuable information, it makes you conspicuous and an easy\ntarget. Better to circulate among people, find allies, mingle. You are\nshielded from your enemies by the crowd.\n\nLAW 19\n\nKNOW WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITHDO NOT OFFEND\nTHE WRONG PERSON\n\nThere are many different kinds of people in the world, and you\ncan never assume that everyone will react to your strategies in the\nsame way. Deceive or outmaneuver some people and they will spend\nthe rest of their lives seeking revenge. They are wolves in lambs'\nclothing. Choose your victims and opponents carefully, then never\noffend or deceive the wrong person.\n\nLAW 20\n\nDO NOT COMMIT TO ANYONE\n\nIt is the fool who always rushes to take sides. Do not commit to\nany side or cause but yourself. By maintaining\n\nyour independence, you become the master of othersplaying\npeople against one another, making them pursue\n\nyou.\n\nLAW 21\n\nPLAY A SUCKER TO CATCH A SUCKERSEEM DUMBER\nTHAN YOUR MARK\n\nNo one likes feeling stupider than the next person. The trick, then,\nis to make your victims feel smartand not just smart, but smarter than\nyou are. Once convinced of this, they will never suspect that you may\nhave ulterior motives.\n\nLAW 22\n\nUSE THE SURRENDER TACTIC: TRANSFORM WEAKNESS\nINTO POWER When you are weaker, never fight for honor's sake;\nchoose surrender instead. Surrender gives you time to recover, time to\ntorment and irritate your conqueror, time to wait for his power to\nwane. Do not give him the satisfaction of fighting and defeating\nyousurrender first. By turning the other cheek you infuriate and\nunsettle him. Make surrender a tool of power.\n\nLAW 23\n\nCONCENTRATE YOUR FORCES Conserve your forces and\nenergies by keeping them concentrated at theirstrongest point. You\ngain more by finding a rich mine and mining it deeper, than by flitting\nfrom one shallow mine to anotherintensity defeats ex-tensity every\ntime. When looking for sources of power to elevate you, find the one\nkey patron, the fat cow who will give you milk for a long time to\ncome.\n\nLAW 24\n\nPLAY THE PERFECT COURTIER\n\nThe perfect courtier thrives in a world where everything revolves\naround power and political dexterity. He has mastered the art of\nindirection; he flatters, yields to superiors, and asserts power over\nothers in the most oblique and graceful manner. Learn and apply the\nlaws of courtiership and there will be no limit to how far you can rise\nin the court.\n\nLAW 25\n\nRE-CREATE YOURSELF\n\nDo not accept the roles that society foists on you. Re-create\nyourself by forging a new identity, one that commands attention and\nnever bores the audience. Be the master of your own image rather than\nletting others define it for you. Incorporate dramatic devices into your\npublic gestures and actionsyour power will be enhanced and your\ncharacter will seem larger than life.\n\nLAW 26\n\nKEEP YOUR HANDS CLEAN\n\nYou must seem a paragon of civility and efficiency: Your hands\nare never soiled by mistakes and nasty deeds. Maintain such a spotless\nappearance by using others as scapegoats and cat's-paws to disguise\nyour involvement.\n\nLAW 27\n\nPLAY ON PEOPLE'S NEED TO BELIEVE TO CREATE A\nCULTLIKE FOLLOWING\n\nPeople have an overwhelming desire to believe in something.\nBecome the focal point of such desire by offering them a cause, a new\nfaith to follow. Keep your words vague but full of promise; emphasize\nenthusiasm over rationality and clear thinking. Give your new\ndisciples rituals to perform, ask them to make sacrifices on your\n\nbehalf. In the absence of organized religion and grand causes, your\nnew belief system will bring you untold power.\n\nENTER ACTION WITH BOLDNESS\n\nIf you are unsure of a course of action, do not attempt it. Your\ndoubts and hesitations will infect your execution. Timidity is\ndangerous: Better to enter with boldness. Any mistakes you commit\nthrough audacity are easily corrected with more audacity. Everyone\nadmires the bold; no one honors the timid.\n\nLAW 29\n\nPLAN ALL THE WAY TO THE END\n\nThe ending is everything. Plan all the way to it, taking into\naccount all the possible consequences, obstacles, and twists of fortune\nthat might reverse your hard work and give the glory to others. By\nplanning to the end you will not be overwhelmed by circumstances and\nyou will know when to stop. Gently guide fortune and help determine\nthe future by thinking far ahead.\n\nLAW 30\n\nMAKE YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS SEEM EFFORTLESS\n\nYour actions must seem natural and executed with ease. All the\ntoil and practice that go into them, and also all the clever tricks, must\nbe concealed. When you act, act effortlessly, as if you could do much\nmore. Avoid the temptation of revealing how hard you workit only\nraises questions. Teach no one your tricks or they will be used against\nyou.\n\nLAW 31\n\nCONTROL THE OPTIONS: GET OTHERS TO PLAY WITH\nTHE CARDS YOU DEAL\n\nThe best deceptions are the ones that seem to give the other\nperson a choice: Your victims feel they are in control, but are actually\nyour puppets. Give people options that come out in your favor\nwhichever one they choose. Forte them to make choices between the\nlesser of two evils, both of which serve your purpose. Put them on the\nhorns of a dilemma: They are gored wherever they turn.\n\nLAW 32\n\nPLAY TO PEOPLE'S FANTASIES\n\nThe truth is often avoided because it is ugly and unpleasant.\nNever appeal to truth and reality unless you are prepared for the anger\n\nthat comes from disenchantment. Life is so harsh and distressing that\npeople who can manufacture romance or conjure up fantasy are like\noases in the desert: Everyone flocks to them. There is great power in\ntapping into the fantasies of the masses.\n\nLAW 33\n\nDISCOVER EACH MAN'S THUMBSCREW\n\nEveryone has a weakness, a gap in the castle wall. That weakness\nis usually an insecurity, an uncontrollable\n\nemotion or need; it can also be a small secret pleasure. Either\nway, once found, it is a thumbscrew you can turn\n\nto your advantage.\n\nLAW 34\n\nBE ROYAL IN YOUR OWN FASHION: ACT LIKE A KING\nTO BE TREATED LIKE ONE\n\nThe way you carry yourself will often determine how you are\ntreated: In the long run, appearing vulgar or common will make people\ndisrespect you. For a king respects himself and inspires the same\nsentiment in others. By acting regally and confident of your powers,\nyou make yourself seem destined to wear a crown.\n\nLAW 35\n\nMASTER THE ART OF TIMING\n\nNever seem to be in a hurryhurrying betrays a lack of control over\nyourself and over time. Always seem patient, as if you know that\neverything will come to you eventually. Become a detective of the\nright moment; sniff out the spirit of the times, the trends that will carry\nyou to power. Learn to stand back when the time is not yet ripe, and to\nstrike fiercely when it has reached fruition.\n\nLAW 36\n\nDISDAIN THINGS YOU CANNOT HAVE: IGNORING THEM\nIS THE BEST REVENGE\n\nBy acknowledging a petty problem you give it existence and\ncredibility. The more attention you pay an enemy, the stronger you\nmake him; and a small mistake is often made worse and more visible\nwhen you try to fix it. It is sometimes best to leave things alone. If\nthere is something you want but cannot have, show contempt for it.\nThe less interest you reveal, the more superior you seem.\n\nLAW 37\n\nCREATE COMPELLING SPECTACLES\n\nStriking imagery and grand symbolic gestures create the aura of\npowereveryone responds to them. Stage spectacles for those around\nyou, then, full of arresting visuals and radiant symbols that heighten\nyour presence. Dazzled by appearances, no one will notice what you\nare really doing.\n\nLAW 38\n\nTHINK AS YOU LIKE BUT BEHAVE LIKE OTHERS\n\nIf you make a show of going against the times, flaunting your\nunconventional ideas and unorthodox ways, people will think that you\nonly want attention and that you look down upon them. They will find\na way to punish you for making them feel inferior. It is far safer to\nblend in and nurture the common touch. Share your originality only\nwith tolerant friends and those who an sure to appreciate your\nuniqueness.\n\nLAW 39\n\nSTIR UP WATERS TO CATCH FISH\n\nAnger and emotion are strategically counterproductive. You must\nalways stay calm and objective. But if you\n\ncan make your enemies angry while staying calm yourself, you\ngain a decided advantage. Put your enemies\n\noff-balance: Find the chink in their vanity through which you can\nrattle them and you hold the strings.\n\nLAW 40\n\nDESPISE THE FREE LUNCH\n\nWhat is offered for free is dangerousit usually involves either a\ntrick or a hidden obligation. What has worth is worth paying for. By\npaying your own way you stay clear of gratitude, guilt, and deceit. It is\nalso often wise to pay the full pricethere is no cutting comers with\nexcellence. Be lavish with your money and keep it circulating, for\ngenerosity is a sign and a magnet for power.\n\nLAW 41\n\nAVOID STEPPING INTO A GREAT MAN'S SHOES\n\nWhat happens first always appears better and more original than\nwhat comes after. If you succeed a great man or have a famous parent,\nyou will have to accomplish double their achievements to outshine\nthem. Do not get lost in their shadow, or stuck in a past not of your\n\nown making: Establish your own name and identity by changing\ncourse. Slay the overbearing father, disparage his legacy, and gain\npower by shining in your own way.\n\nLAW 42\n\nSTRIKE THE SHEPHERD AND THE SHEEP WILL SCATTER\n\nTrouble can often be traced to a single strong individualthe stirrer,\nthe arrogant underling, the poisoner of goodwill. If you allow such\npeople room to operate, others will succumb to their influence. Do not\nwait for the troubles they cause to multiply, do not try to negotiate with\nthemthey are irredeemable. Neutralize their influence by isolating or\nbanishing them. Strike at the source of the trouble and the sheep will\nscatter.\n\nLAW 43\n\nWORK ON THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF OTHERS\n\nCoercion creates a reaction that will eventually work against you.\nYou must seduce others into wanting to move in your direction. A\nperson you have seduced becomes your loyal pawn. And the way to\nseduce others is to operate on their individual psychologies and\nweaknesses. Soften up the resistant by working on their emotions,\nplaying on what they hold dear and what they fear. Ignore the hearts\nand minds of others and they will grow to hate you.\n\nLAW 44\n\nDISARM AND INFURIATE WITH THE MIRROR EFFECT\n\nThe mirror reflects reality, but it is also the perfect tool for\ndeception: When you mirror your enemies, doing exactly as they do,\nthey cannot figure out your strategy. The Mirror Effect mocks and\nhumiliates them, making them overreact. By holding up a mirror to\ntheir psyches, you seduce them with the illusion that you share their\nvalues; by holding up a mirror to their actions, you teach them a\nlesson. Few can resist the power of the Mirror Effect.\n\nLAW 45\n\nPREACH THE NEED FOR CHANGE, BUT NEVER REFORM\nTOO MUCH AT ONCE Everyone understands the need for change in\nthe abstract, but on the day-to-day level people are creatures of habit.\nToo much innovation is traumatic, and will lead to revolt. If you are\nnew to a position of power, or an outsider trying to build a power base,\n\nmake a show of respecting the old way of doing things. If change is\nnecessary, make it feel like a gentle improvement on the past.\n\nLAW 46\n\nNEVER APPEAR TOO PERFECT\n\nAppearing better than others is always dangerous, but most\ndangerous of all is to appear to have no faults or weaknesses. Envy\ncreates silent enemies. It is smart to occasionally display defects, and\nadmit to harmless vices, in order to deflect envy and appear more\nhuman and approachable. Only gods and the dead can seem perfect\nwith impunity.\n\nLAW 47\n\nDO NOT GO PAST THE MARK YOU AIMED FOR; IN\nVICTORY, LEARN WHEN TO STOP\n\nThe moment of victory is often the moment of greatest peril. In\nthe heat of victory, arrogance and overconfi-dence can push you past\nthe goal you had aimed for, and by going too far, you make more\nenemies than you defeat. Do not allow success to go to your head.\nThere is no substitute for strategy and careful planning. Set a goal, and\nwhen you reach it, stop.\n\nLAW 48\n\nASSUME FORMLESSNESS\n\nBy taking a shape, by having a visible plan, you open yourself to\nattack. Instead of taking a form for your enemy to grasp, keep yourself\nadaptable and on the move. Accept the fact that nothing is certain and\nno law is fixed. The best way to protect yourself is to be as fluid and\nformless as water; never bet on stability or lasting order. Everything\nchanges.\n'.

Incorporate dramatic devices into your\npublic gestures and actionsyour power will be enhanced and your\ncharacter will seem larger than life.\n\nLAW 26\n\nKEEP YOUR HANDS CLEAN\n\nYou must seem a paragon of civility and efficiency: Your hands\nare never soiled by mistakes and nasty deeds. Maintain such a spotless\nappearance by using others as scapegoats and cat's-paws to disguise\nyour involvement.\n\nLAW 27\n\nPLAY ON PEOPLE'S NEED TO BELIEVE TO CREATE A\nCULTLIKE FOLLOWING\n\nPeople have an overwhelming desire to believe in something.\nBecome the focal point of such desire by offering them a cause, a new\nfaith to follow. Keep your words vague but full of promise; emphasize\nenthusiasm over rationality and clear thinking. Give your new\ndisciples rituals to perform, ask them to make sacrifices on your\n\nbehalf. In the absence of organized religion and grand causes, your\nnew belief system will bring you untold power.\n\nENTER ACTION WITH BOLDNESS\n\nIf you are unsure of a course of action, do not attempt it. Your\ndoubts and hesitations will infect your execution. Timidity is\ndangerous: Better to enter with boldness. Any mistakes you commit\nthrough audacity are easily corrected with more audacity. Everyone\nadmires the bold; no one honors the timid.\n\nLAW 29\n\nPLAN ALL THE WAY TO THE END\n\nThe ending is everything. Plan all the way to it, taking into\naccount all the possible consequences, obstacles, and twists of fortune\nthat might reverse your hard work and give the glory to others. By\nplanning to the end you will not be overwhelmed by circumstances and\nyou will know when to stop. Gently guide fortune and help determine\nthe future by thinking far ahead.\n\nLAW 30\n\nMAKE YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS SEEM EFFORTLESS\n\nYour actions must seem natural and executed with ease. All the\ntoil and practice that go into them, and also all the clever tricks, must\nbe concealed. When you act, act effortlessly, as if you could do much\nmore. Avoid the temptation of revealing how hard you workit only\nraises questions. Teach no one your tricks or they will be used against\nyou.\n\nLAW 31\n\nCONTROL THE OPTIONS: GET OTHERS TO PLAY WITH\nTHE CARDS YOU DEAL\n\nThe best deceptions are the ones that seem to give the other\nperson a choice: Your victims feel they are in control, but are actually\nyour puppets. Give people options that come out in your favor\nwhichever one they choose. Forte them to make choices between the\nlesser of two evils, both of which serve your purpose. Put them on the\nhorns of a dilemma: They are gored wherever they turn.\n\nLAW 32\n\nPLAY TO PEOPLE'S FANTASIES\n\nThe truth is often avoided because it is ugly and unpleasant.\nNever appeal to truth and reality unless you are prepared for the anger\n\nthat comes from disenchantment. Life is so harsh and distressing that\npeople who can manufacture romance or conjure up fantasy are like\noases in the desert: Everyone flocks to them. There is great power in\ntapping into the fantasies of the masses.\n\nLAW 33\n\nDISCOVER EACH MAN'S THUMBSCREW\n\nEveryone has a weakness, a gap in the castle wall. That weakness\nis usually an insecurity, an uncontrollable\n\nemotion or need; it can also be a small secret pleasure. Either\nway, once found, it is a thumbscrew you can turn\n\nto your advantage.\n\nLAW 34\n\nBE ROYAL IN YOUR OWN FASHION: ACT LIKE A KING\nTO BE TREATED LIKE ONE\n\nThe way you carry yourself will often determine how you are\ntreated: In the long run, appearing vulgar or common will make people\ndisrespect you. For a king respects himself and inspires the same\nsentiment in others. By acting regally and confident of your powers,\nyou make yourself seem destined to wear a crown.\n\nLAW 35\n\nMASTER THE ART OF TIMING\n\nNever seem to be in a hurryhurrying betrays a lack of control over\nyourself and over time. Always seem patient, as if you know that\neverything will come to you eventually. Become a detective of the\nright moment; sniff out the spirit of the times, the trends that will carry\nyou to power. Learn to stand back when the time is not yet ripe, and to\nstrike fiercely when it has reached fruition.\n\nLAW 36\n\nDISDAIN THINGS YOU CANNOT HAVE: IGNORING THEM\nIS THE BEST REVENGE\n\nBy acknowledging a petty problem you give it existence and\ncredibility. The more attention you pay an enemy, the stronger you\nmake him; and a small mistake is often made worse and more visible\nwhen you try to fix it. It is sometimes best to leave things alone. If\nthere is something you want but cannot have, show contempt for it.\nThe less interest you reveal, the more superior you seem.\n\nLAW 37\n\nCREATE COMPELLING SPECTACLES\n\nStriking imagery and grand symbolic gestures create the aura of\npowereveryone responds to them. Stage spectacles for those around\nyou, then, full of arresting visuals and radiant symbols that heighten\nyour presence. Dazzled by appearances, no one will notice what you\nare really doing.\n\nLAW 38\n\nTHINK AS YOU LIKE BUT BEHAVE LIKE OTHERS\n\nIf you make a show of going against the times, flaunting your\nunconventional ideas and unorthodox ways, people will think that you\nonly want attention and that you look down upon them. They will find\na way to punish you for making them feel inferior. It is far safer to\nblend in and nurture the common touch. Share your originality only\nwith tolerant friends and those who an sure to appreciate your\nuniqueness.\n\nLAW 39\n\nSTIR UP WATERS TO CATCH FISH\n\nAnger and emotion are strategically counterproductive. You must\nalways stay calm and objective. But if you\n\ncan make your enemies angry while staying calm yourself, you\ngain a decided advantage. Put your enemies\n\noff-balance: Find the chink in their vanity through which you can\nrattle them and you hold the strings.\n\nLAW 40\n\nDESPISE THE FREE LUNCH\n\nWhat is offered for free is dangerousit usually involves either a\ntrick or a hidden obligation. What has worth is worth paying for. By\npaying your own way you stay clear of gratitude, guilt, and deceit. It is\nalso often wise to pay the full pricethere is no cutting comers with\nexcellence. Be lavish with your money and keep it circulating, for\ngenerosity is a sign and a magnet for power.\n\nLAW 41\n\nAVOID STEPPING INTO A GREAT MAN'S SHOES\n\nWhat happens first always appears better and more original than\nwhat comes after. If you succeed a great man or have a famous parent,\nyou will have to accomplish double their achievements to outshine\nthem. Do not get lost in their shadow, or stuck in a past not of your\n\nown making: Establish your own name and identity by changing\ncourse. Slay the overbearing father, disparage his legacy, and gain\npower by shining in your own way.\n\nLAW 42\n\nSTRIKE THE SHEPHERD AND THE SHEEP WILL SCATTER\n\nTrouble can often be traced to a single strong individualthe stirrer,\nthe arrogant underling, the poisoner of goodwill. If you allow such\npeople room to operate, others will succumb to their influence. Do not\nwait for the troubles they cause to multiply, do not try to negotiate with\nthemthey are irredeemable. Neutralize their influence by isolating or\nbanishing them. Strike at the source of the trouble and the sheep will\nscatter.\n\nLAW 43\n\nWORK ON THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF OTHERS\n\nCoercion creates a reaction that will eventually work against you.\nYou must seduce others into wanting to move in your direction. A\nperson you have seduced becomes your loyal pawn. And the way to\nseduce others is to operate on their individual psychologies and\nweaknesses. Soften up the resistant by working on their emotions,\nplaying on what they hold dear and what they fear. Ignore the hearts\nand minds of others and they will grow to hate you.\n\nLAW 44\n\nDISARM AND INFURIATE WITH THE MIRROR EFFECT\n\nThe mirror reflects reality, but it is also the perfect tool for\ndeception: When you mirror your enemies, doing exactly as they do,\nthey cannot figure out your strategy. The Mirror Effect mocks and\nhumiliates them, making them overreact. By holding up a mirror to\ntheir psyches, you seduce them with the illusion that you share their\nvalues; by holding up a mirror to their actions, you teach them a\nlesson. Few can resist the power of the Mirror Effect.\n\nLAW 45\n\nPREACH THE NEED FOR CHANGE, BUT NEVER REFORM\nTOO MUCH AT ONCE Everyone understands the need for change in\nthe abstract, but on the day-to-day level people are creatures of habit.\nToo much innovation is traumatic, and will lead to revolt. If you are\nnew to a position of power, or an outsider trying to build a power base,\n\nmake a show of respecting the old way of doing things. If change is\nnecessary, make it feel like a gentle improvement on the past.\n\nLAW 46\n\nNEVER APPEAR TOO PERFECT\n\nAppearing better than others is always dangerous, but most\ndangerous of all is to appear to have no faults or weaknesses. Envy\ncreates silent enemies. It is smart to occasionally display defects, and\nadmit to harmless vices, in order to deflect envy and appear more\nhuman and approachable. Only gods and the dead can seem perfect\nwith impunity.\n\nLAW 47\n\nDO NOT GO PAST THE MARK YOU AIMED FOR; IN\nVICTORY, LEARN WHEN TO STOP\n\nThe moment of victory is often the moment of greatest peril. In\nthe heat of victory, arrogance and overconfi-dence can push you past\nthe goal you had aimed for, and by going too far, you make more\nenemies than you defeat. Do not allow success to go to your head.\nThere is no substitute for strategy and careful planning.

Make your masters appear more brilliant than they are and\nyou will attain the heights of power.\n\nTRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW.\n\nNicolas Fouquet, Louis XIV's finance minister in the first years of\nhis reign, was a generous man who loved lavish parties, pretty women,\nand poetry. He also loved money, for he led an extravagant lifestyle.\nFouquet was clever and very much indispensable to the king, so when\nthe prime minister, Jules Mazarin, died, in 1661, the finance minister\nexpected to be named the successor. Instead, the king decided to\nabolish the position. This and other signs made Fouquet suspect that he\nwas falling out of favor, and so he decided to ingratiate himself with\nthe king by staging the most spectacular party the world had ever seen.\nThe party's ostensible purpose would be to commemorate the\ncompletion of Fouquet's chateau, Vaux-le-Vicomte, but its real\nfunction was to pay tribute to the king, the guest of honor.\n\nThe most brilliant nobility of Europe and some of the greatest\nminds of the timeLa Fontaine, La Rochefoucauld, Madame de Sevigne\nattended the party. Moliere wrote a play for the occasion, in which he\nhimself was to perform at the evening's conclusion. The party began\nwith a lavish seven-course dinner, featuring foods from the Orient\nnever before tasted in France, as well as new dishes created especially\nfor the night. The meal was accompanied with music commissioned by\nFouquet to honor the king.\n\nAfter dinner there was a promenade through the chateau's\ngardens. The grounds and fountains of Vaux-le-Vicomte were to be the\ninspiration for Versailles.\n\n\nFouquet personally accompanied the young king through the\ngeometrically aligned arrangements of shrubbery and flower beds.\nArriving at the gardens' canals, they witnessed a fireworks display,\nwhich was followed by the performance of Moliere's play. The party\nran well into the night and everyone agreed it was the most amazing\naffair they had ever attended.\n\nThe next day, Fouquet was arrested by the king's head musketeer,\nD'Artagnan. Three months later he went on trial for stealing from the\ncountry's treasury. (Actually, most of the stealing he was accused of he\nhad done on the king's behalf and with the king's permission.) Fouquet\nwas found guilty and sent to the most isolated prison in France, high in\nthe Pyrenees Mountains, where he spent die last twenty years of his\nlife in solitary confinement.\n\nInterpretation\n\nLouis XIV, the Sun King, was a proud and arrogant man who\nwanted to be the center of attention at all times; he could not\ncountenance being outdone in lavishness by anyone, and certainly not\nhis finance minister. To succeed Fouquet, Louis chose Jean-Baptiste\nColbert, a man famous for his parsimony and for giving the dullest\nparties in Paris. Colbert made sure that any money liberated from the\ntreasury went straight into Louis's hands. With the money, Louis built\na palace even more magnificent than Fouquet'sthe glorious palace of\nVersailles. He used the same architects,\ndecorators, and garden designer. And at Versailles, Louis hosted\nparties even more extravagant uian the one that cost Fouquet his\nreedom.\n\nLet us examine the situation. The evening of the party, as Fouquet\npresented spectacle on spectacle to Louis, each more magnificent than\nthe one before, he imagined the affair as demonstrating his loyalty and\ndevotion to the king. Not only did he think the party would put him\nback in die king's favor, he thought it would show his good taste, his\nconnections, and his popularity, making him indispensable to die king\nand demonstrating that he would make an excellent prime minister.\nInstead, however, each new spectacle, each appreciative smile\nbestowed by the guests on Fouquet, made it seem to Louis that his own\nriends and subjects were more charmed by the finance minister dian\nby the king himself, and that Fouquet was actually flaunting his wealth\n\n\nand power. Rather than flattering Louis XIV, Fouquet's elaborate party\noffended the king's vanity. Louis would not admit this to anyone, of\ncourseinstead, he found a convenient excuse to rid himself of a man\nwho had inadvertently made him feel insecure.\n\nSuch is the fate, in some form or other, of all those who\nunbalance the master's sense of self, poke holes in his vanity, or make\nhim doubt his preeminence.\n\nWhen the evening began, Fouquet was at the top of the world. By\nthe time it had ended, he was at the bottom.\n\nVoltaire, 1694-1778\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nIn the early 1600s, the Italian astronomer and mathematician\nGalileo found himself in a precarious position. He depended on the\ngenerosity of great rulers to support his research, and so, like all\nRenaissance scientists, he would sometimes make gifts of his\ninventions and discoveries to the leading patrons of the time. Once, for\ninstance, he presented a military compass he had invented to the Duke\nof Gonzaga. Then he dedicated a book explaining the use of the\ncompass to the Medicis. Both rulers were grateful, and dirough them\nGalileo was able to find more students to teach. No matter how great\nthe discovery, however, his patrons usually paid him with gifts, not\ncash. This made for a life of constant insecurity and dependence. There\nmust be an easier way, he thought.\n\nGalileo hit on a new strategy in 1610, when he discovered the\nmoons of Jupiter. Instead of dividing the discovery among his\npatronsgiving one the telescope he had used, dedicating a book to\nanother, and so onas he had done in the past, he decided to focus\nexclusively on the Medicis. He chose the Medicis for one reason:\nShortly after Cosimo I had established the Medici dynasty, in 1540, he\nhad made Jupiter, the mightiest of the gods, the Medici symbola\nsymbol of a power that went beyond politics and banking, one linked\nto ancient Rome and its divinities.\n\nGalileo turned his discovery of Jupiter's moons into a cosmic\nevent\n\nhonoring the Medicis' greatness. Shortly after the discovery, he\nannounced that \u201cthe bright stars [the moons of Jupiter] offered\nthemselves in the heavens\u201d to his telescope at the same time as Cosimo\n\nIPs enthronement. He said that the number of the\nmoonsfourharmonized with the number of the Medicis (Cosimo II had\nthree brothers) and that the moons orbited Jupiter as these four sons\nrevolved around Cosimo I, the dynasty's founder. More than\ncoincidence, this showed that the heavens themselves reflected the\nascendancy of the Medici family. After he dedicated the discovery to\nthe Medicis, Galileo commissioned an emblem representing Jupiter\nsitting on a cloud with the four stars circling about him, and presented\nthis to Cosimo II as a symbol of his link to the stars.\n\nIn 1610 Cosimo II made Galileo his official court philosopher and\nmathematician, with a full salary. For a scientist this was the coup of a\nlifetime. The days of begging for patronage were over.\n\nInterpretation\n\nIn one stroke, Galileo gained more with his new strategy than he\nhad in years of begging. The reason is simple: All masters want to\nappear more brilliant than other people.\n\nThey do not care about science or empirical trutii or the latest\ninvention; they care about their name and their glory. Galileo gave the\nMedicis infinitely more glory by linking their name with cosmic forces\nthan he had by making them the patrons of some new scientific gadget\nor discovery.\n\nScientists are not spared the vagaries of court life and patronage.\nThey too must serve masters who hold the purse strings. And their\ngreat intellectual powers can make the master feel insecure, as if he\nwere only there to supply the fundsan ugly, ignoble job. The producer\nof a great work wants to feel he is more than just the provider of the\nfinancing. He wants to appear creative and powerful, and also more\nimportant than the work produced in his name. Instead of insecurity\nyou must give him glory. Galileo did not challenge the intellectual\nauthority of the Medicis with his discovery, or make them feel inferior\nin any way; by literally aligning them with the stars, he made them\nshine brilliantly among the courts of Italy. He did not outshine the\nmaster, he made the master outshine all others.\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nEveryone has insecurities. When you show yourself in the world\nand display your talents, you naturally stir up all kinds of resentment,\nenvy, and other manifestations of insecurity. This is to be expected.\n\nYou cannot spend your life worrying about the petty feelings of others.\nWith those above you, however, you must take a different approach:\nWhen it comes to power, outshining the master is perhaps the worst\nmistake of all.\n\nDo not fool yourself into thinking that life has changed much\nsince the days of Louis XIV and the Medicis. Those who attain high\nstanding in life are like kings and queens: They want to feel secure in\ntheir positions, and\n\nsuperior to those around them in intelligence, wit, and charm. It is\na deadly but common misperception to believe that by displaying and\nvaunting your gifts and talents, you are winning die master's affection.\nHe may feign appreciation, but at his first opportunity he will replace\nyou with someone less intelligent, less attractive, less threatening, just\nas Louis XIV replaced the sparkling Fouquet with the bland Colbert.\nAnd as with Louis, he will not admit the truth, but will find an excuse\nto rid himself of your presence.\n\nThis Law involves two rules that you must realize. First, you can\ninadvertently outshine a master simply by being yourself. There are\nmasters who are more insecure than others, monstrously insecure; you\nmay naturally outshine them by your charm and grace.\n\nNo one had more natural talents than Astorre Manfredi, prince of\nFaenza. The most handsome of all the young princes of Italy, he\ncaptivated his subjects with his generosity and open spirit.\n\nIn the year 1500, Cesare Borgia laid siege to Faenza. When the\ncity surrendered, the citizens expected the worst from the cruel Borgia,\nwho, however, decided to spare the town: He simply occupied its\nfortress, executed none of its citizens, and allowed Prince Manfredi,\neighteen at the time, to remain with his court, in complete freedom.\n\nA few weeks later, though, soldiers hauled Astorre Manfredi\naway to a Roman prison. A year after that, his body was fished out of\nthe River Tiber, a stone tied around his neck. Borgia justified the\nhorrible deed with some sort of trumped-up charge of treason and\nconspiracy, but the real problem was that he was notoriously vain and\ninsecure. The young man was outshining him without even trying.\nGiven Manfredi's natural talents, the prince's mere presence made\nBorgia seem less attractive and charismatic. The lesson is simple: If\nyou cannot help being charming and superior, you must learn to avoid\n\n\nsuch monsters of vanity. Either that, or find a way to mute your good\nqualities when in the company of a Cesare Borgia.\n\nSecond, never imagine that because the master loves you, you can\ndo anything you want. Entire books could be written about favorites\nwho fell out of favor by taking their status for granted, for daring to\noutshine. In late-sixteenth-century Japan, the favorite of Emperor\nHideyoshi was a man called Sen no Rikyu. The premier artist of the\ntea ceremony, which had become an obsession with the nobility, he\nwas one of Hideyoshi's most trusted advisers, had his own apartment\nin the palace, and was honored throughout Japan. Yet in 1591,\nHideyoshi had him arrested and sentenced to death. Rikyu took his\nown life, instead. The cause for his sudden change of fortune was\ndiscovered later: It seems that Rikyu, former peasant and later court\nfavorite, had had a wooden statue made of himself wearing sandals (a\nsign of nobility) and posing loftily. He had had this statue placed in the\nmost important temple inside the palace gates, in clear sight of the\nroyalty who often would pass by. To Hideyoshi this signified that\nRikyu had no sense of limits. Presuming that he had the same rights as\nthose of the highest nobility, he had forgotten that his position\ndepended on the emperor, and had come to believe that he had earned\nit on his own. This was\n\nan unforgivable miscalculation of his own importance and he paid\nfor it with his life. Remember the following: Never take your position\nfor granted and never let any favors you receive go to your head.\n\nKnowing the dangers of outshining your master, you can turn tiiis\nLaw to your advantage. First you must flatter and puff up your master.\nOvert flattery can be effective but has its limits; it is too direct and\nobvious, and looks bad to other courtiers. Discreet flattery is much\nmore powerful. If you are more intelligent than your master, for\nexample, seem the opposite: Make him appear more intelligent than\nyou. Act naive. Make it seem that you need his expertise. Commit\nharmless mistakes that will not hurt you in the long run but will give\nyou die chance to ask for his help. Masters adore such requests. A\nmaster who cannot bestow on you the gifts of his experience may\ndirect rancor and ill will at you instead.\n\nIf your ideas are more creative dian your master's, ascribe them to\nhim, in as public a manner as possible. Make it clear that your advice\n\n\nis merely an echo of his advice.\n\nIf you surpass your master in wit, it is okay to play the role of the\ncourt jester, but do not make him appear cold and surly by comparison.\nTone down your humor if necessary, and find ways to make him seem\nthe dispenser of amusement and good cheer. If you are naturally more\nsociable and generous than your master, be careful not to be the cloud\nthat blocks his radiance from odiers. He must appear as the sun around\nwhich everyone revolves, radiating power and brilliance, die center of\nattention. If you are dirust into the position of entertaining him, a\ndisplay of your limited means may win you his sympathy. Any attempt\nto impress him with your grace and generosity can prove fatal: Learn\nfrom Fouquet or pay die price.\n\nIn all of diese cases it is not a weakness to disguise your strengdis\nif in die end they lead to power. By letting others outshine you, you\nremain in control, instead of being a victim of tiieir insecurity. This\nwill all come in handy the day you decide to rise above your inferior\nstatus. If, like Galileo, you can make your master shine even more in\nthe eyes of odiers, then you are a godsend and you will be instantiy\npromoted.\n\nImage:\n\nThe Stars in the\n\nSky. There can be only\n\none sun at a time. Never\n\nobscure the sunlight, or\n\nrival the sun's brilliance;\n\nrather, fade into the sky and\n\nfind ways to heighten\n\nthe master star's\n\nintensity.\n\nAuthority: Avoid outshining the master. All superiority is odious,\nbut the superiority of a subject over his prince is not only stupid, it is\nfatal. This is a lesson that the stars in the sky teach usthey may be\nrelated to the sun, and just as brilliant, but they never appear in her\ncompany. (Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nYou cannot worry about upsetting every person you come across,\nbut you must be selectively cruel. If your superior is a falling star,\n\nthere is nothing to fear from outshining him. Do not be mercifulyour\nmaster had no such scruples in his own cold-blooded climb to the top.\nGauge his strength. If he is weak, discreetly hasten his downfall:\nOutdo, outcharm, outsmart him at key moments. If he is very weak and\nready to fall, let nature take its course. Do not risk outshining a feeble\nsuperiorit might appear cruel or spiteful. But if your master is firm in\nhis position, yet you know yourself to be the more capable, bide your\ntime and be patient. It is the natural course of things that power\neventually fades and weakens. Your master will fall someday, and if\nyou play it right, you will oudive and someday outshine him.\n'.

Rather than flattering Louis XIV, Fouquet's elaborate party\noffended the king's vanity. Louis would not admit this to anyone, of\ncourseinstead, he found a convenient excuse to rid himself of a man\nwho had inadvertently made him feel insecure.\n\nSuch is the fate, in some form or other, of all those who\nunbalance the master's sense of self, poke holes in his vanity, or make\nhim doubt his preeminence.\n\nWhen the evening began, Fouquet was at the top of the world. By\nthe time it had ended, he was at the bottom.\n\nVoltaire, 1694-1778\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nIn the early 1600s, the Italian astronomer and mathematician\nGalileo found himself in a precarious position. He depended on the\ngenerosity of great rulers to support his research, and so, like all\nRenaissance scientists, he would sometimes make gifts of his\ninventions and discoveries to the leading patrons of the time. Once, for\ninstance, he presented a military compass he had invented to the Duke\nof Gonzaga. Then he dedicated a book explaining the use of the\ncompass to the Medicis. Both rulers were grateful, and dirough them\nGalileo was able to find more students to teach. No matter how great\nthe discovery, however, his patrons usually paid him with gifts, not\ncash. This made for a life of constant insecurity and dependence. There\nmust be an easier way, he thought.\n\nGalileo hit on a new strategy in 1610, when he discovered the\nmoons of Jupiter. Instead of dividing the discovery among his\npatronsgiving one the telescope he had used, dedicating a book to\nanother, and so onas he had done in the past, he decided to focus\nexclusively on the Medicis. He chose the Medicis for one reason:\nShortly after Cosimo I had established the Medici dynasty, in 1540, he\nhad made Jupiter, the mightiest of the gods, the Medici symbola\nsymbol of a power that went beyond politics and banking, one linked\nto ancient Rome and its divinities.\n\nGalileo turned his discovery of Jupiter's moons into a cosmic\nevent\n\nhonoring the Medicis' greatness. Shortly after the discovery, he\nannounced that \u201cthe bright stars [the moons of Jupiter] offered\nthemselves in the heavens\u201d to his telescope at the same time as Cosimo\n\nIPs enthronement. He said that the number of the\nmoonsfourharmonized with the number of the Medicis (Cosimo II had\nthree brothers) and that the moons orbited Jupiter as these four sons\nrevolved around Cosimo I, the dynasty's founder. More than\ncoincidence, this showed that the heavens themselves reflected the\nascendancy of the Medici family. After he dedicated the discovery to\nthe Medicis, Galileo commissioned an emblem representing Jupiter\nsitting on a cloud with the four stars circling about him, and presented\nthis to Cosimo II as a symbol of his link to the stars.\n\nIn 1610 Cosimo II made Galileo his official court philosopher and\nmathematician, with a full salary. For a scientist this was the coup of a\nlifetime. The days of begging for patronage were over.\n\nInterpretation\n\nIn one stroke, Galileo gained more with his new strategy than he\nhad in years of begging. The reason is simple: All masters want to\nappear more brilliant than other people.\n\nThey do not care about science or empirical trutii or the latest\ninvention; they care about their name and their glory. Galileo gave the\nMedicis infinitely more glory by linking their name with cosmic forces\nthan he had by making them the patrons of some new scientific gadget\nor discovery.\n\nScientists are not spared the vagaries of court life and patronage.\nThey too must serve masters who hold the purse strings. And their\ngreat intellectual powers can make the master feel insecure, as if he\nwere only there to supply the fundsan ugly, ignoble job. The producer\nof a great work wants to feel he is more than just the provider of the\nfinancing. He wants to appear creative and powerful, and also more\nimportant than the work produced in his name. Instead of insecurity\nyou must give him glory. Galileo did not challenge the intellectual\nauthority of the Medicis with his discovery, or make them feel inferior\nin any way; by literally aligning them with the stars, he made them\nshine brilliantly among the courts of Italy. He did not outshine the\nmaster, he made the master outshine all others.\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nEveryone has insecurities. When you show yourself in the world\nand display your talents, you naturally stir up all kinds of resentment,\nenvy, and other manifestations of insecurity. This is to be expected.\n\nYou cannot spend your life worrying about the petty feelings of others.\nWith those above you, however, you must take a different approach:\nWhen it comes to power, outshining the master is perhaps the worst\nmistake of all.\n\nDo not fool yourself into thinking that life has changed much\nsince the days of Louis XIV and the Medicis. Those who attain high\nstanding in life are like kings and queens: They want to feel secure in\ntheir positions, and\n\nsuperior to those around them in intelligence, wit, and charm. It is\na deadly but common misperception to believe that by displaying and\nvaunting your gifts and talents, you are winning die master's affection.\nHe may feign appreciation, but at his first opportunity he will replace\nyou with someone less intelligent, less attractive, less threatening, just\nas Louis XIV replaced the sparkling Fouquet with the bland Colbert.\nAnd as with Louis, he will not admit the truth, but will find an excuse\nto rid himself of your presence.\n\nThis Law involves two rules that you must realize. First, you can\ninadvertently outshine a master simply by being yourself. There are\nmasters who are more insecure than others, monstrously insecure; you\nmay naturally outshine them by your charm and grace.\n\nNo one had more natural talents than Astorre Manfredi, prince of\nFaenza. The most handsome of all the young princes of Italy, he\ncaptivated his subjects with his generosity and open spirit.\n\nIn the year 1500, Cesare Borgia laid siege to Faenza. When the\ncity surrendered, the citizens expected the worst from the cruel Borgia,\nwho, however, decided to spare the town: He simply occupied its\nfortress, executed none of its citizens, and allowed Prince Manfredi,\neighteen at the time, to remain with his court, in complete freedom.\n\nA few weeks later, though, soldiers hauled Astorre Manfredi\naway to a Roman prison. A year after that, his body was fished out of\nthe River Tiber, a stone tied around his neck. Borgia justified the\nhorrible deed with some sort of trumped-up charge of treason and\nconspiracy, but the real problem was that he was notoriously vain and\ninsecure. The young man was outshining him without even trying.\nGiven Manfredi's natural talents, the prince's mere presence made\nBorgia seem less attractive and charismatic. The lesson is simple: If\nyou cannot help being charming and superior, you must learn to avoid\n\n\nsuch monsters of vanity. Either that, or find a way to mute your good\nqualities when in the company of a Cesare Borgia.\n\nSecond, never imagine that because the master loves you, you can\ndo anything you want. Entire books could be written about favorites\nwho fell out of favor by taking their status for granted, for daring to\noutshine. In late-sixteenth-century Japan, the favorite of Emperor\nHideyoshi was a man called Sen no Rikyu. The premier artist of the\ntea ceremony, which had become an obsession with the nobility, he\nwas one of Hideyoshi's most trusted advisers, had his own apartment\nin the palace, and was honored throughout Japan. Yet in 1591,\nHideyoshi had him arrested and sentenced to death. Rikyu took his\nown life, instead. The cause for his sudden change of fortune was\ndiscovered later: It seems that Rikyu, former peasant and later court\nfavorite, had had a wooden statue made of himself wearing sandals (a\nsign of nobility) and posing loftily. He had had this statue placed in the\nmost important temple inside the palace gates, in clear sight of the\nroyalty who often would pass by. To Hideyoshi this signified that\nRikyu had no sense of limits. Presuming that he had the same rights as\nthose of the highest nobility, he had forgotten that his position\ndepended on the emperor, and had come to believe that he had earned\nit on his own. This was\n\nan unforgivable miscalculation of his own importance and he paid\nfor it with his life. Remember the following: Never take your position\nfor granted and never let any favors you receive go to your head.\n\nKnowing the dangers of outshining your master, you can turn tiiis\nLaw to your advantage. First you must flatter and puff up your master.\nOvert flattery can be effective but has its limits; it is too direct and\nobvious, and looks bad to other courtiers. Discreet flattery is much\nmore powerful. If you are more intelligent than your master, for\nexample, seem the opposite: Make him appear more intelligent than\nyou. Act naive. Make it seem that you need his expertise. Commit\nharmless mistakes that will not hurt you in the long run but will give\nyou die chance to ask for his help. Masters adore such requests. A\nmaster who cannot bestow on you the gifts of his experience may\ndirect rancor and ill will at you instead.\n\nIf your ideas are more creative dian your master's, ascribe them to\nhim, in as public a manner as possible. Make it clear that your advice\n\n\nis merely an echo of his advice.\n\nIf you surpass your master in wit, it is okay to play the role of the\ncourt jester, but do not make him appear cold and surly by comparison.\nTone down your humor if necessary, and find ways to make him seem\nthe dispenser of amusement and good cheer. If you are naturally more\nsociable and generous than your master, be careful not to be the cloud\nthat blocks his radiance from odiers. He must appear as the sun around\nwhich everyone revolves, radiating power and brilliance, die center of\nattention. If you are dirust into the position of entertaining him, a\ndisplay of your limited means may win you his sympathy. Any attempt\nto impress him with your grace and generosity can prove fatal: Learn\nfrom Fouquet or pay die price.\n\nIn all of diese cases it is not a weakness to disguise your strengdis\nif in die end they lead to power. By letting others outshine you, you\nremain in control, instead of being a victim of tiieir insecurity. This\nwill all come in handy the day you decide to rise above your inferior\nstatus. If, like Galileo, you can make your master shine even more in\nthe eyes of odiers, then you are a godsend and you will be instantiy\npromoted.\n\nImage:\n\nThe Stars in the\n\nSky. There can be only\n\none sun at a time. Never\n\nobscure the sunlight, or\n\nrival the sun's brilliance;\n\nrather, fade into the sky and\n\nfind ways to heighten\n\nthe master star's\n\nintensity.\n\nAuthority: Avoid outshining the master. All superiority is odious,\nbut the superiority of a subject over his prince is not only stupid, it is\nfatal. This is a lesson that the stars in the sky teach usthey may be\nrelated to the sun, and just as brilliant, but they never appear in her\ncompany. (Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nYou cannot worry about upsetting every person you come across,\nbut you must be selectively cruel. If your superior is a falling star,\n\nthere is nothing to fear from outshining him. Do not be mercifulyour\nmaster had no such scruples in his own cold-blooded climb to the top.\nGauge his strength. If he is weak, discreetly hasten his downfall:\nOutdo, outcharm, outsmart him at key moments. If he is very weak and\nready to fall, let nature take its course. Do not risk outshining a feeble\nsuperiorit might appear cruel or spiteful. But if your master is firm in\nhis position, yet you know yourself to be the more capable, bide your\ntime and be patient. It is the natural course of things that power\neventually fades and weakens. Your master will fall someday, and if\nyou play it right, you will oudive and someday outshine him.\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

They also become spoiled and tyrannical. But\nhire a former enemy and he will be more loyal than a friend, because\nhe has more to prove. In fact, you have more to fear from friends than\nfrom enemies. If you have no enemies, find a way to make them.\n\nTRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW\n\nIn the mid-ninth century A.D., a young man named Michael III\nassumed the dirone of the Byzantine Empire. His mother, the Empress\nTheodora, had been banished to a nunnery, and her lover, Theoctistus,\nhad been murdered; at the head of the conspiracy to depose Theodora\nand enthrone Michael had been Michael's uncle, Bardas, a man of\nintelligence and ambition. Michael was now a young, inexperienced\ntuler, surrounded by intriguers, murderers, and profligates. In this time\nof peril he needed someone he could trust as his councillor, and his\ntiioughts turned to Basilius, his best friend. Basilius had no experience\nwhatsoever in government and politicsin fact, he was the head of the\nroyal stablesbut he had proven his love and gratitude time and again.\n\nThey had met a few years before, when Michael had been visiting\nthe stables just as a wild horse got loose. Basilius, a young groom from\npeasant Macedonian stock, had saved Michael's life. The groom's\nstrength and courage had impressed Michael, who immediately raised\nBasilius from die obscurity of being a horse trainer to die position of\nhead of die stables. He loaded his friend with gifts and favors and tiiey\nbecame inseparable. Basilius was sent to the finest school in\nByzantium, and the crude peasant became a cultured and sophisticated\ncourtier.\n\nNow Michael was emperor, and in need of someone loyal. Who\ncould he better trust with the post of chamberlain and chief councillor\nthan a young man who owed him everything\n\nBasilius could be trained for the job and Michael loved him like a\n\nbrother. Ignoring die advice of those who recommended die much\nmore qualified Bardas, Michael chose his friend.\nBasilius learned well and was soon advising the emperor on all\nmatters of state. The only problem seemed to be moneyBasilius never\nhad enough. Exposure to the splendor of Byzantine court life made\nhim avaricious for the perks of power. Michael doubled, then tripled\nhis salary, ennobled him, and married him off to his own mistress,\nEudoxia Ingerina. Keeping such a trusted friend and adviser satisfied\nwas worth any price. But more trouble was to come. Bardas was now\nhead of die army, and Basilius convinced Michael diat die man was\nhopelessly ambitious. Under die illusion diat he could control his\nnephew, Bardas had conspired to put him on the dirone, and he could\nconspire again, diis time to get rid of Michael and assume die crown\nhimself. Basilius poured poison into Michael's ear until the emperor\nagreed to have his uncle murdered. During a great horse race, Basilius\nclosed in on Bardas in the crowd and stabbed him to death. Soon after,\nBasilius asked that he replace Bardas as head of the army, where he\ncould keep control of die realm and quell rebellion. This was granted.\n\nNow Basilius's power and wealdi only grew, and a few years later\nMichael, in financial straits from his own extravagance, asked him to\npay back some of die money he had borrowed over the years. To\nMichael's shock and astonishment, Basilius refused, wiui a look of\nsuch impudence\n\nTo have a good enemy, choose a friend: He knows where to\nstrike.\n\nDiane de Poitiers, 1499-1566, mistress of Henri II of France\n\nEvery time I bestow a\n\nvacant office I make a\n\nhundred discontented\n\npersons and one\n\ningrate.\n\nLouis XIV, 1638-1715\n\n\nThus for my own part I have more than once been deceived by the\nperson I loved most and of whose love, above everyone else's, I have\nbeen most confident. So that I believe that it rnay be right to love and\nserve one person above all others, according to merit and worth, but\nnever to trust so much in this tempting trap of friendship as to have\ncause to repent of it later on.\n\nBaldassare\n\nCastiglione,\n\n1478-1529\n\nIli,\n\nSNAKK. TIIK I ARMKR. AM) TIIK IIKIiON A snake chased\nby hunters asked a farmer to save its life. To hide it from its pursuers,\nthe farmer squatted and let the snake crawl into his belly. But when the\ndanger had passed and the farmer asked the snake to come out, the\nsnake refused. It was warm and safe inside. On his way home, the man\nsaw a heron and went up to him and whispered what had happened.\nThe heron told him to squat and strain to eject the snake. When the\nsnake snuck its head out, the heron caught it, pulled it out, and killed\nit. The farmer was worried that the snake's poison might still be inside\nhim, and the heron told him that the cure for snake poison was to cook\nand eat six white fowl. \u201c You 're a white fo w I, \u201d said the farmer.\n\u201cYou'll do for a start.\u201d He grabbed the heron, put it in a bag, and\ncarried it home, where he hung it up while he told his wife what had\nhappened. \u201cI'm surprised at you,\u201d said the wife. \u201cThe bird does you a\nkindness, rids you of the evil in your belly, saves your life in fact, yet\nyou catch it and talk of killing it. \u201d She immediately released the\nheron, and it flew away. But on its way, it gouged out her eyes. Moral:\nWhen you see water flo wing uphill, it\n\nmeans that someone\n\nthat me emperor suddenly realized his predicament: The former\nstable boy had more money, more allies in the army and senate, and in\nthe end more power than the emperor himself. A few weeks later, after\na night of heavy drinking, Michael awoke to find himself surrounded\nby soldiers. Basilius watched as they stabbed the emperor to death.\nThen, after proclaiming himself emperor, he rode his horse through the\nstreets of Byzantium, brandishing the head of his former benefactor\nand best friend at die end of a long pike.\n\nInterpretation\n\nMichael III staked his future on the sense of gratitude he thought\nBasilius must feel for him. Surely Basilius would serve him best; he\nowed die emperor his wealtii, his education, and his position. Then,\nonce Basilius was in power, anything he needed it was best to give to\nhim, strengdiening the bonds between the two men. It was only on the\nfateful day when the emperor saw that impudent smile on Basilius's\nface diat he realized his deadly mistake.\n\nHe had created a monster. He had allowed a man to see power up\nclosea man who tiien wanted more, who asked for anything and got it,\nwho felt encumbered by the charity he had received and simply did\nwhat many people do in such a situation: They forget the favors they\nhave received and imagine they have earned dieir success by their own\nmerits.\n\nAt Michael's moment of realization, he could still have saved his\nown life, but friendship and love blind every man to their interests.\nNobody believes a friend can betray. And Michael went on\ndisbelieving until the day his head ended up on a pike.\n\nLord, protect me from my friends; I can take care of my enemies.\n\nVoltaire, 1694-1778\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nFor several centuries after the fall of the Han Dynasty (a.D. 222),\nChinese history followed the same pattern of violent and bloody coups,\none after the other. Army men would plot to kill a weak emperor, dien\nwould replace him on the Dragon Throne with a strong general. The\ngeneral would start a new dynasty and crown himself emperor; to\nensure his own survival he would kill off his fellow generals. A few\nyears later, however, die pattern would resume: New generals would\nrise up and assassinate him or his sons in their turn. To be emperor of\nChina was to be alone, surrounded by a pack of enemiesit was die least\npowerful, least secure position in the realm.\n\nIn A.D. 959, General Chao K'uang-yin became Emperor Sung. He\nknew die odds, die probability diat witiiin a year or two he would be\nmurdered; how could he break the pattern Soon after becoming\nemperor, Sung ordered a banquet to celebrate the new dynasty, and\ninvited die most powerful commanders in die army. After tiiey had\ndrunk much wine, he\n\nis repaying a kindness.\n\nAfrican folk faff\n\ndismissed the guards and everybody else except the generals, who\nnow feared he would murder them in one fell swoop. Instead, he\naddressed them: \u201cThe whole day is spent in fear, and I am unhappy\nboth at the table and in my bed. For which one of you does not dream\nof ascending the throne I do not doubt your allegiance, but if by some\nchance your subordinates, seeking wealth and position, were to force\ndie emperor's yellow robe upon you in turn, how could you refuse it\u201d\nDrunk and fearing for their lives, the generals proclaimed their\ninnocence and their loyalty. But Sung had other ideas: \u201cThe best way\nto pass one's days is in peaceful enjoyment of riches and honor. If you\nare willing to give up your commands, I am ready to provide you with\nfine estates and beautiful dwellings where you may take your pleasure\nwith singers and girls as your companions.\u201d\n\nThe astonished generals realized that instead of a life of anxiety\nand struggle Sung was offering diem riches and security. The next day,\nall of me generals tendered their resignations, and diey retired as\nnobles to the estates mat Sung bestowed on them.\n\nIn one stroke, Sung turned a pack of \u201cfriendly\u201d wolves, who\nwould likely have betrayed him, into a group of docile lambs, far from\nall power.\n\nOver the next few years Sung continued his campaign to secure\nhis rule. In A.D. 971, King Liu of the Southern Han finally\nsurrendered to him after years of rebellion. To Liu's astonishment,\nSung gave him a rank in die imperial court and invited him to the\npalace to seal meir newfound friendship widi wine. As King Liu took\nthe glass that Sung offered him, he hesitated, fearing it contained\npoison. \u201cYour subject's crimes certainly merit deafh,\u201d he cried out,\n\u201cbut I beg Your Majesty to spare your subject's life. Indeed I dare not\ndrink this wine.\u201d Emperor Sung laughed, took die glass from Liu, and\nswallowed it himself. There was no poison. From men on Liu became\nhis most trusted and loyal friend.\n\nAt me time, China had splintered into many smaller kingdoms.\nWhen Ch'ien Shu, the king of one of these, was defeated, Sung's\nministers advised the emperor to lock diis rebel up. They presented\ndocuments proving that he was still conspiring to kill Sung. When\n\nCh'ien Shu came to visit the emperor, however, instead of locking him\nup, Sung honored him. He also gave him a package, which he told the\nformer king to open when he was halfway home. Ch'ien Shu opened\nthe bundle on his return journey and saw diat it contained all the\npapers documenting his conspiracy. He realized mat Sung knew of his\nmurderous plans, yet had spared him nonetheless. This generosity won\nhim over, and he too became one of Sung's most loyal vassals.\n\nInterpretation\n\nA Chinese proverb compares friends to die jaws and teeth of a\ndangerous animal: If you are not careful, you will find diem chewing\nyou up. Emperor Sung knew die jaws he was passing between when he\nassumed die dirone: His \u201cfriends\u201d in die army would chew him up like\nmeat, and if he somehow survived, his \u201cfriends\u201d in the government\nwould have him for supper.\n\nThere are many who think therefore that a wise prince ought,\nwhen he has the chance, to foment astutely some enmity, so that by\nsuppressing it he will augment his greatness. Princes, and especially\nnew ones, have found more faith and more usefulness in those men,\nwhom at the beginning of their power they regarded with suspicion,\nthan in those they at first confided in. Pandolfo Petrucci, prince of\nSiena, governed his state more by those whom he suspected than by\nothers.\n\nNiccolo Machiavelli, 1469-1527\n\nA brahman, a great expert in Veda who has become a great archer\nas well, offers his services to his good friend, who is now the king. The\nbrahman cries out when he sees the king, \u201cRecognize me, your\nfriend!\u201d The king answers him with contempt and then explains: \"Yes,\nwe were friends before, but our friendship was based on what power\nwe had. . . . I was friends with you, good brahman, because it served\nmy purpose. No pauper is friend to the rich, no fool to the wise, no\ncoward to the\n\nbrave. An old friend who needs him It is two men of equal wealth\nand equal birth who contract friendship and marriage, not a rich man\nand a pauper.... An old friendwho needs him\n\nTHE MAHABHARATA, C. THIRD CENTURY B.C.\n\nPick up a bee from\n\nkindness, and learn the\n\n\nlimitations of kindness.\n\nSufi proverb\n\nEmperor Sung would have no truck with \u201cfriends\u201dhe bribed his\nfellow generals witii splendid estates and kept diem far away. This was\na much better way to emasculate them than killing them, which would\nonly have led other generals to seek vengeance. And Sung would have\nnothing to do with \u201cfriendly\u201d ministers. More often than not, they\nwould end up drinking his famous cup of poisoned wine.\n\nInstead of relying on friends, Sung used his enemies, one after the\nother, transforming them into far more reliable subjects. While a friend\nexpects more and more favors, and seethes with jealousy, these former\nenemies expected nothing and got everything. A man suddenly spared\nthe guillotine is a grateful man indeed, and will go to die ends of die\nearth for the man who has pardoned him. In time, these former\nenemies became Sung's most trusted friends.\n\nAnd Sung was finally able to break die pattern of coups, violence,\nand civil warthe Sung Dynasty ruled China for more man Uiree\nhundred years.\n\nIn a speech Abraham Lincoln delivered at the height of the Civil\nWart,\n\nhe referred to the Southemers as fellow human beings who were\nin\n\nerror. An elderly lady chastised him for not calling them\nirreconcilable\n\nenemies who must be destroyed. \u201cWhy, madam,\u201d Lincoln replied,\n\n\u201cdo I not destroy my enemies when I make them my friends\u201d\n\nMen are more ready to repay an injury than a benefit, because\ngratitude is a burden and revenge a pleasure. Tacitus, c. a.d. 55-120\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nIt is natural to want to employ your friends when you find\nyourself in times of need. The world is a harsh place, and your friends\nsoften die harshness. Besides, you know diem. Why depend on a\nstranger when you have a friend at hand\n\nThe problem is that you often do not know your friends as well as\nyou imagine. Friends often agree on tilings in order to avoid an\nargument. They cover up their unpleasant qualities so as to not offend\neach other. They laugh extra hard at each odier's jokes. Since honesty\n\nrarely strengthens friendship, you may never know how a friend truly\nfeels. Friends will say that they love your poetry, adore your music,\nenvy your taste in clothesmaybe they mean it, often they do not.\n\nWhen you decide to hire a friend, you gradually discover the\nqualities he or she has kept hidden. Strangely enough, it is your act of\nkindness tiiat unbalances everything. People want to feel they deserve\ntheir good fortune. The receipt of a favor can become oppressive: It\nmeans you have been chosen because you are a friend, not necessarily\nbecause you are deserving. There is almost a touch of condescension\nin die act of hiring friends tiiat secredy afflicts diem. The injury will\ncome out slowly: A littie more honesty, flashes of resentment and envy\nhere and there, and before you know it your friendship fades. The\nmore favors and gifts you supply to revive the friendship, die less\ngratitude you receive.\n\nIngratitude has a long and deep history. It has demonstrated its\npowers\n\nfor so many centuries, that it is truly amazing that people continue\nto underestimate them. Better to be wary. If you never expect gratitude\nrom a friend, you will be pleasantly surprised when they do prove\ngrateful.\n\nThe problem with using or hiring friends is that it will inevitably\nlimit your power. The friend is rarely the one who is most able to help\nyou; and in the end, skill and competence are far more important than\ntiendly feelings. (Michael III had a man right under his nose who\nwould have steered him right and kept him alive: That man was\nBardas.)\n\nAll working situations require a kind of distance between people.\nYou are trying to work, not make friends; friendliness (real or false)\nonly obscures that fact. The key to power, then, is the ability to judge\nwho is best able to further your interests in all situations. Keep friends\nfor friendship, but work with the skilled and competent.\n\nYour enemies, on the other hand, are an untapped gold mine that\nyou must learn to exploit. When Talleyrand, Napoleon's foreign\nminister, decided in 1807 that his boss was leading France to ruin, and\nthe time had come to turn against him, he understood the dangers of\nconspiring against the emperor; he needed a partner, a confederatewhat\nfriend could he trust in such a project He chose Joseph Fouche, head of\n\n\nthe secret police, his most hated enemy, a man who had even tried to\nhave him assassinated. He knew that their former hatred would create\nan opportunity for an emotional reconciliation. He knew that Fouche\nwould expect nothing from him, and in fact would work to prove that\nhe was worthy of Talleyrand's choice; a person who has something to\nprove will move mountains for you. Finally, he knew that his\nrelationship with Fouche would be based on mutual self-interest, and\nwould not be contaminated by personal feeling. The selection proved\nperfect; although the conspirators did not succeed in toppling\nNapoleon, the union of such powerful but unlikely partners generated\nmuch interest in the cause; opposition to the emperor slowly began to\nspread. And from then on, Talleyrand and Fouche had a fruitful\nworking relationship. Whenever you can, bury the hatchet with an\nenemy, and make a point of putting him in your service.\n\nAs Lincoln said, you destroy an enemy when you make a friend\nof him. In 1971, during the Vietnam War, Henry Kissinger was the\ntarget of an unsuccessful kidnapping attempt, a conspiracy involving,\namong others, the renowned antiwar activist priests the Berrigan\nbrothers, four more Catholic priests, and four nuns. In private, without\ninforming the Secret Service or the Justice Department, Kissinger\narranged a Saturday-morning meeting with three of the alleged\nkidnappers.

In\n1937 the Japanese invaded China, interrupting the civil war between\nMao's Communists and their enemy, the Nationalists.\n\nFearing that the Japanese would wipe them out, some Communist\nleaders advocated leaving the Nationalists to fight the Japanese, and\nusing the time to recuperate. Mao disagreed: The Japanese could not\npossibly defeat and occupy a vast country like China for long. Once\nthey left, the Communists would have grown rusty if they had been out\nof combat for several years, and would be ill prepared to reopen their\nstruggle with the Nationalists. To fight a formidable foe like the\nJapanese, in fact, would be the perfect training for the Communists\u2019\nragtag army. Mao's plan was adopted, and it worked: By the time the\nJapanese finally retreated, the Communists had gained the fighting\nexperience that helped them defeat the Nationalists.\n\nYears later, a Japanese visitor tried to apologize to Mao for his\ncountry's invasion of China. Mao interrupted, \u201cShould I not thank you\ninstead\u201d Widiout a worthy opponent, he explained, a man or group\ncannot grow stronger.\n\nMao's strategy of constant conflict has several key components.\nFirst, be certain that in the long run you will emerge victorious. Never\npick a fight with someone you are not sure you can defeat, as Mao\nknew the Japanese would be defeated in time. Second, if you have no\napparent enemies, you must sometimes set up a convenient target, even\nturning a friend into an enemy. Mao used this tactic time and again in\npolitics. Third, use such enemies to define your cause more clearly to\nthe public, even framing it as a struggle of good against evil. Mao\nactually encouraged China's disagreements with the Soviet Union and\nthe United States; without clear-cut enemies, he believed, his people\nwould lose any sense of what Chinese Communism meant. A sharply\n\ndefined enemy is a far stronger argument for your side than all the\nwords you could possibly put together.\n\nNever let the presence of enemies upset or distress youyou are far\nbetter off with a declared opponent or two than not knowing where\nyour real enemies lie. The man of power welcomes conflict, using\nenemies to enhance his reputation as a surefooted fighter who can be\nrelied upon in times of uncertainty.\n\nImage: The Jaws of Ingratitude.

A man of power, for example, often has dirty work that has to\nbe done, but for the sake of appearances it is generally preferable to\nhave other people do it for him; friends often do this the best, since\ntheir affection for him makes them willing to take chances. Also, if\nyour plans go awry for some reason, you can use a friend as a\nconvenient scapegoat. This \u201cfall of the favorite\u201d was a trick often used\nby kings and sovereigns: They would let their closest friend at court\ntake the fall for a mistake, since the public would not believe that they\nwould deliberately sacrifice a friend for such a purpose. Of course,\nafter you play that card, you have lost your friend forever. It is best,\nthen, to reserve the scapegoat role for someone who is close to you but\nnot too close.\n\nFinally, the problem about working with friends is that it confuses\nthe boundaries and distances that working requires. But if both\npartners in the arrangement understand the dangers involved, a friend\noften can be employed to great effect. You must never let your guard\n\ndown in such a venture, however; always be on the lookout for any\nsigns of emotional disturbance such as envy and ingratitude. Nothing\nis stable in the realm of power, and even the closest of friends can be\ntransformed into the worst of enemies.\n'.

His mother, the Empress\nTheodora, had been banished to a nunnery, and her lover, Theoctistus,\nhad been murdered; at the head of the conspiracy to depose Theodora\nand enthrone Michael had been Michael's uncle, Bardas, a man of\nintelligence and ambition. Michael was now a young, inexperienced\ntuler, surrounded by intriguers, murderers, and profligates. In this time\nof peril he needed someone he could trust as his councillor, and his\ntiioughts turned to Basilius, his best friend. Basilius had no experience\nwhatsoever in government and politicsin fact, he was the head of the\nroyal stablesbut he had proven his love and gratitude time and again.\n\nThey had met a few years before, when Michael had been visiting\nthe stables just as a wild horse got loose. Basilius, a young groom from\npeasant Macedonian stock, had saved Michael's life. The groom's\nstrength and courage had impressed Michael, who immediately raised\nBasilius from die obscurity of being a horse trainer to die position of\nhead of die stables. He loaded his friend with gifts and favors and tiiey\nbecame inseparable. Basilius was sent to the finest school in\nByzantium, and the crude peasant became a cultured and sophisticated\ncourtier.\n\nNow Michael was emperor, and in need of someone loyal. Who\ncould he better trust with the post of chamberlain and chief councillor\nthan a young man who owed him everything\n\nBasilius could be trained for the job and Michael loved him like a\n\nbrother. Ignoring die advice of those who recommended die much\nmore qualified Bardas, Michael chose his friend.\nBasilius learned well and was soon advising the emperor on all\nmatters of state. The only problem seemed to be moneyBasilius never\nhad enough. Exposure to the splendor of Byzantine court life made\nhim avaricious for the perks of power. Michael doubled, then tripled\nhis salary, ennobled him, and married him off to his own mistress,\nEudoxia Ingerina. Keeping such a trusted friend and adviser satisfied\nwas worth any price. But more trouble was to come. Bardas was now\nhead of die army, and Basilius convinced Michael diat die man was\nhopelessly ambitious. Under die illusion diat he could control his\nnephew, Bardas had conspired to put him on the dirone, and he could\nconspire again, diis time to get rid of Michael and assume die crown\nhimself. Basilius poured poison into Michael's ear until the emperor\nagreed to have his uncle murdered. During a great horse race, Basilius\nclosed in on Bardas in the crowd and stabbed him to death. Soon after,\nBasilius asked that he replace Bardas as head of the army, where he\ncould keep control of die realm and quell rebellion. This was granted.\n\nNow Basilius's power and wealdi only grew, and a few years later\nMichael, in financial straits from his own extravagance, asked him to\npay back some of die money he had borrowed over the years. To\nMichael's shock and astonishment, Basilius refused, wiui a look of\nsuch impudence\n\nTo have a good enemy, choose a friend: He knows where to\nstrike.\n\nDiane de Poitiers, 1499-1566, mistress of Henri II of France\n\nEvery time I bestow a\n\nvacant office I make a\n\nhundred discontented\n\npersons and one\n\ningrate.\n\nLouis XIV, 1638-1715\n\n\nThus for my own part I have more than once been deceived by the\nperson I loved most and of whose love, above everyone else's, I have\nbeen most confident.

But when the\ndanger had passed and the farmer asked the snake to come out, the\nsnake refused. It was warm and safe inside. On his way home, the man\nsaw a heron and went up to him and whispered what had happened.\nThe heron told him to squat and strain to eject the snake. When the\nsnake snuck its head out, the heron caught it, pulled it out, and killed\nit. The farmer was worried that the snake's poison might still be inside\nhim, and the heron told him that the cure for snake poison was to cook\nand eat six white fowl. \u201c You 're a white fo w I, \u201d said the farmer.\n\u201cYou'll do for a start.\u201d He grabbed the heron, put it in a bag, and\ncarried it home, where he hung it up while he told his wife what had\nhappened. \u201cI'm surprised at you,\u201d said the wife. \u201cThe bird does you a\nkindness, rids you of the evil in your belly, saves your life in fact, yet\nyou catch it and talk of killing it. \u201d She immediately released the\nheron, and it flew away.

A few weeks later, after\na night of heavy drinking, Michael awoke to find himself surrounded\nby soldiers. Basilius watched as they stabbed the emperor to death.\nThen, after proclaiming himself emperor, he rode his horse through the\nstreets of Byzantium, brandishing the head of his former benefactor\nand best friend at die end of a long pike.\n\nInterpretation\n\nMichael III staked his future on the sense of gratitude he thought\nBasilius must feel for him. Surely Basilius would serve him best; he\nowed die emperor his wealtii, his education, and his position. Then,\nonce Basilius was in power, anything he needed it was best to give to\nhim, strengdiening the bonds between the two men. It was only on the\nfateful day when the emperor saw that impudent smile on Basilius's\nface diat he realized his deadly mistake.\n\nHe had created a monster. He had allowed a man to see power up\nclosea man who tiien wanted more, who asked for anything and got it,\nwho felt encumbered by the charity he had received and simply did\nwhat many people do in such a situation: They forget the favors they\nhave received and imagine they have earned dieir success by their own\nmerits.\n\nAt Michael's moment of realization, he could still have saved his\nown life, but friendship and love blind every man to their interests.\nNobody believes a friend can betray. And Michael went on\ndisbelieving until the day his head ended up on a pike.\n\nLord, protect me from my friends; I can take care of my enemies.\n\nVoltaire, 1694-1778\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nFor several centuries after the fall of the Han Dynasty (a.D. 222),\nChinese history followed the same pattern of violent and bloody coups,\none after the other. Army men would plot to kill a weak emperor, dien\nwould replace him on the Dragon Throne with a strong general. The\ngeneral would start a new dynasty and crown himself emperor; to\nensure his own survival he would kill off his fellow generals. A few\nyears later, however, die pattern would resume: New generals would\nrise up and assassinate him or his sons in their turn. To be emperor of\nChina was to be alone, surrounded by a pack of enemiesit was die least\npowerful, least secure position in the realm.\n\nIn A.D. 959, General Chao K'uang-yin became Emperor Sung. He\nknew die odds, die probability diat witiiin a year or two he would be\nmurdered; how could he break the pattern Soon after becoming\nemperor, Sung ordered a banquet to celebrate the new dynasty, and\ninvited die most powerful commanders in die army. After tiiey had\ndrunk much wine, he\n\nis repaying a kindness.\n\nAfrican folk faff\n\ndismissed the guards and everybody else except the generals, who\nnow feared he would murder them in one fell swoop. Instead, he\naddressed them: \u201cThe whole day is spent in fear, and I am unhappy\nboth at the table and in my bed. For which one of you does not dream\nof ascending the throne I do not doubt your allegiance, but if by some\nchance your subordinates, seeking wealth and position, were to force\ndie emperor's yellow robe upon you in turn, how could you refuse it\u201d\nDrunk and fearing for their lives, the generals proclaimed their\ninnocence and their loyalty. But Sung had other ideas: \u201cThe best way\nto pass one's days is in peaceful enjoyment of riches and honor. If you\nare willing to give up your commands, I am ready to provide you with\nfine estates and beautiful dwellings where you may take your pleasure\nwith singers and girls as your companions.\u201d\n\nThe astonished generals realized that instead of a life of anxiety\nand struggle Sung was offering diem riches and security. The next day,\nall of me generals tendered their resignations, and diey retired as\nnobles to the estates mat Sung bestowed on them.\n\nIn one stroke, Sung turned a pack of \u201cfriendly\u201d wolves, who\nwould likely have betrayed him, into a group of docile lambs, far from\nall power.\n\nOver the next few years Sung continued his campaign to secure\nhis rule. In A.D. 971, King Liu of the Southern Han finally\nsurrendered to him after years of rebellion. To Liu's astonishment,\nSung gave him a rank in die imperial court and invited him to the\npalace to seal meir newfound friendship widi wine. As King Liu took\nthe glass that Sung offered him, he hesitated, fearing it contained\npoison. \u201cYour subject's crimes certainly merit deafh,\u201d he cried out,\n\u201cbut I beg Your Majesty to spare your subject's life. Indeed I dare not\ndrink this wine.\u201d Emperor Sung laughed, took die glass from Liu, and\nswallowed it himself. There was no poison. From men on Liu became\nhis most trusted and loyal friend.\n\nAt me time, China had splintered into many smaller kingdoms.\nWhen Ch'ien Shu, the king of one of these, was defeated, Sung's\nministers advised the emperor to lock diis rebel up. They presented\ndocuments proving that he was still conspiring to kill Sung. When\n\nCh'ien Shu came to visit the emperor, however, instead of locking him\nup, Sung honored him. He also gave him a package, which he told the\nformer king to open when he was halfway home. Ch'ien Shu opened\nthe bundle on his return journey and saw diat it contained all the\npapers documenting his conspiracy. He realized mat Sung knew of his\nmurderous plans, yet had spared him nonetheless. This generosity won\nhim over, and he too became one of Sung's most loyal vassals.\n\nInterpretation\n\nA Chinese proverb compares friends to die jaws and teeth of a\ndangerous animal: If you are not careful, you will find diem chewing\nyou up. Emperor Sung knew die jaws he was passing between when he\nassumed die dirone: His \u201cfriends\u201d in die army would chew him up like\nmeat, and if he somehow survived, his \u201cfriends\u201d in the government\nwould have him for supper.\n\nThere are many who think therefore that a wise prince ought,\nwhen he has the chance, to foment astutely some enmity, so that by\nsuppressing it he will augment his greatness. Princes, and especially\nnew ones, have found more faith and more usefulness in those men,\nwhom at the beginning of their power they regarded with suspicion,\nthan in those they at first confided in. Pandolfo Petrucci, prince of\nSiena, governed his state more by those whom he suspected than by\nothers.\n\nNiccolo Machiavelli, 1469-1527\n\nA brahman, a great expert in Veda who has become a great archer\nas well, offers his services to his good friend, who is now the king. The\nbrahman cries out when he sees the king, \u201cRecognize me, your\nfriend!\u201d The king answers him with contempt and then explains: \"Yes,\nwe were friends before, but our friendship was based on what power\nwe had. . . . I was friends with you, good brahman, because it served\nmy purpose. No pauper is friend to the rich, no fool to the wise, no\ncoward to the\n\nbrave. An old friend who needs him It is two men of equal wealth\nand equal birth who contract friendship and marriage, not a rich man\nand a pauper.... An old friendwho needs him\n\nTHE MAHABHARATA, C.

This was\na much better way to emasculate them than killing them, which would\nonly have led other generals to seek vengeance. And Sung would have\nnothing to do with \u201cfriendly\u201d ministers. More often than not, they\nwould end up drinking his famous cup of poisoned wine.\n\nInstead of relying on friends, Sung used his enemies, one after the\nother, transforming them into far more reliable subjects. While a friend\nexpects more and more favors, and seethes with jealousy, these former\nenemies expected nothing and got everything. A man suddenly spared\nthe guillotine is a grateful man indeed, and will go to die ends of die\nearth for the man who has pardoned him. In time, these former\nenemies became Sung's most trusted friends.\n\nAnd Sung was finally able to break die pattern of coups, violence,\nand civil warthe Sung Dynasty ruled China for more man Uiree\nhundred years.\n\nIn a speech Abraham Lincoln delivered at the height of the Civil\nWart,\n\nhe referred to the Southemers as fellow human beings who were\nin\n\nerror.

Tacitus, c. a.d. 55-120\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nIt is natural to want to employ your friends when you find\nyourself in times of need. The world is a harsh place, and your friends\nsoften die harshness. Besides, you know diem. Why depend on a\nstranger when you have a friend at hand\n\nThe problem is that you often do not know your friends as well as\nyou imagine. Friends often agree on tilings in order to avoid an\nargument. They cover up their unpleasant qualities so as to not offend\neach other. They laugh extra hard at each odier's jokes. Since honesty\n\nrarely strengthens friendship, you may never know how a friend truly\nfeels. Friends will say that they love your poetry, adore your music,\nenvy your taste in clothesmaybe they mean it, often they do not.\n\nWhen you decide to hire a friend, you gradually discover the\nqualities he or she has kept hidden. Strangely enough, it is your act of\nkindness tiiat unbalances everything. People want to feel they deserve\ntheir good fortune. The receipt of a favor can become oppressive: It\nmeans you have been chosen because you are a friend, not necessarily\nbecause you are deserving. There is almost a touch of condescension\nin die act of hiring friends tiiat secredy afflicts diem. The injury will\ncome out slowly: A littie more honesty, flashes of resentment and envy\nhere and there, and before you know it your friendship fades. The\nmore favors and gifts you supply to revive the friendship, die less\ngratitude you receive.\n\nIngratitude has a long and deep history. It has demonstrated its\npowers\n\nfor so many centuries, that it is truly amazing that people continue\nto underestimate them. Better to be wary. If you never expect gratitude\nrom a friend, you will be pleasantly surprised when they do prove\ngrateful.\n\nThe problem with using or hiring friends is that it will inevitably\nlimit your power. The friend is rarely the one who is most able to help\nyou; and in the end, skill and competence are far more important than\ntiendly feelings. (Michael III had a man right under his nose who\nwould have steered him right and kept him alive: That man was\nBardas.)\n\nAll working situations require a kind of distance between people.\nYou are trying to work, not make friends; friendliness (real or false)\nonly obscures that fact. The key to power, then, is the ability to judge\nwho is best able to further your interests in all situations. Keep friends\nfor friendship, but work with the skilled and competent.\n\nYour enemies, on the other hand, are an untapped gold mine that\nyou must learn to exploit. When Talleyrand, Napoleon's foreign\nminister, decided in 1807 that his boss was leading France to ruin, and\nthe time had come to turn against him, he understood the dangers of\nconspiring against the emperor; he needed a partner, a confederatewhat\nfriend could he trust in such a project He chose Joseph Fouche, head of\n\n\nthe secret police, his most hated enemy, a man who had even tried to\nhave him assassinated. He knew that their former hatred would create\nan opportunity for an emotional reconciliation. He knew that Fouche\nwould expect nothing from him, and in fact would work to prove that\nhe was worthy of Talleyrand's choice; a person who has something to\nprove will move mountains for you. Finally, he knew that his\nrelationship with Fouche would be based on mutual self-interest, and\nwould not be contaminated by personal feeling. The selection proved\nperfect; although the conspirators did not succeed in toppling\nNapoleon, the union of such powerful but unlikely partners generated\nmuch interest in the cause; opposition to the emperor slowly began to\nspread. And from then on, Talleyrand and Fouche had a fruitful\nworking relationship. Whenever you can, bury the hatchet with an\nenemy, and make a point of putting him in your service.\n\nAs Lincoln said, you destroy an enemy when you make a friend\nof him.

A man of power, for example, often has dirty work that has to\nbe done, but for the sake of appearances it is generally preferable to\nhave other people do it for him; friends often do this the best, since\ntheir affection for him makes them willing to take chances. Also, if\nyour plans go awry for some reason, you can use a friend as a\nconvenient scapegoat. This \u201cfall of the favorite\u201d was a trick often used\nby kings and sovereigns: They would let their closest friend at court\ntake the fall for a mistake, since the public would not believe that they\nwould deliberately sacrifice a friend for such a purpose. Of course,\nafter you play that card, you have lost your friend forever. It is best,\nthen, to reserve the scapegoat role for someone who is close to you but\nnot too close.\n\nFinally, the problem about working with friends is that it confuses\nthe boundaries and distances that working requires. But if both\npartners in the arrangement understand the dangers involved, a friend\noften can be employed to great effect. You must never let your guard\n\ndown in such a venture, however; always be on the lookout for any\nsigns of emotional disturbance such as envy and ingratitude. Nothing\nis stable in the realm of power, and even the closest of friends can be\ntransformed into the worst of enemies.\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Below is an excerpt from my book titled '48 Laws of Power', specifically from Chapter '48 Laws of Power', Section 'LAW 3'. The original text is: 'CONCEAL YOUR INTENTIONS\n\nJUDGMENT\n\nKeep people off-balance and in the dark by never revealing the\npurpose behind your actions. If they have no clue what you are up to,\nthey cannot prepare a defense. Guide them far enough down the wrong\npath, envelop them in enough smoke, and by the time they realize your\nintentions, it will be too late.\n\nPART I: USE DECOYED OBJECTS OF DESIRE AND RED\nHERRINGS TO THROW PEOPLE OFF THE SCENT\n\nIf at any point in the deception you practice people have the\nslightest suspicion as to your intentions, all is lost. Do not give them\nthe chance to sense what you are up to: Throw them off the scent by\ndragging red herrings across the path. Use false sincerity, send\nambiguous signals, set up misleading objects of desire. Unable to\ndistinguish the genuine from the false, they cannot pick out your real\ngoal.\n\nTRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW,\n\nOver several weeks, Ninon de Lenclos, the most infamous\ncourtesan of seventeendi-century France, listened patiently as the\nMarquis de Sevigne explained his struggles in pursuing a beautiful but\ndifficult young countess. Ninon was sixty-two at me time, and more\nthan experienced in matters of love; the marquis was a lad of twenty-\ntwo, handsome, dashing, but hopelessly inexperienced in romance. At\nfirst Ninon was amused to hear the marquis talk about his mistakes,\nbut finally she had had enough. Unable to bear ineptitude in any realm,\nleast of all in seducing a woman, she decided to take the young man\nunder her wing. First, hi had to understand mat mis was war, and that\nthe beautiful countess was a Citadel to which he had to lay siege as\ncarefully as any general. Every step had to be planned and executed\nwith die utmost attention to detail and nuance.\n\n\nInstructing die marquis to start over, Ninon told him to approach\nthe countess with a bit of distance, an air of nonchalance. The next\ntime die two were alone togemer, she said, he would confide in the\ncountess as would a friend but not a potential lover. This was to mrow\nher off the scent. The countess was no longer to take his interest in her\nfor grantedperhaps he was only interested in friendship.\n\nNinon planned ahead. Once the countess was confused, it would\nbe time to make her jealous. At the next encounter, at a major fete in\nParis, die marquis would show up wim a beautiful young woman at his\nside. This beautiful young woman had equally beautiful friends, so\ntiiat wherever die countess would now see die marquis, he would be\nsurrounded by the most stunning young women in Paris. Not only\nwould die countess be seething widi jealousy, she would come to see\ndie marquis as someone who was desired by otiiers. It was hard for\nNinon to make the marquis understand, but she patiendy explained that\na woman who is interested in a man wants to see mat omer women are\ninterested in him, too. Not only does tiiat give him instant value, it\nmakes it all the more satisfying to snatch him from their clutches.\n\nOnce the countess was jealous but intrigued, it would be time to\nbeguile her. On Ninon's instructions, the marquis would fail to show\nup at affairs where die countess expected to see him. Then, suddenly,\nhe would appear at salons he had never frequented before, but tiiat die\ncountess at-\n\ntended often. She would be unable to predict his moves. All of\nthis would push her into the state of emotional confusion that is a\nprerequisite for successful seduction.\n\nThese moves were executed, and took several weeks. Ninon\nmonitored the marquis's progress: Through her network of spies, she\nheard how the countess would laugh a little harder at his witticisms,\nlisten more closely to his stories. She heard that the countess was\nsuddenly asking questions about him. Her friends told her that at social\naffairs the countess would often look up at the marquis, following his\nsteps. Ninon felt certain that the young woman was falling under his\nspell. It was a matter of weeks now, maybe a month or two, but if all\nwent smoothly, the citadel would fall.\n\nA few days later the marquis was at the countess's home. They\nwere alone. Suddenly he was a different man: This time acting on his\n\nown impulse, rather than following Ninon's instructions, he took the\ncountess's hands and told her he was in love with her. The young\nwoman seemed confused, a reaction he did not expect. She became\npolite, then excused herself. For the rest of the evening she avoided his\neyes, was not there to say good-night to him. The next few times he\nvisited he was told she was not at home. When she finally admitted\nhim again, the two felt awkward and uncomfortable with each other.\nThe spell was broken.\n\nInterpretation\n\nNinon de Lenclos knew everything about the art of love. The\ngreatest writers, thinkers, and politicians of the time had been her\nloversmen like La Rochefoucauld, Moliere, and Richelieu. Seduction\nwas a game to her, to be practiced with skill. As she got older, and her\nreputation grew, the most important families in France would send\ntheir sons to her to be instructed in matters of love.\n\nNinon knew that men and women are very different, but when it\ncomes to seduction they feel the same: Deep down inside, they often\nsense when they are being seduced, but they give in because they\nenjoy the feeling of being led along. It is a pleasure to let go, and to\nallow the other person to detour you into a strange country. Everything\nin seduction, however, depends on suggestion. You cannot announce\nyour intentions or reveal them direcdy in words. Instead you must\nthrow your targets off the scent. To surrender to your guidance they\nmust be appropriately confused. You have to scramble your\nsignalsappear interested in another man or woman (the decoy), then\nhint at being interested in the target, then feign indifference, on and on.\nSuch patterns not only confuse, they excite.\n\nImagine this story from the countess's perspective: After a few of\nthe marquis's moves, she sensed the marquis was playing some sort of\ngame, but die game delighted her. She did not know where he was\nleading her, but so much the better. His moves intrigued her, each of\nthem keeping her waiting for the next oneshe even enjoyed her\njealousy and confusion, for sometimes any emotion is better than the\nboredom of security. Perhaps the marquis had ulterior motives; most\nmen do. But she was willing to wait and\n\nsee, and probably if she had been made to wait long enough, what\nhe was up to would not have mattered.\n\n\nThe moment the marquis uttered that fatal word \u201clove,\u201d however,\nall was changed. This was no longer a game widi moves, it was an\nartless show of passion. His intention was revealed: He was seducing\nher. This put everything he had done in a new light. All that before had\nbeen charming now seemed ugly and conniving; the countess felt\nembarrassed and used. A door closed that would never open again.\n\nDo not be held a cheat, even though it is impossible to live today\nwithout being one. Let your greatest cunning lie in covering up what\nlooks like cunning,\n\nBaltasar (Wacidn, 1601-1658\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nIn 1850 the young Otto von Bismarck, then a thirty-five-year-old\ndeputy in the Prussian parliament, was at a turning point in his career.\nThe issues of the day were the unification of the many states\n(including Prussia) into which Germany was then divided, and a war\nagainst Austria, the powerful neighbor to the south diat hoped to keep\ndie Germans weak and at odds, even threatening to intervene if tiiey\ntried to unite. Prince William, next in line to be Prussia's king, was in\nfavor of going to war, and die parliament rallied to the cause, prepared\nto back any mobilization of troops. The only ones to oppose war were\nthe present king, Frederick William IV, and his ministers, who\npreferred to appease the powerful Austrians.\n\nThroughout his career, Bismarck had been a loyal, even\npassionate supporter of Prussian might and power. He dreamed of\nGerman unification, of going to war against Austria and humiliating\nthe country that for so long had kept Germany divided. A former\nsoldier, he saw warfare as a glorious business.\n\nThis, after all, was the man who years later would say, \u201cThe great\nquestions of the time will be decided, not by speeches and resolutions,\nbut by iron and blood.\u201d\n\nPassionate patriot and lover of military glory, Bismarck\nnevertheless gave a speech in parliament at the height of the war fever\nmat astonished all who heard it. \u201cWoe unto the statesman,\u201d he said,\n\u201cwho makes war without a reason mat will still be valid when the war\nis over! After the war, you will all look differendy at these questions.\nWill you men have the courage to turn to the peasant contemplating\nthe ashes of his farm, to the man who has been crippled, to the father\n\nwho has lost his children\u201d Not only did Bismarck go on to talk of the\nmadness of this war, but, strangest of all, he praised Austria and\ndefended her actions. This went against everything he had stood for.\nThe consequences were immediate. Bismarck was against the warwhat\ncould diis possibly mean Otiier deputies were confused, and several of\nthem changed their votes. Eventually die king and his ministers won\nout, and war was averted.\n\nA few weeks after Bismarck's infamous speech, the king, grateful\nthat\n\nhe had spoken for peace, made him a cabinet minister. A few\nyears later he became the Prussian premier. In this role he eventually\nled his country and a peace-loving king into a war against Austria,\ncrushing the former empire and establishing a mighty German state,\nwith Prussia at its head.\n\nInterpretation\n\nAt me time of his speech in 1850, Bismarck made several\ncalculations. First, he sensed that the Prussian military, which had not\nkept pace with other European armies, was unready for warthat\nAustria, in fact, might very well win, a disastrous result for the future.\nSecond, if the war were lost and Bismarck had supported it, his career\nwould be gravely jeopardized. The king and his conservative ministers\nwanted peace; Bismarck wanted power. The answer was to throw\npeople off the scent by supporting a cause he detested, saying things he\nwould laugh at if said by anomer. A whole country was fooled. It was\nbecause of Bismarck's speech that the king made him a minister, a\nposition from which he quickly rose to be prime minister, attaining the\npower to strengthen die Prussian military and accomplish what he had\nwanted all along: the humiliation of Austria and the unification of\nGermany under Prussia's leadership.\n\nBismarck was certainly one of die cleverest statesman who ever\nlived, a master of strategy and deception. No one suspected what he\nwas up to in mis case. Had he announced his real intentions, arguing\nthat it was better to wait now and fight later, he would not have won\nthe argument, since most Prussians wanted war at that moment and\nmistakenly believed diat their army was superior to the Austrians. Had\nhe played up to die king, asking to be made a minister in exchange for\n\nsupporting peace, he would not have succeeded either: The king would\nhave distrusted his ambition and doubted his sincerity.\n\nBy being completely insincere and sending misleading signals,\nhowever, he deceived everyone, concealed his purpose, and attained\nevery-diing he wanted. Such is the power of hiding your intentions.\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nMost people are open books. They say what they feel, blurt out\ntheir opinions at every opportunity, and constandy reveal their plans\nand intentions. They do tiiis for several reasons. First, it is easy and\nnatural to always want to talk about one's feelings and plans for the\nfuture. It takes effort to control your tongue and monitor what you\nreveal. Second, many believe mat by being honest and open they are\nwinning people's hearts and showing their good nature.They are\ngreatly deluded. Honesty is actually a blunt instrument, which bloodies\nmore than it cuts. Your honesty is likely to offend people; it is much\nmore prudent to tailor your words, telling people what they want to\nhear rather than the coarse and ugly trum of what you feel or diink.\nMore important, by being unabashedly open you make yourself so\npredictable and familiar diat it is almost impossible to respect or fear\nyou, and power will not accrue to a person who cannot inspire such\nemotions.\n\nIf you yearn for power, quickly lay honesty aside, and train\nyourself in the art of concealing your intentions. Master the art and you\nwill always have the upper hand. Basic to an ability to conceal one's\nintentions is a simple truth about human nature: Our first instinct is to\nalways trust appearances. We cannot go around doubting the reality of\nwhat we see and hearconstantly imagining that appearances concealed\nsometiiing else would exhaust and terrify us. This fact makes it\nrelatively easy to conceal one's intentions. Simply dangle an object you\nseem to desire, a goal you seem to aim for, in front of people's eyes\nand they will take the appearance for reality. Once their eyes focus on\nthe decoy, they will fail to notice what you are really up to. In\nseduction, set up conflicting\u2019 signals, such as desire and indifference,\nand you not only throw them off the scent, you inflame meir desire to\npossess you.\n\nA tactic that is often effective in setting up a red herring is to\nappear to support an idea or cause that is actually contrary to your own\n\nsentiments. (Bismarck used this to great effect in his speech in 1850.)\nMost people will believe you have experienced a change of heart,\nsince it is so unusual to play so lightly with something as emotional as\none's opinions and values. The same applies for any decoyed object of\ndesire: Seem to want something in which you are actually not at all\ninterested and your enemies will be thrown off the scent, making all\nkinds of errors in their calculations.\n\nDuring the War of the Spanish Succession in 1711, the Duke of\nMarlborough, head of the English army, wanted to destroy a key\nFrench fort, because it protected a vital thoroughfare into France. Yet\nhe knew that if he destroyed it, the French would realize what he\nwantedto advance down that road. Instead, then, he merely captured\nthe fort, and garrisoned it with some of his troops, making it appear as\nif he wanted it for some purpose of his own. The French attacked the\nort and the duke let them recapture it. Once they had it back, though,\nthey destroyed it, figuring that the duke had wanted it for some\nimportant reason. Now that the fort was gone, the road was\nunprotected, and Marlborough could easily march into France.\n\nUse this tactic in the following manner: Hide your intentions not\nby closing up (with the risk of appearing secretive, and making people\nsuspicious) but by talking endlessly about your desires and goals!just\nnot your real ones. You will kill three birds with one stone: You appear\ntiendly, open, and trusting; you conceal your intentions; and you send\nyour rivals on time-consuming wild-goose chases.\n\nAnother powerful tool in throwing people off the scent is false\nsincerity. People easily mistake sincerity for honesty. Remembertheir\n\u2018irst instinct is to trust appearances, and since they value honesty and\nwant to believe in the honesty of those around tiiem, they will rarely\ndoubt you or see through your act. Seeming to believe what you say\ngives your words great weight. This is how Iago deceived and\ndestroyed Othello: Given the depth of his emotions, the apparent\nsincerity of his concerns about Desde-mona's supposed infidelity, how\ncould Othello distrust him This is also how the great con artist Yellow\nKid Weil pulled the wool over suckers' eyes: Seeming to believe so\ndeeply in the decoyed object he was dangling\n\nin front of them (a phony stock, a touted racehorse), he made its\nreality hard to doubt. It is important, of course, not to go too far in this\n\n\narea. Sincerity is a tricky tool: Appear overpassionate and you raise\nsuspicions. Be measured and believable or your ruse will seem the put-\non mat it is.\n\nTo make your false sincerity an effective weapon in concealing\nyour intentions, espouse a belief in honesty and forthrightness as\nimportant social values. Do tiiis as publicly as possible. Emphasize\nyour position on tiiis subject by occasionally divulging some heartfelt\nthoughtthough only one that is actually meaningless or irrelevant, of\ncourse. Napoleon's minister Talleyrand was a master at taking people\ninto his confidence by revealing some apparent secret. This feigned\nconfidencea decoywould then elicit a real confidence on die other\nperson's part.\n\nRemember: The best deceivers do everything they can to cloak\ntheir roguish qualities. They cultivate an air of honesty in one area to\ndisguise their dishonesty in omers. Honesty is merely another decoy in\ntheir arsenal of weapons.\n\nPART II: USE SMOKE SCREENS TO DISGUISE YOUR\nACTIONS\n\nDeception is always the best strategy, but the best deceptions\nrequire a screen\n\nof smoke to distract people's attention from your real purpose.\nThe bland\n\nexteriorlike the unreadable poker faceis often the perfect smoke\nscreen,\n\nhiding your intentions behind the comfortable and familiar. If you\nlead the\n\nsucker down a familiar path, he won't catch on when you lead him\nintoa\n\ntrap.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW I\n\nIn 1910, a Mr. Sam Geezil of Chicago sold his warehouse\nbusiness for close to $ 1 million. He settled down to semiretirement\nand the managing of his many properties, but deep inside he itched for\nthe old days of deal-making. One day a young man named Joseph Weil\nvisited his office, wanting to buy an apartment he had up for sale.\nGeezil explained the terms: The price was $8,000, but he only required\na down payment of $2,000. Weil said he would sleep on it, but he\n\ncame back the following day and offered to pay the full $8,000 in cash,\nif Geezil could wait a couple of days, until a deal Weil was working on\ncame through. Even in semiretirement, a clever businessman like\nGeezil was curious as to how Weil would be able to come up wim so\nmuch cash (roughly $150,000 today) so quickly. Weil seemed reluctant\nto say, and quickly changed the subject, but Geezil was persistent.\nFinally, after assurances of confidentiality, Weil told Geezil the\nollowing story.\n\nWeil's uncle was the secretary to a coterie of multimillionaire\n\u2018inanciers. These wealthy gentlemen had purchased a hunting lodge in\nMichigan ten years ago, at a cheap price. They had not used die lodge\n\u2018or a few years, so they had decided to sell it and had asked Weil's\nuncle to get whatever he could for it. For reasonsgood reasonsof his\nown, the uncle had been nursing a grudge against the millionaires for\nyears; this was his chance to get back at them. He would sell die\nproperty for $35,000 to a setup man (whom it was Weil's job to find).\nThe financiers were too wealdiy to worry about this low price. The set-\nup man would men turn around and sell the property again for its real\nprice, around $155,000. The uncle, Weil, and die tiiird man would split\nthe profits from this second sale. It was all legal and for a good\ncausethe uncle's just retribution.\n\nGeezil had heard enough: He wanted to be the set-up buyer. Weil\nwas reluctant to involve him, but Geezil would not back down: The\nidea of a large profit, plus a little adventure, had him champing at the\nbit. Weil explained mat Geezil would have to put up the $35,000 in\ncash to bring die deal off. Geezil, a millionaire, said he could get die\nmoney with a snap of his fingers. Weil finally relented and agreed to\narrange a meeting between the uncle, Geezil, and die financiers, in the\ntown of Galesburg, Illinois.\n\nOn die train ride to Galesburg, Geezil met the unclean impressive\n\nJKIII'. KINC OF ISUAFI.. I-\"KICNS WORSHIP Oh Till\u2019. 1DOI.\nBAAL\n\nThen Jehu assembled all the people, and said to them, \u201cAhab\nserved Ba \u2018al a little; but Jehu will serve him much more. Now\ntherefore call to me all the prophets of Ba\u2018al, all his worshippers and\nall his priests; let none be missing, for I have a great sacrifice to offer\nto Ba \u2018al; whoever is missing shall not live.\u201d But Jehu did it with\n\n\ncunning in order to destroy the worshippers of Ba \u2018al. And Jehu\nordered, \u201cSanctify a solemn assembly for Ba \u2018al. \u201d So they proclaimed\nit. And Jehu sent throughout all Israel; and all the worshippers of Ba'al\ncame, so that there was not a man left who did not come. And they\nentered the house of Ba'al, and the house of Ba'al was filled from one\nend to the other. . . . Then Jehu went into the house of Ba\u2019al... and he\nsaid to the worshippers of Ba'al, \"Search, and see that there is no\nservant of the LORD here\n\namong you, but only\n\nthe worshippers of\n\nBa'al.\" Then he went in\n\nto offer sacrifices and\n\nburnt offerings.\n\nNow Jehu had\n\nstationed eighty men\n\noutside, and said, \"The\n\nman who allows any of\n\nthose whom I give into\n\nyour hands to escape\n\nshall forfeit his life.\" So\n\nas soon as he had made\n\nan end of offering the\n\nburnt offering, Jehu\n\nsaid to the guard and to\n\nthe officers, \"Go in and\n\nslay them; let not a man\n\nescape.\"\n\nSo when they put them\n\nto the sword, the guard\n\nand the officers cast\n\nthem out and went into\n\nthe inner room of the\n\nhouse of Ba'al and they\n\nbrought out the pillar\n\nthat was in the house of\n\nBa'al and burned it.\n\nAnd they demolished\n\n\nthe pillar of Ba \u2018al and\n\ndemolished the house\n\nof Ba'al, and made it a\n\nlatrine to this day.\n\nThus Jehu wiped out\n\nBa'al from Israel.\n\nold testament, 2 kings 10:18-28\n\nman, with whom he avidly discussed business. Weil also brought\nalong a companion, a somewhat paunchy man named George Gross.\nWeil explained to Geezil that he himself was a boxing trainer, that\nGross was one of the promising prizefighters he trained, and that he\nhad asked Gross to come along to make sure the fighter stayed in\nshape. For a promising fighter, Gross was unimpressive lookinghe had\ngray hair and a beer bellybut Geezil was so excited about the deal that\nhe didn't really think about the man's flabby appearance.\n\nOnce in Galesburg, Weil and his uncle went to fetch the financiers\nwhile Geezil waited in a hotel room with Gross, who promptly put on\nhis boxing trunks. As Geezil half watched, Gross began to shadowbox.\nDistracted as he was, Geezil ignored how badly die boxer wheezed\nafter a few minutes of exercise, although his style seemed real enough.\nAn hour later, Weil and his uncle reappeared with the financiers, an\nimpressive, intimidating group of men, all wearing fancy suits. The\nmeeting went well and the financiers agreed to sell the lodge to Geezil,\nwho had already had the $35,000 wired to a local bank.\n\nThis minor business now setded, the financiers sat back in their\nchairs and began to banter about high finance, throwing out the name\n\u2018J. P. Morgan\" as if they knew the man. Finally one of them noticed die\nboxer in the corner of the room. Weil explained what he was doing\ndiere. The financier countered that he too had a boxer in his entourage,\nwhom he named. Weil laughed brazenly and exclaimed that his man\ncould easily knock out their man. Conversation escalated into\nargument. In the heat of passion, Weil challenged the men to a bet. The\nfinanciers eagerly agreed and left to get their man ready for a fight the\nnext day.\n\nAs soon as Uiey had left, the uncle yelled at Weil, right in front of\nGeezil: They did not have enough money to bet with, and once the\nfinanciers discovered this, the uncle would be fired. Weil apologized\n\nfor getting him in this mess, but he had a plan: He knew the odier\nboxer well, and with a littie bribe, they could fix the fight. But where\nwould the money come from for the bet the uncle replied. Without it\nthey were as good as dead. Finally Geezil had heard enough.\nUnwilling to jeopardize his deal with any ill will, he offered his own\n$35,000 cash for part of the bet. Even if he lost that, he would wire for\nmore money and still make a profit on the sale of the lodge. The uncle\nand nephew thanked him. With their own $15,000 and Geezil's\n$35,000 they would manage to have enough for the bet. That evening,\nas Geezil watched the two boxers rehearse die fix in the hotel room,\nhis mind reeled at the killing he was going to make from both the\nboxing match and the sale of the lodge.\n\nThe fight took place in a gym the next day. Weil handled the cash,\nwhich was placed for security in a locked box. Everything was\nproceeding as planned in the hotel room. The financiers were looking\nglum at how badly their fighter was doing, and Geezil was dreaming\nabout the easy money he was about to make. Then, suddenly, a wild\nswing by the financier's fighter hit Gross hard in the face, knocking\nhim down. When he hit the canvas, blood spurted from his mouth. He\ncoughed, then lay still.\n\nOne of die financiers, a former doctor, checked his pulse; he was\ndead. The millionaires panicked: Everyone had to get out before the\npolice arrived they could all be charged with murder.\n\nTerrified, Geezil hightailed it out of the gym and back to Chicago,\nleaving behind his $35,000 which he was only too glad to forget, for it\nseemed a small price to pay to avoid being implicated in a crime. He\nnever wanted to see Weil or any of the others again.\n\nAfter Geezil scurried out, Gross stood up, under his own steam.\nThe blood that had spurted from his mouth came from a ball filled with\nchicken blood and hot water diat he had hidden in his cheek. The\nwhole affair had been masterminded by Weil, better known as \u201cthe\nYellow Kid,\u201d one of die most creative con artists in history. Weil split\nthe $35,000 with the financiers and the boxers (all fellow con artists)a\nnice little profit for a few days' work.\n\nInterpretation\n\nThe Yellow Kid had staked out Geezil as the perfect sucker long\nbefore he set up the con. He knew the boxing-match scam would be\n\n\nthe perfect ruse to separate Geezil from his money quickly and\ndefinitively. But he also knew diat if he had begun by trying to interest\nGeezil in the boxing match, he would have failed miserably. He had to\nconceal his intentions and switch attention, create a smoke screenin\nthis case die sale of the lodge.\n\nOn die train ride and in the hotel room Geezil's mind had been\ncompletely occupied with the pending deal, the easy money, the\nchance to hobnob with wealthy men. He had failed to notice that Gross\nwas out of shape and middle-aged at best. Such is die distracting\npower of a smoke screen. Engrossed in the business deal, Geezil's\nattention was easily diverted to the boxing match, but only at a point\nwhen it was already too late for him to notice the details that would\nhave given Gross away. The match, after all, now depended on a bribe\nradier than on die boxer's physical condition.

Approach your mark with an idea diat seems\nordinary enougha business deal, financial intrigue. The sucker's mind\nis distracted, his suspicions allayed. That is when you gentiy guide him\nonto the second path, die slippery slope down which he slides\nhelplessly into your trap.\n\nSNEAK ACROSS THE OCEAN IN HROAD DAYEICHT\n\nThis means to create a front that eventually becomes imbued with\nan atmosphere or impression of familiarity, within which the strategist\nmay maneuver unseen while all eyes are trained to see obvious\nfamiliarities.\n\n\u201cTHE THIRTY-SIX STRATEGIES,\u201d QUOTED IN THE\nIAPANESE ART OF WAR,\n\nThomas Cleary, 1991\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II\n\nIn the mid- 1920s, the powerful warlords of Etiiiopia were\ncoming to the realization diat a young man of die nobility named Haile\nSelassie, also known as Ras Tafari, was outcompeting them all and\nnearing the point where he could proclaim himself their leader,\nunifying the country for the first time in decades. Most of his rivals\n\ncould not understand how tiiis wispy, quiet, mild-mannered man had\nbeen able to take control. Yet in\n\n1927, Selassie was able to summon the warlords, one at a time, to\ncome to Addis Ababa to declare their loyalty and recognize him as\nleader.\n\nSome hurried, some hesitated, but only one, Dejazmach Balcha of\nSidamo, dared defy Selassie totally. A blustery man, Balcha was a\ngreat warrior, and he considered the new leader weak and unworthy.\nHe pointedly stayed away from die capital. Finally Selassie, in his\ngende but stern way, commanded Balcha to come. The warlord\ndecided to obey, but in doing so he would turn the tables on diis\npretender to die Ediiopian dirone: He would come to Addis Ababa at\nhis own speed, and widi an army of 10,000 men, a force large enough\nto defend himself, perhaps even start a civil war. Stationing tiiis\nformidable force in a valley three miles from the capital, he waited, as\na king would. Selassie would have to come to him.\n\nSelassie did indeed send emissaries, asking Balcha to attend an\nafternoon banquet in his honor. But Balcha, no fool, knew historyhe\nknew that previous kings and lords of Ethiopia had used banquets as a\ntrap. Once he was there and full of drink, Selassie would have him\narrested or murdered. To signal his understanding of die situation, he\nagreed to come to the banquet, but only if he could bring his personal\nbodyguard600 of his best soldiers, all armed and ready to defend him\nand diemselves. To Balcha's surprise, Selassie answered with the\nutmost politeness diat he would be honored to play host to such\nwarriors.\n\nOn the way to the banquet, Balcha warned his soldiers not to get\ndrunk and to be on their guard. When they arrived at the palace,\nSelassie was his charming best. He deferred to Balcha, treated him as\nif he desperately needed his approval and cooperation. But Balcha\nrefused to be charmed, and he warned Selassie that if he did not return\nto his camp by nightfall, his army had orders to attack die capital.\nSelassie reacted as if hurt by his mistrust. Over the meal, when it came\ntime for the traditional singing of songs in honor of Ethiopia's leaders,\nhe made a point of allowing only songs honoring the warlord of\nSidamo. It seemed to Balcha that Selassie was scared, intimidated by\nthis great warrior who could not be outwitted. Sensing the change,\n\nBalcha believed that he would be the one to call die shots in the days\nto come.\n\nAt the end of the afternoon, Balcha and his soldiers began their\nmarch back to camp amidst cheers and gun salutes. Looking back to\nthe capital over his shoulder, he planned his strategyhow his own\nsoldiers would march through the capital in triumph widiin weeks, and\nSelassie would be put in his place, his place being either prison or\ndeath. When Balcha came in sight of his camp, however, he saw that\nsomething was terribly wrong. Where before there had been colorful\ntents stretching as far as die eye could see, now there was nodiing,\nonly smoke from doused fires. What devil's magic was this\n\nA witness told Balcha what had happened. During the banquet, a\nlarge army, commanded by an ally of Selassie's, had stolen up on\nBalcha's encampment by a side route he had not seen. This army had\nnot come to fight, however: Knowing that Balcha would have heard a\nnoisy batde and\n\nhurried back with his 600-man bodyguard, Selassie had,armed his\nown troops with baskets of gold and cash. They had surrounded\nBalcha's army and proceeded to purchase every last one of their\nweapons. Those who refused were easily intimidated. Within a few\nhours, Balcha's entire force had been disarmed and scattered in all\ndirections.\n\nRealizing his danger, Balcha decided to march south with his 600\nsoldiers to regroup, but the same army that had disarmed his soldiers\nblocked his way. The other way out was to march on the capital, but\nSelassie had set a large army to defend it. Like a chess player, he had\npredicted Balcha's moves, and had checkmated him. For the first time\nin his life, Balcha surrendered. To repent his sins of pride and\nambition, he agreed to enter a monastery.\n\nInterpretation\n\nThroughout Selassie's long reign, no one could quite figure him\nout. Ethiopians like their leaders fierce, but Selassie, who wore the\nfront of a gende, peace-loving man, lasted longer than any of them.\nNever angry or impatient, he lured his victims with sweet smiles,\nlulling them with charm and obsequiousness before he attacked. In the\ncase of Balcha, Selassie played on the man's wariness, his suspicion\nthat the banquet was a trap which in fact it was, but not the one he\n\nexpected. Selassie's way of allaying Balcha's fearsletting him bring his\nbodyguard to the banquet, giving him top billing there, making him\nfeel in controlcreated a thick smoke screen, concealing the real action\nthree miles away.\n\nRemember: The paranoid and wary are often the easiest to\ndeceive. Win their trust in one area and you have a smoke screen that\nblinds their view in anodier, letting you creep up and level them with a\ndevastating blow. A helpful or apparently honest gesture, or one that\nimplies the other person's superioritythese are perfect diversionary\ndevices.\n\nProperly set up, the smoke screen is a weapon of great power. It\nenabled the gentle Selassie to totally destroy his enemy, without firing\na single bullet.\n\nDo not underestimate the power of Tafari. He creeps like a mouse\nbut he has jaws like a lion.\n\nBalclia of Sidamo's last words before entering the monastery\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nIf you believe that deceivers are colorful folk who mislead with\nelaborate lies and tall tales, you are greatly mistaken. The best\ndeceivers utilize a bland and inconspicuous front that calls no attention\nto themselves. They know that extravagant words and gestures\nimmediately raise suspicion. Instead, they envelop their mark in the\nfamiliar, the banal, the harmless. In Yellow Kid Weil's dealings with\nSam Geezil, the familiar was a business deal. In the Ethiopian case, it\nwas Selassie's misleading obsequiousness exacdy what Balcha would\nhave expected from a weaker warlord.\n\nOnce you have lulled your suckers' attention with the familiar,\nthey will not notice the deception being perpetrated behind their backs.\nThis derives from a simple truth: people can only focus on one thing at\na time. It is really too difficult for them to imagine that the bland and\nharmless person they are dealing with is simultaneously setting up\nsomething else. The grayer and more uniform the smoke in your\nsmoke screen, the better it conceals your intentions. In the decoy and\nred herring devices discussed in Part I, you actively distract people; in\nthe smoke screen, you lull your victims, drawing them into your web.\nBecause it is so hypnotic, this is often the best way of concealing your\nintentions.\n\nThe simplest form of smoke screen is facial expression. Behind a\nbland, unreadable exterior, all sorts of mayhem can be planned,\nwithout detection. This is a weapon that the most powerful men in\nhistory have learned to perfect. It was said that no one could read\nFranklin D. Roosevelt's face. Baron James Rothschild made a lifelong\npractice of disguising his real thoughts behind bland smiles and\nnondescript looks. Stendhal wrote of Talleyrand, \u201cNever was a face\nless of a barometer.\u201d Henry Kissinger would bore his opponents\naround the negotiating table to tears with his monotonous voice, his\nblank look, his endless recitations of details; then, as their eyes glazed\nover, he would suddenly hit them with a list of bold terms. Caught off-\nguard, they would be easily intimidated. As one poker manual explains\nit, \u201cWhile playing his hand, the good player is seldom an actor. Instead\nhe practices a bland behavior that minimizes readable patterns,\nTustrates and confuses opponents, permits greater concentration.\u201d\n\nAn adaptable concept, the smoke screen can be practiced on a\nnumber of levels, all playing on the psychological principles of\ndistraction and misdirection. One of the most effective smoke screens\nis the noble gesture. People want to believe apparently noble gestures\nare genuine, for the belief is pleasant. They rarely notice how\ndeceptive these gestures can be.\n\nThe art dealer Joseph Duveen was once confronted with a terrible\nproblem. The millionaires who had paid so dearly for Duveen's\npaintings were running out of wall space, and with inheritance taxes\ngetting ever higher, it seemed unlikely that they would keep buying.\nThe solution was the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.,\nwhich Duveen helped create in 1937 by getting Andrew Mellon to\ndonate his collection to it. The National Gallery was the perfect front\nfor Duveen. In one gesture, his clients avoided taxes, cleared wall\nspace for new purchases, and reduced the number of paintings on the\nmarket, maintaining the upward pressure on their prices. All this while\nthe donors created the appearance of being public benefactors.\n\nAnother effective smoke screen is the pattern, the establishment\nof a series of actions that seduce die victim into believing you will\ncontinue in die same way. The pattern plays on the psychology of\nanticipation: Our behavior conforms to patterns, or so we like to think.\n\n\nIn 1878 the American robber baron Jay Gould created a company\ndiat began to threaten die monopoly of die telegraph company Western\nUnion. The directors of Western Union decided to buy Gould's\ncompany up\n\nthey had to spend a hefty sum, but they figured they had managed\nto rid themselves of an irritating competitor. A few months later,\nthough, Gould was it at again, complaining he had been treated\nunfairly. He started up a second company to compete with Western\nUnion and its new acquisition. The same thing happened again:\nWestern Union bought him out to shut him up. Soon the pattern began\nfor the third time, but now Gould went for uie jugular: He suddenly\nstaged a bloody takeover struggle and managed to gain complete\ncontrol of Western Union. He had established a pattern that had tricked\nthe company's directors into thinking his goal was to be bought out at a\nhandsome rate. Once they paid him off, they relaxed and failed to\nnotice that he was actually playing for higher stakes. The pattern is\npowerful in that it deceives the other person into expecting the\nopposite of what you are really doing.\n\nAnother psychological weakness on which to construct a smoke\nscreen is the tendency to mistake appearances for realitythe feeling\nthat if someone seems to belong to your group, their belonging must be\nreal. This habit makes the seamless blend a very effective front. The\ntrick is simple: You simply blend in with those around you. The better\nyou blend, the less suspicious you become. During the Cold War of the\n1950s and '60s, as is now notorious, a slew of British civil servants\npassed secrets to the Soviets. They went undetected for years because\nthey were apparently decent chaps, had gone to all the right schools,\nand fit the old-boy network perfectly. Blending in is the perfect smoke\nscreen for spying. The better you do it, the better you can conceal your\nintentions.\n\nRemember: It takes patience and humility to dull your brilliant\ncolors, to put on the mask of the inconspicuous. Do not despair at\nhaving to wear such a bland maskit is often your unreadability that\ndraws people to you and makes you appear a person of power.\n\nImage: A Sheep's Skin. A sheep never marauds, a sheep never\ndeceives, a sheep is magnificently dumb and docile. With a sheepskin\non his back, a fox can pass right into the chicken coop.\n\nAuthority: Have you ever heard of a skillful general, who intends\nto surprise a citadel, announcing his plan to his enemy Conceal your\npurpose and hide your progress; do not disclose the extent of your\ndesigns until they cannot be opposed, until the combat is over. Win the\nvictory before you declare the war. In a word, imitate those warlike\npeople whose designs are not known except by the ravaged country\nthrough which they have passed. (Ninon de Lenclos, 1623-1706)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nNo smoke screen, red herring, false sincerity, or any other\ndiversionary device will succeed in concealing your intentions if you\nalready have an established reputation for deception. And as you get\nolder and achieve success, it often becomes increasingly difficult to\ndisguise your cunning. Everyone knows you practice deception; persist\nin playing naive and you run the risk of seeming die rankest hypocrite,\nwhich will severely limit your room to maneuver. In such cases it is\nbetter to own up, to appear the honest rogue, or, better, the repentant\nrogue. Not only will you be admired for your frankness, but, most\nwonderful and strange of all, you will be able to continue your\nstratagems.\n\nAs P. T. Bamum, the nineteentii-century king of humbuggery,\ngrew older, he learned to embrace his reputation as a grand deceiver.\nAt one point he organized a buffalo hunt in New Jersey, complete witii\nIndians and a few imported buffalo. He publicized die hunt as genuine,\nbut it came off as so completely fake that die crowd, instead of getting\nangry and asking for their money back, was gready amused. They\nknew Barnum pulled tricks all the time; diat was the secret of his\nsuccess, and they loved him for it. Learning a lesson from this affair,\nBarnum stopped concealing all of his devices, even revealing his\ndeceptions in a tell-all autobiography. As Kierkegaard wrote, \u201cThe\nworld wants to be deceived.\u201d\n\nFinally, although it is wiser to divert attention from your purposes\nby presenting a bland, familiar exterior, diere are times when die\ncolorful, conspicuous gesture is die right diversionary tactic. The great\ncharlatan mountebanks of seventeendi- and eighteenth-century Europe\nused humor and entertainment to deceive their audiences. Dazzled by a\ngreat show, the public would not notice the charlatans' real intentions.\nThus the star charlatan himself would appear in town in a night-black\n\n\ncoach drawn by black horses. Clowns, tightrope walkers, and star\nentertainers would accompany him, pulling people in to his\ndemonstrations of elixirs and quack potions. The charlatan made\nentertainment seem like die business of die day; the business of die\nday was actually die sale of the elixirs and quack potions.\n\nSpectacle and entertainment, clearly, are excellent devices to\nconceal your intentions, but diey cannot be used indefinitely. The\npublic grows tired and suspicious, and eventually catches on to die\ntrick. And indeed die charlatans had to move quickly from town to\ntown, before word spread tiiat die potions were useless and die\nentertainment a trick. Powerful people with bland exteriors, on the\nodier handdie Talleyrands, die Rotii-schilds, die Selassiescan practice\ntiieir deceptions in die same place tiiroughout their lifetimes. Their act\nnever wears thin, and rarely causes suspicion. The colorful smoke\nscreen should be used cautiously, then, and only when die occasion is\nright.\n'.

Ninon was sixty-two at me time, and more\nthan experienced in matters of love; the marquis was a lad of twenty-\ntwo, handsome, dashing, but hopelessly inexperienced in romance. At\nfirst Ninon was amused to hear the marquis talk about his mistakes,\nbut finally she had had enough. Unable to bear ineptitude in any realm,\nleast of all in seducing a woman, she decided to take the young man\nunder her wing. First, hi had to understand mat mis was war, and that\nthe beautiful countess was a Citadel to which he had to lay siege as\ncarefully as any general. Every step had to be planned and executed\nwith die utmost attention to detail and nuance.\n\n\nInstructing die marquis to start over, Ninon told him to approach\nthe countess with a bit of distance, an air of nonchalance. The next\ntime die two were alone togemer, she said, he would confide in the\ncountess as would a friend but not a potential lover. This was to mrow\nher off the scent. The countess was no longer to take his interest in her\nfor grantedperhaps he was only interested in friendship.\n\nNinon planned ahead. Once the countess was confused, it would\nbe time to make her jealous. At the next encounter, at a major fete in\nParis, die marquis would show up wim a beautiful young woman at his\nside. This beautiful young woman had equally beautiful friends, so\ntiiat wherever die countess would now see die marquis, he would be\nsurrounded by the most stunning young women in Paris. Not only\nwould die countess be seething widi jealousy, she would come to see\ndie marquis as someone who was desired by otiiers. It was hard for\nNinon to make the marquis understand, but she patiendy explained that\na woman who is interested in a man wants to see mat omer women are\ninterested in him, too. Not only does tiiat give him instant value, it\nmakes it all the more satisfying to snatch him from their clutches.\n\nOnce the countess was jealous but intrigued, it would be time to\nbeguile her. On Ninon's instructions, the marquis would fail to show\nup at affairs where die countess expected to see him. Then, suddenly,\nhe would appear at salons he had never frequented before, but tiiat die\ncountess at-\n\ntended often. She would be unable to predict his moves. All of\nthis would push her into the state of emotional confusion that is a\nprerequisite for successful seduction.\n\nThese moves were executed, and took several weeks. Ninon\nmonitored the marquis's progress: Through her network of spies, she\nheard how the countess would laugh a little harder at his witticisms,\nlisten more closely to his stories. She heard that the countess was\nsuddenly asking questions about him. Her friends told her that at social\naffairs the countess would often look up at the marquis, following his\nsteps. Ninon felt certain that the young woman was falling under his\nspell. It was a matter of weeks now, maybe a month or two, but if all\nwent smoothly, the citadel would fall.\n\nA few days later the marquis was at the countess's home. They\nwere alone. Suddenly he was a different man: This time acting on his\n\nown impulse, rather than following Ninon's instructions, he took the\ncountess's hands and told her he was in love with her. The young\nwoman seemed confused, a reaction he did not expect. She became\npolite, then excused herself. For the rest of the evening she avoided his\neyes, was not there to say good-night to him. The next few times he\nvisited he was told she was not at home. When she finally admitted\nhim again, the two felt awkward and uncomfortable with each other.\nThe spell was broken.\n\nInterpretation\n\nNinon de Lenclos knew everything about the art of love. The\ngreatest writers, thinkers, and politicians of the time had been her\nloversmen like La Rochefoucauld, Moliere, and Richelieu. Seduction\nwas a game to her, to be practiced with skill. As she got older, and her\nreputation grew, the most important families in France would send\ntheir sons to her to be instructed in matters of love.\n\nNinon knew that men and women are very different, but when it\ncomes to seduction they feel the same: Deep down inside, they often\nsense when they are being seduced, but they give in because they\nenjoy the feeling of being led along. It is a pleasure to let go, and to\nallow the other person to detour you into a strange country. Everything\nin seduction, however, depends on suggestion. You cannot announce\nyour intentions or reveal them direcdy in words. Instead you must\nthrow your targets off the scent. To surrender to your guidance they\nmust be appropriately confused. You have to scramble your\nsignalsappear interested in another man or woman (the decoy), then\nhint at being interested in the target, then feign indifference, on and on.\nSuch patterns not only confuse, they excite.\n\nImagine this story from the countess's perspective: After a few of\nthe marquis's moves, she sensed the marquis was playing some sort of\ngame, but die game delighted her. She did not know where he was\nleading her, but so much the better. His moves intrigued her, each of\nthem keeping her waiting for the next oneshe even enjoyed her\njealousy and confusion, for sometimes any emotion is better than the\nboredom of security. Perhaps the marquis had ulterior motives; most\nmen do. But she was willing to wait and\n\nsee, and probably if she had been made to wait long enough, what\nhe was up to would not have mattered.\n\n\nThe moment the marquis uttered that fatal word \u201clove,\u201d however,\nall was changed. This was no longer a game widi moves, it was an\nartless show of passion. His intention was revealed: He was seducing\nher. This put everything he had done in a new light. All that before had\nbeen charming now seemed ugly and conniving; the countess felt\nembarrassed and used. A door closed that would never open again.\n\nDo not be held a cheat, even though it is impossible to live today\nwithout being one. Let your greatest cunning lie in covering up what\nlooks like cunning,\n\nBaltasar (Wacidn, 1601-1658\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nIn 1850 the young Otto von Bismarck, then a thirty-five-year-old\ndeputy in the Prussian parliament, was at a turning point in his career.\nThe issues of the day were the unification of the many states\n(including Prussia) into which Germany was then divided, and a war\nagainst Austria, the powerful neighbor to the south diat hoped to keep\ndie Germans weak and at odds, even threatening to intervene if tiiey\ntried to unite. Prince William, next in line to be Prussia's king, was in\nfavor of going to war, and die parliament rallied to the cause, prepared\nto back any mobilization of troops. The only ones to oppose war were\nthe present king, Frederick William IV, and his ministers, who\npreferred to appease the powerful Austrians.\n\nThroughout his career, Bismarck had been a loyal, even\npassionate supporter of Prussian might and power. He dreamed of\nGerman unification, of going to war against Austria and humiliating\nthe country that for so long had kept Germany divided. A former\nsoldier, he saw warfare as a glorious business.\n\nThis, after all, was the man who years later would say, \u201cThe great\nquestions of the time will be decided, not by speeches and resolutions,\nbut by iron and blood.\u201d\n\nPassionate patriot and lover of military glory, Bismarck\nnevertheless gave a speech in parliament at the height of the war fever\nmat astonished all who heard it. \u201cWoe unto the statesman,\u201d he said,\n\u201cwho makes war without a reason mat will still be valid when the war\nis over! After the war, you will all look differendy at these questions.\nWill you men have the courage to turn to the peasant contemplating\nthe ashes of his farm, to the man who has been crippled, to the father\n\nwho has lost his children\u201d Not only did Bismarck go on to talk of the\nmadness of this war, but, strangest of all, he praised Austria and\ndefended her actions. This went against everything he had stood for.\nThe consequences were immediate. Bismarck was against the warwhat\ncould diis possibly mean Otiier deputies were confused, and several of\nthem changed their votes. Eventually die king and his ministers won\nout, and war was averted.\n\nA few weeks after Bismarck's infamous speech, the king, grateful\nthat\n\nhe had spoken for peace, made him a cabinet minister. A few\nyears later he became the Prussian premier. In this role he eventually\nled his country and a peace-loving king into a war against Austria,\ncrushing the former empire and establishing a mighty German state,\nwith Prussia at its head.\n\nInterpretation\n\nAt me time of his speech in 1850, Bismarck made several\ncalculations. First, he sensed that the Prussian military, which had not\nkept pace with other European armies, was unready for warthat\nAustria, in fact, might very well win, a disastrous result for the future.\nSecond, if the war were lost and Bismarck had supported it, his career\nwould be gravely jeopardized. The king and his conservative ministers\nwanted peace; Bismarck wanted power. The answer was to throw\npeople off the scent by supporting a cause he detested, saying things he\nwould laugh at if said by anomer. A whole country was fooled. It was\nbecause of Bismarck's speech that the king made him a minister, a\nposition from which he quickly rose to be prime minister, attaining the\npower to strengthen die Prussian military and accomplish what he had\nwanted all along: the humiliation of Austria and the unification of\nGermany under Prussia's leadership.\n\nBismarck was certainly one of die cleverest statesman who ever\nlived, a master of strategy and deception. No one suspected what he\nwas up to in mis case. Had he announced his real intentions, arguing\nthat it was better to wait now and fight later, he would not have won\nthe argument, since most Prussians wanted war at that moment and\nmistakenly believed diat their army was superior to the Austrians. Had\nhe played up to die king, asking to be made a minister in exchange for\n\nsupporting peace, he would not have succeeded either: The king would\nhave distrusted his ambition and doubted his sincerity.\n\nBy being completely insincere and sending misleading signals,\nhowever, he deceived everyone, concealed his purpose, and attained\nevery-diing he wanted. Such is the power of hiding your intentions.\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nMost people are open books. They say what they feel, blurt out\ntheir opinions at every opportunity, and constandy reveal their plans\nand intentions. They do tiiis for several reasons. First, it is easy and\nnatural to always want to talk about one's feelings and plans for the\nfuture. It takes effort to control your tongue and monitor what you\nreveal. Second, many believe mat by being honest and open they are\nwinning people's hearts and showing their good nature.They are\ngreatly deluded. Honesty is actually a blunt instrument, which bloodies\nmore than it cuts. Your honesty is likely to offend people; it is much\nmore prudent to tailor your words, telling people what they want to\nhear rather than the coarse and ugly trum of what you feel or diink.\nMore important, by being unabashedly open you make yourself so\npredictable and familiar diat it is almost impossible to respect or fear\nyou, and power will not accrue to a person who cannot inspire such\nemotions.\n\nIf you yearn for power, quickly lay honesty aside, and train\nyourself in the art of concealing your intentions. Master the art and you\nwill always have the upper hand. Basic to an ability to conceal one's\nintentions is a simple truth about human nature: Our first instinct is to\nalways trust appearances. We cannot go around doubting the reality of\nwhat we see and hearconstantly imagining that appearances concealed\nsometiiing else would exhaust and terrify us. This fact makes it\nrelatively easy to conceal one's intentions. Simply dangle an object you\nseem to desire, a goal you seem to aim for, in front of people's eyes\nand they will take the appearance for reality. Once their eyes focus on\nthe decoy, they will fail to notice what you are really up to. In\nseduction, set up conflicting\u2019 signals, such as desire and indifference,\nand you not only throw them off the scent, you inflame meir desire to\npossess you.\n\nA tactic that is often effective in setting up a red herring is to\nappear to support an idea or cause that is actually contrary to your own\n\nsentiments. (Bismarck used this to great effect in his speech in 1850.)\nMost people will believe you have experienced a change of heart,\nsince it is so unusual to play so lightly with something as emotional as\none's opinions and values. The same applies for any decoyed object of\ndesire: Seem to want something in which you are actually not at all\ninterested and your enemies will be thrown off the scent, making all\nkinds of errors in their calculations.\n\nDuring the War of the Spanish Succession in 1711, the Duke of\nMarlborough, head of the English army, wanted to destroy a key\nFrench fort, because it protected a vital thoroughfare into France. Yet\nhe knew that if he destroyed it, the French would realize what he\nwantedto advance down that road. Instead, then, he merely captured\nthe fort, and garrisoned it with some of his troops, making it appear as\nif he wanted it for some purpose of his own. The French attacked the\nort and the duke let them recapture it. Once they had it back, though,\nthey destroyed it, figuring that the duke had wanted it for some\nimportant reason. Now that the fort was gone, the road was\nunprotected, and Marlborough could easily march into France.\n\nUse this tactic in the following manner: Hide your intentions not\nby closing up (with the risk of appearing secretive, and making people\nsuspicious) but by talking endlessly about your desires and goals!just\nnot your real ones. You will kill three birds with one stone: You appear\ntiendly, open, and trusting; you conceal your intentions; and you send\nyour rivals on time-consuming wild-goose chases.\n\nAnother powerful tool in throwing people off the scent is false\nsincerity. People easily mistake sincerity for honesty. Remembertheir\n\u2018irst instinct is to trust appearances, and since they value honesty and\nwant to believe in the honesty of those around tiiem, they will rarely\ndoubt you or see through your act. Seeming to believe what you say\ngives your words great weight. This is how Iago deceived and\ndestroyed Othello: Given the depth of his emotions, the apparent\nsincerity of his concerns about Desde-mona's supposed infidelity, how\ncould Othello distrust him This is also how the great con artist Yellow\nKid Weil pulled the wool over suckers' eyes: Seeming to believe so\ndeeply in the decoyed object he was dangling\n\nin front of them (a phony stock, a touted racehorse), he made its\nreality hard to doubt. It is important, of course, not to go too far in this\n\n\narea. Sincerity is a tricky tool: Appear overpassionate and you raise\nsuspicions. Be measured and believable or your ruse will seem the put-\non mat it is.\n\nTo make your false sincerity an effective weapon in concealing\nyour intentions, espouse a belief in honesty and forthrightness as\nimportant social values. Do tiiis as publicly as possible. Emphasize\nyour position on tiiis subject by occasionally divulging some heartfelt\nthoughtthough only one that is actually meaningless or irrelevant, of\ncourse. Napoleon's minister Talleyrand was a master at taking people\ninto his confidence by revealing some apparent secret. This feigned\nconfidencea decoywould then elicit a real confidence on die other\nperson's part.\n\nRemember: The best deceivers do everything they can to cloak\ntheir roguish qualities. They cultivate an air of honesty in one area to\ndisguise their dishonesty in omers. Honesty is merely another decoy in\ntheir arsenal of weapons.\n\nPART II: USE SMOKE SCREENS TO DISGUISE YOUR\nACTIONS\n\nDeception is always the best strategy, but the best deceptions\nrequire a screen\n\nof smoke to distract people's attention from your real purpose.\nThe bland\n\nexteriorlike the unreadable poker faceis often the perfect smoke\nscreen,\n\nhiding your intentions behind the comfortable and familiar. If you\nlead the\n\nsucker down a familiar path, he won't catch on when you lead him\nintoa\n\ntrap.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW I\n\nIn 1910, a Mr. Sam Geezil of Chicago sold his warehouse\nbusiness for close to $ 1 million. He settled down to semiretirement\nand the managing of his many properties, but deep inside he itched for\nthe old days of deal-making. One day a young man named Joseph Weil\nvisited his office, wanting to buy an apartment he had up for sale.\nGeezil explained the terms: The price was $8,000, but he only required\na down payment of $2,000. Weil said he would sleep on it, but he\n\ncame back the following day and offered to pay the full $8,000 in cash,\nif Geezil could wait a couple of days, until a deal Weil was working on\ncame through. Even in semiretirement, a clever businessman like\nGeezil was curious as to how Weil would be able to come up wim so\nmuch cash (roughly $150,000 today) so quickly. Weil seemed reluctant\nto say, and quickly changed the subject, but Geezil was persistent.\nFinally, after assurances of confidentiality, Weil told Geezil the\nollowing story.\n\nWeil's uncle was the secretary to a coterie of multimillionaire\n\u2018inanciers. These wealthy gentlemen had purchased a hunting lodge in\nMichigan ten years ago, at a cheap price. They had not used die lodge\n\u2018or a few years, so they had decided to sell it and had asked Weil's\nuncle to get whatever he could for it. For reasonsgood reasonsof his\nown, the uncle had been nursing a grudge against the millionaires for\nyears; this was his chance to get back at them. He would sell die\nproperty for $35,000 to a setup man (whom it was Weil's job to find).\nThe financiers were too wealdiy to worry about this low price. The set-\nup man would men turn around and sell the property again for its real\nprice, around $155,000. The uncle, Weil, and die tiiird man would split\nthe profits from this second sale. It was all legal and for a good\ncausethe uncle's just retribution.\n\nGeezil had heard enough: He wanted to be the set-up buyer. Weil\nwas reluctant to involve him, but Geezil would not back down: The\nidea of a large profit, plus a little adventure, had him champing at the\nbit. Weil explained mat Geezil would have to put up the $35,000 in\ncash to bring die deal off. Geezil, a millionaire, said he could get die\nmoney with a snap of his fingers. Weil finally relented and agreed to\narrange a meeting between the uncle, Geezil, and die financiers, in the\ntown of Galesburg, Illinois.\n\nOn die train ride to Galesburg, Geezil met the unclean impressive\n\nJKIII'. KINC OF ISUAFI.. I-\"KICNS WORSHIP Oh Till\u2019. 1DOI.\nBAAL\n\nThen Jehu assembled all the people, and said to them, \u201cAhab\nserved Ba \u2018al a little; but Jehu will serve him much more. Now\ntherefore call to me all the prophets of Ba\u2018al, all his worshippers and\nall his priests; let none be missing, for I have a great sacrifice to offer\nto Ba \u2018al; whoever is missing shall not live.\u201d But Jehu did it with\n\n\ncunning in order to destroy the worshippers of Ba \u2018al. And Jehu\nordered, \u201cSanctify a solemn assembly for Ba \u2018al. \u201d So they proclaimed\nit. And Jehu sent throughout all Israel; and all the worshippers of Ba'al\ncame, so that there was not a man left who did not come. And they\nentered the house of Ba'al, and the house of Ba'al was filled from one\nend to the other. . . . Then Jehu went into the house of Ba\u2019al... and he\nsaid to the worshippers of Ba'al, \"Search, and see that there is no\nservant of the LORD here\n\namong you, but only\n\nthe worshippers of\n\nBa'al.\" Then he went in\n\nto offer sacrifices and\n\nburnt offerings.\n\nNow Jehu had\n\nstationed eighty men\n\noutside, and said, \"The\n\nman who allows any of\n\nthose whom I give into\n\nyour hands to escape\n\nshall forfeit his life.\" So\n\nas soon as he had made\n\nan end of offering the\n\nburnt offering, Jehu\n\nsaid to the guard and to\n\nthe officers, \"Go in and\n\nslay them; let not a man\n\nescape.\"\n\nSo when they put them\n\nto the sword, the guard\n\nand the officers cast\n\nthem out and went into\n\nthe inner room of the\n\nhouse of Ba'al and they\n\nbrought out the pillar\n\nthat was in the house of\n\nBa'al and burned it.\n\nAnd they demolished\n\n\nthe pillar of Ba \u2018al and\n\ndemolished the house\n\nof Ba'al, and made it a\n\nlatrine to this day.\n\nThus Jehu wiped out\n\nBa'al from Israel.\n\nold testament, 2 kings 10:18-28\n\nman, with whom he avidly discussed business. Weil also brought\nalong a companion, a somewhat paunchy man named George Gross.\nWeil explained to Geezil that he himself was a boxing trainer, that\nGross was one of the promising prizefighters he trained, and that he\nhad asked Gross to come along to make sure the fighter stayed in\nshape. For a promising fighter, Gross was unimpressive lookinghe had\ngray hair and a beer bellybut Geezil was so excited about the deal that\nhe didn't really think about the man's flabby appearance.\n\nOnce in Galesburg, Weil and his uncle went to fetch the financiers\nwhile Geezil waited in a hotel room with Gross, who promptly put on\nhis boxing trunks. As Geezil half watched, Gross began to shadowbox.\nDistracted as he was, Geezil ignored how badly die boxer wheezed\nafter a few minutes of exercise, although his style seemed real enough.\nAn hour later, Weil and his uncle reappeared with the financiers, an\nimpressive, intimidating group of men, all wearing fancy suits. The\nmeeting went well and the financiers agreed to sell the lodge to Geezil,\nwho had already had the $35,000 wired to a local bank.\n\nThis minor business now setded, the financiers sat back in their\nchairs and began to banter about high finance, throwing out the name\n\u2018J. P. Morgan\" as if they knew the man. Finally one of them noticed die\nboxer in the corner of the room. Weil explained what he was doing\ndiere. The financier countered that he too had a boxer in his entourage,\nwhom he named. Weil laughed brazenly and exclaimed that his man\ncould easily knock out their man. Conversation escalated into\nargument. In the heat of passion, Weil challenged the men to a bet. The\nfinanciers eagerly agreed and left to get their man ready for a fight the\nnext day.\n\nAs soon as Uiey had left, the uncle yelled at Weil, right in front of\nGeezil: They did not have enough money to bet with, and once the\nfinanciers discovered this, the uncle would be fired. Weil apologized\n\nfor getting him in this mess, but he had a plan: He knew the odier\nboxer well, and with a littie bribe, they could fix the fight. But where\nwould the money come from for the bet the uncle replied. Without it\nthey were as good as dead. Finally Geezil had heard enough.\nUnwilling to jeopardize his deal with any ill will, he offered his own\n$35,000 cash for part of the bet. Even if he lost that, he would wire for\nmore money and still make a profit on the sale of the lodge. The uncle\nand nephew thanked him. With their own $15,000 and Geezil's\n$35,000 they would manage to have enough for the bet. That evening,\nas Geezil watched the two boxers rehearse die fix in the hotel room,\nhis mind reeled at the killing he was going to make from both the\nboxing match and the sale of the lodge.\n\nThe fight took place in a gym the next day. Weil handled the cash,\nwhich was placed for security in a locked box. Everything was\nproceeding as planned in the hotel room. The financiers were looking\nglum at how badly their fighter was doing, and Geezil was dreaming\nabout the easy money he was about to make. Then, suddenly, a wild\nswing by the financier's fighter hit Gross hard in the face, knocking\nhim down. When he hit the canvas, blood spurted from his mouth. He\ncoughed, then lay still.\n\nOne of die financiers, a former doctor, checked his pulse; he was\ndead. The millionaires panicked: Everyone had to get out before the\npolice arrived they could all be charged with murder.\n\nTerrified, Geezil hightailed it out of the gym and back to Chicago,\nleaving behind his $35,000 which he was only too glad to forget, for it\nseemed a small price to pay to avoid being implicated in a crime. He\nnever wanted to see Weil or any of the others again.\n\nAfter Geezil scurried out, Gross stood up, under his own steam.\nThe blood that had spurted from his mouth came from a ball filled with\nchicken blood and hot water diat he had hidden in his cheek. The\nwhole affair had been masterminded by Weil, better known as \u201cthe\nYellow Kid,\u201d one of die most creative con artists in history. Weil split\nthe $35,000 with the financiers and the boxers (all fellow con artists)a\nnice little profit for a few days' work.\n\nInterpretation\n\nThe Yellow Kid had staked out Geezil as the perfect sucker long\nbefore he set up the con. He knew the boxing-match scam would be\n\n\nthe perfect ruse to separate Geezil from his money quickly and\ndefinitively. But he also knew diat if he had begun by trying to interest\nGeezil in the boxing match, he would have failed miserably. He had to\nconceal his intentions and switch attention, create a smoke screenin\nthis case die sale of the lodge.\n\nOn die train ride and in the hotel room Geezil's mind had been\ncompletely occupied with the pending deal, the easy money, the\nchance to hobnob with wealthy men. He had failed to notice that Gross\nwas out of shape and middle-aged at best. Such is die distracting\npower of a smoke screen. Engrossed in the business deal, Geezil's\nattention was easily diverted to the boxing match, but only at a point\nwhen it was already too late for him to notice the details that would\nhave given Gross away. The match, after all, now depended on a bribe\nradier than on die boxer's physical condition. And Geezil was so\ndistracted at die end by die illusion of me boxer's death mat he\ncompletely forgot about his money.\n\nLearn from the Yellow Kid: The familiar, inconspicuous front is\nthe perfect smoke screen. Approach your mark with an idea diat seems\nordinary enougha business deal, financial intrigue. The sucker's mind\nis distracted, his suspicions allayed. That is when you gentiy guide him\nonto the second path, die slippery slope down which he slides\nhelplessly into your trap.\n\nSNEAK ACROSS THE OCEAN IN HROAD DAYEICHT\n\nThis means to create a front that eventually becomes imbued with\nan atmosphere or impression of familiarity, within which the strategist\nmay maneuver unseen while all eyes are trained to see obvious\nfamiliarities.\n\n\u201cTHE THIRTY-SIX STRATEGIES,\u201d QUOTED IN THE\nIAPANESE ART OF WAR,\n\nThomas Cleary, 1991\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II\n\nIn the mid- 1920s, the powerful warlords of Etiiiopia were\ncoming to the realization diat a young man of die nobility named Haile\nSelassie, also known as Ras Tafari, was outcompeting them all and\nnearing the point where he could proclaim himself their leader,\nunifying the country for the first time in decades. Most of his rivals\n\ncould not understand how tiiis wispy, quiet, mild-mannered man had\nbeen able to take control. Yet in\n\n1927, Selassie was able to summon the warlords, one at a time, to\ncome to Addis Ababa to declare their loyalty and recognize him as\nleader.\n\nSome hurried, some hesitated, but only one, Dejazmach Balcha of\nSidamo, dared defy Selassie totally. A blustery man, Balcha was a\ngreat warrior, and he considered the new leader weak and unworthy.\nHe pointedly stayed away from die capital. Finally Selassie, in his\ngende but stern way, commanded Balcha to come. The warlord\ndecided to obey, but in doing so he would turn the tables on diis\npretender to die Ediiopian dirone: He would come to Addis Ababa at\nhis own speed, and widi an army of 10,000 men, a force large enough\nto defend himself, perhaps even start a civil war. Stationing tiiis\nformidable force in a valley three miles from the capital, he waited, as\na king would. Selassie would have to come to him.\n\nSelassie did indeed send emissaries, asking Balcha to attend an\nafternoon banquet in his honor. But Balcha, no fool, knew historyhe\nknew that previous kings and lords of Ethiopia had used banquets as a\ntrap. Once he was there and full of drink, Selassie would have him\narrested or murdered. To signal his understanding of die situation, he\nagreed to come to the banquet, but only if he could bring his personal\nbodyguard600 of his best soldiers, all armed and ready to defend him\nand diemselves. To Balcha's surprise, Selassie answered with the\nutmost politeness diat he would be honored to play host to such\nwarriors.\n\nOn the way to the banquet, Balcha warned his soldiers not to get\ndrunk and to be on their guard. When they arrived at the palace,\nSelassie was his charming best. He deferred to Balcha, treated him as\nif he desperately needed his approval and cooperation. But Balcha\nrefused to be charmed, and he warned Selassie that if he did not return\nto his camp by nightfall, his army had orders to attack die capital.\nSelassie reacted as if hurt by his mistrust. Over the meal, when it came\ntime for the traditional singing of songs in honor of Ethiopia's leaders,\nhe made a point of allowing only songs honoring the warlord of\nSidamo. It seemed to Balcha that Selassie was scared, intimidated by\nthis great warrior who could not be outwitted. Sensing the change,\n\nBalcha believed that he would be the one to call die shots in the days\nto come.\n\nAt the end of the afternoon, Balcha and his soldiers began their\nmarch back to camp amidst cheers and gun salutes. Looking back to\nthe capital over his shoulder, he planned his strategyhow his own\nsoldiers would march through the capital in triumph widiin weeks, and\nSelassie would be put in his place, his place being either prison or\ndeath. When Balcha came in sight of his camp, however, he saw that\nsomething was terribly wrong. Where before there had been colorful\ntents stretching as far as die eye could see, now there was nodiing,\nonly smoke from doused fires. What devil's magic was this\n\nA witness told Balcha what had happened. During the banquet, a\nlarge army, commanded by an ally of Selassie's, had stolen up on\nBalcha's encampment by a side route he had not seen. This army had\nnot come to fight, however: Knowing that Balcha would have heard a\nnoisy batde and\n\nhurried back with his 600-man bodyguard, Selassie had,armed his\nown troops with baskets of gold and cash. They had surrounded\nBalcha's army and proceeded to purchase every last one of their\nweapons. Those who refused were easily intimidated. Within a few\nhours, Balcha's entire force had been disarmed and scattered in all\ndirections.\n\nRealizing his danger, Balcha decided to march south with his 600\nsoldiers to regroup, but the same army that had disarmed his soldiers\nblocked his way. The other way out was to march on the capital, but\nSelassie had set a large army to defend it. Like a chess player, he had\npredicted Balcha's moves, and had checkmated him. For the first time\nin his life, Balcha surrendered. To repent his sins of pride and\nambition, he agreed to enter a monastery.\n\nInterpretation\n\nThroughout Selassie's long reign, no one could quite figure him\nout. Ethiopians like their leaders fierce, but Selassie, who wore the\nfront of a gende, peace-loving man, lasted longer than any of them.\nNever angry or impatient, he lured his victims with sweet smiles,\nlulling them with charm and obsequiousness before he attacked. In the\ncase of Balcha, Selassie played on the man's wariness, his suspicion\nthat the banquet was a trap which in fact it was, but not the one he\n\nexpected. Selassie's way of allaying Balcha's fearsletting him bring his\nbodyguard to the banquet, giving him top billing there, making him\nfeel in controlcreated a thick smoke screen, concealing the real action\nthree miles away.\n\nRemember: The paranoid and wary are often the easiest to\ndeceive. Win their trust in one area and you have a smoke screen that\nblinds their view in anodier, letting you creep up and level them with a\ndevastating blow. A helpful or apparently honest gesture, or one that\nimplies the other person's superioritythese are perfect diversionary\ndevices.\n\nProperly set up, the smoke screen is a weapon of great power. It\nenabled the gentle Selassie to totally destroy his enemy, without firing\na single bullet.\n\nDo not underestimate the power of Tafari. He creeps like a mouse\nbut he has jaws like a lion.\n\nBalclia of Sidamo's last words before entering the monastery\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nIf you believe that deceivers are colorful folk who mislead with\nelaborate lies and tall tales, you are greatly mistaken. The best\ndeceivers utilize a bland and inconspicuous front that calls no attention\nto themselves. They know that extravagant words and gestures\nimmediately raise suspicion. Instead, they envelop their mark in the\nfamiliar, the banal, the harmless. In Yellow Kid Weil's dealings with\nSam Geezil, the familiar was a business deal. In the Ethiopian case, it\nwas Selassie's misleading obsequiousness exacdy what Balcha would\nhave expected from a weaker warlord.\n\nOnce you have lulled your suckers' attention with the familiar,\nthey will not notice the deception being perpetrated behind their backs.\nThis derives from a simple truth: people can only focus on one thing at\na time. It is really too difficult for them to imagine that the bland and\nharmless person they are dealing with is simultaneously setting up\nsomething else. The grayer and more uniform the smoke in your\nsmoke screen, the better it conceals your intentions. In the decoy and\nred herring devices discussed in Part I, you actively distract people; in\nthe smoke screen, you lull your victims, drawing them into your web.\nBecause it is so hypnotic, this is often the best way of concealing your\nintentions.\n\nThe simplest form of smoke screen is facial expression. Behind a\nbland, unreadable exterior, all sorts of mayhem can be planned,\nwithout detection. This is a weapon that the most powerful men in\nhistory have learned to perfect. It was said that no one could read\nFranklin D. Roosevelt's face. Baron James Rothschild made a lifelong\npractice of disguising his real thoughts behind bland smiles and\nnondescript looks. Stendhal wrote of Talleyrand, \u201cNever was a face\nless of a barometer.\u201d Henry Kissinger would bore his opponents\naround the negotiating table to tears with his monotonous voice, his\nblank look, his endless recitations of details; then, as their eyes glazed\nover, he would suddenly hit them with a list of bold terms. Caught off-\nguard, they would be easily intimidated. As one poker manual explains\nit, \u201cWhile playing his hand, the good player is seldom an actor. Instead\nhe practices a bland behavior that minimizes readable patterns,\nTustrates and confuses opponents, permits greater concentration.\u201d\n\nAn adaptable concept, the smoke screen can be practiced on a\nnumber of levels, all playing on the psychological principles of\ndistraction and misdirection. One of the most effective smoke screens\nis the noble gesture. People want to believe apparently noble gestures\nare genuine, for the belief is pleasant. They rarely notice how\ndeceptive these gestures can be.\n\nThe art dealer Joseph Duveen was once confronted with a terrible\nproblem. The millionaires who had paid so dearly for Duveen's\npaintings were running out of wall space, and with inheritance taxes\ngetting ever higher, it seemed unlikely that they would keep buying.\nThe solution was the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.,\nwhich Duveen helped create in 1937 by getting Andrew Mellon to\ndonate his collection to it. The National Gallery was the perfect front\nfor Duveen. In one gesture, his clients avoided taxes, cleared wall\nspace for new purchases, and reduced the number of paintings on the\nmarket, maintaining the upward pressure on their prices. All this while\nthe donors created the appearance of being public benefactors.\n\nAnother effective smoke screen is the pattern, the establishment\nof a series of actions that seduce die victim into believing you will\ncontinue in die same way. The pattern plays on the psychology of\nanticipation: Our behavior conforms to patterns, or so we like to think.\n\n\nIn 1878 the American robber baron Jay Gould created a company\ndiat began to threaten die monopoly of die telegraph company Western\nUnion. The directors of Western Union decided to buy Gould's\ncompany up\n\nthey had to spend a hefty sum, but they figured they had managed\nto rid themselves of an irritating competitor. A few months later,\nthough, Gould was it at again, complaining he had been treated\nunfairly. He started up a second company to compete with Western\nUnion and its new acquisition. The same thing happened again:\nWestern Union bought him out to shut him up. Soon the pattern began\nfor the third time, but now Gould went for uie jugular: He suddenly\nstaged a bloody takeover struggle and managed to gain complete\ncontrol of Western Union. He had established a pattern that had tricked\nthe company's directors into thinking his goal was to be bought out at a\nhandsome rate. Once they paid him off, they relaxed and failed to\nnotice that he was actually playing for higher stakes. The pattern is\npowerful in that it deceives the other person into expecting the\nopposite of what you are really doing.\n\nAnother psychological weakness on which to construct a smoke\nscreen is the tendency to mistake appearances for realitythe feeling\nthat if someone seems to belong to your group, their belonging must be\nreal. This habit makes the seamless blend a very effective front. The\ntrick is simple: You simply blend in with those around you. The better\nyou blend, the less suspicious you become. During the Cold War of the\n1950s and '60s, as is now notorious, a slew of British civil servants\npassed secrets to the Soviets. They went undetected for years because\nthey were apparently decent chaps, had gone to all the right schools,\nand fit the old-boy network perfectly. Blending in is the perfect smoke\nscreen for spying. The better you do it, the better you can conceal your\nintentions.\n\nRemember: It takes patience and humility to dull your brilliant\ncolors, to put on the mask of the inconspicuous. Do not despair at\nhaving to wear such a bland maskit is often your unreadability that\ndraws people to you and makes you appear a person of power.\n\nImage: A Sheep's Skin. A sheep never marauds, a sheep never\ndeceives, a sheep is magnificently dumb and docile. With a sheepskin\non his back, a fox can pass right into the chicken coop.\n\nAuthority: Have you ever heard of a skillful general, who intends\nto surprise a citadel, announcing his plan to his enemy Conceal your\npurpose and hide your progress; do not disclose the extent of your\ndesigns until they cannot be opposed, until the combat is over. Win the\nvictory before you declare the war. In a word, imitate those warlike\npeople whose designs are not known except by the ravaged country\nthrough which they have passed. (Ninon de Lenclos, 1623-1706)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nNo smoke screen, red herring, false sincerity, or any other\ndiversionary device will succeed in concealing your intentions if you\nalready have an established reputation for deception. And as you get\nolder and achieve success, it often becomes increasingly difficult to\ndisguise your cunning. Everyone knows you practice deception; persist\nin playing naive and you run the risk of seeming die rankest hypocrite,\nwhich will severely limit your room to maneuver. In such cases it is\nbetter to own up, to appear the honest rogue, or, better, the repentant\nrogue. Not only will you be admired for your frankness, but, most\nwonderful and strange of all, you will be able to continue your\nstratagems.\n\nAs P. T. Bamum, the nineteentii-century king of humbuggery,\ngrew older, he learned to embrace his reputation as a grand deceiver.\nAt one point he organized a buffalo hunt in New Jersey, complete witii\nIndians and a few imported buffalo. He publicized die hunt as genuine,\nbut it came off as so completely fake that die crowd, instead of getting\nangry and asking for their money back, was gready amused. They\nknew Barnum pulled tricks all the time; diat was the secret of his\nsuccess, and they loved him for it. Learning a lesson from this affair,\nBarnum stopped concealing all of his devices, even revealing his\ndeceptions in a tell-all autobiography. As Kierkegaard wrote, \u201cThe\nworld wants to be deceived.\u201d\n\nFinally, although it is wiser to divert attention from your purposes\nby presenting a bland, familiar exterior, diere are times when die\ncolorful, conspicuous gesture is die right diversionary tactic. The great\ncharlatan mountebanks of seventeendi- and eighteenth-century Europe\nused humor and entertainment to deceive their audiences. Dazzled by a\ngreat show, the public would not notice the charlatans' real intentions.\nThus the star charlatan himself would appear in town in a night-black\n\n\ncoach drawn by black horses. Clowns, tightrope walkers, and star\nentertainers would accompany him, pulling people in to his\ndemonstrations of elixirs and quack potions. The charlatan made\nentertainment seem like die business of die day; the business of die\nday was actually die sale of the elixirs and quack potions.\n\nSpectacle and entertainment, clearly, are excellent devices to\nconceal your intentions, but diey cannot be used indefinitely. The\npublic grows tired and suspicious, and eventually catches on to die\ntrick. And indeed die charlatans had to move quickly from town to\ntown, before word spread tiiat die potions were useless and die\nentertainment a trick. Powerful people with bland exteriors, on the\nodier handdie Talleyrands, die Rotii-schilds, die Selassiescan practice\ntiieir deceptions in die same place tiiroughout their lifetimes. Their act\nnever wears thin, and rarely causes suspicion. The colorful smoke\nscreen should be used cautiously, then, and only when die occasion is\nright.\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

In die first half of the fifth century B.C. he won\nmany important battles, saving the city from calamity time and time\nagain. Because he spent most of his time on the batdefield, few\nRomans knew him personally, making him something of a legendary\n\u2018igure.\n\nIn 454 B.C., Coriolanus decided it was time to exploit his\nreputation and enter politics. He stood for election to the high rank of\nconsul. Candidates for this position traditionally made a public address\nearly in the race, and when Coriolanus came before the people, he\nbegan by displaying the dozens of scars he had accumulated over\nseventeen years of fighting for Rome. Few in the crowd really heard\nthe lengthy speech diat followed; those scars, proof of his valor and\npatriotism, moved the people to tears. Coriolanus's election seemed\ncertain.\n\nWhen die polling day arrived, however, Coriolanus made an entry\ninto the forum escorted by the entire senate and by the city's patricians,\nthe aristocracy. The common people who saw this were disturbed by\nsuch a blustering show of confidence on election day.\n\nAnd then Coriolanus spoke again, mostly addressing the wealthy\ncitizens who had accompanied him. His words were arrogant and\ninsolent. Claiming certain victory in die vote, he boasted of his\nbattlefield exploits, made sour jokes that appealed only to die\npatricians, voiced angry accusations against his opponents, and\nspeculated on the riches he would bring to Rome. This time the people\nlistened: They had not realized diat tins legendary soldier was also a\ncommon braggart.\n\n\nNews of Coriolanus's second speech spread quickly dirough\nRome, and the people turned out in great numbers to make sure he was\nnot elected. Defeated, Coriolanus returned to the battlefield, bitter and\nvowing revenge on the common folk who had voted against him.\nSome weeks later a large shipment of grain arrived in Rome. The\nsenate was ready to distribute this food to die people, for free, but just\nas they were preparing to vote on die question Coriolanus appeared on\nthe scene and took the senate floor. The distribution, he argued, would\nhave a harmful effect on the city as a whole. Several senators appeared\nwon over, and the vote on the distribution fell into doubt. Coriolanus\ndid not stop diere: He went on to condemn die concept of democracy\nitself. He advocated getting rid of the people's representativesdie\ntribunesand turning over the governing of the city to the patricians.\n\nWhen word of Coriolanus's latest speech reached the people, their\nanger knew no bounds. The tribunes were sent to the senate to demand\ndiat Coriolanus appear before them. He refused. Riots broke out all\nover the city. The senate, fearing die people's wrath, finally voted in\nfavor of the grain distribution. The tribunes were appeased, but the\npeople still demanded that Coriolanus speak to them and apologize. If\nhe repented, and agreed to keep his opinions to himself, he would be\nallowed to return to the batdefield.\n\nCoriolanus did appear one last time before the people, who\nlistened to\n\nhim in rapt silence. He started slowly and softly, but as the speech\nwent on, he became more and more blunt. Yet again he hurled insults!\nHis tone was arrogant, his expression disdainful. The more he spoke,\nthe angrier the people became. Finally they shouted him down and\nsilenced him.\n\nThe tribunes conferred, condemned Coriolanus to death, and\nordered the magistrates to take him at once to the top of the Tarpeian\nrock and throw him over. The delighted crowd seconded the decision.\nThe patricians, however, managed to intervene, and the sentence was\ncommuted to a lifelong banishment. When the people found out that\nRome's great military hero would never return to the city, they\ncelebrated in the streets. In fact no one had ever seen such a\ncelebration, not even after the defeat of a foreign enemy.\n\n\nquestion from KissingerLord snapped, \u201cDamn it, yes, it's the best\nI can do.\u201d To which Kissinger replied: \u201cFine, then I guess I'll read it\nthis time.\u201d\n\nkissinger, Walter Isaacson, 1992\n\nInterpretation\n\nBefore his entrance into politics, the name of Coriolanus evoked\nawe.\n\nHis battlefield accomplishments showed him as a man of great\nbravery. Since the citizens knew little about him, all kinds of legends\nbecame attached to his name. The moment he appeared before the\nRoman citizens, however, and spoke his mind, all that grandeur and\nmystery vanished. He bragged and blustered like a common soldier.\nHe insulted and slandered people, as if he felt threatened and insecure.\nSuddenly he was not at all what the people had imagined. The\ndiscrepancy between the legend and the reality proved immensely\ndisappointing to those who wanted to believe in their hero. The more\nCoriolanus said, the less powerful he appeareda person who cannot\ncontrol his words shows that he cannot control himself, and is\nunworthy of respect.\n\nHad Coriolanus said less, the people would never have had cause\nto be offended by him, would never have known his true feelings. He\nwould have maintained his powerful aura, would certainly have been\nelected consul, and would have been able to accomplish his\nantidemocratic goals. But the human tongue is a beast that few can\nmaster. It strains constantly to break out of its cage, and if it is not\ntamed, it will run wild and cause you grief. Power cannot accrue to\nthose who squander their treasure of words.\n\nOysters open completely when the moon is full; and when the\ncrab sees one\n\nit throws a piece of stone or seaweed into it and the oyster cannot\nclose\n\nagain so that it serves the crab for meat. Such is the fate of him\nwho opens\n\nhis mouth too much and thereby puts himself at the mercy of the\nlistener.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci, 1452-1519\n\nThe King [Louis XIV] maintains the most impenetrable secrecy\nabout affairs of Slate. The ministers attend council meetings, but he\nconfides his plans to them only when he has reflected at length upon\nthem and has come to a definite decision. 1 wish you might see the\nKing. His expression is inscrutable; his eyes like those of a fox. He\nnever discusses State affairs except with his ministers in Council.\nWhen he speaks to courtiers he refers only to their respective\nprerogatives or duties. Even the most frivolous of his utterances has\nthe air of being the pronouncement of an oracle.\n\nPrimi Visconti, quoted in louis xiv, Louis Bertrand, 1928\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nIn the court of Louis XIV, nobles and ministers would spend days\nand nights debating issues of state. They would confer, argue, make\nand break alliances, and argue again, until finally the critical moment\narrived: Two of them would be chosen to represent the different sides\nto Louis himself, who would decide what should be done. After these\npersons were chosen,\n\nUndutiful words of a\n\nsubject do often take\n\ndeeper root than the\n\nmemory of ill deeds....\n\nThe late Earl of Essex\n\ntold Queen Elizabeth\n\nthat her conditions\n\nwere as crooked as her\n\ncarcass; but it cost him\n\nhis head, which his\n\ninsurrection had not\n\ncost him but for that\n\nspeech.\n\nSir Walter Ralhioh,\n\n1554-1618\n\neveryone would argue some more: How should the issues be\nphrased What would appeal to Louis, what would annoy him At what\ntime of day should the representatives approach him, and in what part\nof the Versailles palace What expression should they have on their\nfaces\n\nFinally, after all this was settled, the fateful moment would finally\narrive. The two men would approach Louisalways a delicate matterand\nwhen they finally had his ear, they would talk about the issue at hand,\nspelling out the options in detail.\n\nLouis would listen in silence, a most enigmatic look on his face.\nFinally, when each had finished his presentation and had asked for the\nking's opinion, he would look at them botii and say, \u201cI shall see.\u201d Then\nhe would walk away.\n\nThe ministers and courtiers would never hear another word on\nthis subject from the kingthey would simply see the result, weeks later,\nwhen he would come to a decision and act. He would never bother to\nconsult them on the matter again.\n\nInterpretation\n\nLouis XIV was a man of very few words. His most famous\nremark is \u201cL\u2019etat, c'est moi\u201d ll am the state\u201c); nothing could be more\npithy yet more eloquent. His infamous \u201dI shall see\" was one of several\nextremely short phrases that he would apply to all manner of requests.\n\nLouis was not always this way; as a young man he was known for\ntalking at length, delighting in his own eloquence. His later taciturnity\nwas self-imposed, an act, a mask he used to keep everybody below\nhim off-balance. No one knew exactly where he stood, or could predict\nhis reactions. No one could try to deceive him by saying what they\nthought he wanted to hear, because no one knew what he wanted to\nhear. As they talked on and on to the silent Louis, they revealed more\nand more about themselves, information he would later use against\nthem to great effect.\n\nIn the end, Louis's silence kept those around him terrified and\nunder his thumb. It was one of the foundations of his power. As Saint-\nSimon wrote, \u201cNo one knew as well as he how to sell his words, his\nsmile, even his glances. Everything in him was valuable because he\ncreated differences, and his majesty was enhanced by the sparseness of\nhis words.\u201d\n\nIt is even more damaging for a minister to say foolish things than\nto do them.\n\nCardinal de Retz, 1613-1679\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nPower is in many ways a game of appearances, and when you say\nless than necessary, you inevitably appear greater and more powerful\nthan you are. Your silence will make other people uncomfortable.\nHumans are machines of interpretation and explanation; they have to\nknow what you are thinking. When you carefully control what you\nreveal, they cannot pierce your intentions or your meaning.\n\nYour short answers and silences will put them on the defensive,\nand they will jump in, nervously filling the silence with all kinds of\ncomments that will reveal valuable information about them and their\nweaknesses. They will leave a meeting with you feeling as if they had\nbeen robbed, and they will go home and ponder your every word. This\nextra attention to your brief comments will only add to your power.\n\nSaying less than necessary is not for kings and statesmen only. In\nmost areas of life, the less you say, the more profound and mysterious\nyou appear. As a young man, the artist Andy Warhol had the revelation\nthat it was generally impossible to get people to do what you wanted\nthem to do by talking to them. They would turn against you, subvert\nyour wishes, disobey you out of sheer perversity. He once told a friend,\n\u201cT learned that you actually have more power when you shut up.\u201d\n\nIn his later life Warhol employed this strategy with great success.\nHis interviews were exercises in oracular speech: He would say\nsomething vague and ambiguous, and the interviewer would twist in\ncircles trying to figure it out, imagining there was something profound\nbehind his often meaningless phrases. Warhol rarely talked about his\nwork; he let others do the interpreting. He claimed to have learned this\ntechnique from that master of enigma Marcel Duchamp, anotiier\ntwentieth-century artist who realized early on that the less he said\nabout his work, the more people talked about it. And the more they\ntalked, the more valuable his work became.\n\nBy saying less than necessary you create the appearance of\nmeaning and power. Also, the less you say, the less risk you run of\nsaying something foolish, even dangerous. In 1825 a new czar,\nNicholas I, ascended the throne of Russia. A rebellion immediately\nbroke out, led by liberals demanding that the country modernizethat its\nindustries and civil structures catch up with the rest of Europe.\nBrutally crushing this rebellion (the Decembrist Uprising), Nicholas I\nsentenced one of its leaders, Kondraty Ryleyev, to death. On the day of\n\n\nthe execution Ryleyev stood on the gallows, the noose around his\nneck. The trapdoor openedbut as Ryleyev dangled, the rope broke,\ndashing him to the ground. At the time, events like this were\nconsidered signs of providence or heavenly will, and a man saved from\nexecution this way was usually pardoned. As Ryleyev got to his feet,\nbruised and dirtied but believing his neck had been saved, he called out\nto the crowd, \u201cYou see, in Russia they don't know how to do anything\nproperly, not even how to make rope!\u201d\n\nA messenger immediately went to the Winter Palace with news of\nthe failed hanging. Vexed by this disappointing turnabout, Nicholas I\nnevertheless began to sign the pardon. But then: \u201cDid Ryleyev say\nanything after this miracle\u201d the czar asked the messenger. \u201cSire,\u201d the\nmessenger replied, \u201che said that in Russia they don't even know how to\nmake rope.\u201d\n\n\u201cTn that case,\u201d said the Czar, \u201clet us prove the contrary,\u201d and he\ntore up the pardon. The next day Ryleyev was hanged again. This time\nthe rope did not break.\n\nLearn the lesson: Once the words are out, you cannot take them\nback. Keep them under control. Be particularly careful with sarcasm:\nThe mo-\n\nmentary satisfaction you gain with your biting words will be\noutweighed by the price you pay.\n\nImage :\n\nThe Oracle at Delphi.\n\nWhen visitors consulted the\n\nOracle, the priestess would utter\n\na few enigmatic words that seemed\n\nfull of meaning and import. No one\n\ndisobeyed the words of the Oracle\n\nthey held power over life and death.\n\nAuthority: Never start moving your own lips and teeth before the\nsubordinates do. The longer I keep quiet, the sooner others move their\nlips and teeth. As they move their lips and teeth, I can thereby\nunderstand tiieir real intentions.... If the sovereign is not mysterious,\nthe ministers will find opportunity to take and take. (Han-fei-tzu,\nChinese philosopher, third century B.C.)\n\nREVERSAL\n\n\nThere are times when it is unwise to be silent. Silence can arouse\nsuspicion and even insecurity, especially in your superiors; a vague or\nambiguous comment can open you up to interpretations you had not\nbargained for. Silence and saying less than necessary must be practiced\nwith caution, then, and in the right situations. It is occasionally wiser\nto imitate the court jester, who plays the fool but knows he is smarter\nthan the king. He talks and talks and entertains, and no one suspects\nthat he is more than just a fool.\n\nAlso, words can sometimes act as a kind of smoke screen for any\ndeception you might practice. By bending your listener's ear with talk,\nyou can distract and mesmerize them; the more you talk, in fact, the\nless suspicious of you they become. The verbose are not perceived as\nsly and manipulative but as helpless and unsophisticated. This is the\nreverse of the silent policy employed by the powerful: By talking\nmore, and making yourself appear weaker and less intelligent than\nyour mark, you can practice deception with greater ease.\n\n'.

A rebellion immediately\nbroke out, led by liberals demanding that the country modernizethat its\nindustries and civil structures catch up with the rest of Europe.\nBrutally crushing this rebellion (the Decembrist Uprising), Nicholas I\nsentenced one of its leaders, Kondraty Ryleyev, to death. On the day of\n\n\nthe execution Ryleyev stood on the gallows, the noose around his\nneck. The trapdoor openedbut as Ryleyev dangled, the rope broke,\ndashing him to the ground. At the time, events like this were\nconsidered signs of providence or heavenly will, and a man saved from\nexecution this way was usually pardoned. As Ryleyev got to his feet,\nbruised and dirtied but believing his neck had been saved, he called out\nto the crowd, \u201cYou see, in Russia they don't know how to do anything\nproperly, not even how to make rope!\u201d\n\nA messenger immediately went to the Winter Palace with news of\nthe failed hanging. Vexed by this disappointing turnabout, Nicholas I\nnevertheless began to sign the pardon. But then: \u201cDid Ryleyev say\nanything after this miracle\u201d the czar asked the messenger. \u201cSire,\u201d the\nmessenger replied, \u201che said that in Russia they don't even know how to\nmake rope.\u201d\n\n\u201cTn that case,\u201d said the Czar, \u201clet us prove the contrary,\u201d and he\ntore up the pardon. The next day Ryleyev was hanged again. This time\nthe rope did not break.\n\nLearn the lesson: Once the words are out, you cannot take them\nback. Keep them under control. Be particularly careful with sarcasm:\nThe mo-\n\nmentary satisfaction you gain with your biting words will be\noutweighed by the price you pay.\n\nImage :\n\nThe Oracle at Delphi.\n\nWhen visitors consulted the\n\nOracle, the priestess would utter\n\na few enigmatic words that seemed\n\nfull of meaning and import. No one\n\ndisobeyed the words of the Oracle\n\nthey held power over life and death.\n\nAuthority: Never start moving your own lips and teeth before the\nsubordinates do. The longer I keep quiet, the sooner others move their\nlips and teeth. As they move their lips and teeth, I can thereby\nunderstand tiieir real intentions.... If the sovereign is not mysterious,\nthe ministers will find opportunity to take and take. (Han-fei-tzu,\nChinese philosopher, third century B.C.)\n\nREVERSAL\n\n\nThere are times when it is unwise to be silent. Silence can arouse\nsuspicion and even insecurity, especially in your superiors; a vague or\nambiguous comment can open you up to interpretations you had not\nbargained for. Silence and saying less than necessary must be practiced\nwith caution, then, and in the right situations. It is occasionally wiser\nto imitate the court jester, who plays the fool but knows he is smarter\nthan the king. He talks and talks and entertains, and no one suspects\nthat he is more than just a fool.\n\nAlso, words can sometimes act as a kind of smoke screen for any\ndeception you might practice. By bending your listener's ear with talk,\nyou can distract and mesmerize them; the more you talk, in fact, the\nless suspicious of you they become. The verbose are not perceived as\nsly and manipulative but as helpless and unsophisticated. This is the\nreverse of the silent policy employed by the powerful: By talking\nmore, and making yourself appear weaker and less intelligent than\nyour mark, you can practice deception with greater ease.\n\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Suddenly sentinels hurried in with the\nalarming news that an enemy force of over 150,000 troops under Sima\n\n\nYi was approaching. With only a hundred men to defend him, Chuko\nLiang's situation was hopeless. The enemy would finally capture this\nrenowned leader.\n\nWithout lamenting his fate, or wasting time trying to figure out\nhow he had been caught, Liang ordered his troops to take down their\nflags, throw open the city gates, and hide. He himself men took a seat\non the most visible part of the city's wall, wearing a Taoist robe. He lit\nsome incense, strummed his lute, and began to chant.

At its head was Sima Yi,\nwho instantly recognized the man on the wall.\n\nEven so, as his soldiers itched to enter the unguarded town\nthrough its open gates, Sima Yi hesitated, held them back, and studied\nLiang on the wall. Then, he ordered an immediate and speedy retreat.\n\nInterpretation\n\nChuko Liang was commonly known as the \u201cSleeping Dragon.\u201d\nHis exploits in the War of the Three Kingdoms were legendary. Once a\nman claiming to be a disaffected enemy lieutenant came to his camp,\noffering help and information. Liang instantly recognized the situation\nas a setup; this man was a false deserter, and should be beheaded. At\nthe last minute, though, as the ax was about to fall, Liang stopped the\nexecution and offered to spare the man's life if he agreed to become a\ndouble agent.

Everything else is subject to barter: we will let our\nriends have\n\nour goods and our lives if need be; but a case of sharing our fame\nand\n\nmaking someone else the gift of our reputation is hardly to be\nound.\n\nMontaigne, 1533-1592\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II\n\nIn 1841 the young P. T. Barnum, trying to establish his reputation\nas America's premier showman, decided to purchase the American\nMuseum in Manhattan and turn it into a collection of curiosities that\nwould secure his fame. The problem was that he had no money. The\nmuseum's asking price was $15,000, but Barnum was able to put\ntogether a proposal that appealed to the institution's owners even\nthough it replaced cash up front with dozens of guarantees and\nreferences. The owners came to a verbal agreement with Barnum, but\nat the last minute, the principal partner changed his mind, and the\nmuseum and its collection were sold to the directors of Peale's\nMuseum. Barnum was infuriated, but the partner explained that\nbusiness was businessthe museum had been sold to Peale's because\nPeale's had a reputation and Barnum had none.\n\nBarnum immediately decided that if he had no reputation to bank\non, his only recourse was to ruin die reputation of Peale's. Accordingly\nhe launched a letter-writing campaign in the newspapers, calling the\nowners a bunch of \u201cbroken-down bank directors\u201d who had no idea\n\n\nhow to run a museum or entertain people. He warmed the public\nagainst buying Peale's stock, since the business's purchase of another\nmuseum would invariably spread its resources thin. The campaign was\neffective, die stock plummeted, and widi no more confidence in Peale's\ntrack record and reputation, the owners of die American Museum\nreneged on their deal and sold the whole thing to Barnum.\n\nIt took years for Peale's to recover, and they never forgot what\nBarnum had done. Mr. Peale himself decided to attack Barnum by\nbuilding a reputation for \u201chigh-brow entertainment,\u201d promoting his\nmuseum's programs as more scientific than those of his vulgar\ncompetitor. Mesmerism (hypnotism) was one of Peale's \u201cscientific\u201d\nattractions, and for a while it drew big crowds and was quite\nsuccessful. To fight back, Barnum decided to attack Peale's reputation\nyet again.\n\nBarnum organized a rival mesmeric performance in which he\nhimself apparently put a little girl into a trance. Once she seemed to\nhave fallen deeply under, he tried to hypnotize members of the\naudiencebut no matter how hard he tried, none of the spectators fell\nunder his spell, and many of them began to laugh. A frustrated Barnum\nfinally announced that to prove the little girl's trance was real, he\nwould cut off one of her fingers\n\nmany a sheep Who'd injured me in no respect, And even in my\ntime been known to try Shepherd pie. If need be, then, I'll die. Yet I\nsuspect That others also ought to own their sins. It's only fair that all\nshould do their best To single out the guiltiest.\"\n\n\u201cSire, you're too good a king,\u201d the Fox begins; \"Such scruples are\ntoo delicate. My word, To eat sheep, that profane and vulgar herd,\n\nThat's sin Nay, Sire, enough for such a crew To be devoured by\nsuch as you; While of the shepherds we may say That they deserved\nthe worst they got, Theirs being the lot that over us beasts plot A\nflimsy dream-begotten sway.\" Thus spake the Fox, and toady cheers\nrose high,\n\nWhile none dared cast too cold an eye On Tiger's, Bear's, and\nother em in en ces' Most unpardonable offences.\n\nEach, of never mind what currish breed, Was really a saint, they\nall agreed.\n\nThen came the Ass, to say: \u201cI do recall How once 1 crossed an\nabbey-mead Where hunger, grass in plenty, and withal, I have no\ndoubt, some imp of greed, Assailed me, and I shaved a tongue's-\nbreadth wide Where frankly I'd no right to any grass. \u201d\n\nAll forthwith fell full cry upon the Ass: A Wolf of some book-\nlearning testified That that curst beast must suffer their despite, That\ngallskinned author of their piteous plight. They judged him fit for\nnought but gallows-bait: How vile, another's grass to sequestrate! His\ndeath alone could expiate A crime so heinous, as full well he learns.\nThe court, as you're of great or poor estate, Will paint you either white\nor black by turns.\n\nthe best fables\n\nof la fontaine,\n\nJean de La Fontaine,\n\n1621-1695\n\nwitiiout her noticing. But as he sharpened die knife, die litde girl's\neyes popped open and she ran away, to die audience's delight. He\nrepeated diis and otiier parodies for several weeks. Soon no one could\ntake Peale's show seriously, and attendance went way down. Within a\nfew weeks, the show closed. Over the next few years Barnum\nestablished a reputation for audacity and consummate showmanship\nthat lasted his whole life. Peale's reputation, on the otiier hand, never\nrecovered.\n\nInterpretation\n\nBarnum used two different tactics to ruin Peale's reputation. The\nfirst was simple: He sowed doubts about die museum's stability and\nsolvency. Doubt is a powerful weapon: Once you let it out of die bag\nwith insidious rumors, your opponents are in a horrible dilemma. On\nthe one hand they can deny the rumors, even prove diat you have\nslandered diem. But a layer of suspicion will remain: Why are they\ndefending themselves so desperately Maybe die rumor has some trudi\nto it If, on die otiier hand, tiiey take the high road and ignore you, die\ndoubts, unrefuted, will be even stronger. If done correctiy, the sowing\nof rumors can so infuriate and unsettle your rivals that in defending\ntiiemselves they will make numerous mistakes. This is die perfect\nweapon for those who have no reputation of their own to work from.\n\nOnce Barnum did have a reputation of his own, he used die\nsecond, gender tactic, the fake hypnotism demonstration: He ridiculed\nhis rivals' reputation. This too was extremely successful. Once you\nhave a solid base of respect, ridiculing your opponent botii puts him on\ndie defensive and draws more attention to you, enhancing your own\nreputation. Outright slander and insult are too strong at diis point; tiiey\nare ugly, and may hurt you more tiian help you. But gentie barbs and\nmockery suggest that you have a strong enough sense of your own\nworth to enjoy a good laugh at your rival's expense. A humorous front\ncan make you out as a harmless entertainer while poking holes in die\nreputation of your rival.\n\nIt is easier to cope with a bad conscience than with a bad\nreputation.\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche, 1844-1900\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nThe people around us, even our closest friends, will always to\nsome extent remain mysterious and unfathomable. Their characters\nhave secret recesses that they never reveal. The unknowableness of\nother people could prove disturbing if we thought about it long\nenough, since it would make it impossible for us really to judge otiier\npeople. So we prefer to ignore this fact, and to judge people on their\nappearances, on what is most visible to our eyesclotiies, gestures,\nwords, actions. In the social realm, appearances are die barometer of\nalmost all of our judgments, and you must never be misled into\nbelieving otiierwise. One false slip, one awkward or sudden change in\nyour appearance, can prove disastrous.\n\nThis is the reason for the supreme importance of making and\nmaintaining a reputation that is of your own creation.\n\nThat reputation will protect you in the dangerous game of\nappearances, distracting the probing eyes of others from knowing what\nyou are really like, and giving you a degree of control over how the\nworld judges youa powerful position to be in. Reputation has a power\nlike magic: Widi one stroke of its wand, it can double your strengtfi. It\ncan also send people scurrying away from you. Whether the exact\nsame deeds appear brilliant or dreadful can depend entirely on the\nreputation of the doer.\n\nIn the ancient Chinese court of the Wei kingdom there was a man\nnamed Mi Tzu-hsia who had a reputation for supreme civility and\ngracious-ness. He became the ruler's favorite. It was a law in Wei that\n\u201cwhoever rides secretly in the ruler's coach shall have his feet cut off,\u201d\nbut when Mi Tzu-hsia's mother fell ill, he used the royal coach to visit\nher, pretending that the ruler had given him permission. When the ruler\nfound out, he said, \u201cHow dutiful is Mi Tzu-hsia! For his mother's sake\nhe even forgot that he was committing a crime making him liable to\nlose his feet!\u201d\n\nAnother time the two of them took a stroll in an orchard. Mi Tzu-\nhsia began eating a peach that he could not finish, and he gave the\nruler die other half to eat. The ruler remarked, \u201cYou love me so much\nmat you would even forget your own saliva taste and let me eat the rest\nof the peach!\u201d\n\nLater, however, envious fellow courtiers, spreading word that Mi\nTzu-hsia was actually devious and arrogant, succeeded in damaging\nhis reputation; the ruler came to see his actions in a new light. \u201cThis\nfellow once rode in my coach under pretense of my order,\u201d he told the\ncourtiers angrily, \u201cand another time he gave me a half-eaten peach.\u201d\nFor the same actions that had charmed the ruler when he was the\nfavorite, Mi Tzu-hsia now had to suffer the penalties. The fate of his\nfeet depended solely on the strength of his reputation.\n\nIn the beginning, you must work to establish a reputation for one\noutstanding quality, whether generosity or honesty or cunning. This\nquality sets you apart and gets other people to talk about you. You then\nmake your reputation known to as many people as possible (subtly,\nthough; take care to build slowly, and widi a firm foundation), and\nwatch as it spreads like wildfire.\n\nA solid reputation increases your presence and exaggerates your\nstrengths without your having to spend much energy. It can also create\nan aura around you that will instill respect, even fear. In the fighting in\nthe North African desert during World War II, the German general\nErwin Rommel had a reputation for cunning and for deceptive\nmaneuvering that struck terror into everyone who faced him. Even\nwhen his forces were depleted, and when British tanks outnumbered\nhis by five to one, entire cities would be evacuated at the news of his\napproach.\n\nAs they say, your reputation inevitably precedes you, and if it\ninspires respect, a lot of your work is done for you before you arrive\non the scene, or utter a single word.\n\nYour success seems destined by your past triumphs. Much of the\nsue-\n\ncess of Henry Kissinger's shuttle diplomacy rested on his\nreputation for ironing out differences; no one wanted to be seen as so\nunreasonable that Kissinger could not sway him. A peace treaty\nseemed a fait accompli as soon as Kissinger's name became involved\nin the negotiations.\n\nMake your reputation simple and base it on one sterling quality.\nThis single qualityefficiency, say, or seductivenessbecomes a kind of\ncalling card that announces your presence and places others under a\nspell. A reputation for honesty will allow you to practice all manner of\ndeception. Casanova used his reputation as a great seducer to pave die\nway for his future conquests; women who had heard of his powers\nbecame immensely curious, and wanted to discover for memselves\nwhat had made him so romantically successful.\n\nPerhaps you have already stained your reputation, so that you are\nprevented from establishing a new one. In such cases it is wise to\nassociate with someone whose image counteracts your own, using\ndieir good name to whitewash and elevate yours. It is hard, for\nexample, to erase a reputation for dishonesty by yourself; but a\nparagon of honesty can help. When P. T. Barnum wanted to clean up a\nreputation for promoting vulgar entertainment, he brought the singer\nJenny Lind over from Europe. She had a stellar, high-class reputation,\nand die American tour Barnum sponsored for her gready enhanced his\nown image. Similarly the great robber barons of nineteendi-century\nAmerica were long unable to rid diemselves of a reputation for cruelty\nand mean-spiritedness. Only when tiiey began collecting art, so that\nthe names of Morgan and Frick became permanendy associated with\ntiiose of da Vinci and Rembrandt, were they able to soften dieir\nunpleasant image.\n\nReputation is a treasure to be carefully collected and hoarded.\nEspecially when you are first establishing it, you must protect it\nstrictiy, anticipating all attacks on it. Once it is solid, do not let\nyourself get angry or defensive at the slanderous comments of your\n\nenemiestiiat reveals insecurity, not confidence in your reputation. Take\ndie high road instead, and never appear desperate in your self-defense.\nOn die other hand, an attack on another man's reputation is a potent\nweapon, particularly when you have less power than he does. He has\nmuch more to lose in such a battie, and your own thus-far-small\nreputation gives him a small target when he tries to return your fire.\nBarnum used such campaigns to great effect in his early career. But\nthis tactic must be practiced with skill; you must not seem to engage in\npetty vengeance. If you do not break your enemy's reputation cleverly,\nyou will inadvertentiy ruin your own.\n\nThomas Edison, considered the inventor who harnessed\nelectricity, believed that a workable system would have to be based on\ndirect current (DC). When the Serbian scientist Nikola Tesla appeared\nto have succeeded in creating a system based on alternating current\n(AC), Edison was furious. He determined to ruin Tesla's reputation, by\nmaking the public believe tiiat die AC system was inherendy unsafe,\nand Tesla irresponsible in promoting it.\n\nTo this end he captured all kinds of household pets and\nelectrocuted\n\nthem to death with an AC current. When this wasn't enough, in\n1890 he got New York State prison authorities to organize die world's\nfirst execution by electrocution, using an AC current. But Edison's\nelectrocution experiments had all been widi small creatures; the charge\nwas too weak, and the man was only half killed. In perhaps die\ncountry's crudest state-authorized execution, the procedure had to be\nrepeated. It was an awful spectacle.\n\nAlthough, in the long run, it is Edison's name that has survived, at\ndie time his campaign damaged his own reputation more than Tesla's.\nHe backed off. The lesson is simplenever go too far in attacks like\nthese, for that will draw more attention to your own vengefulness than\nto the person you are slandering. When your own reputation is solid,\nuse subtler tactics, such as satire and ridicule, to weaken your\nopponent while making you out as a charming rogue. The mighty lion\ntoys widi die mouse that crosses his pathany otiier reaction would mar\nhis fearsome reputation.\n\nImage\".\n\nA Mine Full of\n\nDiamonds and Rubies.\n\nYou dug for it, you found it,\n\nand your wealth is now assured.\n\nGuard it with your life. Robbers and thieves\n\nwill appear from all sides. Never take your wealth\n\nfor granted, and constantly renew ittime\n\nwill diminish the jewels' luster,\n\nand bury them from sight.\n\nAuthority: Therefore I should wish our courtier to bolster up his\ninherent worth with skill and cunning, and ensure that whenever he has\nto go where he is a stranger, he is preceded by a good reputation. .. .\nFor the fame which appears to rest on the opinions of many fosters a\ncertain unshakable belief in a man's worth which is then easily\nstrengthened in minds already thus disposed and prepared. (Baldassare\nCastiglione, 1478-1529)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nThere is no possible Reversal. Reputation is critical; there are no\nexceptions to this law. Perhaps, not caring what others think of you,\nyou gain a reputation for insolence and arrogance, but that can be a\nvaluable image in itselfOscar Wilde used it to great advantage. Since\nwe must live in society and must depend on the opinions of others,\nthere is nothing to be gained by neglecting your reputation.

Everything else is subject to barter: we will let our\nriends have\n\nour goods and our lives if need be; but a case of sharing our fame\nand\n\nmaking someone else the gift of our reputation is hardly to be\nound.\n\nMontaigne, 1533-1592\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II\n\nIn 1841 the young P. T. Barnum, trying to establish his reputation\nas America's premier showman, decided to purchase the American\nMuseum in Manhattan and turn it into a collection of curiosities that\nwould secure his fame. The problem was that he had no money. The\nmuseum's asking price was $15,000, but Barnum was able to put\ntogether a proposal that appealed to the institution's owners even\nthough it replaced cash up front with dozens of guarantees and\nreferences. The owners came to a verbal agreement with Barnum, but\nat the last minute, the principal partner changed his mind, and the\nmuseum and its collection were sold to the directors of Peale's\nMuseum. Barnum was infuriated, but the partner explained that\nbusiness was businessthe museum had been sold to Peale's because\nPeale's had a reputation and Barnum had none.\n\nBarnum immediately decided that if he had no reputation to bank\non, his only recourse was to ruin die reputation of Peale's. Accordingly\nhe launched a letter-writing campaign in the newspapers, calling the\nowners a bunch of \u201cbroken-down bank directors\u201d who had no idea\n\n\nhow to run a museum or entertain people. He warmed the public\nagainst buying Peale's stock, since the business's purchase of another\nmuseum would invariably spread its resources thin. The campaign was\neffective, die stock plummeted, and widi no more confidence in Peale's\ntrack record and reputation, the owners of die American Museum\nreneged on their deal and sold the whole thing to Barnum.\n\nIt took years for Peale's to recover, and they never forgot what\nBarnum had done. Mr. Peale himself decided to attack Barnum by\nbuilding a reputation for \u201chigh-brow entertainment,\u201d promoting his\nmuseum's programs as more scientific than those of his vulgar\ncompetitor. Mesmerism (hypnotism) was one of Peale's \u201cscientific\u201d\nattractions, and for a while it drew big crowds and was quite\nsuccessful. To fight back, Barnum decided to attack Peale's reputation\nyet again.\n\nBarnum organized a rival mesmeric performance in which he\nhimself apparently put a little girl into a trance. Once she seemed to\nhave fallen deeply under, he tried to hypnotize members of the\naudiencebut no matter how hard he tried, none of the spectators fell\nunder his spell, and many of them began to laugh. A frustrated Barnum\nfinally announced that to prove the little girl's trance was real, he\nwould cut off one of her fingers\n\nmany a sheep Who'd injured me in no respect, And even in my\ntime been known to try Shepherd pie. If need be, then, I'll die. Yet I\nsuspect That others also ought to own their sins. It's only fair that all\nshould do their best To single out the guiltiest.\"\n\n\u201cSire, you're too good a king,\u201d the Fox begins; \"Such scruples are\ntoo delicate. My word, To eat sheep, that profane and vulgar herd,\n\nThat's sin Nay, Sire, enough for such a crew To be devoured by\nsuch as you; While of the shepherds we may say That they deserved\nthe worst they got, Theirs being the lot that over us beasts plot A\nflimsy dream-begotten sway.\" Thus spake the Fox, and toady cheers\nrose high,\n\nWhile none dared cast too cold an eye On Tiger's, Bear's, and\nother em in en ces' Most unpardonable offences.\n\nEach, of never mind what currish breed, Was really a saint, they\nall agreed.\n\nThen came the Ass, to say: \u201cI do recall How once 1 crossed an\nabbey-mead Where hunger, grass in plenty, and withal, I have no\ndoubt, some imp of greed, Assailed me, and I shaved a tongue's-\nbreadth wide Where frankly I'd no right to any grass. \u201d\n\nAll forthwith fell full cry upon the Ass: A Wolf of some book-\nlearning testified That that curst beast must suffer their despite, That\ngallskinned author of their piteous plight. They judged him fit for\nnought but gallows-bait: How vile, another's grass to sequestrate! His\ndeath alone could expiate A crime so heinous, as full well he learns.\nThe court, as you're of great or poor estate, Will paint you either white\nor black by turns.\n\nthe best fables\n\nof la fontaine,\n\nJean de La Fontaine,\n\n1621-1695\n\nwitiiout her noticing. But as he sharpened die knife, die litde girl's\neyes popped open and she ran away, to die audience's delight. He\nrepeated diis and otiier parodies for several weeks. Soon no one could\ntake Peale's show seriously, and attendance went way down. Within a\nfew weeks, the show closed. Over the next few years Barnum\nestablished a reputation for audacity and consummate showmanship\nthat lasted his whole life. Peale's reputation, on the otiier hand, never\nrecovered.\n\nInterpretation\n\nBarnum used two different tactics to ruin Peale's reputation. The\nfirst was simple: He sowed doubts about die museum's stability and\nsolvency. Doubt is a powerful weapon: Once you let it out of die bag\nwith insidious rumors, your opponents are in a horrible dilemma. On\nthe one hand they can deny the rumors, even prove diat you have\nslandered diem. But a layer of suspicion will remain: Why are they\ndefending themselves so desperately Maybe die rumor has some trudi\nto it If, on die otiier hand, tiiey take the high road and ignore you, die\ndoubts, unrefuted, will be even stronger. If done correctiy, the sowing\nof rumors can so infuriate and unsettle your rivals that in defending\ntiiemselves they will make numerous mistakes. This is die perfect\nweapon for those who have no reputation of their own to work from.\n\nOnce Barnum did have a reputation of his own, he used die\nsecond, gender tactic, the fake hypnotism demonstration: He ridiculed\nhis rivals' reputation. This too was extremely successful. Once you\nhave a solid base of respect, ridiculing your opponent botii puts him on\ndie defensive and draws more attention to you, enhancing your own\nreputation. Outright slander and insult are too strong at diis point; tiiey\nare ugly, and may hurt you more tiian help you. But gentie barbs and\nmockery suggest that you have a strong enough sense of your own\nworth to enjoy a good laugh at your rival's expense. A humorous front\ncan make you out as a harmless entertainer while poking holes in die\nreputation of your rival.\n\nIt is easier to cope with a bad conscience than with a bad\nreputation.\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche, 1844-1900\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nThe people around us, even our closest friends, will always to\nsome extent remain mysterious and unfathomable. Their characters\nhave secret recesses that they never reveal. The unknowableness of\nother people could prove disturbing if we thought about it long\nenough, since it would make it impossible for us really to judge otiier\npeople. So we prefer to ignore this fact, and to judge people on their\nappearances, on what is most visible to our eyesclotiies, gestures,\nwords, actions. In the social realm, appearances are die barometer of\nalmost all of our judgments, and you must never be misled into\nbelieving otiierwise. One false slip, one awkward or sudden change in\nyour appearance, can prove disastrous.\n\nThis is the reason for the supreme importance of making and\nmaintaining a reputation that is of your own creation.\n\nThat reputation will protect you in the dangerous game of\nappearances, distracting the probing eyes of others from knowing what\nyou are really like, and giving you a degree of control over how the\nworld judges youa powerful position to be in. Reputation has a power\nlike magic: Widi one stroke of its wand, it can double your strengtfi. It\ncan also send people scurrying away from you. Whether the exact\nsame deeds appear brilliant or dreadful can depend entirely on the\nreputation of the doer.\n\nIn the ancient Chinese court of the Wei kingdom there was a man\nnamed Mi Tzu-hsia who had a reputation for supreme civility and\ngracious-ness. He became the ruler's favorite. It was a law in Wei that\n\u201cwhoever rides secretly in the ruler's coach shall have his feet cut off,\u201d\nbut when Mi Tzu-hsia's mother fell ill, he used the royal coach to visit\nher, pretending that the ruler had given him permission. When the ruler\nfound out, he said, \u201cHow dutiful is Mi Tzu-hsia! For his mother's sake\nhe even forgot that he was committing a crime making him liable to\nlose his feet!\u201d\n\nAnother time the two of them took a stroll in an orchard. Mi Tzu-\nhsia began eating a peach that he could not finish, and he gave the\nruler die other half to eat. The ruler remarked, \u201cYou love me so much\nmat you would even forget your own saliva taste and let me eat the rest\nof the peach!\u201d\n\nLater, however, envious fellow courtiers, spreading word that Mi\nTzu-hsia was actually devious and arrogant, succeeded in damaging\nhis reputation; the ruler came to see his actions in a new light. \u201cThis\nfellow once rode in my coach under pretense of my order,\u201d he told the\ncourtiers angrily, \u201cand another time he gave me a half-eaten peach.\u201d\nFor the same actions that had charmed the ruler when he was the\nfavorite, Mi Tzu-hsia now had to suffer the penalties. The fate of his\nfeet depended solely on the strength of his reputation.\n\nIn the beginning, you must work to establish a reputation for one\noutstanding quality, whether generosity or honesty or cunning. This\nquality sets you apart and gets other people to talk about you. You then\nmake your reputation known to as many people as possible (subtly,\nthough; take care to build slowly, and widi a firm foundation), and\nwatch as it spreads like wildfire.\n\nA solid reputation increases your presence and exaggerates your\nstrengths without your having to spend much energy. It can also create\nan aura around you that will instill respect, even fear. In the fighting in\nthe North African desert during World War II, the German general\nErwin Rommel had a reputation for cunning and for deceptive\nmaneuvering that struck terror into everyone who faced him. Even\nwhen his forces were depleted, and when British tanks outnumbered\nhis by five to one, entire cities would be evacuated at the news of his\napproach.\n\nAs they say, your reputation inevitably precedes you, and if it\ninspires respect, a lot of your work is done for you before you arrive\non the scene, or utter a single word.\n\nYour success seems destined by your past triumphs. Much of the\nsue-\n\ncess of Henry Kissinger's shuttle diplomacy rested on his\nreputation for ironing out differences; no one wanted to be seen as so\nunreasonable that Kissinger could not sway him. A peace treaty\nseemed a fait accompli as soon as Kissinger's name became involved\nin the negotiations.\n\nMake your reputation simple and base it on one sterling quality.\nThis single qualityefficiency, say, or seductivenessbecomes a kind of\ncalling card that announces your presence and places others under a\nspell. A reputation for honesty will allow you to practice all manner of\ndeception. Casanova used his reputation as a great seducer to pave die\nway for his future conquests; women who had heard of his powers\nbecame immensely curious, and wanted to discover for memselves\nwhat had made him so romantically successful.\n\nPerhaps you have already stained your reputation, so that you are\nprevented from establishing a new one. In such cases it is wise to\nassociate with someone whose image counteracts your own, using\ndieir good name to whitewash and elevate yours. It is hard, for\nexample, to erase a reputation for dishonesty by yourself; but a\nparagon of honesty can help. When P. T. Barnum wanted to clean up a\nreputation for promoting vulgar entertainment, he brought the singer\nJenny Lind over from Europe. She had a stellar, high-class reputation,\nand die American tour Barnum sponsored for her gready enhanced his\nown image. Similarly the great robber barons of nineteendi-century\nAmerica were long unable to rid diemselves of a reputation for cruelty\nand mean-spiritedness. Only when tiiey began collecting art, so that\nthe names of Morgan and Frick became permanendy associated with\ntiiose of da Vinci and Rembrandt, were they able to soften dieir\nunpleasant image.\n\nReputation is a treasure to be carefully collected and hoarded.\nEspecially when you are first establishing it, you must protect it\nstrictiy, anticipating all attacks on it. Once it is solid, do not let\nyourself get angry or defensive at the slanderous comments of your\n\nenemiestiiat reveals insecurity, not confidence in your reputation. Take\ndie high road instead, and never appear desperate in your self-defense.\nOn die other hand, an attack on another man's reputation is a potent\nweapon, particularly when you have less power than he does. He has\nmuch more to lose in such a battie, and your own thus-far-small\nreputation gives him a small target when he tries to return your fire.\nBarnum used such campaigns to great effect in his early career. But\nthis tactic must be practiced with skill; you must not seem to engage in\npetty vengeance. If you do not break your enemy's reputation cleverly,\nyou will inadvertentiy ruin your own.\n\nThomas Edison, considered the inventor who harnessed\nelectricity, believed that a workable system would have to be based on\ndirect current (DC). When the Serbian scientist Nikola Tesla appeared\nto have succeeded in creating a system based on alternating current\n(AC), Edison was furious. He determined to ruin Tesla's reputation, by\nmaking the public believe tiiat die AC system was inherendy unsafe,\nand Tesla irresponsible in promoting it.\n\nTo this end he captured all kinds of household pets and\nelectrocuted\n\nthem to death with an AC current. When this wasn't enough, in\n1890 he got New York State prison authorities to organize die world's\nfirst execution by electrocution, using an AC current. But Edison's\nelectrocution experiments had all been widi small creatures; the charge\nwas too weak, and the man was only half killed. In perhaps die\ncountry's crudest state-authorized execution, the procedure had to be\nrepeated. It was an awful spectacle.\n\nAlthough, in the long run, it is Edison's name that has survived, at\ndie time his campaign damaged his own reputation more than Tesla's.\nHe backed off. The lesson is simplenever go too far in attacks like\nthese, for that will draw more attention to your own vengefulness than\nto the person you are slandering. When your own reputation is solid,\nuse subtler tactics, such as satire and ridicule, to weaken your\nopponent while making you out as a charming rogue. The mighty lion\ntoys widi die mouse that crosses his pathany otiier reaction would mar\nhis fearsome reputation.\n\nImage\".\n\nA Mine Full of\n\nDiamonds and Rubies.\n\nYou dug for it, you found it,\n\nand your wealth is now assured.\n\nGuard it with your life. Robbers and thieves\n\nwill appear from all sides.

(Baldassare\nCastiglione, 1478-1529)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nThere is no possible Reversal. Reputation is critical; there are no\nexceptions to this law. Perhaps, not caring what others think of you,\nyou gain a reputation for insolence and arrogance, but that can be a\nvaluable image in itselfOscar Wilde used it to great advantage. Since\nwe must live in society and must depend on the opinions of others,\nthere is nothing to be gained by neglecting your reputation. By not\ncaring how you are perceived, you let others decide this for you. Be\nthe master of your fate, and also of your reputation.\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Better to be slandered and attacked than ignored.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nP. T. Barnum, America's premier nineteenth-century showman,\nstarted his career as an assistant to the owner of a circus, Aaron Turner.\nIn 1836 die circus stopped in Annapolis, Maryland, for a series of\nperformances. On the morning of opening day, Barnum took a stroll\nthrough town, wearing a new black suit. People started to follow him.\nSomeone in the gathering crowd shouted out that he was the Reverend\nEphraim K. Avery, infamous as a man acquitted of the charge of\nmurder but still believed guilty by most Americans. The angry mob\ntore off Barnum's suit and was ready to lynch him. After desperate\nappeals, Barnum finally convinced them to follow him to the circus,\nwhere he could verify his identity.\n\nOnce there, old Turner confirmed that this was all a practical\njokehe himself had spread the rumor that Barnum was Avery. The\ncrowd dispersed, but Barnum, who had nearly been killed, was not\namused. He wanted to know what could have induced his boss to play\nsuch a trick. \u201cMy dear Mr. Barnum,\u201d Turner replied, \u201cit was all for our\n\ngood. Remember, all we need to ensure success is notoriety.\u201d And\nindeed everyone in town was talking about the joke, and the circus was\npacked that night and every night it stayed in Annapolis. Barnum had\nlearned a lesson he would never forget.\n\nBarnum's first big venture of his own was the American\nMuseuma collection of curiosities, located in New York. One day a\nbeggar approached Barnum in die street. Instead of giving him money,\nBarnum decided to employ him. Taking him back to the museum, he\ngave die man five bricks and told him to make a slow circuit of several\nblocks. At certain points he was to lay down a brick on the sidewalk,\nalways keeping one brick in hand. On the return journey he was to\nreplace each brick on the street with the one he held. Meanwhile he\nwas to remain serious of countenance and to answer no questions.\nOnce back at the museum, he was to enter, walk around inside, then\nleave dirough the back door and make the same bricklaying circuit\nagain.\n\nOn the man's first walk through the streets, several hundred\npeople watched his mysterious movements. By his fourth circuit,\nonlookers swarmed around him, debating what he was doing. Every\ntime he entered the museum he was followed by people who bought\ntickets to keep watching him. Many of diem were distracted by the\nmuseum's collections, and stayed inside. By the end of the first day, the\nbrick man had drawn over a\n\nT1IK WASP AND 11 IK PKINCE\n\nA wasp named Pin Tail was long in quest of some deed that\nwould make him forever famous. So one day he entered the king's\npalace and stung the little prince, who was in bed. The prince awoke\nwith loud cries. The king and his courtiers rushed in to see what had\nhappened. The prince was yelling as the wasp stung him again and\nagain. The courtiers tried to catch the wasp, and each in turn was\nstung. The whole royal household rushed in, the news soon spread, and\npeople flocked to the palace. The city was in an uproar, all business\nsuspended. Said the wasp to itself, before it expired from its efforts, \u201cA\nname without fame is like fire without flame. There is nothing like\nattracting notice at any cost.\u201d Indian fable\n\nEven when I'm railed\n\nat, I get my quota of\n\n\nrenown.\n\nPihtro Arhiino. 1492-1556\n\nA work that was voluntarily presented to a prince was bound to\nseem in some way special. The artist himself might also try to attract\nthe attention of the court through his behaviour. In Vasari's judgment\nSodoma was \u201cwell known both for his personal eccentricities and for\nhis reputation as a good painter.\u201d Because Pope Leo X \u201cfound pleasure\nin such strange, harebrained individuals,\u201d he made Sodoma a knight,\ncausing the artist to go completely out of his mind. Van Mander found\nit odd that the products of Cornells Ketel 's experiments in mouth and\noot painting were bought by notable persons \u201cbecause of their\noddity,\u201d yet Ketel was only adding a variation to similar experiments\nby Titian, Ugo da Carpi and Talma Giovane, who, according to\nBoschini painted with their fingers \u201cbecause they wished to imitate the\nmethod used by the Supreme Creator.\u201d Van Mander\nthousand people into the museum. A few days later die police\nordered him to cease and desist from his walksthe crowds were\nblocking traffic. The bricklaying stopped but thousands of New\nYorkers had entered the museum, and many of those had become P. T.\nBarnum converts.\n\nBarnum would put a band of musicians on a balcony overlooking\nthe street, beneath a huge banner proclaiming FREE music for the\nmillions. What generosity, New Yorkers thought, and they flocked to\nhear the free concerts. But Barnum took pains to hire the worst\nmusicians he could find, and soon after the band struck up, people\nwould hurry to buy tickets to the museum, where they would be out of\nearshot of the band's noise, and of the booing of the crowd.\n\nOne of the first oddities Bamum toured around the country was\nJoice Heth, a woman he claimed was 161 years old, and whom he\nadvertised as a slave who had once been George Washington's nurse.\nAfter several months the crowds began to dwindle, so Barnum sent an\nanonymous letter to the papers, claiming that Heth was a clever fraud.\nAJoice Heth,\u201c he wrote, \u201dis not a human being but an automaton, made\nup of whalebone, india-rubber, and numberless springs.\" Those who\nhad not bothered to see her before were immediately curious, and\nthose who had already seen her paid to see her again, to find out\nwhether the rumor that she was a robot was true.\n\n\nIn 1842, Barnum purchased the carcass of what was purported to\nbe a mermaid. This creature resembled a monkey with the body of a\nfish, but the head and body were perfecdy joinedit was truly a wonder.\nAfter some research Barnum discovered that die creature had been\nexperdy put together in Japan, where the hoax had caused quite a stir.\n\nHe nevertheless planted articles in newspapers around the country\nclaiming the capture of a mermaid in the Fiji Islands. He also sent the\npapers woodcut prints of paintings showing mermaids. By the time he\nshowed the specimen in his museum, a national debate had been\nsparked over the existence of these mythical creatures. A few months\nbefore Barnum's campaign, no one had cared or even known about\nmermaids; now everyone was talking about them as if they were real.\nCrowds flocked in record numbers to see the Fiji Mermaid, and to hear\ndebates on the subject.\n\nA few years later, Barnum toured Europe with General Tom\nThumb, a five-year-old dwarf from Connecticut whom Barnum\nclaimed was an eleven-year-old English boy, and whom he had trained\nto do many remarkable acts. During this tour Barnum's name attracted\nsuch attention that Queen Victoria, that paragon of sobriety, requested\na private audience with him and his talented dwarf at Buckingham\nPalace. The English press may have ridiculed Barnum, but Victoria\nwas royally entertained by him, and respected him ever after.\n\nInterpretation\n\nBarnum understood the fundamental truth about attracting\nattention:\n\nOnce people's eyes are on you, you have a special legitimacy. For\nBarnum,\n\ncreating interest meant creating a crowd; as he later wrote, \u201cEvery\ncrowd has a silver lining.\u201d And crowds tend to act in conjunction. If\none person stops to see your beggarman laying bricks in the street,\nmore will do the same. They will gather like dust bunnies. Then, given\na gentle push, they will enter your museum or watch your show. To\ncreate a crowd you have to do sometiiing different and odd. Any kind\nof curiosity will serve the purpose, for crowds are magnetically\nattracted by the unusual and inexplicable. And once you have their\nattention, never let it go. If it veers toward other people, it does so at\n\nyour expense. Barnum would ruthlessly suck attention from his\ncompetitors, knowing what a valuable commodity it is.\n\nAt the beginning of your rise to the top, then, spend all your\nenergy on attracting attention. Most important: The quality of the\nattention is irrelevant. No matter how badly his shows were reviewed,\nor how slanderously personal were the attacks on his hoaxes, Barnum\nwould never complain. If a newspaper critic reviled him particularly\nbadly, in fact, he made sure to invite the man to an opening and to give\nhim the best seat in the house. He would even write anonymous attacks\non his own work, just to keep his name in the papers. From Barnum's\nvantage, attentionwhether negative or positivewas the main ingredient\nof his success. The worst fate in the world for a man who yearns fame,\nglory, and, of course, power is to be ignored.\n\nreports that Gossaert attracted the attention of Emperor Charles V\nby wearing a fantastic paper costume. In doing so he was adopting the\ntactics used by Dinocrates, who, in order to gain access to Alexander\nthe Great, is said to have appeared disguised as the naked Hercules\nwhen the monarch was sitting in judgment.\n\nthe court artist, Martin Warnke. 1993\n\nIf the courtier happens to engage in arms in some public spectacle\n\nsuch as jousting. . . he will ensure that the horse he has is\nbeautifully\n\ncaparisoned, that he himself is suitably attired, with appropriate\n\nmottoes and ingenious devices to attract the eyes of the onlookers\n\nin his direction as surely as the lodestone attracts iron.\n\nBaldassare Castiglione., 1478-1529\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nBurning more brighdy than those around you is a skill that no one\nis born with. You have to learn to attract attention, \u201cas surely as the\nlodestone attracts iron.\u201d At the start of your career, you must attach\nyour name and reputation to a quality, an image, that sets you apart\nfrom other people. This image can be something like a characteristic\nstyle of dress, or a personality quirk that amuses people and gets talked\nabout. Once the image is established, you have an appearance, a place\nin the sky for your star.\n\nIt is a common mistake to imagine that this peculiar appearance\nof yours should not be controversial, mat to be attacked is somehow\n\n\nbad. Nothing could be further from the truth. To avoid being a flash in\nthe pan, and having your notoriety eclipsed by another, you must not\ndiscriminate between different types of attention; in the end, every\nkind will work in your favor. Barnum, we have seen, welcomed\npersonal attacks and felt no need to defend himself. He deliberately\ncourted the image of being a humbug.\n\nThe court of Louis XIV contained many talented writers, artists,\ngreat beauties, and men and women of impeccable virtue, but no one\nwas more talked about than the singular Due de Lauzun. The duke was\nshort, almost dwarfish, and he was prone to the most insolent kinds of\nbehaviorhe slept with the king's mistress, and openly insulted not only\nother courtiers but the king himself. Louis, however, was so beguiled\nby the duke's eccentricities that he could not bear his absences from\nthe court. It was simple: The strangeness of the duke's character\nattracted attention. Once people were enthralled by him, they wanted\nhim around at any cost.\n\nSociety craves larger-dian-life figures, people who stand above\nthe general mediocrity. Never be afraid, then, of the qualities that set\nyou apart and draw attention to you. Court controversy, even scandal.\nIt is better to be attacked, even slandered, than ignored. All professions\nare ruled by diis law, and all professionals must have a bit of the\nshowman about diem.\n\nThe great scientist Thomas Edison knew that to raise money he\nhad to remain in die public eye at any cost. Almost as important as die\ninventions diemselves was how he presented diem to the public and\ncourted attention.\n\nEdison would design visually dazzling experiments to display his\ndiscoveries widi electricity. He would talk of future inventions mat\nseemed fantastic at the timerobots, and machines that could\nphotograph thoughtand that he had no intention of wasting his energy\non, but tiiat made the public talk about him. He did everything he\ncould to make sure diat he received more attention than his great rival\nNikola Tesla, who may actually have been more brilliant tiian he was\nbut whose name was far less known. In 1915, it was rumored that\nEdison and Tesla would be joint recipients of mat year's Nobel Prize in\nphysics. The prize was eventually given to a pair of English physicists;\nonly later was it discovered mat die prize committee had actually\n\napproached Edison, but he had turned tiiem down, refusing to share the\nprize widi Tesla. By that time his fame was more secure than Tesla's,\nand he thought it better to refuse the honor than to allow his rival die\nattention that would have come even from sharing die prize.\n\nIf you find yourself in a lowly position tiiat offers little\nopportunity for you to draw attention, an effective trick is to attack die\nmost visible, most famous, most powerful person you can find. When\nPietro Aretino, a young Roman servant boy of die early sixteenth\ncentury, wanted to get attention as a writer of verses, he decided to\npublish a series of satirical poems ridiculing die pope and his affection\nfor a pet elephant. The attack put Aretino in the public eye\nimmediately. A slanderous attack on a person in a position of power\nwould have a similar effect. Remember, however, to use such tactics\nsparingly after you have die public's attention, when die act can wear\nthin\n\nOnce in the limelight you must constantiy renew it by adapting\nand varying your method of courting attention. If you don't, die public\nwill grow tired, will take you for granted, and will move on to a newer\nstar. The game requires constant vigilance and creativity. Pablo Picasso\nnever allowed himself to fade into die background; if his name became\ntoo at-\n\ntached to a particular style, he would deliberately upset die public\nwith a new series of paintings that went against all expectations. Better\nto create somediing ugly and disturbing, he believed, than to let\nviewers grow too familiar with his work. Understand: People feel\nsuperior to die person whose actions diey can predict. If you show\ndiem who is in control by playing against their expectations, you bodi\ngain their respect and tighten your hold on dieir fleeting attention.\n\nImage: The Limelight. The actor who steps into this brilliant light\nattains a heightened presence. All eyes are on him. There is room for\nonly one actor at a time in the limelight's narrow beam; do whatever it\ntakes to make yourself its focus. Make your gestures so large, amusing,\nand scandalous that the light stays on you while the other actors are\nleft in the shadows.\n\nAuthority: Be ostentatious and be seen. . . . What is not seen is as\ndiough it did not exist. ... It was light that first caused all creation to\nshine forth. Display fills up many blanks, covers up deficiencies, and\n\n\ngives everything a second life, especially when it is backed by genuine\nmerit. (Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658)\n\nPART II: CREATE AN AIR OF MYSTERY\n\nIn a world growing increasingly banal and familiar, what seems\nenigmatic instantly draws attention. Never make it too clear what you\nare doing or about to do. Do not show all your cards. An air of mystery\nheightens your presence; it also creates anticipationeveryone will be\nwatching you to see what happens next. Use mystery to beguile,\nseduce, even frighten.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nBeginning in 1905, rumors started to spread throughout Paris of a\nyoung Oriental girl who danced in a private home, wrapped in veils\nmat she gradually discarded. A local journalist who had seen her\ndancing reported tiiat \u201ca woman from the Far East had come to Europe\nladen with perfume and jewels, to introduce some of the richness of\nthe Oriental colour and life into the satiated society of European\ncities.\u201d Soon everyone knew die dancer's name: Mata Hari.\n\nEarly that year, in the winter, small and select audiences would\ngather in a salon filled with Indian statues and other relics while an\norchestra played music inspired by Hindu and Javanese melodies.\nAfter keeping the audience waiting and wondering, Mata Hari would\nsuddenly appear, in a startling costume: a white cotton brassiere\ncovered with Indian-type jewels; jeweled bands at the waist supporting\na sarong that revealed as much as it concealed; bracelets up the arms.\nThen Mata Hari would dance, in a style no one in France had seen\nbefore, her whole body swaying as if she were in a trance. She told her\nexcited and curious audience that her dances told stories from Indian\nmythology and Javanese folktales. Soon the cream of Paris, and\nambassadors from far-off lands, were competing for invitations to the\nsalon, where it was rumored that Mata Hari was actually performing\nsacred dances in the nude.\n\nThe public wanted to know more about her. She told journalists\nthat she was actually Dutch in origin, but had grown up on the island\nof Java. She would also talk about time spent in India, how she had\nlearned sacred Hindu dances there, and how Indian women \u201ccan shoot\nstraight, ride horseback, and are capable of doing logarithms and talk\n\nphilosophy.\u201d By the summer of 1905, although few Parisians had\nactually seen Mata Hari dance, her name was on everyone's lips.\n\nAs Mata Hari gave more interviews, the story of her origins kept\nchanging: She had grown up in India, her grandmother was the\ndaughter of a Javanese princess, she had lived on the island of Sumatra\nwhere she had spent her time \u201chorseback riding, gun in hand, and\nrisking her life.\u201d No one knew anything certain about her, but\njournalists did not mind these changes in her biography. They\ncompared her to an Indian goddess, a creature from the pages of\nBaudelairewhatever their imagination wanted to see in this mysterious\nwoman from the East.\n\nIn August of 1905, Mata Hari performed for the first time in\npublic.\n\nCrowds thronging to see her on opening night caused a riot. She\nhad now become a cult figure, spawning many imitations. One\nreviewer wrote, \u201cMata Hari personifies all die poetry of India, its\nmysticism, its voluptuousness, its hypnotizing charm.\u201d Anodier noted,\n\u201cTf India possesses such unexpected treasures, men all Frenchmen will\nemigrate to the shores of the Ganges.\u201d\n\nSoon the fame of Mata Hari and her sacred Indian dances spread\nbeyond Paris. She was invited to Berlin, Vienna, Milan. Over the next\nfew years she performed throughout Europe, mixed with the highest\nsocial circles, and earned an income that gave her an independence\nrarely enjoyed by a woman of the period. Then, near die end of World\nWar I, she was arrested in France, tried, convicted, and finally\nexecuted as a German spy. Only during the trial did the truth come out:\nMata Hari was not from Java or India, had not grown up in the Orient,\ndid not have a drop of Eastern blood in her body. Her real name was\nMargaredia Zelle, and she came from die stolid northern province of\nFriesland, Holland.\n\nInterpretation\n\nWhen Margaretha Zelle arrived in Paris, in 1904, she had half a\nfranc in her pocket. She was one of the thousands of beautiful young\ngirls who flocked to Paris every year, taking work as artists' models,\nnightclub dancers, or vaudeville performers at die Folies Bergere.\nAfter a few years they would inevitably be replaced by younger girls,\n\nand would often end up on die streets, turning to prostitution, or else\nreturning to the town they came from, older and chastened.\n\nZelle had higher ambitions. She had no dance experience and had\nnever performed in the theater, but as a young girl she had traveled\nwith her family and had witnessed local dances in Java and Sumatra.\nZelle clearly understood that what was important in her act was not the\ndance itself, or even her face or figure, but her ability to create an air\nof mystery about herself. The mystery she created lay not just in her\ndancing, or her costumes, or die stories she would tell, or her endless\nlies about her origins; it lay in an atmosphere enveloping everything\nshe did. There was notiiing you could say for sure about hershe was\nalways changing, always surprising her audience witii new costumes,\nnew dances, new stories. This air of mystery left die public always\nwanting to know more, always wondering about her next move. Mata\nHari was no more beautiful tiian many of die otiier young girls who\ncame to Paris, and she was not a particularly good dancer. What\nseparated her from die mass, what attracted and held die public's\nattention and made her famous and wealtiiy, was her mystery. People\nare enthralled by mystery; because it invites constant interpretation,\ndiey never tire of it. The mysterious cannot be grasped. And what\ncannot be seized and consumed creates power.\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nIn die past, the world was filled with the terrifying and\nunknowable diseases, disasters, capricious despots, the mystery of\ndeath itself. What we could not understand we reimagined as myths\nand spirits. Over the centuries, though, we have managed, through\nscience and reason, to illuminate the darkness; what was mysterious\nand forbidding has grown familiar and comfortable. Yet diis light has a\nprice: in a world diat is ever more banal, diat has had its mystery and\nmyth squeezed out of it, we secretly crave enigmas, people or things\nthat cannot be instantiy interpreted, seized, and consumed.\n\nThat is the power of die mysterious: It invites layers of\ninterpretation, excites our imagination, seduces us into believing that it\nconceals something marvelous. The world has become so familiar and\nits inhabitants so predictable that what wraps itself in mystery will\nalmost always draw die limelight to it and make us watch it.\n\nDo not imagine diat to create an air of mystery you have to be\ngrand and awe-inspiring. Mystery that is woven into your day-to-day\ndemeanor, and is subde, has mat much more power to fascinate and\nattract attention. Remember: Most people are upfront, can be read like\nan open book, take little care to control their words or image, and are\nhopelessly predictable. By simply holding back, keeping silent,\noccasionally uttering ambiguous phrases, deliberately appearing\ninconsistent, and acting odd in die subdest of ways, you will emanate\nan aura of mystery. The people around you will men magnify diat aura\nby constantiy trying to interpret you.\n\nBoth artists and con artists understand the vital link between\nbeing mysterious and attracting interest. Count Victor Lustig, the\naristocrat of swindlers, played die game to perfection. He was always\ndoing things mat were different, or seemed to make no sense. He\nwould show up at die best hotels in a limo driven by a Japanese\nchauffeur; no one had ever seen a Japanese chauffeur before, so this\nseemed exotic and strange. Lustig would dress in die most expensive\nclothing, but always widi sometiiinga medal, a flower, an armbandout\nof place, at least in conventional terms. This was seen not as tasteless\nbut as odd and intriguing. In hotels he would be seen receiving\ntelegrams at all hours, one after the other, brought to him by his\nJapanese chauffeurtelegrams he would tear up widi utter nonchalance.\n(In fact they were fakes, completely blank.) He would sit alone in the\ndining room, reading a large and impressive-looking book, smiling at\npeople yet remaining aloof. Widiin a few days, of course, die entire\nhotel would be abuzz with interest in diis strange man.\n\nAll this attention allowed Lustig to lure suckers in with ease.\nThey would beg for his confidence and his company. Everyone wanted\nto be seen widi diis mysterious aristocrat. And in the presence of diis\ndistracting enigma, they wouldn't even notice that diey were being\nrobbed blind.\n\nAn air of mystery can make the mediocre appear intelligent and\nprofound. It made Mata Hari, a woman of average appearance and\nintelligence, seem like a goddess, and her dancing divinely inspired.\nAn air of\n\nmystery about an artist makes his or her artwork immediately\nmore intriguing, a trick Marcel Duchamp played to great effect. It is all\n\nvery easy to dosay little about your work, tease and titillate with\nalluring, even contradictory comments, then stand back and let others\ntry to make sense of it all.\n\nMysterious people put others in a kind of inferior positionthat of\ntrying to figure them out. To degrees that they can control, diey also\nelicit die fear surrounding anything uncertain or unknown. All great\nleaders know that an aura of mystery draws attention to them and\ncreates an intimidating presence. Mao Tse-tung, for example, cleverly\ncultivated an enigmatic image; he had no worries about seeming\ninconsistent or contradicting himselfthe very contradictoriness of his\nactions and words meant that he always had the upper hand. No one,\nnot even his own wife, ever felt diey understood him, and he therefore\nseemed larger than life. This also meant that the public paid constant\nattention to him, ever anxious to witness his next move.\n\nIf your social position prevents you from completely wrapping\nyour actions in mystery, you must at least learn to make yourself less\nobvious. Every now and men, act in a way that does not mesh with\nother people's perception of you. This way you keep those around you\non the defensive, eliciting the kind of attention that makes you\npowerful. Done right, the creation of enigma can also draw the kind of\nattention that strikes terror into your enemy.\n\nDuring the Second Punic War (219-202 B.C.), the great\nCarthaginian general Hannibal was wreaking havoc in his march on\nRome. Hannibal was known for his cleverness and duplicity.\n\nUnder his leadership Carthage's army, though smaller than those\nof the Romans, had constandy outmaneuvered them. On one occasion,\nthough, Hannibal's scouts made a horrible blunder, leading his troops\ninto a marshy terrain with the sea at their back. The Roman army\nblocked the mountain passes mat led inland, and its general, Fabius,\nwas ecstaticat last he had Hannibal trapped. Posting his best sentries\non the passes, he worked on a plan to destroy Hannibal's forces. But in\nthe middle of the night, die sentries looked down to see a mysterious\nsight: A huge procession of lights was heading up die mountain.\nThousands and thousands of lights. If this was Hannibal's army, it had\nsuddenly grown a hundredfold.\n\nThe sentries argued heatedly about what this could mean:\nReinforcements from the sea Troops tiiat had been hidden in die area\n\n\nGhosts No explanation made sense.\n\nAs they watched, fires broke out all over the mountain, and a\nhorrible noise drifted up to them from below, like the blowing of a\nmillion horns. Demons, they thought. The sentries, the bravest and\nmost sensible in the Roman army, fled their posts in a panic.\n\nBy the next day, Hannibal had escaped from the marshland. What\nwas his trick Had he really conjured up demons Actually what he had\ndone was order bundles of twigs to be fastened to the horns of the\nthousands of oxen that traveled with his troops as beasts of burden.\nThe twigs were then\n\nlit, giving the impression of the torches of a vast army heading up\nthe mountain. When the flames burned down to the oxen's skin, they\nstampeded in all directions, bellowing like mad and setting fires all\nover the mountainside. The key to mis device's success was not the\ntorches, the fires, or the noises in themselves, however, but the fact\nthat Hannibal had created a puzzle that captivated the sentries'\nattention and gradually terrified them. From the mountaintop there was\nno way to explain this bizarre sight. If the sentries could have\nexplained it they would have stayed at their posts.\n\nIf you find yourself trapped, cornered, and on the defensive in\nsome situation, try a simple experiment: Do something that cannot be\neasily explained or interpreted. Choose a simple action, but carry it out\nin a way that unsettles your opponent, a way with many possible\ninterpretations, making your intentions obscure. Don't just be\nunpredictable (although this tactic too can be successfulsee Law 17);\nlike Hannibal, create a scene that cannot be read. There will seem to be\nno method to your madness, no rhyme or reason, no single\nexplanation. If you do this right, you will inspire fear and trembling\nand the sentries will abandon their posts. Call it the \u201cfeigned madness\nof Hamlet\u201d tactic, for Hamlet uses it to great effect in Shakespeare's\nplay, frightening his stepfather Claudius through die mystery of his\nbehavior. The mysterious makes your forces seem larger, your power\nmore terrifying.\n\nImage: The Dance of the Veilsthe veils envelop the dancer. What\nthey reveal causes excitement. What they conceal heightens interest.\nThe essence of mystery.\n\nAuthority: If you do not declare yourself immediately, you arouse\nexpectation. . . . Mix a little mystery with everything, and the very\nmystery stirs up veneration. And when you explain, be not too explicit.\n... In this manner you imitate the Divine way when you cause men to\nwonder and watch. (Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nIn the beginning of your rise to the top, you must attract attention\nat all cost, but as you rise higher you must constantly adapt. Never\nwear the public out with the same tactic. An air of mystery works\nwonders for those who need to develop an aura of power and get\nthemselves noticed, but it must seem measured and under control.\nMata Hari went too far with her fabrications; although the accusation\nthat she was a spy was false, at the time it was a reasonable\npresumption because all her lies made her seem suspicious and\nnefarious. Do not let your air of mystery be slowly transformed into a\nreputation for deceit. The mystery you create must seem a game,\nplayful and unthreatening. Recognize when it goes too far, and pull\nback.\n\nThere are times when the need for attention must be deferred, and\nwhen scandal and notoriety are the last things you want to create. The\nattention you attract must never offend or challenge the reputation o\nthose above younot, at any rate, if they are secure. You will seem not\nonly paltry but desperate by comparison. There is an art to knowing\nwhen to draw notice and when to wididraw.\n\nLola Montez was one of die great practitioners of the art o\nattracting attention. She managed to rise from a middle-class Irish\nbackground to being the lover of Franz Liszt and then the mistress and\npolitical adviser of King Ludwig of Bavaria. In her later years, though,\nshe lost her sense of proportion.\n\nIn London in 1850 there was to be a performance o:\nShakespeare's Macbeth featuring the greatest actor of the time, Charles\nJohn Kean. Everyone of consequence in English society was to be\nthere; it was rumored that even Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were\nto make a public appearance. The custom of the period demanded that\neveryone be seated before the queen arrived. So the audience got there\na little early, and when the queen entered her royal box, diey observed\ndie convention of standing up and applauding her. The royal couple\n\n\nwaited, then bowed. Everyone sat down and the lights were dimmed.\nThen, suddenly, all eyes turned to a box opposite Queen Victoria's: A\nwoman appeared from the shadows, taking her seat later tiian the\nqueen. It was Lola Montez. She wore a diamond tiara on her dark hair\nand a long fur coat over her shoulders. People whispered in\namazement as the ermine cloak was dropped to reveal a low-necked\ngown of crimson velvet. By turning tfieir heads, the audience could see\nthat the royal couple deliberately avoided looking at Lola's box. They\nfollowed Victoria's example, and for the rest of the evening Lola\nMontez was ignored. After that evening no one in fashionable society\ndared to be seen with her. All her magnetic powers were reversed.\nPeople would flee her sight. Her future in England was finished.\n\nNever appear overly greedy for attention, then, for it signals\ninsecurity, and insecurity drives power away. Understand that there are\ntimes when it is not in your interest to be the center of attention. When\nin the presence of a king or queen, for instance, or the equivalent\nthereof, bow and retreat to the shadows; never compete.\n'.

Barnum, America's premier nineteenth-century showman,\nstarted his career as an assistant to the owner of a circus, Aaron Turner.\nIn 1836 die circus stopped in Annapolis, Maryland, for a series of\nperformances. On the morning of opening day, Barnum took a stroll\nthrough town, wearing a new black suit. People started to follow him.\nSomeone in the gathering crowd shouted out that he was the Reverend\nEphraim K. Avery, infamous as a man acquitted of the charge of\nmurder but still believed guilty by most Americans. The angry mob\ntore off Barnum's suit and was ready to lynch him. After desperate\nappeals, Barnum finally convinced them to follow him to the circus,\nwhere he could verify his identity.\n\nOnce there, old Turner confirmed that this was all a practical\njokehe himself had spread the rumor that Barnum was Avery. The\ncrowd dispersed, but Barnum, who had nearly been killed, was not\namused. He wanted to know what could have induced his boss to play\nsuch a trick. \u201cMy dear Mr. Barnum,\u201d Turner replied, \u201cit was all for our\n\ngood. Remember, all we need to ensure success is notoriety.\u201d And\nindeed everyone in town was talking about the joke, and the circus was\npacked that night and every night it stayed in Annapolis. Barnum had\nlearned a lesson he would never forget.\n\nBarnum's first big venture of his own was the American\nMuseuma collection of curiosities, located in New York. One day a\nbeggar approached Barnum in die street. Instead of giving him money,\nBarnum decided to employ him. Taking him back to the museum, he\ngave die man five bricks and told him to make a slow circuit of several\nblocks. At certain points he was to lay down a brick on the sidewalk,\nalways keeping one brick in hand. On the return journey he was to\nreplace each brick on the street with the one he held. Meanwhile he\nwas to remain serious of countenance and to answer no questions.\nOnce back at the museum, he was to enter, walk around inside, then\nleave dirough the back door and make the same bricklaying circuit\nagain.\n\nOn the man's first walk through the streets, several hundred\npeople watched his mysterious movements. By his fourth circuit,\nonlookers swarmed around him, debating what he was doing. Every\ntime he entered the museum he was followed by people who bought\ntickets to keep watching him. Many of diem were distracted by the\nmuseum's collections, and stayed inside. By the end of the first day, the\nbrick man had drawn over a\n\nT1IK WASP AND 11 IK PKINCE\n\nA wasp named Pin Tail was long in quest of some deed that\nwould make him forever famous. So one day he entered the king's\npalace and stung the little prince, who was in bed. The prince awoke\nwith loud cries. The king and his courtiers rushed in to see what had\nhappened. The prince was yelling as the wasp stung him again and\nagain. The courtiers tried to catch the wasp, and each in turn was\nstung. The whole royal household rushed in, the news soon spread, and\npeople flocked to the palace. The city was in an uproar, all business\nsuspended. Said the wasp to itself, before it expired from its efforts, \u201cA\nname without fame is like fire without flame. There is nothing like\nattracting notice at any cost.\u201d Indian fable\n\nEven when I'm railed\n\nat, I get my quota of\n\n\nrenown.\n\nPihtro Arhiino. 1492-1556\n\nA work that was voluntarily presented to a prince was bound to\nseem in some way special. The artist himself might also try to attract\nthe attention of the court through his behaviour. In Vasari's judgment\nSodoma was \u201cwell known both for his personal eccentricities and for\nhis reputation as a good painter.\u201d Because Pope Leo X \u201cfound pleasure\nin such strange, harebrained individuals,\u201d he made Sodoma a knight,\ncausing the artist to go completely out of his mind. Van Mander found\nit odd that the products of Cornells Ketel 's experiments in mouth and\noot painting were bought by notable persons \u201cbecause of their\noddity,\u201d yet Ketel was only adding a variation to similar experiments\nby Titian, Ugo da Carpi and Talma Giovane, who, according to\nBoschini painted with their fingers \u201cbecause they wished to imitate the\nmethod used by the Supreme Creator.\u201d Van Mander\nthousand people into the museum. A few days later die police\nordered him to cease and desist from his walksthe crowds were\nblocking traffic. The bricklaying stopped but thousands of New\nYorkers had entered the museum, and many of those had become P. T.\nBarnum converts.\n\nBarnum would put a band of musicians on a balcony overlooking\nthe street, beneath a huge banner proclaiming FREE music for the\nmillions. What generosity, New Yorkers thought, and they flocked to\nhear the free concerts. But Barnum took pains to hire the worst\nmusicians he could find, and soon after the band struck up, people\nwould hurry to buy tickets to the museum, where they would be out of\nearshot of the band's noise, and of the booing of the crowd.\n\nOne of the first oddities Bamum toured around the country was\nJoice Heth, a woman he claimed was 161 years old, and whom he\nadvertised as a slave who had once been George Washington's nurse.\nAfter several months the crowds began to dwindle, so Barnum sent an\nanonymous letter to the papers, claiming that Heth was a clever fraud.\nAJoice Heth,\u201c he wrote, \u201dis not a human being but an automaton, made\nup of whalebone, india-rubber, and numberless springs.\" Those who\nhad not bothered to see her before were immediately curious, and\nthose who had already seen her paid to see her again, to find out\nwhether the rumor that she was a robot was true.\n\n\nIn 1842, Barnum purchased the carcass of what was purported to\nbe a mermaid. This creature resembled a monkey with the body of a\nfish, but the head and body were perfecdy joinedit was truly a wonder.\nAfter some research Barnum discovered that die creature had been\nexperdy put together in Japan, where the hoax had caused quite a stir.\n\nHe nevertheless planted articles in newspapers around the country\nclaiming the capture of a mermaid in the Fiji Islands. He also sent the\npapers woodcut prints of paintings showing mermaids. By the time he\nshowed the specimen in his museum, a national debate had been\nsparked over the existence of these mythical creatures. A few months\nbefore Barnum's campaign, no one had cared or even known about\nmermaids; now everyone was talking about them as if they were real.\nCrowds flocked in record numbers to see the Fiji Mermaid, and to hear\ndebates on the subject.\n\nA few years later, Barnum toured Europe with General Tom\nThumb, a five-year-old dwarf from Connecticut whom Barnum\nclaimed was an eleven-year-old English boy, and whom he had trained\nto do many remarkable acts. During this tour Barnum's name attracted\nsuch attention that Queen Victoria, that paragon of sobriety, requested\na private audience with him and his talented dwarf at Buckingham\nPalace. The English press may have ridiculed Barnum, but Victoria\nwas royally entertained by him, and respected him ever after.\n\nInterpretation\n\nBarnum understood the fundamental truth about attracting\nattention:\n\nOnce people's eyes are on you, you have a special legitimacy. For\nBarnum,\n\ncreating interest meant creating a crowd; as he later wrote, \u201cEvery\ncrowd has a silver lining.\u201d And crowds tend to act in conjunction. If\none person stops to see your beggarman laying bricks in the street,\nmore will do the same. They will gather like dust bunnies. Then, given\na gentle push, they will enter your museum or watch your show. To\ncreate a crowd you have to do sometiiing different and odd. Any kind\nof curiosity will serve the purpose, for crowds are magnetically\nattracted by the unusual and inexplicable. And once you have their\nattention, never let it go. If it veers toward other people, it does so at\n\nyour expense. Barnum would ruthlessly suck attention from his\ncompetitors, knowing what a valuable commodity it is.\n\nAt the beginning of your rise to the top, then, spend all your\nenergy on attracting attention. Most important: The quality of the\nattention is irrelevant. No matter how badly his shows were reviewed,\nor how slanderously personal were the attacks on his hoaxes, Barnum\nwould never complain. If a newspaper critic reviled him particularly\nbadly, in fact, he made sure to invite the man to an opening and to give\nhim the best seat in the house. He would even write anonymous attacks\non his own work, just to keep his name in the papers. From Barnum's\nvantage, attentionwhether negative or positivewas the main ingredient\nof his success. The worst fate in the world for a man who yearns fame,\nglory, and, of course, power is to be ignored.\n\nreports that Gossaert attracted the attention of Emperor Charles V\nby wearing a fantastic paper costume. In doing so he was adopting the\ntactics used by Dinocrates, who, in order to gain access to Alexander\nthe Great, is said to have appeared disguised as the naked Hercules\nwhen the monarch was sitting in judgment.\n\nthe court artist, Martin Warnke. 1993\n\nIf the courtier happens to engage in arms in some public spectacle\n\nsuch as jousting. . . he will ensure that the horse he has is\nbeautifully\n\ncaparisoned, that he himself is suitably attired, with appropriate\n\nmottoes and ingenious devices to attract the eyes of the onlookers\n\nin his direction as surely as the lodestone attracts iron.\n\nBaldassare Castiglione., 1478-1529\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nBurning more brighdy than those around you is a skill that no one\nis born with. You have to learn to attract attention, \u201cas surely as the\nlodestone attracts iron.\u201d At the start of your career, you must attach\nyour name and reputation to a quality, an image, that sets you apart\nfrom other people. This image can be something like a characteristic\nstyle of dress, or a personality quirk that amuses people and gets talked\nabout. Once the image is established, you have an appearance, a place\nin the sky for your star.\n\nIt is a common mistake to imagine that this peculiar appearance\nof yours should not be controversial, mat to be attacked is somehow\n\n\nbad. Nothing could be further from the truth. To avoid being a flash in\nthe pan, and having your notoriety eclipsed by another, you must not\ndiscriminate between different types of attention; in the end, every\nkind will work in your favor. Barnum, we have seen, welcomed\npersonal attacks and felt no need to defend himself. He deliberately\ncourted the image of being a humbug.\n\nThe court of Louis XIV contained many talented writers, artists,\ngreat beauties, and men and women of impeccable virtue, but no one\nwas more talked about than the singular Due de Lauzun. The duke was\nshort, almost dwarfish, and he was prone to the most insolent kinds of\nbehaviorhe slept with the king's mistress, and openly insulted not only\nother courtiers but the king himself. Louis, however, was so beguiled\nby the duke's eccentricities that he could not bear his absences from\nthe court. It was simple: The strangeness of the duke's character\nattracted attention. Once people were enthralled by him, they wanted\nhim around at any cost.\n\nSociety craves larger-dian-life figures, people who stand above\nthe general mediocrity. Never be afraid, then, of the qualities that set\nyou apart and draw attention to you. Court controversy, even scandal.\nIt is better to be attacked, even slandered, than ignored. All professions\nare ruled by diis law, and all professionals must have a bit of the\nshowman about diem.\n\nThe great scientist Thomas Edison knew that to raise money he\nhad to remain in die public eye at any cost. Almost as important as die\ninventions diemselves was how he presented diem to the public and\ncourted attention.\n\nEdison would design visually dazzling experiments to display his\ndiscoveries widi electricity. He would talk of future inventions mat\nseemed fantastic at the timerobots, and machines that could\nphotograph thoughtand that he had no intention of wasting his energy\non, but tiiat made the public talk about him. He did everything he\ncould to make sure diat he received more attention than his great rival\nNikola Tesla, who may actually have been more brilliant tiian he was\nbut whose name was far less known. In 1915, it was rumored that\nEdison and Tesla would be joint recipients of mat year's Nobel Prize in\nphysics. The prize was eventually given to a pair of English physicists;\nonly later was it discovered mat die prize committee had actually\n\napproached Edison, but he had turned tiiem down, refusing to share the\nprize widi Tesla. By that time his fame was more secure than Tesla's,\nand he thought it better to refuse the honor than to allow his rival die\nattention that would have come even from sharing die prize.\n\nIf you find yourself in a lowly position tiiat offers little\nopportunity for you to draw attention, an effective trick is to attack die\nmost visible, most famous, most powerful person you can find. When\nPietro Aretino, a young Roman servant boy of die early sixteenth\ncentury, wanted to get attention as a writer of verses, he decided to\npublish a series of satirical poems ridiculing die pope and his affection\nfor a pet elephant. The attack put Aretino in the public eye\nimmediately. A slanderous attack on a person in a position of power\nwould have a similar effect. Remember, however, to use such tactics\nsparingly after you have die public's attention, when die act can wear\nthin\n\nOnce in the limelight you must constantiy renew it by adapting\nand varying your method of courting attention. If you don't, die public\nwill grow tired, will take you for granted, and will move on to a newer\nstar. The game requires constant vigilance and creativity. Pablo Picasso\nnever allowed himself to fade into die background; if his name became\ntoo at-\n\ntached to a particular style, he would deliberately upset die public\nwith a new series of paintings that went against all expectations. Better\nto create somediing ugly and disturbing, he believed, than to let\nviewers grow too familiar with his work. Understand: People feel\nsuperior to die person whose actions diey can predict. If you show\ndiem who is in control by playing against their expectations, you bodi\ngain their respect and tighten your hold on dieir fleeting attention.\n\nImage: The Limelight. The actor who steps into this brilliant light\nattains a heightened presence. All eyes are on him. There is room for\nonly one actor at a time in the limelight's narrow beam; do whatever it\ntakes to make yourself its focus. Make your gestures so large, amusing,\nand scandalous that the light stays on you while the other actors are\nleft in the shadows.\n\nAuthority: Be ostentatious and be seen. . . . What is not seen is as\ndiough it did not exist. ... It was light that first caused all creation to\nshine forth.

(Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658)\n\nPART II: CREATE AN AIR OF MYSTERY\n\nIn a world growing increasingly banal and familiar, what seems\nenigmatic instantly draws attention. Never make it too clear what you\nare doing or about to do. Do not show all your cards. An air of mystery\nheightens your presence; it also creates anticipationeveryone will be\nwatching you to see what happens next. Use mystery to beguile,\nseduce, even frighten.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nBeginning in 1905, rumors started to spread throughout Paris of a\nyoung Oriental girl who danced in a private home, wrapped in veils\nmat she gradually discarded. A local journalist who had seen her\ndancing reported tiiat \u201ca woman from the Far East had come to Europe\nladen with perfume and jewels, to introduce some of the richness of\nthe Oriental colour and life into the satiated society of European\ncities.\u201d Soon everyone knew die dancer's name: Mata Hari.\n\nEarly that year, in the winter, small and select audiences would\ngather in a salon filled with Indian statues and other relics while an\norchestra played music inspired by Hindu and Javanese melodies.\nAfter keeping the audience waiting and wondering, Mata Hari would\nsuddenly appear, in a startling costume: a white cotton brassiere\ncovered with Indian-type jewels; jeweled bands at the waist supporting\na sarong that revealed as much as it concealed; bracelets up the arms.\nThen Mata Hari would dance, in a style no one in France had seen\nbefore, her whole body swaying as if she were in a trance. She told her\nexcited and curious audience that her dances told stories from Indian\nmythology and Javanese folktales. Soon the cream of Paris, and\nambassadors from far-off lands, were competing for invitations to the\nsalon, where it was rumored that Mata Hari was actually performing\nsacred dances in the nude.\n\nThe public wanted to know more about her. She told journalists\nthat she was actually Dutch in origin, but had grown up on the island\nof Java. She would also talk about time spent in India, how she had\nlearned sacred Hindu dances there, and how Indian women \u201ccan shoot\nstraight, ride horseback, and are capable of doing logarithms and talk\n\nphilosophy.\u201d By the summer of 1905, although few Parisians had\nactually seen Mata Hari dance, her name was on everyone's lips.\n\nAs Mata Hari gave more interviews, the story of her origins kept\nchanging: She had grown up in India, her grandmother was the\ndaughter of a Javanese princess, she had lived on the island of Sumatra\nwhere she had spent her time \u201chorseback riding, gun in hand, and\nrisking her life.\u201d No one knew anything certain about her, but\njournalists did not mind these changes in her biography. They\ncompared her to an Indian goddess, a creature from the pages of\nBaudelairewhatever their imagination wanted to see in this mysterious\nwoman from the East.\n\nIn August of 1905, Mata Hari performed for the first time in\npublic.\n\nCrowds thronging to see her on opening night caused a riot. She\nhad now become a cult figure, spawning many imitations. One\nreviewer wrote, \u201cMata Hari personifies all die poetry of India, its\nmysticism, its voluptuousness, its hypnotizing charm.\u201d Anodier noted,\n\u201cTf India possesses such unexpected treasures, men all Frenchmen will\nemigrate to the shores of the Ganges.\u201d\n\nSoon the fame of Mata Hari and her sacred Indian dances spread\nbeyond Paris. She was invited to Berlin, Vienna, Milan. Over the next\nfew years she performed throughout Europe, mixed with the highest\nsocial circles, and earned an income that gave her an independence\nrarely enjoyed by a woman of the period. Then, near die end of World\nWar I, she was arrested in France, tried, convicted, and finally\nexecuted as a German spy. Only during the trial did the truth come out:\nMata Hari was not from Java or India, had not grown up in the Orient,\ndid not have a drop of Eastern blood in her body. Her real name was\nMargaredia Zelle, and she came from die stolid northern province of\nFriesland, Holland.\n\nInterpretation\n\nWhen Margaretha Zelle arrived in Paris, in 1904, she had half a\nfranc in her pocket. She was one of the thousands of beautiful young\ngirls who flocked to Paris every year, taking work as artists' models,\nnightclub dancers, or vaudeville performers at die Folies Bergere.\nAfter a few years they would inevitably be replaced by younger girls,\n\nand would often end up on die streets, turning to prostitution, or else\nreturning to the town they came from, older and chastened.\n\nZelle had higher ambitions. She had no dance experience and had\nnever performed in the theater, but as a young girl she had traveled\nwith her family and had witnessed local dances in Java and Sumatra.\nZelle clearly understood that what was important in her act was not the\ndance itself, or even her face or figure, but her ability to create an air\nof mystery about herself. The mystery she created lay not just in her\ndancing, or her costumes, or die stories she would tell, or her endless\nlies about her origins; it lay in an atmosphere enveloping everything\nshe did. There was notiiing you could say for sure about hershe was\nalways changing, always surprising her audience witii new costumes,\nnew dances, new stories. This air of mystery left die public always\nwanting to know more, always wondering about her next move. Mata\nHari was no more beautiful tiian many of die otiier young girls who\ncame to Paris, and she was not a particularly good dancer. What\nseparated her from die mass, what attracted and held die public's\nattention and made her famous and wealtiiy, was her mystery. People\nare enthralled by mystery; because it invites constant interpretation,\ndiey never tire of it. The mysterious cannot be grasped. And what\ncannot be seized and consumed creates power.\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nIn die past, the world was filled with the terrifying and\nunknowable diseases, disasters, capricious despots, the mystery of\ndeath itself. What we could not understand we reimagined as myths\nand spirits. Over the centuries, though, we have managed, through\nscience and reason, to illuminate the darkness; what was mysterious\nand forbidding has grown familiar and comfortable. Yet diis light has a\nprice: in a world diat is ever more banal, diat has had its mystery and\nmyth squeezed out of it, we secretly crave enigmas, people or things\nthat cannot be instantiy interpreted, seized, and consumed.\n\nThat is the power of die mysterious: It invites layers of\ninterpretation, excites our imagination, seduces us into believing that it\nconceals something marvelous. The world has become so familiar and\nits inhabitants so predictable that what wraps itself in mystery will\nalmost always draw die limelight to it and make us watch it.\n\nDo not imagine diat to create an air of mystery you have to be\ngrand and awe-inspiring. Mystery that is woven into your day-to-day\ndemeanor, and is subde, has mat much more power to fascinate and\nattract attention. Remember: Most people are upfront, can be read like\nan open book, take little care to control their words or image, and are\nhopelessly predictable. By simply holding back, keeping silent,\noccasionally uttering ambiguous phrases, deliberately appearing\ninconsistent, and acting odd in die subdest of ways, you will emanate\nan aura of mystery. The people around you will men magnify diat aura\nby constantiy trying to interpret you.\n\nBoth artists and con artists understand the vital link between\nbeing mysterious and attracting interest. Count Victor Lustig, the\naristocrat of swindlers, played die game to perfection. He was always\ndoing things mat were different, or seemed to make no sense. He\nwould show up at die best hotels in a limo driven by a Japanese\nchauffeur; no one had ever seen a Japanese chauffeur before, so this\nseemed exotic and strange. Lustig would dress in die most expensive\nclothing, but always widi sometiiinga medal, a flower, an armbandout\nof place, at least in conventional terms. This was seen not as tasteless\nbut as odd and intriguing. In hotels he would be seen receiving\ntelegrams at all hours, one after the other, brought to him by his\nJapanese chauffeurtelegrams he would tear up widi utter nonchalance.\n(In fact they were fakes, completely blank.) He would sit alone in the\ndining room, reading a large and impressive-looking book, smiling at\npeople yet remaining aloof. Widiin a few days, of course, die entire\nhotel would be abuzz with interest in diis strange man.\n\nAll this attention allowed Lustig to lure suckers in with ease.\nThey would beg for his confidence and his company. Everyone wanted\nto be seen widi diis mysterious aristocrat. And in the presence of diis\ndistracting enigma, they wouldn't even notice that diey were being\nrobbed blind.\n\nAn air of mystery can make the mediocre appear intelligent and\nprofound. It made Mata Hari, a woman of average appearance and\nintelligence, seem like a goddess, and her dancing divinely inspired.\nAn air of\n\nmystery about an artist makes his or her artwork immediately\nmore intriguing, a trick Marcel Duchamp played to great effect. It is all\n\nvery easy to dosay little about your work, tease and titillate with\nalluring, even contradictory comments, then stand back and let others\ntry to make sense of it all.\n\nMysterious people put others in a kind of inferior positionthat of\ntrying to figure them out. To degrees that they can control, diey also\nelicit die fear surrounding anything uncertain or unknown. All great\nleaders know that an aura of mystery draws attention to them and\ncreates an intimidating presence. Mao Tse-tung, for example, cleverly\ncultivated an enigmatic image; he had no worries about seeming\ninconsistent or contradicting himselfthe very contradictoriness of his\nactions and words meant that he always had the upper hand. No one,\nnot even his own wife, ever felt diey understood him, and he therefore\nseemed larger than life. This also meant that the public paid constant\nattention to him, ever anxious to witness his next move.\n\nIf your social position prevents you from completely wrapping\nyour actions in mystery, you must at least learn to make yourself less\nobvious. Every now and men, act in a way that does not mesh with\nother people's perception of you. This way you keep those around you\non the defensive, eliciting the kind of attention that makes you\npowerful. Done right, the creation of enigma can also draw the kind of\nattention that strikes terror into your enemy.\n\nDuring the Second Punic War (219-202 B.C.), the great\nCarthaginian general Hannibal was wreaking havoc in his march on\nRome. Hannibal was known for his cleverness and duplicity.\n\nUnder his leadership Carthage's army, though smaller than those\nof the Romans, had constandy outmaneuvered them. On one occasion,\nthough, Hannibal's scouts made a horrible blunder, leading his troops\ninto a marshy terrain with the sea at their back. The Roman army\nblocked the mountain passes mat led inland, and its general, Fabius,\nwas ecstaticat last he had Hannibal trapped. Posting his best sentries\non the passes, he worked on a plan to destroy Hannibal's forces. But in\nthe middle of the night, die sentries looked down to see a mysterious\nsight: A huge procession of lights was heading up die mountain.\nThousands and thousands of lights. If this was Hannibal's army, it had\nsuddenly grown a hundredfold.\n\nThe sentries argued heatedly about what this could mean:\nReinforcements from the sea Troops tiiat had been hidden in die area\n\n\nGhosts No explanation made sense.\n\nAs they watched, fires broke out all over the mountain, and a\nhorrible noise drifted up to them from below, like the blowing of a\nmillion horns. Demons, they thought. The sentries, the bravest and\nmost sensible in the Roman army, fled their posts in a panic.\n\nBy the next day, Hannibal had escaped from the marshland. What\nwas his trick Had he really conjured up demons Actually what he had\ndone was order bundles of twigs to be fastened to the horns of the\nthousands of oxen that traveled with his troops as beasts of burden.\nThe twigs were then\n\nlit, giving the impression of the torches of a vast army heading up\nthe mountain. When the flames burned down to the oxen's skin, they\nstampeded in all directions, bellowing like mad and setting fires all\nover the mountainside. The key to mis device's success was not the\ntorches, the fires, or the noises in themselves, however, but the fact\nthat Hannibal had created a puzzle that captivated the sentries'\nattention and gradually terrified them. From the mountaintop there was\nno way to explain this bizarre sight. If the sentries could have\nexplained it they would have stayed at their posts.\n\nIf you find yourself trapped, cornered, and on the defensive in\nsome situation, try a simple experiment: Do something that cannot be\neasily explained or interpreted. Choose a simple action, but carry it out\nin a way that unsettles your opponent, a way with many possible\ninterpretations, making your intentions obscure. Don't just be\nunpredictable (although this tactic too can be successfulsee Law 17);\nlike Hannibal, create a scene that cannot be read. There will seem to be\nno method to your madness, no rhyme or reason, no single\nexplanation. If you do this right, you will inspire fear and trembling\nand the sentries will abandon their posts. Call it the \u201cfeigned madness\nof Hamlet\u201d tactic, for Hamlet uses it to great effect in Shakespeare's\nplay, frightening his stepfather Claudius through die mystery of his\nbehavior. The mysterious makes your forces seem larger, your power\nmore terrifying.\n\nImage: The Dance of the Veilsthe veils envelop the dancer. What\nthey reveal causes excitement. What they conceal heightens interest.\nThe essence of mystery.\n\nAuthority: If you do not declare yourself immediately, you arouse\nexpectation. . . . Mix a little mystery with everything, and the very\nmystery stirs up veneration. And when you explain, be not too explicit.\n... In this manner you imitate the Divine way when you cause men to\nwonder and watch. (Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nIn the beginning of your rise to the top, you must attract attention\nat all cost, but as you rise higher you must constantly adapt. Never\nwear the public out with the same tactic. An air of mystery works\nwonders for those who need to develop an aura of power and get\nthemselves noticed, but it must seem measured and under control.\nMata Hari went too far with her fabrications; although the accusation\nthat she was a spy was false, at the time it was a reasonable\npresumption because all her lies made her seem suspicious and\nnefarious. Do not let your air of mystery be slowly transformed into a\nreputation for deceit. The mystery you create must seem a game,\nplayful and unthreatening. Recognize when it goes too far, and pull\nback.\n\nThere are times when the need for attention must be deferred, and\nwhen scandal and notoriety are the last things you want to create. The\nattention you attract must never offend or challenge the reputation o\nthose above younot, at any rate, if they are secure. You will seem not\nonly paltry but desperate by comparison. There is an art to knowing\nwhen to draw notice and when to wididraw.\n\nLola Montez was one of die great practitioners of the art o\nattracting attention. She managed to rise from a middle-class Irish\nbackground to being the lover of Franz Liszt and then the mistress and\npolitical adviser of King Ludwig of Bavaria. In her later years, though,\nshe lost her sense of proportion.\n\nIn London in 1850 there was to be a performance o:\nShakespeare's Macbeth featuring the greatest actor of the time, Charles\nJohn Kean. Everyone of consequence in English society was to be\nthere; it was rumored that even Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were\nto make a public appearance. The custom of the period demanded that\neveryone be seated before the queen arrived. So the audience got there\na little early, and when the queen entered her royal box, diey observed\ndie convention of standing up and applauding her. The royal couple\n\n\nwaited, then bowed. Everyone sat down and the lights were dimmed.\nThen, suddenly, all eyes turned to a box opposite Queen Victoria's: A\nwoman appeared from the shadows, taking her seat later tiian the\nqueen. It was Lola Montez. She wore a diamond tiara on her dark hair\nand a long fur coat over her shoulders. People whispered in\namazement as the ermine cloak was dropped to reveal a low-necked\ngown of crimson velvet. By turning tfieir heads, the audience could see\nthat the royal couple deliberately avoided looking at Lola's box. They\nfollowed Victoria's example, and for the rest of the evening Lola\nMontez was ignored. After that evening no one in fashionable society\ndared to be seen with her. All her magnetic powers were reversed.\nPeople would flee her sight. Her future in England was finished.\n\nNever appear overly greedy for attention, then, for it signals\ninsecurity, and insecurity drives power away. Understand that there are\ntimes when it is not in your interest to be the center of attention. When\nin the presence of a king or queen, for instance, or the equivalent\nthereof, bow and retreat to the shadows; never compete.\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Not only will such assistance save you\nvaluable time and energy, it will give you a godlike aura of efficiency\nand speed. In the end your helpers will be forgotten and you will be\nremembered. Never do yourself what others can do for you.\n\nTRANSGRESSION AND OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW In\n883 a young Serbian scientist named Nikola Tesla was working for\nthe European division of die Continental Edison Company. He was a\nbrilliant inventor, and Charles Batchelor, a plant manager and a\npersonal friend of Thomas Edison, persuaded him he should seek his\nortune in America, giving him a letter of introduction to Edison\nhimself. So began a life of woe and tribulation mat lasted until Tesla's\ndeath.\nWhen Tesla met Edison in New York, the famous inventor hired\nhim on the spot. Tesla worked eighteen-hour days, finding ways to\nimprove the primitive Edison dynamos. Finally he offered to redesign\ndiem completely. To Edison diis seemed a monumental task mat could\nlast years wimout paying off, but he told Tesla, \u201cThere's fifty diousand\ndollars in it for you if you can do it.\u201d Tesla labored day and night on\nthe project and after only a year he produced a greatiy improved\nversion of the dynamo, complete with automatic controls. He went to\nEdison to break the good news and receive his $50,000. Edison was\npleased with the improvement, for which he and his company would\ntake credit, but when it came to the issue of the money he told the\nyoung Serb, \u201cTesla, you don't understand our American humor!,\u201d and\noffered a small raise instead.\n\n\nTesla's obsession was to create an alternating-current system (AC)\nof electricity. Edison believed in the direct-current system (DC), and\nnot only refused to support Tesla's research but later did all he could to\nsabotage him. Tesla turned to die great Pittsburgh magnate George\nWestinghouse, who had started his own electricity company.\nWestinghouse completely funded Tesla's research and offered him a\ngenerous royalty agreement on future profits. The AC system Tesla\ndeveloped is still the standard today but after patents were filed in his\nname, other scientists came forward to take credit for the invention,\nclaiming mat they had laid the groundwork for him. His name was lost\nin the shuffle, and the public came to associate the invention widi\nWestinghouse himself.\n\nA year later, Westinghouse was caught in a takeover bid from J.\nPierpont Morgan, who made him rescind the generous royalty contract\nhe had signed widi Tesla. Westinghouse explained to the scientist mat\nhis company would not survive if it had to pay him his full royalties;\nhe persuaded Tesla to accept a buyout of his patents for $216,000a\nlarge sum, no doubt, but far less dian the $12 million mey were worth\nat the time. The financiers had divested Tesla of the riches, the patents,\nand essentially me credit for the greatest invention of his career.\n\nThe name of Guglielmo Marconi is forever linked widi the\ninvention of radio. But few know mat in producing his inventionhe\nbroadcast a signal across the English Channel in 1899Marconi made\nuse of a patent Tesla had filed in 1897, and that his work depended on\nTesla's research. Once again Tesla received no money and no credit.\nTesla invented an induction motor as well as the AC power system,\nand he is die real \u201cfatiier of radio.\u201d Yet none of diese discoveries bear\nhis name. As an old man, he lived in poverty.\n\nTHE TORTOISE. THE ELEPHANT AND THE\nHIPPOPOTAMI'S\n\nOne day the tortoise met the elephant, who trumpeted, \u201cOut of my\nway, you weakling / might step on you!\u201d The tortoise was not afraid\nand stayed where he was, so the elephant stepped on him, but could\nnot crush him. \u201cDo not boast, Mr. Elephant, I am as strong as you\nare!\u201dsaid the tortoise, but the elephant just laughed. So the tortoise\nasked him to come to his hill the next morning.\n\nThe next day, before sunrise, the tortoise ran down the hill to the\nriver, where he met the hippopotamus, who was just on his way back\ninto the water after his nocturnal feeding. \u201cMr Hippo! Shall we have a\ntug-of-war I bet I'm as strong as you are!\u201d said the tortoise. The\nhippopotamus laughed at this ridiculous idea, but agreed. The tortoise\nproduced a long rope and told the hippo to hold it in his mouth until\nthe tortoise shouted \u201cHey!\u201d Then the tortoise ran back up the hill\nwhere he found the elephant, who was getting impatient. He gave the\nelephant the other end of the rope and said, \u201cWhen I say 'Hey!' pull,\nand you'll see which of us is the strongest.\u201d Then he ran halfway back\ndown the\n\nhill, to a place where he couldn be seen, and shouted, \u201cHey!\u201d The\nelephant and the hippopotamus pulled and pulled, but neither could\nbudge the otherthey were of equal strength. They both agreed that the\ntortoise was as strong as thev were. Never do what others can do for\nyou. The tortoise let others do the work for him while he got the credit.\n\nZalRHAN FAIil.h\n\nTo be sure, if the hunter relies on the security of the carriage,\nutilizes the legs of the six horses, and makes Wang Liang hold their\nreins, then he will not tire himself and will find it easy to overtake\nswift animals. Now supposing he discarded the advantage of the\ncarriage, gave up the useful legs of the horses and the skill of Wang\nLiang, and alighted to run after the animals, then even though his legs\nwere as quick as Lou Chi's, he would not be in time to overtake the\nanimals. In fact, if good horses and strong carriages are taken into use,\nthen mere bondmen and bondwomen will be good enough to catch the\nanimals.\n\nHan-lki-tzi;,\n\nChinlsk philosopher,\n\nthird (tintury b.c.\n\nIn 1917, during his later impoverished years, Tesla was told he\nwas to receive the Edison Medal of the American Institute of Electrical\nEngineers. He turned the medal down. \u201cYou propose,\u201d he said, \u201cto\nhonor me with a medal which I could pin upon my coat and strut for a\nvain hour before the members of your Institute. You would decorate\nmy body and continue to let starve, for failure to supply recognition,\n\nmy mind and its creative products, which have supplied the foundation\nupon which the major portion of your Institute exists.\u201d\n\nInterpretation\n\nMany harbor the illusion that science, dealing with facts as it\ndoes, is beyond the petty rivalries that trouble the rest of the world.\nNikola Tesla was one of those. He believed science had nothing to do\nwith politics, and claimed not to care for fame and riches. As he grew\nolder, though, this ruined his scientific work. Not associated with any\nparticular discovery, he could attract no investors to his many ideas.\nWhile he pondered great inventions for the future, others stole the\npatents he had already developed and got the glory for themselves.\n\nHe wanted to do everything on his own, but merely exhausted and\nimpoverished himself in the process.\n\nEdison was Tesla's polar opposite. He wasn't actually much of a\nscientific thinker or inventor; he once said that he had no need to be a\nmathematician because he could always hire one. That was Edison's\nmain method. He was really a businessman and publicist, spotting the\ntrends and the opportunities that were out there, then hiring the best in\nthe field to do the work for him. If he had to he would steal from his\ncompetitors. Yet his name is much better known than Tesla's, and is\nassociated with more inventions.\n\nThe lesson is twofold: First, the credit for an invention or creation\nis as important, if not more important, than the invention itself. You\nmust secure the credit for yourself and keep others from stealing it\naway, or from piggybacking on your hard work. To accomplish this\nyou must always be vigilant and ruthless, keeping your creation quiet\nuntil you can be sure there are no vultures circling overhead. Second,\nlearn to take advantage of other people's work to further your own\ncause. Time is precious and life is short. If you try to do it all on your\nown, you run yourself ragged, waste energy, and burn yourself out.

He was a\nbrilliant inventor, and Charles Batchelor, a plant manager and a\npersonal friend of Thomas Edison, persuaded him he should seek his\nortune in America, giving him a letter of introduction to Edison\nhimself. So began a life of woe and tribulation mat lasted until Tesla's\ndeath.\nWhen Tesla met Edison in New York, the famous inventor hired\nhim on the spot. Tesla worked eighteen-hour days, finding ways to\nimprove the primitive Edison dynamos. Finally he offered to redesign\ndiem completely. To Edison diis seemed a monumental task mat could\nlast years wimout paying off, but he told Tesla, \u201cThere's fifty diousand\ndollars in it for you if you can do it.\u201d Tesla labored day and night on\nthe project and after only a year he produced a greatiy improved\nversion of the dynamo, complete with automatic controls. He went to\nEdison to break the good news and receive his $50,000. Edison was\npleased with the improvement, for which he and his company would\ntake credit, but when it came to the issue of the money he told the\nyoung Serb, \u201cTesla, you don't understand our American humor!,\u201d and\noffered a small raise instead.\n\n\nTesla's obsession was to create an alternating-current system (AC)\nof electricity. Edison believed in the direct-current system (DC), and\nnot only refused to support Tesla's research but later did all he could to\nsabotage him. Tesla turned to die great Pittsburgh magnate George\nWestinghouse, who had started his own electricity company.\nWestinghouse completely funded Tesla's research and offered him a\ngenerous royalty agreement on future profits. The AC system Tesla\ndeveloped is still the standard today but after patents were filed in his\nname, other scientists came forward to take credit for the invention,\nclaiming mat they had laid the groundwork for him. His name was lost\nin the shuffle, and the public came to associate the invention widi\nWestinghouse himself.\n\nA year later, Westinghouse was caught in a takeover bid from J.\nPierpont Morgan, who made him rescind the generous royalty contract\nhe had signed widi Tesla. Westinghouse explained to the scientist mat\nhis company would not survive if it had to pay him his full royalties;\nhe persuaded Tesla to accept a buyout of his patents for $216,000a\nlarge sum, no doubt, but far less dian the $12 million mey were worth\nat the time. The financiers had divested Tesla of the riches, the patents,\nand essentially me credit for the greatest invention of his career.\n\nThe name of Guglielmo Marconi is forever linked widi the\ninvention of radio. But few know mat in producing his inventionhe\nbroadcast a signal across the English Channel in 1899Marconi made\nuse of a patent Tesla had filed in 1897, and that his work depended on\nTesla's research. Once again Tesla received no money and no credit.\nTesla invented an induction motor as well as the AC power system,\nand he is die real \u201cfatiier of radio.\u201d Yet none of diese discoveries bear\nhis name. As an old man, he lived in poverty.\n\nTHE TORTOISE. THE ELEPHANT AND THE\nHIPPOPOTAMI'S\n\nOne day the tortoise met the elephant, who trumpeted, \u201cOut of my\nway, you weakling / might step on you!\u201d The tortoise was not afraid\nand stayed where he was, so the elephant stepped on him, but could\nnot crush him. \u201cDo not boast, Mr. Elephant, I am as strong as you\nare!\u201dsaid the tortoise, but the elephant just laughed. So the tortoise\nasked him to come to his hill the next morning.\n\nThe next day, before sunrise, the tortoise ran down the hill to the\nriver, where he met the hippopotamus, who was just on his way back\ninto the water after his nocturnal feeding. \u201cMr Hippo! Shall we have a\ntug-of-war I bet I'm as strong as you are!\u201d said the tortoise. The\nhippopotamus laughed at this ridiculous idea, but agreed. The tortoise\nproduced a long rope and told the hippo to hold it in his mouth until\nthe tortoise shouted \u201cHey!\u201d Then the tortoise ran back up the hill\nwhere he found the elephant, who was getting impatient. He gave the\nelephant the other end of the rope and said, \u201cWhen I say 'Hey!' pull,\nand you'll see which of us is the strongest.\u201d Then he ran halfway back\ndown the\n\nhill, to a place where he couldn be seen, and shouted, \u201cHey!\u201d The\nelephant and the hippopotamus pulled and pulled, but neither could\nbudge the otherthey were of equal strength. They both agreed that the\ntortoise was as strong as thev were. Never do what others can do for\nyou. The tortoise let others do the work for him while he got the credit.\n\nZalRHAN FAIil.h\n\nTo be sure, if the hunter relies on the security of the carriage,\nutilizes the legs of the six horses, and makes Wang Liang hold their\nreins, then he will not tire himself and will find it easy to overtake\nswift animals. Now supposing he discarded the advantage of the\ncarriage, gave up the useful legs of the horses and the skill of Wang\nLiang, and alighted to run after the animals, then even though his legs\nwere as quick as Lou Chi's, he would not be in time to overtake the\nanimals. In fact, if good horses and strong carriages are taken into use,\nthen mere bondmen and bondwomen will be good enough to catch the\nanimals.\n\nHan-lki-tzi;,\n\nChinlsk philosopher,\n\nthird (tintury b.c.\n\nIn 1917, during his later impoverished years, Tesla was told he\nwas to receive the Edison Medal of the American Institute of Electrical\nEngineers. He turned the medal down. \u201cYou propose,\u201d he said, \u201cto\nhonor me with a medal which I could pin upon my coat and strut for a\nvain hour before the members of your Institute. You would decorate\nmy body and continue to let starve, for failure to supply recognition,\n\nmy mind and its creative products, which have supplied the foundation\nupon which the major portion of your Institute exists.\u201d\n\nInterpretation\n\nMany harbor the illusion that science, dealing with facts as it\ndoes, is beyond the petty rivalries that trouble the rest of the world.\nNikola Tesla was one of those. He believed science had nothing to do\nwith politics, and claimed not to care for fame and riches. As he grew\nolder, though, this ruined his scientific work. Not associated with any\nparticular discovery, he could attract no investors to his many ideas.\nWhile he pondered great inventions for the future, others stole the\npatents he had already developed and got the glory for themselves.\n\nHe wanted to do everything on his own, but merely exhausted and\nimpoverished himself in the process.\n\nEdison was Tesla's polar opposite. He wasn't actually much of a\nscientific thinker or inventor; he once said that he had no need to be a\nmathematician because he could always hire one. That was Edison's\nmain method. He was really a businessman and publicist, spotting the\ntrends and the opportunities that were out there, then hiring the best in\nthe field to do the work for him. If he had to he would steal from his\ncompetitors. Yet his name is much better known than Tesla's, and is\nassociated with more inventions.\n\nThe lesson is twofold: First, the credit for an invention or creation\nis as important, if not more important, than the invention itself. You\nmust secure the credit for yourself and keep others from stealing it\naway, or from piggybacking on your hard work. To accomplish this\nyou must always be vigilant and ruthless, keeping your creation quiet\nuntil you can be sure there are no vultures circling overhead. Second,\nlearn to take advantage of other people's work to further your own\ncause. Time is precious and life is short. If you try to do it all on your\nown, you run yourself ragged, waste energy, and burn yourself out. It\nis far better to conserve your forces, pounce on the work others have\ndone, and find a way to make it your own.\n\nEverybody steals in commerce and industry.\n\nI've stolen a lot myself.\n\nBut I know how to steal.\n\nThomas Edison, 1847-1931\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\n\nA hen who had lost her sight, and was accustomed to scratching\nup\n\ntill continued to scratch awav most diligently.

The original text is: 'MAKE OTHER PEOPLE\n\nCOME TO YOU\n\nUSE BAIT IF NECESSARY\n\nJUDGMENT\n\nWhen you force the other person to act, you are the one in\ncontrol. It is always better to make your opponent come to you,\nabandoning his own plans in the process. Lure him with fabulous\ngainsthen attack. You hold the cards.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nAt die Congress of Vienna in 1814, die major powers of Europe\ngadiered to carve up the remains of Napoleon's fallen Empire. The city\nwas full of gaiety and die balls were die most splendid in memory.\nHovering over die proceedings, however, was die shadow of Napoleon\nhimself. Instead of being executed or exiled far away, he had been sent\nto die island of Elba, not far from die coast of Italy.\n\nEven imprisoned on an island, a man as bold and creative as\nNapoleon Bonaparte made everyone nervous. The Austrians plotted to\nkill him on Elba, but decided it was too risky. Alexander I, Russia's\ntemperamental czar, heightened die anxiety by dirowing a fit during\nthe congress when a part of Poland was denied him: \u201cBeware, I shall\nloose die monster!\u201d he mreatened. Everyone knew he meant Napoleon.\nOf all die statesmen gadiered in Vienna, only Talleyrand, Napoleon's\nformer foreign minister, seemed calm and unconcerned. It was as if he\nknew somediing the odiers did not.\n\nMeanwhile, on die island of Elba, Napoleon's life was a mockery\nof his previous glory. As Elba's \u201cking,\u201d he had been allowed to form a\ncourt there was a cook, a wardrobe mistress, an official pianist, and a\nhandful of courtiers. All this was designed to humiliate Napoleon, and\nit seemed to work.\n\nThat winter, however, there occurred a series of events so strange\nand dramatic they might have been scripted in a play. Elba was\n\nsurrounded by British ships, dieir cannons covering all possible exit\npoints. Yet somehow, in broad daylight on 26 February 1815, a ship\nwith nine hundred men on board picked up Napoleon and put to sea.\nThe English gave chase but the ship got away. This almost impossible\nescape astonished die public throughout Europe, and terrified die\nstatesmen at the Congress of Vienna.\n\nAkhough it would have been safer to leave Europe, Napoleon not\nonly chose to return to France, he raised die odds by marching on Paris\nwith a tiny army, in hopes of recapturing the throne. His strategy\nworkedpeople of all classes direw themselves at his feet. An army\nunder Marshal Ney sped from Paris to arrest him, but when die\nsoldiers saw dieir beloved former leader, diey changed sides. Napoleon\nwas declared emperor again. Volunteers swelled the ranks of his new\narmy. Delirium swept the country. In Paris, crowds went wild. The\nking who had replaced Napoleon fled the country.\n\nFor die next hundred days, Napoleon ruled France. Soon,\nhowever, the giddiness subsided. France was bankrupt, its resources\nnearly exhausted, and diere was little Napoleon could do about mis. At\ndie Batde of Waterloo, in June of diat year, he was finally defeated for\ngood. This time his enemies had learned dieir lesson: They exiled him\nto the barren island of Saint Helena, off the west coast of Africa. There\nhe had no more hope of escape.\n\nInterpretation\n\nOnly years later did the facts of Napoleon's dramatic escape from\nElba come to light. Before he decided to attempt diis bold move,\nvisitors to his court had told him diat he was more popular in France\nthan ever, and diat\n\nthe country would embrace him again. One of tiiese visitors was\nAustria's General Koller, who convinced Napoleon that if he escaped,\nthe European powers, England included, would welcome him back\ninto power. Napoleon was tipped off that the English would let him go,\nand indeed his escape occurred in the middle of the afternoon, in full\nview of English spyglasses.\n\nWhat Napoleon did not know was that there was a man behind it\nall, pulling the strings, and that this man was his former minister,\nTalleyrand. And Talleyrand was doing all this not to bring back the\nglory days but to crush Napoleon once and for all. Considering the\n\nemperor's ambition unsettling to Europe's stability, he had tumed\nagainst him long ago. When Napoleon was exiled to Elba, Talleyrand\nhad protested. Napoleon should be sent farther away, he argued, or\nEurope would never have peace. But no one listened.\n\nInstead of pushing his opinion, Talleyrand bided his time.\nWorking quiedy, he eventually won over Casdereagh and Metternich,\nthe foreign ministers of England and Austria.\n\nTogether these men baited Napoleon into escaping. Even Roller's\nvisit, to whisper the promise of glory in die exile's ear, was part of the\nplan. Like a master cardplayer, Talleyrand figured eveiything out in\nadvance. He knew Napoleon would fall into the trap he had set. He\nalso foresaw that Napoleon would lead the country into a war, which,\ngiven France's weakened condition, could only last a few mondis. One\ndiplomat in Vienna, who understood that Talleyrand was behind it all,\nsaid, \u201cHe has set the house ablaze in order to save it from the plague.\u201d\n\nWhen I have laid bait for deer,\n\nI don't shoot at the first doe that comes to sniff,\n\nbut wait until the whole herd has gathered round.\n\nOtto von Bismarck, 1815-1898\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nHow many times has this scenario played itself out in history: An\naggressive leader initiates a series of bold moves mat begin by\nbringing him much power. Slowly, however, his power reaches a peak,\nand soon everything turns against him. His numerous enemies band\ntogether; trying to maintain his power, he exhausts himself going in\nthis direction and that, and inevitably he collapses. The reason for this\npattern is that the aggressive person is rarely in full control. He cannot\nsee more than a couple of moves ahead, cannot see the consequences\nof diis bold move or that one. Because he is constantiy being forced to\nreact to the moves of his evergrowing host of enemies, and to the\nunforeseen consequences of his own rash actions, his aggressive\nenergy is turned against him.\n\nIn the realm of power, you must ask yourself, what is the point of\nchasing here and mere, trying to solve problems and defeat my\nenemies, if I never feel in control Why am I always having to react to\nevents instead of directing them The answer is simple: Your idea of\npower is wrong. You\n\nhave mistaken aggressive action for effective action. And most\noften the most effective action is to stay back, keep calm, and let\nothers be frustrated by the traps you lay for them, playing for long-\nterm power rather than quick victory.\n\nRemember: The essence of power is the ability to keep the\ninitiative, to get others to react to your moves, to keep your opponent\nand those around you on the defensive. When you make other people\ncome to you, you suddenly become the one controlling the situation.\nAnd the one who has control has power. Two things must happen to\nplace you in this position: You yourself must learn to master your\nemotions, and never to be influenced by anger; meanwhile, however,\nyou must play on people's natural tendency to react angrily when\npushed and baited. In the long run, the ability to make others come to\nyou is a weapon far more powerful than any tool of aggression.\n\nStudy how Talleyrand, the master of the art, performed this\ndelicate trick. First, he overcame the urge to try to convince his fellow\nstatesmen that they needed to banish Napoleon far away. It is only\nnatural to want to persuade people by pleading your case, imposing\nyour will with words. But this often turns against you. Few of\nTalleyrand's contemporaries believed Napoleon was still a threat, so\nthat if he had spent a lot of energy trying to convince them, he would\nonly have made himself look foolish. Instead, he held his tongue and\nhis emotions in check. Most important of all, he laid Napoleon a sweet\nand irresistible trap. He knew the man's weakness, his impetuosity, his\nneed for glory and the love of the masses, and he played all this to\nperfection. When Napoleon went for the bait, there was no danger that\nhe might succeed and turn the tables on Talleyrand, who better than\nanyone knew France's depleted state. And even had Napoleon been\nable to overcome these difficulties, the likelihood of his success would\nhave been greater were he able to choose his time and place of action.\nBy setting the proper trap, Talleyrand took the time and place into his\nown hands.\n\nAll of us have only so much energy, and there is a moment when\nour energies are at their peak. When you make the other person come\nto you, he wears himself out, wasting his energy on the trip. In the year\n1905, Russia and Japan were at war. The Japanese had only recently\nbegun to modernize their warships, so that the Russians had a stronger\n\n\nnavy, but by spreading false information the Japanese marshal Togo\nHeihachiro baited the Russians into leaving their docks in the Baltic\nSea, making them believe they could wipe out the Japanese fleet in one\nswift attack. The Russian fleet could not reach Japan by the quickest\nroutethrough the Strait of Gibraltar and then the Suez Canal into the\nIndian Oceanbecause these were controlled by the British, and Japan\nwas an ally of Great Britain. They had to go around the Cape of Good\nHope, at die southern tip of Africa, adding over more than six\nthousand miles to die voyage. Once the fleet passed the Cape, the\nJapanese spread another false story: They were sailing to launch a\ncounterattack. So the Russians made the entire journey to Japan on\ncombat alert. By the time diey arrived, their seamen were tense,\nexhausted, and overworked, while the Japanese had been waiting at\ntheir ease. Despite die\n\nodds and their lack of experience in modern naval warfare, the\nJapanese crushed the Russians.\n\nOne added benefit of making the opponent come to you, as the\nJapanese discovered with the Russians, is that it forces him to operate\nin your territory. Being on hostile ground will make him nervous and\noften he will rush his actions and make mistakes. For negotiations or\nmeetings, it is always wise to lure others into your territory, or the\nterritory of your choice. You have your bearings, while they see\nnothing familiar and are subdy placed on the defensive.\n\nManipulation is a dangerous game. Once someone suspects he is\nbeing manipulated, it becomes harder and harder to control him. But\nwhen you make your opponent come to you, you create the illusion\nthat he is controlling the situation. He does not feel the strings that pull\nhim, just as Napoleon imagined that he himself was the master of his\ndaring escape and return to power.\n\nEverything depends on the sweetness of your bait. If your trap is\nattractive enough, the turbulence of your enemies' emotions and\ndesires will blind them to reality. The greedier they become, the more\nthey can be led around.\n\nThe great nineteenth-century robber baron Daniel Drew was a\nmaster at playing the stock market. When he wanted a particular stock\nto be bought or sold, driving prices up or down, he rarely resorted to\nthe direct approach. One of his tricks was to hurry through an\n\nexclusive club near Wall Street, obviously on his way to the stock\nexchange, and to pull out his customary red bandanna to wipe his\nperspiring brow. A slip of paper would fall from this bandanna that he\nwould pretend not to notice. The club's members were always trying to\n\u2018oresee Drew's moves, and they would pounce on the paper, which\ninvariably seemed to contain an inside tip on a stock. Word would\nspread, and members would buy or sell the stock in droves, playing\nperfectly into Drew's hands.\nIf you can get other people to dig their own graves, why sweat\nyourself Pickpockets work this to perfection.

But when the city officials hired a second\nman, Lorenzo Ghiberti, to work with Brunelleschi, the great artist\nbrooded in secret. He knew that Ghiberti had gotten the job through his\nconnections, and that he would do none of the work and get half the\ncredit. At a critical moment of the construction, then, Brunelleschi\nsuddenly developed a mysterious illness. He had to stop work, but\npointed out to city officials that they had hired Ghiberti, who should\nhave been able to continue the work on his own. Soon it became clear\nthat Ghiberti was useless and the officials came begging to\n\n\nBrunelleschi. He ignored mem, insisting that Ghiberti should finish the\nproject, until finally they realized the problem: They fired Ghiberti.\n\nBy some miracle, Brunelleschi recovered within days. He did not\nhave to throw a tantrum or make a fool of himself; he simply practiced\nthe art of \u201cmaking others come to you.\u201d\n\nIf on one occasion you make it a point of dignity that others must\ncome to you and you succeed, they will continue to do so even after\nyou stop trying.\n\nImage: The Honeyed Bear Trap.

The city\nwas full of gaiety and die balls were die most splendid in memory.\nHovering over die proceedings, however, was die shadow of Napoleon\nhimself. Instead of being executed or exiled far away, he had been sent\nto die island of Elba, not far from die coast of Italy.\n\nEven imprisoned on an island, a man as bold and creative as\nNapoleon Bonaparte made everyone nervous. The Austrians plotted to\nkill him on Elba, but decided it was too risky. Alexander I, Russia's\ntemperamental czar, heightened die anxiety by dirowing a fit during\nthe congress when a part of Poland was denied him: \u201cBeware, I shall\nloose die monster!\u201d he mreatened. Everyone knew he meant Napoleon.\nOf all die statesmen gadiered in Vienna, only Talleyrand, Napoleon's\nformer foreign minister, seemed calm and unconcerned. It was as if he\nknew somediing the odiers did not.\n\nMeanwhile, on die island of Elba, Napoleon's life was a mockery\nof his previous glory. As Elba's \u201cking,\u201d he had been allowed to form a\ncourt there was a cook, a wardrobe mistress, an official pianist, and a\nhandful of courtiers. All this was designed to humiliate Napoleon, and\nit seemed to work.\n\nThat winter, however, there occurred a series of events so strange\nand dramatic they might have been scripted in a play. Elba was\n\nsurrounded by British ships, dieir cannons covering all possible exit\npoints. Yet somehow, in broad daylight on 26 February 1815, a ship\nwith nine hundred men on board picked up Napoleon and put to sea.\nThe English gave chase but the ship got away. This almost impossible\nescape astonished die public throughout Europe, and terrified die\nstatesmen at the Congress of Vienna.\n\nAkhough it would have been safer to leave Europe, Napoleon not\nonly chose to return to France, he raised die odds by marching on Paris\nwith a tiny army, in hopes of recapturing the throne. His strategy\nworkedpeople of all classes direw themselves at his feet. An army\nunder Marshal Ney sped from Paris to arrest him, but when die\nsoldiers saw dieir beloved former leader, diey changed sides. Napoleon\nwas declared emperor again. Volunteers swelled the ranks of his new\narmy. Delirium swept the country. In Paris, crowds went wild. The\nking who had replaced Napoleon fled the country.\n\nFor die next hundred days, Napoleon ruled France. Soon,\nhowever, the giddiness subsided. France was bankrupt, its resources\nnearly exhausted, and diere was little Napoleon could do about mis. At\ndie Batde of Waterloo, in June of diat year, he was finally defeated for\ngood. This time his enemies had learned dieir lesson: They exiled him\nto the barren island of Saint Helena, off the west coast of Africa. There\nhe had no more hope of escape.\n\nInterpretation\n\nOnly years later did the facts of Napoleon's dramatic escape from\nElba come to light. Before he decided to attempt diis bold move,\nvisitors to his court had told him diat he was more popular in France\nthan ever, and diat\n\nthe country would embrace him again. One of tiiese visitors was\nAustria's General Koller, who convinced Napoleon that if he escaped,\nthe European powers, England included, would welcome him back\ninto power. Napoleon was tipped off that the English would let him go,\nand indeed his escape occurred in the middle of the afternoon, in full\nview of English spyglasses.\n\nWhat Napoleon did not know was that there was a man behind it\nall, pulling the strings, and that this man was his former minister,\nTalleyrand. And Talleyrand was doing all this not to bring back the\nglory days but to crush Napoleon once and for all. Considering the\n\nemperor's ambition unsettling to Europe's stability, he had tumed\nagainst him long ago. When Napoleon was exiled to Elba, Talleyrand\nhad protested. Napoleon should be sent farther away, he argued, or\nEurope would never have peace. But no one listened.\n\nInstead of pushing his opinion, Talleyrand bided his time.\nWorking quiedy, he eventually won over Casdereagh and Metternich,\nthe foreign ministers of England and Austria.\n\nTogether these men baited Napoleon into escaping. Even Roller's\nvisit, to whisper the promise of glory in die exile's ear, was part of the\nplan. Like a master cardplayer, Talleyrand figured eveiything out in\nadvance. He knew Napoleon would fall into the trap he had set. He\nalso foresaw that Napoleon would lead the country into a war, which,\ngiven France's weakened condition, could only last a few mondis. One\ndiplomat in Vienna, who understood that Talleyrand was behind it all,\nsaid, \u201cHe has set the house ablaze in order to save it from the plague.\u201d\n\nWhen I have laid bait for deer,\n\nI don't shoot at the first doe that comes to sniff,\n\nbut wait until the whole herd has gathered round.\n\nOtto von Bismarck, 1815-1898\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nHow many times has this scenario played itself out in history: An\naggressive leader initiates a series of bold moves mat begin by\nbringing him much power. Slowly, however, his power reaches a peak,\nand soon everything turns against him. His numerous enemies band\ntogether; trying to maintain his power, he exhausts himself going in\nthis direction and that, and inevitably he collapses. The reason for this\npattern is that the aggressive person is rarely in full control. He cannot\nsee more than a couple of moves ahead, cannot see the consequences\nof diis bold move or that one. Because he is constantiy being forced to\nreact to the moves of his evergrowing host of enemies, and to the\nunforeseen consequences of his own rash actions, his aggressive\nenergy is turned against him.\n\nIn the realm of power, you must ask yourself, what is the point of\nchasing here and mere, trying to solve problems and defeat my\nenemies, if I never feel in control Why am I always having to react to\nevents instead of directing them The answer is simple: Your idea of\npower is wrong. You\n\nhave mistaken aggressive action for effective action. And most\noften the most effective action is to stay back, keep calm, and let\nothers be frustrated by the traps you lay for them, playing for long-\nterm power rather than quick victory.\n\nRemember: The essence of power is the ability to keep the\ninitiative, to get others to react to your moves, to keep your opponent\nand those around you on the defensive.

They worked on the sultan\ndav in and day out until he loo came to distrust the innocent vizier and\nfinally ordered the man who had served him so well to he put to death.\nIn this realm, those condemned to death were tied up and thrown into\nthe pen where the sultan kept his fiercest hunting dogs. The dogs\nwould promptly tear the victim to pieces. Before being thrown to the\ndogs, however, the vizier asked for one last request. \u201cI would like ten\ndays' respite,\u201dhe said, \u201cso that I can pay tnv debts, collect any monev\ndue to me, return items that people have put in my care, and share out\nmy goods among the mendiers of tnv family and mv children and\nappoint a guardian for them. \u201d After receiving a guar antee that the\nvizier would not try to escape, the sultan granted this request. The\nvizier hurried home, collected one hundred gold pieces, then paid a\nvisit to the huntsman who looked after the sultan \\s\n\nTRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW,\n\nIn 131 B.C., the Roman consul Publius Crassus Dives Mucianus,\nlaying siege to the Greek town of Pergamus, found himself in need of a\nbattering ram to force through the town's walls. He had seen a couple\nof hefty ship's masts in a shipyard in Athens a few days before, and he\n\nordered that the larger of these be sent to him immediately. The\nmilitary engineer in Athens who received the order felt certain that the\nconsul really wanted the smaller of the masts. He argued endlessly\nwith the soldiers who delivered the request: The smaller mast, he told\nthem, was much better suited to the task. And indeed it would be easier\nto transport.\n\nThe soldiers warned the engineer that their master was not a man\nto argue with, but he insisted that the smaller mast would be the only\none that would work with a machine that he was constructing to go\nwith it. He drew diagram after diagram, and went so far as to say that\nhe was the expert and they had no clue what they were talking about.\nThe soldiers knew their leader and at last convinced the engineer that it\nwould be better to swallow his expertise and obey.\n\nAfter they left, though, the engineer thought about it some more.\nWhat was the point, he asked himself, in obeying an order that would\nlead to failure And so he sent the smaller mast, confident that the\nconsul would see how much more effective it was and reward him\njusdy.\n\nWhen the smaller mast arrived, Mucianus asked his soldiers for\nan explanation. They described to him how the engineer had argued\nendlessly for the smaller mast, but had finally promised to send the\nlarger one. Mucianus went into a rage. He could not concentrate on the\nsiege, or consider the importance of breaching the walls before the\ntown received reinforcements. All he could think about was the\nimpudent engineer, whom he ordered to be brought to him\nimmediately.\n\nArriving a few days later, the engineer gladly explained to the\nconsul, one more time, the reasons for the smaller mast. He went on\nand on, using me same arguments he had made with the soldiers. He\nsaid it was wise to listen to experts in these matters, and if the attack\nwas only tried with the battering ram he had sent, die consul would not\nregret it. Mucianus let him finish, then had him stripped naked before\nthe soldiers and flogged and scourged with rods until he died.\n\nInterpretation\n\nThe engineer, whose name has not been recorded by history, had\nspent his life designing masts and pillars, and was respected as the\nfinest engineer in a city that had excelled in the science. He knew that\n\nhe was right. A smaller ram would allow more speed and carry more\nforce. Larger is not necessarily better. Of course the consul would see\nhis logic, and would eventually understand that science is neutral and\nreason superior. How could the consul possibly persist in his ignorance\nif the engineer showed him detailed diagrams and explained the\ntheories behind his advice\n\nThe military engineer was the quintessence of die Arguer, a type\nfound everywhere among us. The Arguer does not understand that\nwords\n\nare never neutral, and that by arguing with a superior he impugns\nthe intelligence of one more powerful than he. He also has no\nawareness of the person he is dealing with. Since each man believes\nthat he is right, and words will rarely convince him otherwise, the\narguer's reasoning falls on deaf ears. When comered, he only argues\nmore, digging his own grave. Once he has made the other person feel\ninsecure and inferior in his beliefs, the eloquence of Socrates could not\nsave the situation.\n\nIt is not simply a question of avoiding an argument with those\nwho stand above you. We all believe we are masters in the realm of\nopinions and reasoning.

Michelangelo traveled to Florence,\nexamined die stone, and came to the conclusion mat he could in fact\n\ncarve a fine figure from it, by adapting the pose to the way the rock\nhad been mutilated. Soderini argued that this was a waste of\ntimenobody could salvage such a disasterbut he finally agreed to let\nthe artist work on it. Michelangelo decided he would depict a young\nDavid, sling in hand.\n\nWeeks later, as Michelangelo was putting the final touches on the\nstatue, Soderini entered the studio. Fancying himself a bit of a\nconnoisseur, he studied the huge work, and told Michelangelo that\nwhile he thought it was magnificent, die nose, he judged, was too big.\nMichelangelo realized that Soderini was standing in a place right under\nthe giant figure and did not have the proper perspective.

The problem in trying to prove\na point or gain a victory through argument is mat in the end you can\nnever be certain how it affects the people you're arguing with: They\nmay appear to agree with you politely, but inside they may resent you.\nOr perhaps something you said inadvertently even offended\nthemwords have that insidious ability to be interpreted according to the\nother person's mood and insecurities. Even the best argument has no\nsolid foundation, for we have all come to distrust the slippery nature of\nwords. And days after agreeing with someone, we often revert to our\nold opinion out of sheer habit.\n\nUnderstand this: Words are a dime a dozen. Everyone knows that\nin the heat of an argument, we will all say anything to support our\ncause. We will quote the Bible, refer to unverifiable statistics. Who can\nbe persuaded by bags of air like that Action and demonstration are\nmuch more powerful and meaningful. They are there, before our eyes,\nfor us to see\u201cYes, now the statue's nose does look just right.\u201d There are\nno offensive words, no possibility of misinterpretation. No one can\nargue with a demonstrated proof. As Baltasar Gracian remarks, \u201cThe\ntruth is generally seen, rarely heard.\u201d\n\nSir Christopher Wren was England's version of the Renaissance\nman. He had mastered the sciences of mathematics, astronomy,\nphysics, and physiology. Yet during his extremely long career as\nEngland's most celebrated architect he was often told by his patrons to\nmake impractical changes in his designs. Never once did he argue or\noffend. He had other ways of proving his point.\n\nIn 1688 Wren designed a magnificent town hall for the city of\nWestminster. The mayor, however, was not satisfied; in fact he was\nnervous. He told Wren he was afraid the second floor was not secure,\nand that it could all come crashing down on his office on the first floor.\nHe demanded that Wren add two stone columns for extra support.\nWren, the consummate engineer, knew that these columns would serve\nno purpose, and that the\n\nmayor's fears were baseless. But build them he did, and the mayor\nwas grateful. It was only years later that workmen on a high scaffold\nsaw that the columns stopped just short of the ceiling.\n\n\nThey were dummies. But both men got what they wanted: The\nmayor could relax, and Wren knew posterity would understand that his\noriginal design worked and the columns were unnecessary.\n\nThe power of demonstrating your idea is that your opponents do\nnot get defensive, and are therefore more open to persuasion. Making\nthem literally and physically feel your meaning is infinitely more\npowerful than argument.\n\nA heckler once interrupted Nikita Khrushchev in the middle of a\nspeech in which he was denouncing the crimes of Stalin. \u201cYou were a\ncolleague of Stalin's,\u201d the heckler yelled, \u201cwhy didn't you stop him\nthen\u201d Khrushschev apparently could not see the heckler and barked\nout, \u201cWho said that\u201d No hand went up. No one moved a muscle. After\na few seconds of tense silence, Khrushchev finally said in a quiet\nvoice, \u201cNow you know why I didn't stop him.\u201d Instead of just arguing\nthat anyone facing Stalin was afraid, knowing that the slightest sign of\nrebellion would mean certain death, he had made them feel what it was\nlike to face Stalinhad made them feel the paranoia, the fear of speaking\nup, the terror of confronting the leader, in this case Khrushchev. The\ndemonstration was visceral and no more argument was necessary.\n\nThe most powerful persuasion goes beyond action into symbol.\nThe power of a symbola flag, a mythic story, a monument to some\nemotional eventis that everyone understands you without anything\nbeing said. In 1975, when Henry Kissinger was engaged in some\nfrustrating negotiations with the Israelis over the return of part of the\nSinai desert that they had seized in the 1967 war, he suddenly broke\noff a tense meeting and decided to do some sight-seeing. He paid a\nvisit to the ruins of the ancient fortress of Masada, known to all Israelis\nas the place where seven hundred Jewish warriors committed mass\nsuicide in A.D. 73 rather than give in to the Roman troops besieging\nthem. The Israelis instantly understood the message of Kissinger's\nvisit! He was indirecdy accusing them of courting mass suicide.\nAlthough the visit did not by itself change their minds, it made them\nthink far more seriously than any direct warning would have. Symbols\nlike this one carry great emotional significance.\n\nWhen aiming for power, or trying to conserve it, always look for\nthe indirect route. And also choose your batdes carefully. If it does not\nmatter in the long run whemer the other person agrees with youor if\n\n\ntime and their own experience will make them understand what you\nmeanthen it is best not even to bother with a demonstration. Save your\nenergy and walk away.\n\nhonor and respect to him, too.

The old man stopped outside Abraham's\ndoor and said to him, \u201cOh Abraham, I would like something to eat.\u201d\nAbraham was amazed to hear him say this. \u201cDie,\u201d exclaimed\nAbraham. \u201cIt would be better for you than to go on living in that\ncondition.\u201d Abraham always kept food ready at his home for passing\nguests. So he gave the old man a bow! containing broth and meat with\nbread crumbs. The old man sat down to eat. He swallowed laboriously,\nwith great effort, and once when he took some food it dropped from\nhis hand, scattering on the ground. \u201cOh Abraham,\u201d he said,\n\n\u201chelp me to eat.\u201dAbraham took the food in his hand and lifted it\nto the old man's lips. But it slid down his beard and over his chest.\n\u201cWhat i.s your age, old man\u201d asked Abraham. The old man mentioned\na number of years slightly greater than Abraham '.v old age. Then\nAbraham exclaimed: \u201cOh Lord Our God, take me unto You before I\nreach this man Is age and .sink into the same condition as he is in now.\n\u201d No sooner had Abraham spoken those words than God took\npossession of his soul.\n\nTHE SUBTLH RUSE:\n\nTHE HOOK OK ARABIC\n\nWISDOM AND GUILE,\n\nTHIRTEENTH CENTURY\n\nImage: The Seesaw.

(Benjamin Disraeli, 1804-1881)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nVerbal argument has one vital use in the realm of power: To\ndistract and cover your tracks when you are practicing deception or are\ncaught in a lie. In such cases it is to your advantage to argue with all\nthe conviction you can muster. Draw the other person into an argument\nto distract them from your deceptive move. When caught in a lie, the\nmore emotional and certain you appear, the less likely it seems that\nyou are lying.\n\nThis technique has saved the hide of many a con artist. Once\nCount Victor Lustig, swindler par excellence, had sold dozens of\nsuckers around the country a phony box with which he claimed to be\nable to copy money. Discovering their mistake, the suckers generally\nchose not to go the police, rather than risk the embarrassment of\npublicity. But one Sheriff Richards,\n\nLAW 9\n\nof Remsen County, Oklahoma, was not the kind of man to accept\nbeing conned out of $ 10,000, and one morning he tracked Lustig\ndown to a hotel in Chicago.\n\nLustig heard a knock on the door. When he opened it he was\nlooking down the barrel of a gun. \u201cWhat seems to be the problem\u201d he\ncalmly asked. \u201cYou son of a bitch,\u201d yelled the sheriff, \u201cI'm going to\nkill you. You conned me with that damn box of yours!\u201d Lustig feigned\nconfusion. \u201cYou mean it's not working\u201d he asked. \u201cYou know it's not\nworking,\u201d replied the sheriff. \u201cBut that's impossible,\u201d said Lustig.\n\u201cThere's no way it couldn't be working. Did you operate it properly\u201d \u201cI\ndid exactly what you told me to do,\u201d said the sheriff. \u201cNo, you must\nhave done something wrong,\u201d said Lustig. The argument went in\ncircles. The barrel of the gun was gently lowered.\n\nLustig next went to phase two in the argument tactic: He poured\nout a whole bunch of technical gobbledygook about the box's\noperation, completely beguiling the sheriff, who now appeared less\nsure of himself and argued less forcefully. \u201cLook,\u201d said Lustig, \u201cI'll\ngive you your money back right now. I'll also give you written\ninstructions on how to work the machine and I'll come out to\nOklahoma to make sure it's working properly. There's no way you can\n\nlose on that.\u201d The sheriff reluctandy agreed. To satisfy him totally,\nLustig took out a hundred one-hundred-dollar bills and gave diem to\nhim, telling him to relax and have a fun weekend in Chicago. Calmer\nand a littie confused, the sheriff finally left. Over die next few days\nLustig checked the paper every morning. He finally found what he was\nlooking for: A short article reporting Sheriff Richards's arrest, trial,\nand conviction for passing counterfeit notes. Lustig had won the\nargument; the sheriff never bodiered him again.\n'.

They worked on the sultan\ndav in and day out until he loo came to distrust the innocent vizier and\nfinally ordered the man who had served him so well to he put to death.\nIn this realm, those condemned to death were tied up and thrown into\nthe pen where the sultan kept his fiercest hunting dogs. The dogs\nwould promptly tear the victim to pieces. Before being thrown to the\ndogs, however, the vizier asked for one last request. \u201cI would like ten\ndays' respite,\u201dhe said, \u201cso that I can pay tnv debts, collect any monev\ndue to me, return items that people have put in my care, and share out\nmy goods among the mendiers of tnv family and mv children and\nappoint a guardian for them. \u201d After receiving a guar antee that the\nvizier would not try to escape, the sultan granted this request. The\nvizier hurried home, collected one hundred gold pieces, then paid a\nvisit to the huntsman who looked after the sultan \\s\n\nTRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW,\n\nIn 131 B.C., the Roman consul Publius Crassus Dives Mucianus,\nlaying siege to the Greek town of Pergamus, found himself in need of a\nbattering ram to force through the town's walls. He had seen a couple\nof hefty ship's masts in a shipyard in Athens a few days before, and he\n\nordered that the larger of these be sent to him immediately. The\nmilitary engineer in Athens who received the order felt certain that the\nconsul really wanted the smaller of the masts. He argued endlessly\nwith the soldiers who delivered the request: The smaller mast, he told\nthem, was much better suited to the task. And indeed it would be easier\nto transport.\n\nThe soldiers warned the engineer that their master was not a man\nto argue with, but he insisted that the smaller mast would be the only\none that would work with a machine that he was constructing to go\nwith it. He drew diagram after diagram, and went so far as to say that\nhe was the expert and they had no clue what they were talking about.\nThe soldiers knew their leader and at last convinced the engineer that it\nwould be better to swallow his expertise and obey.\n\nAfter they left, though, the engineer thought about it some more.\nWhat was the point, he asked himself, in obeying an order that would\nlead to failure And so he sent the smaller mast, confident that the\nconsul would see how much more effective it was and reward him\njusdy.\n\nWhen the smaller mast arrived, Mucianus asked his soldiers for\nan explanation. They described to him how the engineer had argued\nendlessly for the smaller mast, but had finally promised to send the\nlarger one. Mucianus went into a rage. He could not concentrate on the\nsiege, or consider the importance of breaching the walls before the\ntown received reinforcements. All he could think about was the\nimpudent engineer, whom he ordered to be brought to him\nimmediately.\n\nArriving a few days later, the engineer gladly explained to the\nconsul, one more time, the reasons for the smaller mast. He went on\nand on, using me same arguments he had made with the soldiers. He\nsaid it was wise to listen to experts in these matters, and if the attack\nwas only tried with the battering ram he had sent, die consul would not\nregret it. Mucianus let him finish, then had him stripped naked before\nthe soldiers and flogged and scourged with rods until he died.\n\nInterpretation\n\nThe engineer, whose name has not been recorded by history, had\nspent his life designing masts and pillars, and was respected as the\nfinest engineer in a city that had excelled in the science. He knew that\n\nhe was right. A smaller ram would allow more speed and carry more\nforce. Larger is not necessarily better. Of course the consul would see\nhis logic, and would eventually understand that science is neutral and\nreason superior. How could the consul possibly persist in his ignorance\nif the engineer showed him detailed diagrams and explained the\ntheories behind his advice\n\nThe military engineer was the quintessence of die Arguer, a type\nfound everywhere among us. The Arguer does not understand that\nwords\n\nare never neutral, and that by arguing with a superior he impugns\nthe intelligence of one more powerful than he. He also has no\nawareness of the person he is dealing with. Since each man believes\nthat he is right, and words will rarely convince him otherwise, the\narguer's reasoning falls on deaf ears. When comered, he only argues\nmore, digging his own grave. Once he has made the other person feel\ninsecure and inferior in his beliefs, the eloquence of Socrates could not\nsave the situation.\n\nIt is not simply a question of avoiding an argument with those\nwho stand above you. We all believe we are masters in the realm of\nopinions and reasoning. You must be careful, then: Learn to\ndemonstrate the correctness of your ideas indirectiy.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nIn 1502, in Florence, Italy, an enormous block of marble stood in\nthe works department of the church of Santa Maria del Fiore.

The\ndemonstration was visceral and no more argument was necessary.\n\nThe most powerful persuasion goes beyond action into symbol.\nThe power of a symbola flag, a mythic story, a monument to some\nemotional eventis that everyone understands you without anything\nbeing said. In 1975, when Henry Kissinger was engaged in some\nfrustrating negotiations with the Israelis over the return of part of the\nSinai desert that they had seized in the 1967 war, he suddenly broke\noff a tense meeting and decided to do some sight-seeing. He paid a\nvisit to the ruins of the ancient fortress of Masada, known to all Israelis\nas the place where seven hundred Jewish warriors committed mass\nsuicide in A.D. 73 rather than give in to the Roman troops besieging\nthem. The Israelis instantly understood the message of Kissinger's\nvisit! He was indirecdy accusing them of courting mass suicide.\nAlthough the visit did not by itself change their minds, it made them\nthink far more seriously than any direct warning would have. Symbols\nlike this one carry great emotional significance.\n\nWhen aiming for power, or trying to conserve it, always look for\nthe indirect route. And also choose your batdes carefully. If it does not\nmatter in the long run whemer the other person agrees with youor if\n\n\ntime and their own experience will make them understand what you\nmeanthen it is best not even to bother with a demonstration.

The old man stopped outside Abraham's\ndoor and said to him, \u201cOh Abraham, I would like something to eat.\u201d\nAbraham was amazed to hear him say this. \u201cDie,\u201d exclaimed\nAbraham. \u201cIt would be better for you than to go on living in that\ncondition.\u201d Abraham always kept food ready at his home for passing\nguests. So he gave the old man a bow! containing broth and meat with\nbread crumbs. The old man sat down to eat. He swallowed laboriously,\nwith great effort, and once when he took some food it dropped from\nhis hand, scattering on the ground. \u201cOh Abraham,\u201d he said,\n\n\u201chelp me to eat.\u201dAbraham took the food in his hand and lifted it\nto the old man's lips. But it slid down his beard and over his chest.\n\u201cWhat i.s your age, old man\u201d asked Abraham. The old man mentioned\na number of years slightly greater than Abraham '.v old age. Then\nAbraham exclaimed: \u201cOh Lord Our God, take me unto You before I\nreach this man Is age and .sink into the same condition as he is in now.\n\u201d No sooner had Abraham spoken those words than God took\npossession of his soul.\n\nTHE SUBTLH RUSE:\n\nTHE HOOK OK ARABIC\n\nWISDOM AND GUILE,\n\nTHIRTEENTH CENTURY\n\nImage: The Seesaw.

(Benjamin Disraeli, 1804-1881)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nVerbal argument has one vital use in the realm of power: To\ndistract and cover your tracks when you are practicing deception or are\ncaught in a lie. In such cases it is to your advantage to argue with all\nthe conviction you can muster. Draw the other person into an argument\nto distract them from your deceptive move. When caught in a lie, the\nmore emotional and certain you appear, the less likely it seems that\nyou are lying.\n\nThis technique has saved the hide of many a con artist. Once\nCount Victor Lustig, swindler par excellence, had sold dozens of\nsuckers around the country a phony box with which he claimed to be\nable to copy money. Discovering their mistake, the suckers generally\nchose not to go the police, rather than risk the embarrassment of\npublicity. But one Sheriff Richards,\n\nLAW 9\n\nof Remsen County, Oklahoma, was not the kind of man to accept\nbeing conned out of $ 10,000, and one morning he tracked Lustig\ndown to a hotel in Chicago.\n\nLustig heard a knock on the door. When he opened it he was\nlooking down the barrel of a gun. \u201cWhat seems to be the problem\u201d he\ncalmly asked. \u201cYou son of a bitch,\u201d yelled the sheriff, \u201cI'm going to\nkill you. You conned me with that damn box of yours!\u201d Lustig feigned\nconfusion. \u201cYou mean it's not working\u201d he asked. \u201cYou know it's not\nworking,\u201d replied the sheriff. \u201cBut that's impossible,\u201d said Lustig.\n\u201cThere's no way it couldn't be working. Did you operate it properly\u201d \u201cI\ndid exactly what you told me to do,\u201d said the sheriff. \u201cNo, you must\nhave done something wrong,\u201d said Lustig. The argument went in\ncircles. The barrel of the gun was gently lowered.\n\nLustig next went to phase two in the argument tactic: He poured\nout a whole bunch of technical gobbledygook about the box's\noperation, completely beguiling the sheriff, who now appeared less\nsure of himself and argued less forcefully. \u201cLook,\u201d said Lustig, \u201cI'll\ngive you your money back right now. I'll also give you written\ninstructions on how to work the machine and I'll come out to\nOklahoma to make sure it's working properly. There's no way you can\n\nlose on that.\u201d The sheriff reluctandy agreed. To satisfy him totally,\nLustig took out a hundred one-hundred-dollar bills and gave diem to\nhim, telling him to relax and have a fun weekend in Chicago. Calmer\nand a littie confused, the sheriff finally left. Over die next few days\nLustig checked the paper every morning. He finally found what he was\nlooking for: A short article reporting Sheriff Richards's arrest, trial,\nand conviction for passing counterfeit notes. Lustig had won the\nargument; the sheriff never bodiered him again.\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Below is an excerpt from my book titled '48 Laws of Power', specifically from Chapter '48 Laws of Power', Section 'LAW 10'. The original text is: 'INFECTION: AVOID THE UNHAPPY AND UNLUCKY\n\nJUDGMENT\n\nYou can die from someone else's miseryemotional states are as\ninfectious as diseases. You may feel you are helping the drowning man\nbut you are only precipitating your own disaster. The unfortunate\nsometimes draw misfortune on themselves; they will also draw it on\nyou. Associate with the happy and fortunate instead.\n\nTRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW\n\nBorn in Limerick, Ireland, in 1818, Marie Gilbert came to Paris in\nthe\n\n1840s to make her fortune as a dancer and performer. Taking the\nname\n\nLola Montez (her mother was of distant Spanish descent), she\nclaimed to\n\nbe a flamenco dancer from Spain. By 1845 her career was\nlanguishing, and\n\nto survive she became a courtesanquickly one of the more\nsuccessful in\n\nParis.\n\nOnly one man could salvage Lola's dancing career: Alexandre\nDujarier, owner of die newspaper with the largest circulation in\nFrance, and also the newspaper's drama critic. She decided to woo and\nconquer him. Investigating his habits, she discovered mat he went\nriding every morning. An excellent horsewoman herself, she rode out\none morning and \u201caccidentally\u201d ran into him. Soon they were riding\ntogether every day. A few weeks later Lola moved into his apartment.\n\nFor a while the two were happy together. With Dujarier's help,\nLola began to revive her dancing career. Despite the risk to his social\nstanding, Dujarier told friends he would marry her in the spring. (Lola\nhad never told him mat she had eloped at age nineteen with an\n\nEnglishman, and was still legally married.) Although Dujarier was\ndeeply in love, his life started to slide downhill.\n\nHis fortunes in business changed and influential friends began to\navoid him. One night Dujarier was invited to a party, attended by some\nof the wealthiest young men in Paris. Lola wanted to go too but he\nwould not allow it. They had their first quarrel, and Dujarier attended\nthe party by himself. There, hopelessly drunk, he insulted an\ninfluential drama critic, Jean-Baptiste Rosemond de Beauvallon,\nperhaps because of something the critic had said about Lola. The\nfollowing morning Beauvallon challenged him to a duel. Beauvallon\nwas one of the best pistol shots in France. Dujarier tried to apologize,\nbut the duel took place, and he was shot and killed. Thus ended the life\nof one of the most promising young men of Paris society. Devastated,\nLola left Paris.\n\nIn 1846 Lola Montez found herself in Munich, where she decided\nto woo and conquer King Ludwig of Bavaria. The best way to Ludwig,\nshe discovered, was through his aide-de-camp, Count Otto von\nRechberg, a man with a fondness for pretty girls. One day when the\ncount was breakfasting at an outdoor cafe, Lola rode by on her horse,\nwas \u201caccidentally\u201d thrown from the saddle, and landed at Rechberg's\nfeet. The count rushed to help her and was enchanted. He promised to\nintroduce her to Ludwig.\n\nRechberg arranged an audience with die king for Lola, but when\nshe arrived in the anteroom, she could hear the king saying he was too\nbusy to meet a favor-seeking stranger. Lola pushed aside the sentries\nand entered his room anyway. In the process, die front of her dress\nsomehow got torn (perhaps by her, perhaps by one of the sentries), and\nto the astonishment of all, most especially the king, her bare breasts\nwere brazenly exposed. Lola was granted her audience widi Ludwig.\nFifty-five hours later she made her debut on the Bavarian stage; the\nreviews were terrible, but that did not stop Ludwig from arranging\nmore performances.\n\nA mil found itself carried by a crow to the top of a tall campanile,\nand by falling into a crevice succeeded in escaping its dread fate. It\nthen besought the wall to shelter it, by appealing to it by the grace of\nGod, and praising its height, and the beauty and noble tone of its bells.\n\u201cAlas,\u201d it went on, \u201cas I have not been able to drop beneath the green\n\nbranches of my old Father and to lie in the fallow earth covered bv his\nfallen leaves, do you, at least, not abandon me. When 1 found myself\nin the beak of the cruel crow 1 made a vow, that if I escaped I would\nend my life in a little hole. \u201d At these words, the wall, moved with\ncompassion, was content to shelter the nut in the spot where it had\nfallen. Within a short time, the nut burst open: Its roots reached in\nbetween the crevices of the stones and began to push them apart; its-\nshoots pressed up toward the sky. Thev soon rose above the building,\nand as the twisted roots grew thicker they began to thrust the walls\napart and force the ancient stones from their old places. Then the wall,\nloo late and in vain, bewailed the cause of its destruction, and in short\ntime it fell in ruin.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci. 1452-1519\n\nIll Itis own time Simon Thomas was a great doctor. I remember\nthat I happened to meet him one day at the home of a rich old\nconsumptive: He told his patient when discussing ways to cure him\nthat one means was to provide occasions for me to enjoy his company:\nHe could then fix his eves on the freshness of my countenance and his\nthoughts on the overflowing cheerfulness and vigor of my young\nmanhood; by filling all his senses with the flower of my youth his\ncondition might improve. He forgot to add that mine might get worse.\n\nMONTAIGNF,\n\n1533-1592\n\nMany things are said to be infectious. Sleepiness can be\ninfectious, and yawning as well. In large-scale strategy. when the\nenemy is agitated and shows an inclination to rush, do not mind in the\nleast. Make a show of complete calmness, and the enemy will be taken\nby this and will become relaxed. You infect their spirit. You can infect\nthem with a carefree, drunklike spirit, with boredom, or even\nweakness.\n\nLudwig was, in his own words, \u201cbewitched\u201d by Lola. He started\nto appear in public with her on his arm, and then he bought and\nfurnished an apartment for her on one of Munich's most fashionable\nboulevards. Although he had been known as a miser, and was not\ngiven to flights of fancy, he started to shower Lola with gifts and to\nwrite poetry for her. Now his favored mistress, she catapulted to fame\nand fortune overnight.\n\nLola began to lose her sense of proportion. One day when she was\nout riding, an elderly man rode ahead of her, a bit too slowly for her\nliking. Unable to pass him, she began to slash him with her riding\ncrop. On another occasion she took her dog, unleashed, out for a stroll.\nThe dog attacked a passerby, but instead of helping the man get the\ndog away, she whipped him with the leash. Incidents like this\ninfuriated the stolid citizens of Bavaria, but Ludwig stood by Lola and\neven had her naturalized as a Bavarian citizen. The king's entourage\ntried to wake him to the dangers of the affair, but those who criticized\nLola were summarily fired.\n\nWhile Bavarians who had loved their king now outwardly\ndisrespected him, Lola was made a countess, had a new palace built\nfor herself, and began to dabble in politics, advising Ludwig on policy.\nShe was the most powerful force in the kingdom. Her influence in the\nking's cabinet continued to grow, and she treated the other ministers\nwith disdain. As a result, riots broke out throughout the realm. A once\npeaceful land was virtually in the grip of civil war, and students\neverywhere were chanting, \u201cRaus mit Lola!\u201d\n\nBy February of 1848, Ludwig was finally unable to withstand the\npressure. With great sadness he ordered Lola to leave Bavaria\nimmediately. She left, but not until she was paid off. For the next five\nweeks the Bavarians' wrath was turned against their formerly beloved\nking. In March of that year he was forced to abdicate.\n\nLola Montez moved to England. More than anything she needed\nrespectability, and despite being married (she still had not arranged a\ndivorce from the Englishman she had wed years before), she set her\nsights on George Trafford Heald, a promising young army officer who\nwas the son of an influential barrister. Although he was ten years\nyounger than Lola, and could have chosen a wife among the prettiest\nand wealthiest young girls of English society, Heald fell under her\nspell. They were married in 1849. Soon arrested on the charge of\nbigamy, she skipped bail, and she and Heald made their way to Spain.\nThey quarreled horribly and on one occasion Lola slashed him with a\nknife. Finally, she drove him away. Returning to England, he found he\nhad lost his position in the army. Ostracized from English society, he\nmoved to Portugal, where he lived in poverty. After a few months his\nshort life ended in a boating accident.\n\nA few years later the man who published Lola Montez's\nautobiography went bankrupt\n\nIn 1853 Lola moved to California, where she met and married a\nman named Pat Hull. Their relationship was as stormy as all the others,\nand she left Hull for another man. He took to drink and fell into a deep\ndepression that lasted until he died, four years later, still a relatively\nyoung man.\n\nAt the age of forty-one, Lola gave away her clothes and finery\nand turned to God. She toured America, lecturing on religious topics,\ndressed in white and wearing a halolike white headgear. She died two\nyears later, in 1861.\n\nInterpretation\n\nLola Montez attracted men witii her wiles, but her power over\nthem went beyond the sexual. It was through the force of her character\ntiiat she kept her lovers enthralled. Men were sucked into the\nmaelstrom she churned up around her. They felt confused, upset, but\ndie strength of the emotions she stirred also made diem feel more\nalive.\n\nAs is often the case widi infection, die problems would only arise\nover time. Lola's inherent instability would begin to get under her\nlovers' skin. They would find diemselves drawn into her problems, but\ndieir emotional attachment to her would make diem want to help her.\nThis was the crucial point of die diseasefor Lola Montez could not be\nhelped. Her problems were too deep. Once die lover identified widi\ndiem, he was lost. He would find himself embroiled in quarrels. The\ninfection would spread to his family and friends, or, in die case of\nLudwig, to an entire nation. The only solution would be to cut her off,\nor suffer an eventual collapse.\n\nThe infecting-character type is not restricted to women; it has\nnotiiing to do with gender. It stems from an inward instability tiiat\nradiates outward, drawing disaster upon itself. There is almost a desire\nto destroy and unsettle. You could spend a lifetime studying die\npathology of infecting characters, but don't waste your time-just learn\ndie lesson. When you suspect you are in die presence of an infector,\ndon't argue, don't try to help, don't pass die person on to your friends,\nor you will become enmeshed. Flee die infector's presence or suffer the\nconsequences.\n\nRegard no foolish man as cultured, though you may reckon a\ngifted man as wise; and esteem no ignorant abstainer a true ascetic. Do\nnot consort with fools, especially those who consider themselves wise.\nAnd be not self-satisfied with your own ignorance. Let your\nintercourse be only with men of good repute; for it is by such\nassociation that men themselves attain to good repute. Do you not\nobserve how .sesame-oil is mingled with roses or violets and how,\nwhen it has been for some time in association with roses or violets, it\nceases to be sesame-oil and is called oil of roses or oil of violets\n\na mirror for princks, Kai Ka'us Ibn\n\nYond Cassius has a lean and hungry look. He thinks too much. . .\n\nI do not know the man I should avoid so soon as that spare\nCassius... .\n\nSuch men as he be never at heart's ease whiles they behold a\ngreater\n\nthan themselves, and therefore are they very dangerous.\n\nJulius Caesar, William, Shakespeare, 1564-1616\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nThose misfortunates among us who have been brought down by\ncircumstances beyond their control deserve all die help and sympathy\nwe can give diem. But diere are otiiers who are not born to misfortune\nor unhappi-ness, but who draw it upon diemselves by tiieir destructive\nactions and un-setding effect on odiers. It would be a great tiling if we\ncould raise diem up, change tiieir patterns, but more often tiian not it is\ntheir patterns tiiat end up getting inside and changing us. The reason is\nsimplehumans are extremely susceptible to the moods, emotions, and\neven the ways of thinking of tiiose with whom tiiey spend tiieir time.\n\nThe incurably unhappy and unstable have a particularly strong\ninfect-\n\ning power because their characters and emotions are so intense.\nThey often present themselves as victims, making it difficult, at first,\nto see their miseries as self-inflicted. Before you realize the real nature\nof their problems you have been infected by them.\n\nUnderstand this: In the game of power, the people you associate\nwith are critical. The risk of associating with infectors is that you will\nwaste valuable time and energy trying to free yourself. Through a kind\n\nof guilt by association, you will also suffer in the eyes of others. Never\nunderestimate the dangers of infection.\n\nThere are many kinds of infector to be aware of, but one of the\nmost insidious is the sufferer from chronic dissatisfaction. Cassius, the\nRoman conspirator against Julius Caesar, had the discontent that\ncomes from deep envy. He simply could not endure the presence of\nanyone of greater talent. Probably because Caesar sensed the man's\ninterminable sourness, he passed him up for the position of first\npraetorship, and gave the position to Brutus instead. Cassius brooded\nand brooded, his hatred for Caesar becoming pathological. Brutus\nhimself, a devoted republican, disliked Caesar's dictatorship; had he\nhad the patience to wait, he would have become the first man in Rome\nafter Caesar's death, and could have undone the evil that the leader had\nwrought. But Cassius infected him with his own rancor, bending his\near daily with tales of Caesar's evil. He finally won Brutus over to the\nconspiracy. It was the beginning of a great tragedy. How many\nmisfortunes could have been avoided had Brutus learned to fear the\npower of infection.\n\nThere is only one solution to infection: quarantine. But by the\ntime you recognize the problem it is often too late. A Lola Montez\noverwhelms you with her forceful personality. Cassius intrigues you\nwith his confiding nature and the depth of his feelings. How can you\nprotect yourself against such insidious viruses The answer lies in\njudging people on the effects they have on the world and not on the\nreasons they give for their prob-\n\nImage: A Virus. Unseen, it lems. Infectors can be recognized by\nthe misfortune they draw on them-\n\nenters your pores without selves, their turbulent past, their long\nline of broken relationships, their un-\n\nwarning, spreading silently and stable careers, and the very force\nof their character, which sweeps you up\n\nslowly. Before you are aware of and makes you lose your reason.\nBe forewarned by these signs of an infec-\n\nthe infection, it is deep inside you. tor; learn to see the discontent\nin their eye. Most important of all, do not take pity. Do not enmesh\nyourself in trying to help. The infector will remain unchanged, but you\nwill be unhinged.\n\n\nThe other side of infection is equally valid, and perhaps more\nreadily understood: There are people who attract happiness to\nthemselves by their good cheer, natural buoyancy, and intelligence.\nThey are a source of pleasure, and you must associate with them to\nshare in the prosperity they draw upon themselves.\n\nThis applies to more than good cheer and success: All positive\nqualities can infect us. Talleyrand had many strange and intimidating\ntraits, but most agreed that he surpassed all Frenchmen in\ngraciousness, aristocratic charm, and wit. Indeed he came from one of\nthe oldest noble families in the country, and despite his belief in\ndemocracy and the French Republic, he retained his courtly manners.\nHis contemporary Napoleon was in many ways the oppositea peasant\nfrom Corsica, taciturn and ungracious, even violent.\n\nThere was no one Napoleon admired more than Talleyrand. He\nenvied his minister's way with people, his wit and his ability to charm\nwomen, and as best he could, he kept Talleyrand around him, hoping\nto soak up the culture he lacked. There is no doubt that Napoleon\nchanged as his rule continued. Many of the rough edges were\nsmoothed by his constant association with Talleyrand.\n\nUse the positive side of this emotional osmosis to advantage. If,\nfor example, you are miserly by nature, you will never go beyond a\ncertain limit; only generous souls attain greatness. Associate with the\ngenerous, then, and they will infect you, opening up everything that is\ntight and restricted in you. If you are gloomy, gravitate to the cheerful.\nIf you are prone to isolation, force yourself to befriend the gregarious.\nNever associate with those who share your defectsthey will reinforce\neverything that holds you back. Only create associations with positive\naffinities. Make this a rule of life and you will benefit more than from\nall the therapy in the world.\n\nAuthority: Recognize the fortunate so that you may choose their\ncompany, and the unfortunate so that you may avoid them. Misfortune\nis usually the crime of folly, and among those who suffer from it there\nis no malady more contagious: Never open your door to the least of\nmisfortunes, for, if you do, many others will follow in its train... . Do\nnot die of another's misery. (Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nThis law admits of no reversal. Its application is universal.

He started\nto appear in public with her on his arm, and then he bought and\nfurnished an apartment for her on one of Munich's most fashionable\nboulevards. Although he had been known as a miser, and was not\ngiven to flights of fancy, he started to shower Lola with gifts and to\nwrite poetry for her. Now his favored mistress, she catapulted to fame\nand fortune overnight.\n\nLola began to lose her sense of proportion. One day when she was\nout riding, an elderly man rode ahead of her, a bit too slowly for her\nliking. Unable to pass him, she began to slash him with her riding\ncrop. On another occasion she took her dog, unleashed, out for a stroll.\nThe dog attacked a passerby, but instead of helping the man get the\ndog away, she whipped him with the leash. Incidents like this\ninfuriated the stolid citizens of Bavaria, but Ludwig stood by Lola and\neven had her naturalized as a Bavarian citizen. The king's entourage\ntried to wake him to the dangers of the affair, but those who criticized\nLola were summarily fired.\n\nWhile Bavarians who had loved their king now outwardly\ndisrespected him, Lola was made a countess, had a new palace built\nfor herself, and began to dabble in politics, advising Ludwig on policy.\nShe was the most powerful force in the kingdom. Her influence in the\nking's cabinet continued to grow, and she treated the other ministers\nwith disdain. As a result, riots broke out throughout the realm. A once\npeaceful land was virtually in the grip of civil war, and students\neverywhere were chanting, \u201cRaus mit Lola!\u201d\n\nBy February of 1848, Ludwig was finally unable to withstand the\npressure. With great sadness he ordered Lola to leave Bavaria\nimmediately. She left, but not until she was paid off. For the next five\nweeks the Bavarians' wrath was turned against their formerly beloved\nking. In March of that year he was forced to abdicate.\n\nLola Montez moved to England. More than anything she needed\nrespectability, and despite being married (she still had not arranged a\ndivorce from the Englishman she had wed years before), she set her\nsights on George Trafford Heald, a promising young army officer who\nwas the son of an influential barrister. Although he was ten years\nyounger than Lola, and could have chosen a wife among the prettiest\nand wealthiest young girls of English society, Heald fell under her\nspell. They were married in 1849. Soon arrested on the charge of\nbigamy, she skipped bail, and she and Heald made their way to Spain.\nThey quarreled horribly and on one occasion Lola slashed him with a\nknife. Finally, she drove him away. Returning to England, he found he\nhad lost his position in the army. Ostracized from English society, he\nmoved to Portugal, where he lived in poverty. After a few months his\nshort life ended in a boating accident.\n\nA few years later the man who published Lola Montez's\nautobiography went bankrupt\n\nIn 1853 Lola moved to California, where she met and married a\nman named Pat Hull. Their relationship was as stormy as all the others,\nand she left Hull for another man. He took to drink and fell into a deep\ndepression that lasted until he died, four years later, still a relatively\nyoung man.\n\nAt the age of forty-one, Lola gave away her clothes and finery\nand turned to God. She toured America, lecturing on religious topics,\ndressed in white and wearing a halolike white headgear. She died two\nyears later, in 1861.\n\nInterpretation\n\nLola Montez attracted men witii her wiles, but her power over\nthem went beyond the sexual. It was through the force of her character\ntiiat she kept her lovers enthralled. Men were sucked into the\nmaelstrom she churned up around her. They felt confused, upset, but\ndie strength of the emotions she stirred also made diem feel more\nalive.\n\nAs is often the case widi infection, die problems would only arise\nover time. Lola's inherent instability would begin to get under her\nlovers' skin. They would find diemselves drawn into her problems, but\ndieir emotional attachment to her would make diem want to help her.\nThis was the crucial point of die diseasefor Lola Montez could not be\nhelped. Her problems were too deep. Once die lover identified widi\ndiem, he was lost. He would find himself embroiled in quarrels. The\ninfection would spread to his family and friends, or, in die case of\nLudwig, to an entire nation. The only solution would be to cut her off,\nor suffer an eventual collapse.\n\nThe infecting-character type is not restricted to women; it has\nnotiiing to do with gender. It stems from an inward instability tiiat\nradiates outward, drawing disaster upon itself. There is almost a desire\nto destroy and unsettle. You could spend a lifetime studying die\npathology of infecting characters, but don't waste your time-just learn\ndie lesson. When you suspect you are in die presence of an infector,\ndon't argue, don't try to help, don't pass die person on to your friends,\nor you will become enmeshed. Flee die infector's presence or suffer the\nconsequences.\n\nRegard no foolish man as cultured, though you may reckon a\ngifted man as wise; and esteem no ignorant abstainer a true ascetic. Do\nnot consort with fools, especially those who consider themselves wise.\nAnd be not self-satisfied with your own ignorance. Let your\nintercourse be only with men of good repute; for it is by such\nassociation that men themselves attain to good repute. Do you not\nobserve how .sesame-oil is mingled with roses or violets and how,\nwhen it has been for some time in association with roses or violets, it\nceases to be sesame-oil and is called oil of roses or oil of violets\n\na mirror for princks, Kai Ka'us Ibn\n\nYond Cassius has a lean and hungry look. He thinks too much. . .\n\nI do not know the man I should avoid so soon as that spare\nCassius... .\n\nSuch men as he be never at heart's ease whiles they behold a\ngreater\n\nthan themselves, and therefore are they very dangerous.\n\nJulius Caesar, William, Shakespeare, 1564-1616\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nThose misfortunates among us who have been brought down by\ncircumstances beyond their control deserve all die help and sympathy\nwe can give diem. But diere are otiiers who are not born to misfortune\nor unhappi-ness, but who draw it upon diemselves by tiieir destructive\nactions and un-setding effect on odiers. It would be a great tiling if we\ncould raise diem up, change tiieir patterns, but more often tiian not it is\ntheir patterns tiiat end up getting inside and changing us. The reason is\nsimplehumans are extremely susceptible to the moods, emotions, and\neven the ways of thinking of tiiose with whom tiiey spend tiieir time.\n\nThe incurably unhappy and unstable have a particularly strong\ninfect-\n\ning power because their characters and emotions are so intense.\nThey often present themselves as victims, making it difficult, at first,\nto see their miseries as self-inflicted. Before you realize the real nature\nof their problems you have been infected by them.\n\nUnderstand this: In the game of power, the people you associate\nwith are critical. The risk of associating with infectors is that you will\nwaste valuable time and energy trying to free yourself. Through a kind\n\nof guilt by association, you will also suffer in the eyes of others. Never\nunderestimate the dangers of infection.\n\nThere are many kinds of infector to be aware of, but one of the\nmost insidious is the sufferer from chronic dissatisfaction. Cassius, the\nRoman conspirator against Julius Caesar, had the discontent that\ncomes from deep envy. He simply could not endure the presence of\nanyone of greater talent. Probably because Caesar sensed the man's\ninterminable sourness, he passed him up for the position of first\npraetorship, and gave the position to Brutus instead. Cassius brooded\nand brooded, his hatred for Caesar becoming pathological. Brutus\nhimself, a devoted republican, disliked Caesar's dictatorship; had he\nhad the patience to wait, he would have become the first man in Rome\nafter Caesar's death, and could have undone the evil that the leader had\nwrought. But Cassius infected him with his own rancor, bending his\near daily with tales of Caesar's evil. He finally won Brutus over to the\nconspiracy. It was the beginning of a great tragedy. How many\nmisfortunes could have been avoided had Brutus learned to fear the\npower of infection.\n\nThere is only one solution to infection: quarantine. But by the\ntime you recognize the problem it is often too late. A Lola Montez\noverwhelms you with her forceful personality. Cassius intrigues you\nwith his confiding nature and the depth of his feelings. How can you\nprotect yourself against such insidious viruses The answer lies in\njudging people on the effects they have on the world and not on the\nreasons they give for their prob-\n\nImage: A Virus. Unseen, it lems. Infectors can be recognized by\nthe misfortune they draw on them-\n\nenters your pores without selves, their turbulent past, their long\nline of broken relationships, their un-\n\nwarning, spreading silently and stable careers, and the very force\nof their character, which sweeps you up\n\nslowly. Before you are aware of and makes you lose your reason.\nBe forewarned by these signs of an infec-\n\nthe infection, it is deep inside you. tor; learn to see the discontent\nin their eye. Most important of all, do not take pity. Do not enmesh\nyourself in trying to help. The infector will remain unchanged, but you\nwill be unhinged.\n\n\nThe other side of infection is equally valid, and perhaps more\nreadily understood: There are people who attract happiness to\nthemselves by their good cheer, natural buoyancy, and intelligence.\nThey are a source of pleasure, and you must associate with them to\nshare in the prosperity they draw upon themselves.\n\nThis applies to more than good cheer and success: All positive\nqualities can infect us. Talleyrand had many strange and intimidating\ntraits, but most agreed that he surpassed all Frenchmen in\ngraciousness, aristocratic charm, and wit. Indeed he came from one of\nthe oldest noble families in the country, and despite his belief in\ndemocracy and the French Republic, he retained his courtly manners.\nHis contemporary Napoleon was in many ways the oppositea peasant\nfrom Corsica, taciturn and ungracious, even violent.\n\nThere was no one Napoleon admired more than Talleyrand. He\nenvied his minister's way with people, his wit and his ability to charm\nwomen, and as best he could, he kept Talleyrand around him, hoping\nto soak up the culture he lacked. There is no doubt that Napoleon\nchanged as his rule continued. Many of the rough edges were\nsmoothed by his constant association with Talleyrand.\n\nUse the positive side of this emotional osmosis to advantage. If,\nfor example, you are miserly by nature, you will never go beyond a\ncertain limit; only generous souls attain greatness. Associate with the\ngenerous, then, and they will infect you, opening up everything that is\ntight and restricted in you. If you are gloomy, gravitate to the cheerful.\nIf you are prone to isolation, force yourself to befriend the gregarious.\nNever associate with those who share your defectsthey will reinforce\neverything that holds you back. Only create associations with positive\naffinities. Make this a rule of life and you will benefit more than from\nall the therapy in the world.\n\nAuthority: Recognize the fortunate so that you may choose their\ncompany, and the unfortunate so that you may avoid them. Misfortune\nis usually the crime of folly, and among those who suffer from it there\nis no malady more contagious: Never open your door to the least of\nmisfortunes, for, if you do, many others will follow in its train... . Do\nnot die of another's misery. (Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nThis law admits of no reversal. Its application is universal. The!\nis nothing to be gained by associating with those who infect you wi\ntheir misery; there is only power and good fortune to be obtained t\nassociating with the fortunate. Ignore this law at your peril.\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Below is an excerpt from my book titled '48 Laws of Power', specifically from Chapter '48 Laws of Power', Section 'LAW 11'. The original text is: 'LEARN TO KEEP PEOPLE DEPENDENT ON YOU\n\nJUDGMENT\n\nTo maintain your independence you must always be needed and\nwanted. The more you are relied on, the more freedom you have. Make\npeople depend on you for their happiness and prosperity and you have\nnothing to fear. Never teach them enough so that they can do without\nyou.\n\nTRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW\n\nSometime in the Middle Ages, a mercenary soldier (a condottiere)\n, whose name has not been recorded, saved the town of Siena from a\nforeign aggressor. How could the good citizens of Siena reward him\nNo amount of money or honor could possibly compare in value to the\npreservation of a city's liberty. The citizens thought of making the\nmercenary the lord of the city, but even that, they decided, wasn't\nrecompense enough. At last one of them stood before the assembly\ncalled to debate this matter and said, \u201cLet us kill him and then worship\nhim as our patron saint.\u201d And so they did.\n\nThe Count of Carmagnola was cue of the bravest and most\nsuccessful of all the condottieri. In 1442, late in his life, he was in the\nemploy of the city of Venice, which was in the midst of a long war\nwith Florence. The count was suddenly recalled to Venice. A favorite\nof the people, he was received there with all kinds of honor and\nsplendor. That evening he was to dine with the doge himself, in the\ndoge's palace. On the way into die palace, however, he noticed diat die\nguard was leading him in a different direction from usual. Crossing the\nfamous Bridge of Sighs, he suddenly realized where they were taking\nhimto die dungeon. He was convicted on a trumped-up charge and the\nnext day in the Piazza San Marco, before a horrified crowd who could\nnot understand how his fate had changed so drastically, he was\nbeheaded.\n\nInterpretation\n\nMany of the great condottieri of Renaissance Italy suffered die\nsame fate as the patron saint of Siena and the Count of Carmagnola:\nThey won batde after battle for their employers only to find themselves\nbanished, imprisoned, or executed. The problem was not ingratitude; it\nwas diat there were so many other condottieri as able and valiant as\ndiey were. They were replaceable. Nodiing was lost by killing diem.\nMeanwhile, the older among them had grown powerful themselves,\nand wanted more and more money for their services. How much better,\nthen, to do away with them and hire a younger, cheaper mercenary.\nThat was the fate of the Count of Carmagnola, who had started to act\nimpudendy and independendy. He had taken his power for granted\nwidiout making sure that he was truly indispensable.\n\nSuch is the fate (to a less violent degree, one hopes) of diose who\ndo not make otiiers dependent on them. Sooner or later someone\ncomes along who can do the job as well as they cansomeone younger,\nfresher, less expensive, less threatening.\n\nBe die only one who can do what you do, and make the fate of\ndiose who hire you so entwined with yours that they cannot possibly\nget rid of you. Otherwise you will someday be forced to cross your\nown Bridge of Sighs.\n\nTwo horses were carrying two loads. The [rout Horse went well,\nbut the rear Horse was lazy. I he men began to pile the rear Horse's\nload on the front Horse; when thev had transferred it all. the rear Horse\nfound it easv going, and he said to the front Horse: \u201cToil and sweat!\nThe more you trv, the more von have to suffer. \u201d When thev reached\nthe tavern, the owner said; \u201cWhv should I fodder two horses when I\ncarry all on one I had better give the one all the food it wants, and cut\nthe throat of the other; at least I shall have the hide. \u201dAnd so he ditl.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nWhen Otto von Bismarck became a deputy in die Prussian\nparliament in\n\n1847, he was thirty-two years old and without an ally or friend.\nLooking\n\nINK CAT THAT WALKK)I) in 11 \\1SI. 1.1\n\nThen the Woman laughed and set the Cat a bowl of the warm\nwhile milk and said, \u201cO Cat, you are as clever as a man, but remember\n\nthat your bargain was not made with the Man or the Dog, and I do not\nknow what they will do when they come home. \u201d \u201cWhat is that to me \u201d\nsaid the Cat. \u201cIf I have my place in the Cave by the fire and my warm\nwhite milk three times a day, I do not care what the Man or the Dog\ncan do.\u201d .. . And from that day to this. Best Beloved, three proper Men\nout of five will always throw things at a Cat whenever they meet him,\nand all proper Dogs will chase him up a tree. But the Cat keeps his\nside of the bargain too. He will kill mice, and he will be kind to Babies\nwhen he is in the house, just as long as they do not pull his tail too\nhard. But when he has done that, and between times, and when the\nmoon gets up and the night comes, he is the Cat that walks by himself,\nand all places are alike to him. Then he goes out to the Wet Wild\nWoods or up the Wet Wild Trees or on the Wet Wild Roofs, waving his\nwild tail and walking by his wild lone.\n\njust so stories,\n\nRudyard Kipling,\n\n1865-1936\n\naround him, he decided that the side to ally himself with was not\nthe parliament's liberals or conservatives, not any particular minister,\nand certainly not the people. It was with the king, Frederick William\nIV. This was an odd choice to say the least, for Frederick was at a low\npoint of his power. A weak, indecisive man, he consistently gave in to\nthe liberals in parliament; in fact he was spineless, and stood for much\nthat Bismarck disliked, personally and politically. Yet Bismarck\ncourted Frederick night and day. When other deputies attacked the\nking for his many inept moves, only Bismarck stood by him.\n\nFinally, it all paid off: In 1851 Bismarck was made a minister in\nthe king's cabinet. Now he went to work. Time and again he forced the\nking's hand, getting him to build up the military, to stand up to the\nliberals, to do exactly as Bismarck wished. He worked on Frederick's\ninsecurity about his manliness, challenging him to be firm and to rule\nwith pride. And he slowly restored the king's powers until die\nmonarchy was once again the most powerful force in Prussia.\n\nWhen Frederick died, in 1861, his brother William assumed the\nthrone. William disliked Bismarck intensely and had no intention of\nkeeping him around. But he also inherited the same situation his\nbrother had: enemies galore, who wanted to nibble his power away. He\n\nactually considered abdicating, feeling he lacked the strength to deal\nwith this dangerous and precarious position. But Bismarck insinuated\nhimself once again. He stood by the new king, gave him strength, and\nurged him into firm and decisive action. The king grew dependent on\nBismarck's strong-arm tactics to keep his enemies at bay, and despite\nhis antipathy toward the man, he soon made him his prime minister.\nThe two quarreled often over policy Bismarck was much more\nconservativebut the king understood his own dependency. Whenever\nthe prime minister threatened to resign, the king gave in to him, time\nafter time. It was in fact Bismarck who set state policy.\n\nYears later, Bismarck's actions as Prussia's prime minister led die\nvarious German state\" to be united into one country. Now Bismarck\nfinagled the king into letting himself be crowned emperor of Germany.\nYet it was really Bismarck who had reached the heights of power. As\nright-hand man to the emperor, and as imperial chancellor and\nknighted prince, he pulled all the levers.\n\nInterpretation\n\nMost young and ambitious politicians looking out on the political\nlandscape of 1840s Germany would have tried to build a power base\namong those with the most power. Bismarck saw different. Joining\nforces with the powerful can be foolish: They will swallow you up,\njust as the doge of Venice swallowed up the Count of Carmagnola. No\none will come to depend on you if they are already strong. If you are\nambitious, it is much wiser to seek out weak rulers or masters with\nwhom you can create a relationship of dependency. You become their\nstrength, their intelligence, their spine. What power you hold! If they\ngot rid of you die whole edifice would collapse.\n\nNecessity rules the world. People rarely act unless compelled to.\nIf you create no need for yourself, then you will be done away widi at\nfirst opportunity. If, on the other hand, you understand the Laws of\nPower and make others depend on you for their welfare, if you can\ncounteract their weakness with your own \u201ciron and blood,\u201d in\nBismarck's phrase, then you will survive your masters as Bismarck\ndid. You will have all the benefits of power without the thorns that\ncome from being a master.\n\nThus a wise prince will think of ways to keep his citizens of every\nsort\n\nand under every circumstance dependent on the state and on him;\n\nand then they will always be trustworthy.\n\nNiccolb Machiavelli, 1469-1527\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nThe ultimate power is the power to get people to do as you wish.\nWhen you can do this without having to force people or hurt them,\nwhen they willingly grant you what you desire, then your power is\nuntouchable. The best way to achieve this position is to create a\nrelationship of dependence. The master requires your services; he is\nweak, or unable to function without you; you have enmeshed yourself\nin his work so deeply that doing away with you would bring him great\ndifficulty, or at least would mean valuable time lost in training another\nto replace you. Once such a relationship is established you have the\nupper hand, the leverage to make the master do as you wish. It is the\nclassic case of the man behind the tbrone, the servant of the king who\nactually controls the king. Bismarck did not have to bully either\nFrederick or William into doing his bidding. He simply made it clear\nthat unless he got what he wanted he would walk away, leaving the\nking to twist in the wind. Both kings soon danced to Bismarck's tune.\n\nDo not be one of the many who mistakenly believe that the\nultimate form of power is independence. Power involves a relationship\nbetween people; you will always need others as allies, pawns, or even\nas weak masters who serve as your front. The completely independent\nman would live in a cabin in the woodshe would have the freedom to\ncome and go as he pleased, but he would have no power. The best you\ncan hope for is that others will grow so dependent on you diat you\nenjoy a kind of reverse independence: Their need for you frees you.\n\nLouis XI (1423-1483), the great Spider King of France, had a\nweakness for astrology. He kept a court astrologer whom he admired,\nuntil one day the man predicted mat a lady of the court would die\nwithin eight days. When the prophecy came true, Louis was terrified,\nthinking that either the man had murdered the woman to prove his\naccuracy or that he was so versed in his science that his powers\nthreatened Louis himself. In either case he had to be killed.\n\nOne evening Louis summoned the astrologer to his room, high in\nthe castle. Before the man arrived, the king told his servants that when\nhe gave\n\nAn extravagant young Vine, vainly ambitious of independence,\nand fond of rambling at large, despised the alliance of a stately elm\nthat grew near, and courted her embraces. Having risen to some small\nheight without any kind of support, she shot forth her flimsy branches\nto a very uncommon and superfluous length; calling on her neighbour\nto take notice how little she wanted his assistance. \u201cPoor infatuated\nshrub, \u201d replied the elm, \u201chow inconsistent is thy conduct! Wouldst\nthou be truly independent, thou shouldst carefully apply those juices to\nthe enlargement of thy stem, which thou lavishest in vain upon\nunnecessary foliage. 1 shortly shall behold thee grovelling on the\nground; yet countenanced. indeed, by many of the human race, who,\nintoxicated with vanity, have despised economy; and who, to support\nfor a moment their empty boast of independence, have exhausted the\nvery source of it in frivolous expenses. \u201d\n\nFABLES,\n\nRobert Dodslhy,\n\n1703-1764\n\nthe signal they were to pick the astrologer up, carry him to the\nwindow, and hurl him to the ground, hundreds of feet below.\n\nThe astrologer soon arrived, but before giving the signal, Louis\ndecided to ask him one last question: \u201cYou claim to understand\nastrology and to know the fate of others, so tell me what your fate will\nbe and how long you have to live.\u201d\n\n\u201cT shall die just three days before Your Majesty,\u201d the astrologer\nreplied. The king's signal was never given. The man's life was spared.\nThe Spider King not only protected his astrologer for as long as he was\nalive, he lavished him with gifts and had him tended by the finest court\ndoctors.\n\nThe astrologer survived Louis by several years, disproving his\npower of prophecy but proving his mastery of power.\n\nThis is the model: Make others dependent on you. To get rid of\nyou might spell disaster, even death, and your master dares not tempt\nfate by finding out. There are many ways to obtain such a position.\nForemost among them is to possess a talent and creative skill that\nsimply cannot be replaced.\n\nDuring the Renaissance, the major obstacle to a painter's success\nwas finding the right patron. Michelangelo did this better man anyone\n\nelse: His patron was Pope Julius II. But he and the pope quarreled over\nthe building of the pope's marble tomb, and Michelangelo left Rome in\ndisgust. To the amazement of those in the pope's circle, not only did\nthe pope not fire him, he sought him out and in his own haughty way\nbegged the artist to stay. Michelangelo, he knew, could find anomer\npatron, but he could never find another Michelangelo.\n\nYou do not have to have the talent of a Michelangelo; you do\n\nhave to have a skill that sets you apart from the crowd. You should\ncreate a situation in which you can always latch on to another master\nor patron but your master cannot easily find another servant with your\nparticular talent. And if, in reality, you are not actually indispensable,\nyou must find a way to make it look as if you are. Having the\nappearance of specialized knowledge and skill gives you leeway in\nyour ability to deceive those above you into thinking they cannot do\nwithout you. Real dependence on your master's part, however, leaves\nhim more vulnerable to you than the faked variety, and it is always\nwithin your power to make your skill indispensable.\nThis is what is meant by the intertwining of fates: Like creeping\nivy, you have wrapped yourself around the source of power, so that it\nwould cause great trauma to cut you away. And you do not necessarily\nhave to entwine yourself around the master; another person will do, as\nlong as he or she too is indispensable in the chain.\n\nOne day Harry Cohn, president of Columbia Pictures, was visited\nin his office by a gloomy group of his executives. It was 1951, when\ndie witchhunt against Communists in Hollywood, carried on by the\nU.S. Congress's House Un-American Activities Committee, was at its\nheight. The executives had bad news: One of their employees, the\nscreenwriter John Howard Lawson, had been singled out as a\nCommunist. They had to get rid of him right away or suffer the wrath\nof me committee.\n\nHarry Cohn was no bleeding-heart liberal; in fact, he had always\nbeen a die-hard Republican.\n\nHis favorite politician was Benito Mussolini, whom he had once\nvisited, and whose framed photo hung on his wall. If there was\nsomeone he hated Cohn would call him a \u201cCommunist bastard.\u201d But to\nthe executives\u2019 amazement Cohn told them he would not fire Lawson.\nHe did not keep the screenwriter on because he was a good writerthere\n\n\nwere many good writers in Hollywood. He kept him because of a chain\nof dependence: Lawson was Humphrey Bogart's writer and Bogart was\nColumbia's star. If Cohn messed with Lawson he would ruin an\nimmensely profitable relationship. That was worth more dian the\nterrible publicity brought to him by his defiance of the committee.\n\nHenry Kissinger managed to survive the many bloodlettings that\nwent on in the Nixon White House not because he was the best\ndiplomat Nixon could findthere were other fine negotiatorsand not\nbecause the two men got along so well: They did not. Nor did they\nshare their beliefs and politics. Kissinger survived because he\nentrenched himself in so many areas of the political structure drat to do\naway with him would lead to chaos. Michelangelo's power was\nintensive, depending on one skill, his ability as an artist; Kissinger's\nwas extensive. He got himself involved in so many aspects and\ndepartments of the administration that his involvement became a card\nin his hand. It also made him many allies. If you can arrange such a\nposition for yourself, getting rid of you becomes dangerousall sorts of\ninterdependencies will unravel.

Never teach them enough so that they can do without\nyou.\n\nTRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW\n\nSometime in the Middle Ages, a mercenary soldier (a condottiere)\n, whose name has not been recorded, saved the town of Siena from a\nforeign aggressor. How could the good citizens of Siena reward him\nNo amount of money or honor could possibly compare in value to the\npreservation of a city's liberty. The citizens thought of making the\nmercenary the lord of the city, but even that, they decided, wasn't\nrecompense enough. At last one of them stood before the assembly\ncalled to debate this matter and said, \u201cLet us kill him and then worship\nhim as our patron saint.\u201d And so they did.\n\nThe Count of Carmagnola was cue of the bravest and most\nsuccessful of all the condottieri. In 1442, late in his life, he was in the\nemploy of the city of Venice, which was in the midst of a long war\nwith Florence. The count was suddenly recalled to Venice. A favorite\nof the people, he was received there with all kinds of honor and\nsplendor. That evening he was to dine with the doge himself, in the\ndoge's palace. On the way into die palace, however, he noticed diat die\nguard was leading him in a different direction from usual. Crossing the\nfamous Bridge of Sighs, he suddenly realized where they were taking\nhimto die dungeon. He was convicted on a trumped-up charge and the\nnext day in the Piazza San Marco, before a horrified crowd who could\nnot understand how his fate had changed so drastically, he was\nbeheaded.\n\nInterpretation\n\nMany of the great condottieri of Renaissance Italy suffered die\nsame fate as the patron saint of Siena and the Count of Carmagnola:\nThey won batde after battle for their employers only to find themselves\nbanished, imprisoned, or executed. The problem was not ingratitude; it\nwas diat there were so many other condottieri as able and valiant as\ndiey were. They were replaceable. Nodiing was lost by killing diem.\nMeanwhile, the older among them had grown powerful themselves,\nand wanted more and more money for their services. How much better,\nthen, to do away with them and hire a younger, cheaper mercenary.\nThat was the fate of the Count of Carmagnola, who had started to act\nimpudendy and independendy. He had taken his power for granted\nwidiout making sure that he was truly indispensable.\n\nSuch is the fate (to a less violent degree, one hopes) of diose who\ndo not make otiiers dependent on them. Sooner or later someone\ncomes along who can do the job as well as they cansomeone younger,\nfresher, less expensive, less threatening.\n\nBe die only one who can do what you do, and make the fate of\ndiose who hire you so entwined with yours that they cannot possibly\nget rid of you. Otherwise you will someday be forced to cross your\nown Bridge of Sighs.\n\nTwo horses were carrying two loads. The [rout Horse went well,\nbut the rear Horse was lazy. I he men began to pile the rear Horse's\nload on the front Horse; when thev had transferred it all. the rear Horse\nfound it easv going, and he said to the front Horse: \u201cToil and sweat!\nThe more you trv, the more von have to suffer. \u201d When thev reached\nthe tavern, the owner said; \u201cWhv should I fodder two horses when I\ncarry all on one I had better give the one all the food it wants, and cut\nthe throat of the other; at least I shall have the hide. \u201dAnd so he ditl.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nWhen Otto von Bismarck became a deputy in die Prussian\nparliament in\n\n1847, he was thirty-two years old and without an ally or friend.\nLooking\n\nINK CAT THAT WALKK)I) in 11 \\1SI. 1.1\n\nThen the Woman laughed and set the Cat a bowl of the warm\nwhile milk and said, \u201cO Cat, you are as clever as a man, but remember\n\nthat your bargain was not made with the Man or the Dog, and I do not\nknow what they will do when they come home. \u201d \u201cWhat is that to me \u201d\nsaid the Cat. \u201cIf I have my place in the Cave by the fire and my warm\nwhite milk three times a day, I do not care what the Man or the Dog\ncan do.\u201d .. . And from that day to this. Best Beloved, three proper Men\nout of five will always throw things at a Cat whenever they meet him,\nand all proper Dogs will chase him up a tree. But the Cat keeps his\nside of the bargain too. He will kill mice, and he will be kind to Babies\nwhen he is in the house, just as long as they do not pull his tail too\nhard. But when he has done that, and between times, and when the\nmoon gets up and the night comes, he is the Cat that walks by himself,\nand all places are alike to him. Then he goes out to the Wet Wild\nWoods or up the Wet Wild Trees or on the Wet Wild Roofs, waving his\nwild tail and walking by his wild lone.\n\njust so stories,\n\nRudyard Kipling,\n\n1865-1936\n\naround him, he decided that the side to ally himself with was not\nthe parliament's liberals or conservatives, not any particular minister,\nand certainly not the people. It was with the king, Frederick William\nIV. This was an odd choice to say the least, for Frederick was at a low\npoint of his power. A weak, indecisive man, he consistently gave in to\nthe liberals in parliament; in fact he was spineless, and stood for much\nthat Bismarck disliked, personally and politically. Yet Bismarck\ncourted Frederick night and day. When other deputies attacked the\nking for his many inept moves, only Bismarck stood by him.\n\nFinally, it all paid off: In 1851 Bismarck was made a minister in\nthe king's cabinet. Now he went to work. Time and again he forced the\nking's hand, getting him to build up the military, to stand up to the\nliberals, to do exactly as Bismarck wished. He worked on Frederick's\ninsecurity about his manliness, challenging him to be firm and to rule\nwith pride. And he slowly restored the king's powers until die\nmonarchy was once again the most powerful force in Prussia.\n\nWhen Frederick died, in 1861, his brother William assumed the\nthrone. William disliked Bismarck intensely and had no intention of\nkeeping him around. But he also inherited the same situation his\nbrother had: enemies galore, who wanted to nibble his power away. He\n\nactually considered abdicating, feeling he lacked the strength to deal\nwith this dangerous and precarious position. But Bismarck insinuated\nhimself once again. He stood by the new king, gave him strength, and\nurged him into firm and decisive action. The king grew dependent on\nBismarck's strong-arm tactics to keep his enemies at bay, and despite\nhis antipathy toward the man, he soon made him his prime minister.\nThe two quarreled often over policy Bismarck was much more\nconservativebut the king understood his own dependency. Whenever\nthe prime minister threatened to resign, the king gave in to him, time\nafter time. It was in fact Bismarck who set state policy.\n\nYears later, Bismarck's actions as Prussia's prime minister led die\nvarious German state\" to be united into one country. Now Bismarck\nfinagled the king into letting himself be crowned emperor of Germany.\nYet it was really Bismarck who had reached the heights of power. As\nright-hand man to the emperor, and as imperial chancellor and\nknighted prince, he pulled all the levers.\n\nInterpretation\n\nMost young and ambitious politicians looking out on the political\nlandscape of 1840s Germany would have tried to build a power base\namong those with the most power. Bismarck saw different. Joining\nforces with the powerful can be foolish: They will swallow you up,\njust as the doge of Venice swallowed up the Count of Carmagnola. No\none will come to depend on you if they are already strong. If you are\nambitious, it is much wiser to seek out weak rulers or masters with\nwhom you can create a relationship of dependency. You become their\nstrength, their intelligence, their spine. What power you hold! If they\ngot rid of you die whole edifice would collapse.\n\nNecessity rules the world. People rarely act unless compelled to.\nIf you create no need for yourself, then you will be done away widi at\nfirst opportunity. If, on the other hand, you understand the Laws of\nPower and make others depend on you for their welfare, if you can\ncounteract their weakness with your own \u201ciron and blood,\u201d in\nBismarck's phrase, then you will survive your masters as Bismarck\ndid. You will have all the benefits of power without the thorns that\ncome from being a master.\n\nThus a wise prince will think of ways to keep his citizens of every\nsort\n\nand under every circumstance dependent on the state and on him;\n\nand then they will always be trustworthy.\n\nNiccolb Machiavelli, 1469-1527\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nThe ultimate power is the power to get people to do as you wish.\nWhen you can do this without having to force people or hurt them,\nwhen they willingly grant you what you desire, then your power is\nuntouchable. The best way to achieve this position is to create a\nrelationship of dependence. The master requires your services; he is\nweak, or unable to function without you; you have enmeshed yourself\nin his work so deeply that doing away with you would bring him great\ndifficulty, or at least would mean valuable time lost in training another\nto replace you. Once such a relationship is established you have the\nupper hand, the leverage to make the master do as you wish. It is the\nclassic case of the man behind the tbrone, the servant of the king who\nactually controls the king. Bismarck did not have to bully either\nFrederick or William into doing his bidding. He simply made it clear\nthat unless he got what he wanted he would walk away, leaving the\nking to twist in the wind. Both kings soon danced to Bismarck's tune.\n\nDo not be one of the many who mistakenly believe that the\nultimate form of power is independence. Power involves a relationship\nbetween people; you will always need others as allies, pawns, or even\nas weak masters who serve as your front. The completely independent\nman would live in a cabin in the woodshe would have the freedom to\ncome and go as he pleased, but he would have no power. The best you\ncan hope for is that others will grow so dependent on you diat you\nenjoy a kind of reverse independence: Their need for you frees you.\n\nLouis XI (1423-1483), the great Spider King of France, had a\nweakness for astrology. He kept a court astrologer whom he admired,\nuntil one day the man predicted mat a lady of the court would die\nwithin eight days. When the prophecy came true, Louis was terrified,\nthinking that either the man had murdered the woman to prove his\naccuracy or that he was so versed in his science that his powers\nthreatened Louis himself. In either case he had to be killed.\n\nOne evening Louis summoned the astrologer to his room, high in\nthe castle. Before the man arrived, the king told his servants that when\nhe gave\n\nAn extravagant young Vine, vainly ambitious of independence,\nand fond of rambling at large, despised the alliance of a stately elm\nthat grew near, and courted her embraces. Having risen to some small\nheight without any kind of support, she shot forth her flimsy branches\nto a very uncommon and superfluous length; calling on her neighbour\nto take notice how little she wanted his assistance. \u201cPoor infatuated\nshrub, \u201d replied the elm, \u201chow inconsistent is thy conduct! Wouldst\nthou be truly independent, thou shouldst carefully apply those juices to\nthe enlargement of thy stem, which thou lavishest in vain upon\nunnecessary foliage. 1 shortly shall behold thee grovelling on the\nground; yet countenanced. indeed, by many of the human race, who,\nintoxicated with vanity, have despised economy; and who, to support\nfor a moment their empty boast of independence, have exhausted the\nvery source of it in frivolous expenses. \u201d\n\nFABLES,\n\nRobert Dodslhy,\n\n1703-1764\n\nthe signal they were to pick the astrologer up, carry him to the\nwindow, and hurl him to the ground, hundreds of feet below.\n\nThe astrologer soon arrived, but before giving the signal, Louis\ndecided to ask him one last question: \u201cYou claim to understand\nastrology and to know the fate of others, so tell me what your fate will\nbe and how long you have to live.\u201d\n\n\u201cT shall die just three days before Your Majesty,\u201d the astrologer\nreplied. The king's signal was never given. The man's life was spared.\nThe Spider King not only protected his astrologer for as long as he was\nalive, he lavished him with gifts and had him tended by the finest court\ndoctors.\n\nThe astrologer survived Louis by several years, disproving his\npower of prophecy but proving his mastery of power.\n\nThis is the model: Make others dependent on you. To get rid of\nyou might spell disaster, even death, and your master dares not tempt\nfate by finding out. There are many ways to obtain such a position.\nForemost among them is to possess a talent and creative skill that\nsimply cannot be replaced.\n\nDuring the Renaissance, the major obstacle to a painter's success\nwas finding the right patron. Michelangelo did this better man anyone\n\nelse: His patron was Pope Julius II. But he and the pope quarreled over\nthe building of the pope's marble tomb, and Michelangelo left Rome in\ndisgust. To the amazement of those in the pope's circle, not only did\nthe pope not fire him, he sought him out and in his own haughty way\nbegged the artist to stay. Michelangelo, he knew, could find anomer\npatron, but he could never find another Michelangelo.\n\nYou do not have to have the talent of a Michelangelo; you do\n\nhave to have a skill that sets you apart from the crowd. You should\ncreate a situation in which you can always latch on to another master\nor patron but your master cannot easily find another servant with your\nparticular talent. And if, in reality, you are not actually indispensable,\nyou must find a way to make it look as if you are. Having the\nappearance of specialized knowledge and skill gives you leeway in\nyour ability to deceive those above you into thinking they cannot do\nwithout you. Real dependence on your master's part, however, leaves\nhim more vulnerable to you than the faked variety, and it is always\nwithin your power to make your skill indispensable.\nThis is what is meant by the intertwining of fates: Like creeping\nivy, you have wrapped yourself around the source of power, so that it\nwould cause great trauma to cut you away. And you do not necessarily\nhave to entwine yourself around the master; another person will do, as\nlong as he or she too is indispensable in the chain.\n\nOne day Harry Cohn, president of Columbia Pictures, was visited\nin his office by a gloomy group of his executives. It was 1951, when\ndie witchhunt against Communists in Hollywood, carried on by the\nU.S. Congress's House Un-American Activities Committee, was at its\nheight. The executives had bad news: One of their employees, the\nscreenwriter John Howard Lawson, had been singled out as a\nCommunist. They had to get rid of him right away or suffer the wrath\nof me committee.\n\nHarry Cohn was no bleeding-heart liberal; in fact, he had always\nbeen a die-hard Republican.\n\nHis favorite politician was Benito Mussolini, whom he had once\nvisited, and whose framed photo hung on his wall. If there was\nsomeone he hated Cohn would call him a \u201cCommunist bastard.\u201d But to\nthe executives\u2019 amazement Cohn told them he would not fire Lawson.\nHe did not keep the screenwriter on because he was a good writerthere\n\n\nwere many good writers in Hollywood. He kept him because of a chain\nof dependence: Lawson was Humphrey Bogart's writer and Bogart was\nColumbia's star. If Cohn messed with Lawson he would ruin an\nimmensely profitable relationship. That was worth more dian the\nterrible publicity brought to him by his defiance of the committee.\n\nHenry Kissinger managed to survive the many bloodlettings that\nwent on in the Nixon White House not because he was the best\ndiplomat Nixon could findthere were other fine negotiatorsand not\nbecause the two men got along so well: They did not. Nor did they\nshare their beliefs and politics. Kissinger survived because he\nentrenched himself in so many areas of the political structure drat to do\naway with him would lead to chaos. Michelangelo's power was\nintensive, depending on one skill, his ability as an artist; Kissinger's\nwas extensive. He got himself involved in so many aspects and\ndepartments of the administration that his involvement became a card\nin his hand. It also made him many allies. If you can arrange such a\nposition for yourself, getting rid of you becomes dangerousall sorts of\ninterdependencies will unravel. Still, the intensive form of power\nprovides more freedom tiian the extensive, because those who have it\ndepend on no particular master, or particular position of power, for\ntheir security.\n\nTo make others dependent on you, one route to take is the secret-\nintelligence tactic.

Distracting the people\nyou want to deceive gives you the time and space to do something tiiey\nwon't notice. An act of kindness, generosity, or honesty is often the\nmost powerful form of distraction because it disarms other people's\nsuspicions. It turns them into children, eagerly lapping up any kind of\naffectionate gesture.\n\nIn ancient China this was called \u201cgiving before you take\u201dthe\ngiving makes it hard for die other person to notice the taking. It is a\n\ndevice with infinite practical uses. Brazenly taking something from\nsomeone is dangerous, even for the powerful. The victim will plot\nrevenge. It is also dangerous simply to ask for what you need, no\nmatter how politely: Unless the other person sees some gain for\nthemselves, they may come to resent your neediness. Learn to give\nbefore you take. It softens the ground, takes the bite out of a future\nrequest, or simply creates a distraction. And the giving can take many\nforms: an actual gift, a generous act, a kind favor, an \u201chonest\u201d\nadmissionwhatever it takes.\n\nSelective honesty is best employed on your first encounter with\nsomeone. We are all creatures of habit, and our first impressions last a\nlong time. If someone believes you are honest at die start of your\nrelationship it takes a lot to convince them otherwise. This gives you\nroom to maneuver.\n\nJay Gould, like Al Capone, was a man who distrusted everyone.\nBy die time he was thirty-three he was already a multimillionaire,\nmostly dirough deception and strong-arming. In the late 1860s, Gould\ninvested heavily in the Erie Railroad, then discovered tiiat the market\nhad\n\nbeen flooded with a vast amount of phony stock certificates for\nthe company. He stood to lose a fortune and to suffer a lot of\nembarrassment.\n\nIn the midst of this crisis, a man named Lord John Gordon-\nGordon offered to help. Gordon-Gordon, a Scottish lord, had\napparendy made a small fortune investing in railroads.\n\nBy hiring some handwriting experts \"Gordon-Gordon was able to\nprove to Gould that the culprits for the phony stock certificates were\nactually several top executives with the Erie Railroad itself. Gould was\ngrateful. Gordon-Gordon then proposed that he and Gould join forces\nto buy up a controlling interest in Erie. Gould agreed. For a while the\nventure appeared to prosper. The two men were now good friends, and\nevery time Gordon-Gordon came to Gould asking for money to buy\nmore stock, Gould gave it to him. In 1873, however, Gordon-Gordon\nsuddenly dumped all of his stock, making a fortune but drastically\nlowering the value of Gould's own holdings. Then he disappeared from\n\nsight.\n\nUpon investigation, Gould found out that Gordon-Gordon's real\nname was John Crowningsfield, and that he was the bastard son of a\nmerchant seaman and a London barmaid. There had been many clues\nbefore then that Gordon-Gordon was a con man, but his initial act of\nhonesty and support had so blinded Gould that it took the loss of\nmillions for him to see through the scheme.\n\nA single act of honesty is often not enough. What is required is a\nreputation for honesty, built on a series of actsbut these can be quite\ninconsequential. Once this reputation is established, as with first\nimpressions, it is hard to shake.\n\nIn ancient China, Duke Wu of Cheng decided it was time to take\nover the increasingly powerful kingdom of Hu. Telling no one of his\nplan, he married his daughter to Hu's ruler. He then called a council\nand asked his ministers, \u201cI am considering a military campaign. Which\ncountry should we invade\u201d As he had expected, one of his ministers\nreplied, \u201cHu should be invaded.\u201d The duke seemed angry, and said,\n\u201cHu is a sister state now. Why do you suggest invading her\u201d He had\nthe minister executed for his impolitic remark. The ruler of Hu heard\nabout this, and considering other tokens of Wu's honesty and the\nmarriage with his daughter, he took no precautions to defend himself\nfrom Cheng. A few weeks later, Cheng forces swept through Hu and\ntook die country, never to relinquish it.\n\nHonesty is one of the best ways to disarm the wary, but it is not\nthe only one. Any kind of noble, apparently selfless act will serve.\nPerhaps the best such act, though, is one of generosity. Few people can\nresist a gift, even from die most hardened enemy, which is why it is\noften the perfect way to disarm people. A gift brings out the child in\nus, instandy lowering our defenses. Although we often view other\npeople's actions in the most cynical light, we rarely see the\nMachiavellian element of a gift, which quite often hides ulterior\nmotives. A gift is the perfect object in which to hide a deceptive move.\n\nOver three thousand years ago the ancient Greeks traveled across\ndie sea to recapture the beautiful Helen, stolen away from them by\nParis, and\n\nto destroy Paris's city, Troy. The siege lasted ten years, many\nheroes died, yet neither side had come close to victory. One day, the\nprophet Calchas assembled the Greeks.\n\n\n\u201cStop battering away at these walls!\u201d he told them. \"You must\nfind\n\nruse.

The trick was successful and\nTroy fell. One gift did more for the Greek cause than ten years of\nfighting.\n\nSelective kindness should also be part of your arsenal of\ndeception. For years the ancient Romans had besieged the city of the\nFaliscans, always unsuccessfully. One day, however, when the Roman\ngeneral Camillus was encamped outside the city, he suddenly saw a\nman leading some children toward him. The man was a Faliscan\nteacher, and the children, it turned out, were the sons and daughters of\nthe noblest and wealthiest citizens of the town. On the pretense of\ntaking these children out for a walk, he had led them straight to the\nRomans, offering them as hostages in hopes of ingratiating himself\nwith Camillus, the city's enemy.\n\nCamillus did not take the children hostage. He stripped the\nteacher, tied his hands behind his back, gave each child a rod, and let\nthem whip him all the way back to the city. The gesture had an\nimmediate effect on the Faliscans. Had Camillus used die children as\nhostages, some in the city would have voted to surrender. And even if\nthe Faliscans had gone on fighting, their resistance would have been\nhalfhearted. Camillus's refusal to take advantage of die situation broke\ndown the Faliscans' resistance, and they surrendered. The general had\ncalculated correcdy. And in any case he had had nothing to lose: He\n\nknew mat the hostage ploy would not have ended die war, at least not\nright away. By turning die situation around, he earned his enemy's trust\nand respect, disarming them. Selective kindness will often break down\neven the most stubborn foe: Aiming right for the heart, it corrodes the\nwill to fight back.\n\nRemember: By playing on people's emotions, calculated acts of\nkindness can turn a Capone into a gullible child. As with any\nemotional approach, the tactic must be practiced with caution: If\npeople see through it, their disappointed feelings of gratitude and\nwarmth will become the most violent hatred and distrust. Unless you\ncan make the gesture seem sincere and heartfelt, do not play with fire.\n\nAuthority: When Duke Hsien of Chin was about to raid Yii, he\npresented to them a jade and a team of horses. When Earl Chih was\nabout to raid Ch'ou-yu, he presented to them grand chariots. Hence the\nsaying: \u201cWhen you are about to take, you should give.\u201d (Han-fei-tzu,\nChinese philosopher, third century B.C.)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nWhen you have a history of deceit behind you, no amount of\nhonesty, generosity, or kindness will fool people. In fact it will only\ncall attention to itself. Once people have come to see you as deceitful,\nto act honest all of a sudden is simply suspicious. In these cases it is\nbetter to play the rogue.\n\nCount Lustig, pulling the biggest con of his career, was about to\nsell the Eiffel Tower to an unsuspecting industrialist who believed the\ngovernment was auctioning it off for scrap metal. The industrialist was\nprepared to hand over a huge sum of money to Lustig, who had\nsuccessfully impersonated a government official. At the last minute,\nhowever, the mark was suspicious. Something about Lustig bothered\nhim. At die meeting in which he was to hand over the money, Lustig\nsensed his sudden distrust.\n\nLeaning over to fhe industrialist, Lustig explained, in a low\nwhisper, how low his salary was, how difficult his finances were, on\nand on. After a few minutes of this, the industrialist realized that\nLustig was asking for a bribe. For the first time he relaxed. Now he\nknew he could trust Lustig: Since all government officials were\ndishonest, Lustig had to be real. The man forked over the money. By\n\n\nacting dishonest, Lustig seemed the real McCoy. In this case selective\nhonesty would have had the opposite effect.\n\nAs the French diplomat Talleyrand grew older, his reputation as a\nmaster liar and deceiver spread. At the Congress of Vienna (1814-\n1815), he would spin fabulous stories and make impossible remarks to\npeople who knew he had to be lying. His dishonesty had no purpose\nexcept to cloak the moments when he really was deceiving them. One\nday, for example, among friends, Talleyrand said with apparent\nsincerity, \u201cIn business one ought to show one's hand.\u201d No one who\nheard him could believe their ears: A man who never once in his life\nhad shown his cards was telling other people to show theirs. Tactics\nlike this made it impossible to distinguish Talleyrand's real deceptions\nrom his fake ones. By embracing his reputation for dishonesty, he\npreserved his ability to deceive.\n\nNothing in the realm of power is set in stone.

In fact it will only\ncall attention to itself. Once people have come to see you as deceitful,\nto act honest all of a sudden is simply suspicious. In these cases it is\nbetter to play the rogue.\n\nCount Lustig, pulling the biggest con of his career, was about to\nsell the Eiffel Tower to an unsuspecting industrialist who believed the\ngovernment was auctioning it off for scrap metal. The industrialist was\nprepared to hand over a huge sum of money to Lustig, who had\nsuccessfully impersonated a government official. At the last minute,\nhowever, the mark was suspicious. Something about Lustig bothered\nhim. At die meeting in which he was to hand over the money, Lustig\nsensed his sudden distrust.\n\nLeaning over to fhe industrialist, Lustig explained, in a low\nwhisper, how low his salary was, how difficult his finances were, on\nand on. After a few minutes of this, the industrialist realized that\nLustig was asking for a bribe. For the first time he relaxed. Now he\nknew he could trust Lustig: Since all government officials were\ndishonest, Lustig had to be real. The man forked over the money. By\n\n\nacting dishonest, Lustig seemed the real McCoy. In this case selective\nhonesty would have had the opposite effect.\n\nAs the French diplomat Talleyrand grew older, his reputation as a\nmaster liar and deceiver spread. At the Congress of Vienna (1814-\n1815), he would spin fabulous stories and make impossible remarks to\npeople who knew he had to be lying. His dishonesty had no purpose\nexcept to cloak the moments when he really was deceiving them. One\nday, for example, among friends, Talleyrand said with apparent\nsincerity, \u201cIn business one ought to show one's hand.\u201d No one who\nheard him could believe their ears: A man who never once in his life\nhad shown his cards was telling other people to show theirs. Tactics\nlike this made it impossible to distinguish Talleyrand's real deceptions\nrom his fake ones. By embracing his reputation for dishonesty, he\npreserved his ability to deceive.\n\nNothing in the realm of power is set in stone.

Self-interest alone moves some men.\n\nFABLES,\n\nAesop, sixth century b.c.\n\nTRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW\n\nIn the early fourteendi century, a young man named Castruccio\nCastracani rose from the rank of common soldier to become lord of the\ngreat city of Lucca, Italy. One of the most powerful families in the city,\nthe Poggios, had been instrumental in his climb (which succeeded\nthrough treachery and bloodshed), but after he came to power, they\ncame to feel he had forgotten them. His ambition outweighed any\n\ngratitude he felt. In 1325, while Castruccio was away fighting Lucca's\nmain rival, Florence, the Poggios conspired with other noble families\nin the city to rid themselves of this troublesome and ambitious prince.\n\nMounting an insurrection, the plotters attacked and murdered the\ngovernor whom Castruccio had left behind to rule the city. Riots broke\nout, and the Castruccio supporters and the Poggio supporters were\npoised to do battle. At die height of the tension, however, Stefano di\nPoggio, the oldest member of the family, intervened, and made both\nsides lay down their arms.\n\nA peaceful man, Stefano had not taken part in the conspiracy. He\nhad told his family it would end in a useless bloodbath. Now he\ninsisted he should intercede on the family's behalf and persuade\nCastruccio to listen to their complaints and satisfy their demands.\nStefano was the oldest and wisest member of the clan, and his family\nagreed to put their trust in his diplomacy rather man in their weapons.\n\nWhen news of the rebellion reached Castruccio, he hurried back\nto Lucca. By the time he arrived, however, the fighting had ceased,\nthrough Stefano's agency, and he was surprised by the city's calm and\npeace. Stefano di Poggio had imagined that Castruccio would be\ngrateful to him for his part in quelling die rebellion, so he paid die\nprince a visit. He explained how he had brought peace, then begged for\nCastruccio's mercy. He said mat die rebels in his family were young\nand impetuous, hungry for power yet inexperienced; he recalled his\nfamily's past generosity to Castruccio. For all tiiese reasons, he said,\nthe great prince should pardon the Poggios and listen to their\ncomplaints. This, he said, was the only just thing to do, since the\nfamily had willingly laid down their arms and had always supported\nhim.\n\nCastruccio listened patiendy. He seemed not the slightest bit\nangry or resentful. Instead, he told Stefano to rest assured that justice\nwould prevail, and he asked him to bring his entire family to die palace\nto talk over their grievances and come to an agreement. As diey took\nleave of one another, Castruccio said he thanked God for the chance he\nhad been given to show his clemency and kindness. That evening die\nentire Poggio family came to die palace. Castruccio immediately had\nthem imprisoned and a few days later all were executed, including\nStefano.\n\nInterpretation\n\nStefano di Poggio is die embodiment of all those who believe that\nthe justice and nobility of dieir cause will prevail. Certainly appeals to\njustice and gratitude have occasionally succeeded in the past, but more\noften than not\n\nthey have had dire consequences, especially in dealings with the\nCastruc-cios of the world. Stefano knew that the prince had risen to\npower through treachery and ruthlessness. This was a man, after all,\nwho had put a close and devoted friend to death. When Castruccio was\ntold that it had been a terrible wrong to kill such an old friend, he\nreplied that he had executed not an old friend but a new enemy.\n\nA man like Castruccio knows only force and self-interest. When\nthe rebellion began, to end it and place oneself at his mercy was the\nmost dangerous possible move. Even once Stefano di Poggio had made\nthat fatal mistake, however, he still had options: He could have offered\nmoney to Castruccio, could have made promises for the future, could\nhave pointed out what the Poggios could still contribute to Castruccio's\npowertheir influence with the most influential families of Rome, for\nexample, and die great marriage they could have brokered.\n\nInstead Stefano brought up the past, and debts that carried no\nobligation. Not only is a man not obliged to be grateful, gratitude is\noften a terrible burden that he gladly discards. And in this case\nCastruccio rid himself of his obligations to the Poggios by eliminating\nthe Poggios.\n\nMost men are so thoroughly subjective that nothing really\ninterests them but themselves. They always think of their own case as\nsoon as ever any remark is made, and their whole attention is\nengrossed and absorbed by the merest chance reference to anything\nwhich affects them personally, be it never so remote.\n\nArthur\n\nSchopenhauer,\n\n1788-1860\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nIn 433 B.C., just before the Peloponnesian War, the island of\nCorcyra (later called Corfu) and the Greek city-state of Corinth stood\non the brink of conflict. Both parties sent ambassadors to Athens to try\nto win over the Athenians to their side. The stakes were high, since\n\n\nwhoever had Athens on his side was sure to win. And whoever won\nthe war would certainly give the defeated side no mercy.\n\nCorcyra spoke first. Its ambassador began by admitting that the\nisland had never helped Athens before, and in fact had allied itself with\nAthens's enemies. There were no ties of friendship or gratitude\nbetween Corcyra and Athens. Yes, the ambassador admitted, he had\ncome to Athens now out of fear and concern for Corcyra's safety. The\nonly thing he could offer was an alliance of mutual interests. Corcyra\nhad a navy only surpassed in size and strengdi by Athens's own; an\nalliance between the two states would create a formidable force, one\nthat could intimidate the rival state of Sparta. That, unfortunately, was\nall Corcyra had to offer.\n\nThe representative from Corinth then gave a brilliant, passionate\nspeech, in sharp contrast to the dry, colorless approach of the\nCorcyran. He talked of everything Corinth had done for Athens in die\npast. He asked how it would look to Athens's other allies if the city put\nan agreement with a former enemy over one with a present friend, one\nthat had served Athens's interest loyally: Perhaps those allies would\nbreak their agreements with Athens if tiiey saw that their loyalty was\nnot valued. He referred to Hellenic law, and the need to repay Corinth\nfor all its good deeds. He finally went on to list the many services\nCorinth had performed for Athens, and the importance of showing\ngratitude to one's friends.\n\nAfter the speech, the Athenians debated the issue in an assembly.\nOn\n\nthe second round, they voted overwhelmingly to ally with\nCorcyra and drop Corinth.\n\nInterpretation\n\nHistory has remembered the Atiienians nobly, but they were the\npreeminent realists of classical Greece. With them, all the rhetoric, all\nthe emotional appeals in the world, could not match a good pragmatic\nargument, especially one that added to their power.\n\nWhat the Corinthian ambassador did not realize was that his\nreferences to Corinth's past generosity to Athens only irritated the\nAthenians, subdy asking them to feel guilty and putting them under\nobligation. The Athenians couldn't care less about past favors and\nfriendly feelings. At the same time, they knew that if their other allies\n\nthought them ungrateful for abandoning Corinth, these city-states\nwould still be unlikely to break their ties to Athens, the preeminent\npower in Greece. Atiiens ruled its empire by force, and would simply\ncompel any rebellious ally to return to the fold.\n\nWhen people choose between talk about the past and talk about\nthe future, a pragmatic person will always opt for the future and forget\nthe past. As die Corcyrans realized, it is always best to speak\npragmatically to a pragmatic person. And in the end, most people are\nin fact pragmaticthey will rarely act against their own self-interest.\n\nIt has always been a rule that the weak should be subject to the\nstrong;\n\nand besides, we consider that we are worthy of our power. Up till\nthe\n\npresent moment you, too, used to think that we were; but now,\nafter\n\ncalculating your own interest, you are beginning to talk in terms\nof right\n\nand wrong. Considerations of this kind have never yet turned\npeople aside\n\nfrom the opportunities of aggrandizement offered by superior\nstrength.\n\nAthenian representative to Sparta,\n\nquoted in The Peloponnesian War, Thucydide.s, c. 465-395 B.C.\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nIn your quest for power, you will constantiy find yourself in the\nposition of asking for help from those more powerful than you. There\nis an art to asking for help, an art that depends on your ability to\nunderstand the person you are dealing with, and to not confuse your\nneeds with theirs.\n\nMost people never succeed at this, because they are completely\ntrapped in their own wants and desires. They start from the assumption\nthat the people they are appealing to have a selfless interest in helping\nthem. They talk as if their needs mattered to these peoplewho probably\ncouldn't care less. Sometimes they refer to larger issues: a great cause,\nor grand emotions such as love and gratitude. They go for the big\npicture when simple, everyday realities would have much more appeal.\nWhat they do not realize is that even the most powerful person is\n\nlocked inside needs of his own, and that if you make no appeal to his\nself-interest, he merely sees you as desperate or, at best, a waste of\ntime.\n\nIn die sixteendi century, Portuguese missionaries tried for years to\nconvert the people of Japan to Catholicism, while at the same time\nPortugal had a monopoly on trade between Japan and Europe.\nAlthough the missionaries did have some success, they never got far\namong the ruling elite; by the beginning of the seventeenth century, in\nfact, tiieir proselytizing had completely antagonized the Japanese\nemperor Ieyasu. When the Dutch began to arrive in Japan in great\nnumbers, Ieyasu was much relieved. He needed Europeans for their\nknow-how in guns and navigation, and here at last were Europeans\nwho cared nothing for spreading religiondie Dutch wanted only to\ntrade. Ieyasu swifdy moved to evict die Portuguese. From then on, he\nwould only deal with the practical-minded Dutch.\n\nJapan and Holland were vasdy different cultures, but each shared\na timeless and universal concern: self-interest. Every person you deal\nwith is like anotiier culture, an alien land with a past tiiat has nothing\nto do witii yours. Yet you can bypass die differences between you and\nhim by appealing to his self-interest. Do not be subde: You have\nvaluable knowledge to share, you will fill his coffers with gold, you\nwill make him live longer and happier. This is a language mat all of us\nspeak and understand.\n\nA key step in die process is to understand die other person's\npsychology. Is he vain Is he concerned about his reputation or his\nsocial standing Does he have enemies you could help him vanquish Is\nhe simply motivated by money and power\n\nWhen die Mongols invaded China in the twelfth century, they\nthreat-ened to obliterate a culture that had thrived for over two\nthousand years. Their leader, Genghis Khan, saw nothing in China but\na country tiiat lacked pasturing for his horses, and he decided to\ndestroy die place, leveling all its cities, for \u201cit would be better to\nexterminate the Chinese and let the grass grow.\u201d It was not a soldier, a\ngeneral, or a king who saved die Chinese from devastation, but a man\nnamed Yelu Ch'u-Ts'ai. A foreigner himself, Ch'u-Ts'ai had come to\nappreciate die superiority of Chinese culture. He managed to make\nhimself a trusted adviser to Genghis Khan, and persuaded him that he\n\nwould reap riches out of the place if, instead of destroying it, he simply\ntaxed everyone who lived tiiere. Khan saw the wisdom in diis and did\nas Ch'u-Ts'ai advised.\n\nWhen Khan took the city of Kaifeng, after a long siege, and\ndecided to massacre its inhabitants (as he had in otiier cities diat had\nresisted him), Ch'u-Ts'ai told him tiiat the finest craftsmen and\nengineers in China had fled to Kaifeng, and it would be better to put\nthem to use. Kaifeng was spared. Never before had Genghis Khan\nshown such mercy, but then it really wasn't mercy tiiat saved Kaifeng.\nCh'u-Ts'ai knew Khan well. He was a barbaric peasant who cared\nnothing for culture, or indeed for anytiiing otiier than warfare and\npractical results. Ch'u-Ts'ai chose to appeal to the only emotion that\nwould work on such a man: greed.\n\nSelf-interest is the lever tiiat will move people. Once you make\nthem see how you can in some way meet their needs or advance their\ncause, their resistance to your requests for help will magically fall\naway. At each step on die way to acquiring power, you must train\nyourself to tiiink your\n\nway inside the other person's mind, to see their needs and\ninterests, to get rid of the screen of your own feelings that obscure the\ntruth. Master tiiis art and there will be no limits to what you can\naccomplish.\n\nImage: A Cord that Binds. The cord of mercy and gratitude is\nthreadbare, and will break at the first shock. Do not throw such a\nlifeline. The cord of mutual self-interest is woven of many fibers and\ncannot easily be severed. It will serve you well for years.\n\nAuthority: The shortest and best way to make your fortune is to\nlet people see clearly that it is in their interests to promote yours. (Jean\nde La Bruyere, 1645-1696)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nSome people will see an appeal to their self-interest as ugly and\nignoble. They actually prefer to be able to exercise charity, mercy, and\njustice, which are their ways of feeling superior to you: When you beg\nthem for help, you emphasize their power and position. They are\nstrong enough to need nothing from you except the chance to feel\nsuperior. This is the wine that intoxicates them. They are dying to fund\nyour project, to introduce you to powerful peopleprovided, of course,\n\nthat all this is done in public, and for a good cause (usually the more\npublic, the better). Not everyone, then, can be approached through\ncynical self-interest. Some people will be put off by it, because they\ndon't want to seem to be motivated by such things. They need\nopportunities to display their good heart.\n\nDo not be shy. Give them that opportunity. It's not as if you are\nconning them by asking for helpit is really their pleasure to give, and\nto be seen giving. You must distinguish the differences among\npowerful people and figure out what makes them tick. When they ooze\ngreed, do not appeal to meir charity. When they want to look charitable\nand noble, do not appeal to their greed.\n'.

This is a language mat all of us\nspeak and understand.\n\nA key step in die process is to understand die other person's\npsychology. Is he vain Is he concerned about his reputation or his\nsocial standing Does he have enemies you could help him vanquish Is\nhe simply motivated by money and power\n\nWhen die Mongols invaded China in the twelfth century, they\nthreat-ened to obliterate a culture that had thrived for over two\nthousand years. Their leader, Genghis Khan, saw nothing in China but\na country tiiat lacked pasturing for his horses, and he decided to\ndestroy die place, leveling all its cities, for \u201cit would be better to\nexterminate the Chinese and let the grass grow.\u201d It was not a soldier, a\ngeneral, or a king who saved die Chinese from devastation, but a man\nnamed Yelu Ch'u-Ts'ai. A foreigner himself, Ch'u-Ts'ai had come to\nappreciate die superiority of Chinese culture. He managed to make\nhimself a trusted adviser to Genghis Khan, and persuaded him that he\n\nwould reap riches out of the place if, instead of destroying it, he simply\ntaxed everyone who lived tiiere. Khan saw the wisdom in diis and did\nas Ch'u-Ts'ai advised.\n\nWhen Khan took the city of Kaifeng, after a long siege, and\ndecided to massacre its inhabitants (as he had in otiier cities diat had\nresisted him), Ch'u-Ts'ai told him tiiat the finest craftsmen and\nengineers in China had fled to Kaifeng, and it would be better to put\nthem to use. Kaifeng was spared. Never before had Genghis Khan\nshown such mercy, but then it really wasn't mercy tiiat saved Kaifeng.\nCh'u-Ts'ai knew Khan well. He was a barbaric peasant who cared\nnothing for culture, or indeed for anytiiing otiier than warfare and\npractical results. Ch'u-Ts'ai chose to appeal to the only emotion that\nwould work on such a man: greed.\n\nSelf-interest is the lever tiiat will move people. Once you make\nthem see how you can in some way meet their needs or advance their\ncause, their resistance to your requests for help will magically fall\naway. At each step on die way to acquiring power, you must train\nyourself to tiiink your\n\nway inside the other person's mind, to see their needs and\ninterests, to get rid of the screen of your own feelings that obscure the\ntruth. Master tiiis art and there will be no limits to what you can\naccomplish.\n\nImage: A Cord that Binds. The cord of mercy and gratitude is\nthreadbare, and will break at the first shock. Do not throw such a\nlifeline. The cord of mutual self-interest is woven of many fibers and\ncannot easily be severed. It will serve you well for years.\n\nAuthority: The shortest and best way to make your fortune is to\nlet people see clearly that it is in their interests to promote yours. (Jean\nde La Bruyere, 1645-1696)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nSome people will see an appeal to their self-interest as ugly and\nignoble. They actually prefer to be able to exercise charity, mercy, and\njustice, which are their ways of feeling superior to you: When you beg\nthem for help, you emphasize their power and position. They are\nstrong enough to need nothing from you except the chance to feel\nsuperior. This is the wine that intoxicates them. They are dying to fund\nyour project, to introduce you to powerful peopleprovided, of course,\n\nthat all this is done in public, and for a good cause (usually the more\npublic, the better). Not everyone, then, can be approached through\ncynical self-interest. Some people will be put off by it, because they\ndon't want to seem to be motivated by such things. They need\nopportunities to display their good heart.\n\nDo not be shy. Give them that opportunity. It's not as if you are\nconning them by asking for helpit is really their pleasure to give, and\nto be seen giving. You must distinguish the differences among\npowerful people and figure out what makes them tick. When they ooze\ngreed, do not appeal to meir charity. When they want to look charitable\nand noble, do not appeal to their greed.\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Below is an excerpt from my book titled '48 Laws of Power', specifically from Chapter '48 Laws of Power', Section 'LAW 14'. The original text is: 'POSE AS A FRIEND, WORK AS A SPY\n\nJUDGMENT\n\nKnowing about your rival is critical. Use spies to gather valuable\ninformation that will keep you a step ahead. Better still: Play the spy\nyourself. In polite social encounters, learn to probe. Ask indirect\nquestions to get people to reveal their weaknesses and intentions.\nThere is no occasion that is not an opportunity for artful spying.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nJoseph Duveen was undoubtedly the greatest art dealer of his\ntimefrom 1904 to 1940 he almost single-handedly monopolized\nAmerica's millionaire art-collecting market. But one prize plum eluded\nhim: the industrialist Andrew Mellon. Before he died, Duveen was\ndetermined to make Mellon a client.\nDuveen's friends said this was an impossible dream. Mellon was a\nstiff, taciturn man. The stories he had heard about the congenial,\ntalkative Duveen rubbed him die wrong wayhe had made it clear he\nhad no desire to meet the man. Yet Duveen told his doubting friends,\n\u201cNot only will Mellon buy from me but he will buy only from me.\u201d\nFor several years he tracked his prey, learning the man's habits, tastes,\nphobias. To do this, he secredy put several of Mellon's staff on his own\npayroll, worming valuable information out of them. By the time he\nmoved into action, he knew Mellon about as well as Mellon's wife did.\nIn 1921 Mellon was visiting London, and staying in a palatial\nsuite on the third floor of Claridge's Hotel. Duveen booked himself\ninto the suite just below Mellon's, on the second floor. He had arranged\nor his valet to befriend Mellon's valet, and on the fateful day he had\nchosen to make his move, Mellon's valet told Duveen's valet, who told\nDuveen, that he had just helped Mellon on with his overcoat, and that\nthe industrialist was making his way down the corridor to ring for the\nlift.\n\n\nDuveen's valet hurriedly helped Duveen witii his own overcoat.\nSeconds later, Duveen entered the lift, and lo and behold, there was\nMellon. \u201cHow do you do, Mr. Mellon\u201d said Duveen, introducing\nhimself. \u201cI am on my way to die National Gallery to look at some\npictures.\u201d How uncanny diat was precisely where Mellon was headed.\nAnd so Duveen was able to accompany his prey to the one location\nthat would ensure his success. He knew Mellon's taste inside and out,\nand while the two men wandered through the museum, he dazzled the\nmagnate with his knowledge. Once again quite uncannily, they seemed\nto have remarkably similar tastes.\n\nMellon was pleasantiy surprised: This was not the Duveen he had\nexpected. The man was charming and agreeable, and clearly had\nexquisite taste. When they returned to New York, Mellon visited\nDuveen's exclusive gallery and fell in love with the collection.\nEverything, surprisingly enough, seemed to be precisely the kind of\nwork he wanted to collect. For the rest of his life he was Duveen's best\nand most generous client.\n\nInterpretation\n\nA man as ambitious and competitive as Joseph Duveen left\nnothing to chance. What's the point of winging it, of just hoping you\nmay be able to charm this or that client It's like shooting ducks\nblindfolded. Arm yourself with a litde knowledge and your aim\nimproves.\n\nMellon was the most spectacular of Duveen's catches, but he\nspied on many a millionaire. By secredy putting members of his\nclients' household staffs on his own payroll, he would gain constant\naccess to valuable infor-\n\nmation about dieir masters' comings and goings, changes in taste,\nand other such tidbits of information that would put him a step ahead.\nA rival of Duveen's who wanted to make Henry Frick a client noticed\nthat whenever he visited this wealthy New Yorker, Duveen was there\nbefore him, as if he had a sixth sense. To otiier dealers Duveen seemed\nto be everywhere, and to know everything before they did. His powers\ndiscouraged and disheartened them, until many simply gave up going\nafter the wealthy clients who could make a dealer rich.\n\nSuch is the power of artful spying: It makes you seem all-\npowerful, clairvoyant. Your knowledge of your mark can also make\n\nyou seem charming, so well can you anticipate his desires. No one sees\nthe source of your power, and what they cannot see they cannot fight.\n\nRulers see through spies, as cows through smell, Brahmins\nthrough scriptures and the rest oj the people through their normal eyes.\n\nKnutilya, Indian philosopher, third century B.C.\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nIn the realm of power, your goal is a degree of control over future\nevents. Part of die problem you face, then, is that people won't tell you\nall their thoughts, emotions, and plans. Controlling what they say, they\noften keep the most critical parts of their character hiddentheir\nweaknesses, ulterior motives, obsessions. The result is that you cannot\npredict their moves, and are constandy in the dark. The trick is to find\na way to probe them, to find out their secrets and hidden intentions,\nwithout letting them know what you are up to.\n\nThis is not as difficult as you might think. A friendly front will let\nyou secredy gather information on friends and enemies alike. Let\nodiers consult the horoscope, or read tarot cards: You have more\nconcrete means of seeing into the future.\n\nThe most common way of spying is to use other people, as\nDuveen did. The method is simple, powerful, but risky: You will\ncertainly gamer information, but you have litde control over the people\nwho are doing die work. Perhaps diey will inepdy reveal your spying,\nor even secretly turn against you. It is far better to be die spy yourself,\nto pose as a friend while secredy gathering information.\n\nThe French politician Talleyrand was one of the greatest\npractitioners of diis art. He had an uncanny ability to worm secrets out\nof people in polite conversation. A contemporary of his, Baron de\nVitrolles, wrote, \u201cWit and grace marked his conversation. He\npossessed die art of concealing his thoughts or his malice beneath a\ntransparent veil of insinuations, words diat imply something more than\nthey express. Only when necessary did he inject his own personality.\u201d\nThe key here is Talleyrand's ability to suppress himself in the\nconversation, to make odiers talk endlessly about diemselves and\ninadvertendy reveal dieir intentions and plans.\n\nIf you have reason to suspect that a person is telling you a lie,\nlook as though you believed every word he said. This will give him\ncourage to go on; he will become more vehement in his assertions, and\n\nin the end betray himself. Again, if you perceive that a person is trying\nto conceal something from you, but with only partial success, look as\nthough you did not believe him. The opposition on your part will\nprovoke him into leading out his reserve of truth and bringing the\nwhole force of it to bear upon your incredulity.\n\nArthur\n\n1788-1860\n\nThroughout Talleyrand's life, people said he was a superb\nconversationalistyet he actually said very httle. He never talked about\nhis own ideas; he got others to reveal theirs. He would organize\nfriendly games of charades for foreign diplomats, social gatherings\nwhere, however, he would carefully weigh their words, cajole\nconfidences out of them, and gather information invaluable to his work\nas France's foreign minister. At die Congress of Vienna (1814-1815) he\ndid his spying in other ways: He would blurt out what seemed to be a\nsecret (actually something he had made up), dien watch his listeners\u2019\nreactions. He might tell a gathering of diplomats, for instance, mat a\nreliable source had revealed to him mat the czar of Russia was\nplanning to arrest his top general for treason. By watching the\ndiplomats' reactions to this made-up story, he would know which ones\nwere most excited by the weakening of the Russian armyperhaps their\ngoverments had designs on Russia As Baron von Stetten said,\n\u201cMonsieur Talleyrand fires a pistol into the air to see who will jump\nout the window.\u201d\n\nDuring social gamerings and innocuous encounters, pay attention.\nThis is when people's guards are down. By suppressing your own\npersonality, you can make them reveal things. The brilliance of the\nmaneuver is that they will mistake your interest in them for friendship,\nso that you not only learn, you make allies.\n\nNevertheless, you should practice this tactic with caution and\ncare. If people begin to suspect you are worming secrets out of them\nunder the cover of conversation, they will stricdy avoid you.\nEmphasize friendly chatter, not valuable information. Your search for\ngems of information cannot be too obvious, or your probing questions\nwill reveal more about yourself and your intentions than about the\ninformation you hope to find.\n\nA trick to try in spying comes from La Rochefoucauld, who\nwrote, \u201cSincerity is found in very few men, and is often the cleverest\nof ruses one is sincere in order to draw out the confidence and secrets\nof the other.\u201d By pretending to bare your heart to another person, in\nother words, you make mem more likely to reveal their own secrets.\nGive them a false confession and they will give you a real one.\nAnother trick was identified by the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer,\nwho suggested vehemendy contradicting people you're in conversation\nwith as a way of irritating mem, stirring them up so that mey lose some\nof the control over dieir words. In their emotional reaction they will\nreveal all kinds of truths about themselves, truths you can later use\nagainst them.\n\nAnother method of indirect spying is to test people, to lay litde\ntraps that make them reveal things about themselves. Chosroes II, a\nnotoriously clever seventh-century king of the Persians, had many\nways of seeing through his subjects without raising suspicion. If he\nnoticed, for instance, mat two of his courtiers had become particularly\nfriendly, he would call one of them aside and say he had information\nthat the other was a traitor, and would soon be killed. The king would\ntell the courtier he trusted him more tiian anyone, and that he must\nkeep this information secret. Then he\n\nwould watch the two men carefully. If he saw that the second\ncourtier had not changed in his behavior toward the king, he would\nconclude that the first courtier had kept the secret, and he would\nquickly promote the man, later taking him aside to confess, \u201cI meant to\nkill your friend because of certain information that had reached me,\nbut, when I investigated the matter, I found it was untrue.\u201d If, on the\nodier hand, the second courtier started to avoid the king, acting aloof\nand tense, Chosroes would know that the secret had been revealed. He\nwould ban the second courtier from his court, letting him know that the\nwhole business had only been a test, but that even though the man had\ndone nothing wrong, he could no longer trust him. The first courtier,\nhowever, had revealed a secret, and him Chosroes would ban from his\nentire kingdom.\n\nIt may seem an odd form of spying that reveals not empirical\ninformation but a person's character. Often, however, it is the best way\nof solving problems before they arise.\n\nBy tempting people into certain acts, you learn about their loyalty,\ntheir honesty, and so on. And this kind of knowledge is often the most\nvaluable of all: Armed with it, you can predict their actions in the\nfuture.\n\nImage:\n\nThe Third Eye of\n\nthe Spy. In the land of\n\nthe two-eyed, the third eye\n\ngives you the omniscience\n\nof a god. You see further than\n\nothers, and you see deeper\n\ninto them. Nobody is\n\nsafe from the eye\n\nbut you.\n\nAuthority: Now, the reason a brilliant sovereign and a wise\ngeneral conquer the enemy whenever they move, and _ their\nachievements surpass those of ordinary men, is their foreknowledge of\nthe enemy situation. This \u201cforeknowledge\u201d cannot be elicited from\nspirits, nor from gods, nor by analogy with past events, nor by\nastrologic calculations. It must be obtained from men who know the\nenemy situationfrom spies. (Sun-tzu, The Art of War, fourth century\nB.C.)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nInformation is critical to power, but just as you spy on other\npeople, you must be prepared for them to spy on you. One of the most\npotent weapons in the batde for information, dien, is giving out false\ninformation. As Winston Churchill said, \u201cTruth is so precious mat she\nshould always be attended by a bodyguard of lies.\u201d You must surround\nyourself with such a bodyguard, so that your truth cannot be\npenetrated. By planting the information of your choice, you control the\ngame.\n\nIn 1944 the Nazis' rocket-bomb attacks on London suddenly\nescalated. Over two diousand V-! flying bombs fell on the city, killing\nmore than five thousand people and wounding many more. Somehow,\nhowever, the Germans consistendy missed their targets. Bombs that\nwere intended for Tower Bridge, or Piccadilly, would fall well short of\nthe city, landing in die less populated suburbs. This was because, in\n\n\nfixing tfieir targets, the Germans relied on secret agents they had\nplanted in England. They did not know that these agents had been\ndiscovered, and that in their place, English-controlled agents were\nfeeding them subdy deceptive information.\n\nThe bombs would hit farther and farther from their targets every\ntime they fell. By the end of the campaign they were landing on cows\nin the country. By feeding people wrong information, then, you gain a\npotent advantage. While spying gives you a third eye, disinformation\nputs out one of your enemy's eyes. A cyclops, he always misses his\ntarget.\n'.

Over two diousand V-! flying bombs fell on the city, killing\nmore than five thousand people and wounding many more. Somehow,\nhowever, the Germans consistendy missed their targets. Bombs that\nwere intended for Tower Bridge, or Piccadilly, would fall well short of\nthe city, landing in die less populated suburbs. This was because, in\n\n\nfixing tfieir targets, the Germans relied on secret agents they had\nplanted in England. They did not know that these agents had been\ndiscovered, and that in their place, English-controlled agents were\nfeeding them subdy deceptive information.\n\nThe bombs would hit farther and farther from their targets every\ntime they fell. By the end of the campaign they were landing on cows\nin the country. By feeding people wrong information, then, you gain a\npotent advantage.

These two generals\nbegan their careers as friends, fighting on the same side. Hsiang Yu\ncame from the nobility; large and powerful, given to bouts of violence\n\nand temper, a bit dull-witted, he was yet a mighty warrior who always\nfought at the head of his troops. Liu Pang came from peasant stock. He\nhad never been much of a soldier, and preferred women and wine to\nfighting; in fact, he was something of a scoundrel. But he was wily,\nand he had the ability to recognize the best strategists, keep them as his\nadvisers, and listen to their advice. He had risen in the army through\nthese strengths.\n\nIn 208 B.C., the king of Ch'u sent two massive armies to conquer\nthe powerful kingdom of Ch'in. One army went north, under the\ngeneralship of Sung Yi, with Hsiang Yu second in command; the other,\nled by Liu Pang, headed straight toward Ch'in. The target was the\nkingdom's splendid capital, Hsien-yang. And Hsiang Yu, ever violent\nand impatient, could not stand the idea that Liu Pang would get to\nHsien-yang first, and perhaps would assume command of the entire\narmy.\n\nAt one point on the northern front, Hsiang's commander, Sung Yi,\nhesitated in sending his troops into batde. Furious, Hsiang entered\nSung Yi's tent, proclaimed him a traitor, cut off his head, and assumed\nsole command of the army. Without waiting for orders, he left the\nnorthern front and marched direcdy on Hsien-yang. He felt certain he\nwas the better soldier and general than Liu, but, to his utter\nastonishment, his rival, leading a smaller, swifter army, managed to\nreach Hsien-yang first. Hsiang had an adviser, Fan Tseng, who warned\nhim, \u201cThis village headman [Liu Pang] used to be greedy only for\nriches and women, but since entering the capital he has not been led\nastray by wealth, wine, or sex. That shows he is aiming high.\u201d\n\nFan Tseng urged Hsiang to kill his rival before it was too late. He\ntold the general to invite the wily peasant to a banquet at their camp\noutside Hsien-yang, and, in the midst of a celebratory sword dance, to\nhave his head cut off. The invitation was sent; Liu fell for the trap, and\ncame to the banquet. But Hsiang hesitated in ordering the sword dance,\nand by the time he gave the signal, Liu had sensed a trap, and managed\nto escape. \u201cBah!\u201d cried Fan Tseng in disgust, seeing that Hsiang had\nbotched the plot. \u201cOne cannot plan with a simpleton. Liu Pang will\nsteal your empire yet and make us all his prisoners.\u201d\n\nRealizing his mistake, Hsiang hurriedly marched on Hsien-yang,\nthis time determined to hack off his rival's head. Liu was never one to\n\nfight when the odds were against him, and he abandoned the city.\nHsiang captured Hsien-yang, murdered the young prince of Ch'in, and\nburned the city to the ground. Liu was now Hsiang's bitter enemy, and\nhe pursued him for many months, finally cornering him in a walled\ncity. Lacking food, his army in disarray, Liu sued for peace.\n\nAgain Fan Tseng warned Hsiang, \"Crush him now! If you let him\ngo\n\nagain, you will be sorry later.\u201c But Hsiang decided to be merciful.\nHe wanted to bring Liu back to Ch'u alive, and to force his former\ntiend to acknowledge him as master. But Fan proved right: Liu\nmanaged to use the negotiations for his surrender as a distraction, and\nhe escaped with a small army. Hsiang, amazed that he had yet again let\nhis rival slip away, once more set out after Liu, this time with such\nerocity diat he seemed to have lost his mind. At one point, having\ncaptured Liu's father in battle, Hsiang stood the old man up during the\n\u2018ighting and yelled to Liu across the line of troops, \u201dSurrender now, or\nI shall boil your father alive!\u201c Liu calmly answered, \u201dBut we are sworn\nbrothers. So my father is your father also. If you insist on boiling your\nown father, send me a bow! of the soup!\" Hsiang backed down, and the\nstruggle continued.\n\nA few weeks later, in the thick of the hunt, Hsiang scattered his\n\u2018orces unwisely, and in a surprise attack Liu was able to surround his\nmain garrison. For the first time the tables were turned. Now it was\nHsiang who sued for peace. Liu's top adviser urged him to destroy\nHsiang, crush his army, show no mercy. \u201cTo let him go would be like\nrearing a tigerit will devour you later,\u201d the adviser said. Liu agreed.\n\nMaking a false treaty, he lured Hsiang into relaxing his defense,\nthen slaughtered almost all of his army. Hsiang managed to escape.\nAlone and on foot, knowing mat Liu had put a bounty on his head, he\ncame upon a small group of his own retreating soldiers, and cried out,\n\u201cT hear Liu Pang has offered one thousand pieces of gold and a fief of\nten thousand families for my head. Let me do you a favor.\u201d Then he\nslit his own throat and died.\n\nInterpretation\n\nHsiang Yu had proven his ruthlessness on many an occasion. He\nrarely hesitated in doing away witii a rival if it served his purposes.\nBut with Liu Pang he acted differently. He respected his rival, and did\n\n\nnot want to defeat him through deception; he wanted to prove his\nsuperiority on the battlefield, even to force the clever Liu to surrender\nand to serve him. Every time he had his rival in his hands, something\nmade him hesitatea fatal sympathy with or respect for the man who,\nafter all, had once been a friend and comrade in arms. But the moment\nHsiang made it clear that he intended to do away with Liu, yet failed to\naccomplish it, he sealed his own doom. Liu would not suffer the same\nhesitation once the tables were turned.\n\nThis is the fate that faces all of us when we sympathize with our\nenemies, when pity, or the hope of reconciliation, makes us pull back\nfrom doing away with them. We only strengthen their fear and hatred\nof us. We have beaten them, and they are humiliated; yet we nurture\nthese resentful vipers who will one day kill us. Power cannot be dealt\nwith this way. It must be exterminated, crushed, and denied the chance\nto return to haunt us. This is all the truer with a former friend who has\nbecome an enemy. The law governing fatal antagonisms reads:\nReconcihation is out of die question. Only one side can win, and it\nmust win totally.\n\nLiu Pang learned this lesson well. After defeating Hsiang Yu, this\nson\n\ncondottieri wanted to hear. Once he reached Sinigagliu, Ccsare\nwould be an easy prey, caught between the citadel and their forces\nringing the town... The condottieri were sure they had military\nsuperiority, believing that the departure of the French troops had left\nCesare with only a small force. In fact, according to Machiavelli,\n[Borgia] had left Cesena with ten thousand infantrymen and three\nthousand horse, taking pains to split up his men so that they would\nmarch along parallel routes before converging on Sinigaglia. The\nreason for such a large force was that he knew, from a confession\nextracted from Ramiro de Lorca, what the condottieri had up their\nsleeve. He therefore decided to turn their own trap against them. This\nwas the masterpiece of trickery that the historian Paolo Giovio later\ncalled \u201cthe magnificent deceit.\u201d At dawn on December 3111502],\nCesare reached the outskirts of Sinigaglia... Led by Michelotto\nCorella, Cesare's advance guard of two hundred lances took up its\nposition on the canal bridge.... This control of the bridge effectively\nprevented the conspira-tors' troops from withdrawing. . . . Cesare\n\ngreeted the condottieri effusively and invited them to join him....\nMichelotto\n\nhad prepared the\n\nPalazzo Bernardino\n\nfor Cesare's use, and\n\nthe duke invited the\n\ncondottieri inside...\n\nOnce indoors the men\n\nwere quietlv arrested\n\nby guards who crept up\n\nfrom the rear... .\n\njCesare/ gave orders\n\nfor an attack on\n\nVitelli's and Orsini's\n\nsoldiers in the outlying\n\nareas.... That night,\n\nwhile their troops were\n\nbeing crushed, Miche-\n\nlotto throttled Olive-\n\nretto and Vitelli in the\n\nBernardino palace. ...\n\nA tone fell swoop,\n\n[Borgiaj had got rid of\n\nhis former generals and\n\nworst enemies.\n\nthh boroias,\n\nIvan Cloui.as,\n\nTo have ultimate\n\nvictory, you must be\n\nruthless.\n\nNapolkon Bonaparte. 1769-L821\n\nof a farmer went on to become supreme commander of the armies\nof Ch'u. Crushing his next rivalthe king of Ch'u, his own former\nleaderhe crowned himself emperor, defeated everyone in his path, and\nwent down in history as one of the greatest rulers of China, the\nimmortal Han Kao-tsu, founder of the Han Dynasty.\n\nThose who seek to achieve things should show no mercy.\n\nKautilya, Indian philosopher, third century B.C.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nWu Chao, born in A.D. 625, was the daughter of a duke, and as a\nbeautiful young woman of many charms, she was accordingly attached\nto the harem of Emperor T'ai Tsung.\n\nThe imperial harem was a dangerous place, full of young\nconcubines vying to become the emperor's favorite. Wu's beauty and\nforceful character quickly won her this battle, but, knowing that an\nemperor, like other powerful men, is a creature of whim, and that she\ncould easily be replaced, she kept her eye on the future.\n\nWu managed to seduce the emperor's dissolute son, Kao Tsung,\non the only possible occasion when she could find him alone: while he\nwas relieving himself at the royal urinal. Even so, when the emperor\ndied and Kao Tsung took over the throne, she still suffered the fate to\nwhich all wives and concubines of a deceased emperor were bound by\ntradition and law: Her head shaven, she entered a convent, for what\nwas supposed to be the rest of her life. For seven years Wu schemed to\nescape. By communicating in secret with the new emperor, and by\nbefriending his wife, the empress, she managed to get a highly unusual\nroyal edict allowing her to return to the palace and to the royal harem.\nOnce there, she fawned on the empress, while still sleeping with the\nemperor. The empress did not discourage thisshe had yet to provide the\nemperor with an heir, her position was vulnerable, and Wu was a\nvaluable ally.\n\nIn 654 Wu Chao gave birth to a child. One day the empress came\nto visit, and as soon as she had left, Wu smothered the newbornher\nown baby. When the murder was discovered, suspicion immediately\nfell on the empress, who had been on the scene moments earlier, and\nwhose jealous nature was known by all. This was precisely Wu's plan.\nShortly thereafter, the empress was charged with murder and executed.\nWu Chao was crowned empress in her place. Her new husband,\naddicted to his life of pleasure, gladly gave up the reins of government\nto Wu Chao, who was from then on known as Empress Wu.\n\nAlthough now in a position of great power, Wu hardly felt secure.\nThere were enemies everywhere; she could not let down her guard for\none moment. Indeed, when she was forty-one, she began to fear that\nher beautiful young niece was becoming the emperor's favorite. She\n\npoisoned the woman with a clay mixed into her food. In 675 her own\nson, touted as the\n\nheir apparent, was poisoned as well. The next-eldest\nsonillegitimate, but now the crown princewas exiled a little later on\ntrumped-up charges. And when the emperor died, in 683, Wu managed\nto have the son after that declared unfit for the throne. All this meant\nthat it was her youngest, most ineffectual son who finally became\nemperor. In this way she continued to rule.\n\nOver the next five years there were innumerable palace coups. All\nof them failed, and all of the conspirators were executed. By 688 mere\nwas no one left to challenge Wu. She proclaimed herself a divine\ndescendant of Buddha, and in 690 her wishes were finally granted: She\nwas named Holy and Divine \u201cEmperor\u201d of China.\n\nWu became emperor because there was literally nobody left from\nthe previous T'ang dynasty. And so she ruled unchallenged, for over a\ndecade of relative peace. In 705, at the age of eighty, she was forced to\nabdicate.\n\nInterpretation\n\nAll who knew Empress Wu remarked on her energy and\nintelligence. At the time, there was no glory available for an ambitious\nwoman beyond a few years in the imperial harem, then a lifetime\nwalled up in a convent. In Wu's gradual but remarkable rise to the top,\nshe was never naive. She knew that any hesitation, any momentary\nweakness, would spell her end. If, every time she got rid of a rival a\nnew one appeared, the solution was simple: She had to crush them all\nor be killed herself. Other emperors before her had followed the same\npath to the top, but Wuwho, as a woman, had next to no chance to gain\npowerhad to be more ruthless still.\n\nEmpress Wu's forty-year reign was one of the longest in Chinese\nhistory. Although the story of her bloody rise to power is well known,\nin China she is considered one of the period's most able and effective\nrulers.\n\nA priest asked the dying Spanish statesman and general Ramon\nMaria Narvdez\n\n(1800-1868), \u201cDoes your Excellency forgive all your enemies \u201d \u201cI\ndo not have to forgive my enemies, \u201d answered Narvdez, \u201cJ have had\nthem all shot. \u201d\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nIt is no accident that die two stories illustrating this law come\nfrom China: Chinese history abounds with examples of enemies who\nwere left alive and returned to haunt the lenient. \u201cCrush the enemy\u201d is\na key strategic tenet of Sun-tzu, the fourth-century-B.C. author of The\nArt of War. The idea is simple: Your enemies wish you ill. There is\nnothing they want more than to eliminate you. If, in your struggles\nwith them, you stop halfway or even three quarters of the way, out of\nmercy or hope of reconciliation, you only make them more\ndetermined, more embittered, and tiiey will someday take revenge.\nThey may act friendly for the time being, but this is only because you\nhave defeated them. They have no choice but to bide their time.\n\nThe solution: Have no mercy. Crush your enemies as totally as\nthey\n\nwould crush you. Ultimately the only peace and security you can\nhope for from your enemies is their disappearance.\n\nMao Tse-tung, a devoted reader of Sun-tzu and of Chinese history\ngenerally, knew the importance of this law. In 1934 the Communist\nleader and some 75,000 poorly equipped soldiers fled into the desolate\nmountains of western China to escape Chiang Kai-shek's much larger\narmy, in what has since been called the Long March.\n\nChiang was determined to eliminate every last Communist, and\nby a few years later Mao had less than 10,000 soldiers left. By 1937, in\nfact, when China was invaded by Japan, Chiang calculated that the\nCommunists were no longer a threat. He chose to give up the chase\nand concentrate on the Japanese. Ten years later the Communists had\nrecovered enough to rout Chiang's army. Chiang had forgotten the\nancient wisdom of crushing the enemy; Mao had not. Chiang was\npursued until he and his entire army fled to the island of Taiwan.\nNothing remains of his regime in mainland China to this day.\n\nThe wisdom behind \u201ccrushing the enemy\u201d is as ancient as the\nBible: Its first practitioner may have been Moses, who learned it from\nGod Himself, when He parted the Red Sea for the Jews, then let the\nwater flow back over the pursuing Egyptians so that \u201cnot so much as\none of them remained.\u201d When Moses returned from Mount Sinai with\nthe Ten Commandments and found his people worshipping the Golden\nCalf, he had every last offender slaughtered. And just before he died,\n\nhe told his followers, finally about to enter the Promised Land, that\nwhen they had defeated the tribes of Canaan they should \u201cutterly\ndestroy them . . . make no covenant with them, and show no mercy to\nthem.\u201d\n\nThe goal of total victory is an axiom of modem warfare, and was\ncodified as such by Carl von Clausewitz, the premier philosopher of\nwar. Analyzing the campaigns of Napoleon, von Clausewitz wrote,\n\u201cWe do claim that direct annihilation of the enemy's forces must\nalways be the dominant consideration... Once a major victory is\nachieved there must be no talk of rest, of breathing space . . . but only\nof the pursuit, going for the enemy again, seizing his capital, attacking\nhis reserves and anything else that might give his country aid and\ncomfort.\u201d The reason for this is that after war come negotiation and the\ndivision of territory. If you have only won a partial victory, you will\ninevitably lose in negotiation what you have gained by war.\n\nThe solution is simple: Allow your enemies no options.\nAnnihilate them and their territory is yours to carve. The goal of power\nis to control your enemies completely, to make them obey your will.\nYou cannot afford to go halfway. If they have no options, they will be\nforced to do your bidding. This law has applications far beyond the\nbattlefield. Negotiation is the insidious viper that will eat away at your\nvictory, so give your enemies nothing to negotiate, no hope, no room\nto maneuver. They are crushed and that is that.\n\nRealize this: In your struggle for power you will stir up rivalries\nand\n\ncreate enemies. There will be people you cannot win over, who\nwill remain your enemies no matter what. But whatever wound you\ninflicted on them, deliberately or not, do not take their hatred\npersonally. Just recognize that there is no possibility of peace between\nyou, especially as long as you stay in power. If you let them stick\naround, they will seek revenge, as certainly as night follows day. To\nwait for diem to show their cards is just silly; as Empress Wu\nunderstood, by then it will be too late.\n\nBe realistic: With an enemy like this around, you will never be\nsecure. Remember the lessons of history, and the wisdom of Moses\nand Mao: Never go halfway.\n\nIt is not, of course, a question of murder, it is a question of\nbanishment. Sufficiently weakened and then exiled from your court\nforever, your enemies are rendered harmless. They have no hope of\nrecovering, insinuating themselves and hurting you. And if they cannot\nbe banished, at least understand that they are plotting against you, and\npay no heed to whatever friendliness they feign. Your only weapon in\nsuch a situation is your own wariness. If you cannot banish them\nimmediately, then plot for the best time to act.\n\nImage: A Viper crushed beneadi your foot but left alive, will rear\nup and bite you with a double dose of venom. An enemy that is left\naround is like a half-dead viper that you nurse back to health. Time\nmakes the venom grow stronger.\n\nAuthority: For it must be noted, that men must either be caressed\nor else annihilated; they will revenge themselves for small injuries, but\ncannot do so for great ones; the injury therefore that we do to a man\nmust be such that we need not fear his vengeance. (Niccolo\nMachiavelli, 1469-1527)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nThis law should very rarely be ignored, but it does sometimes\nhappen that it is better to let your enemies destroy themselves, if such\na thing is possible, than to make them suffer by your hand. In warfare,\nfor example, a good general knows that if he attacks an army when it is\ncornered, its soldiers will fight much more fiercely. It is sometimes\nbetter, then, to leave them an escape route, a way out. As they retreat,\nthey wear themselves out, and are ultimately more demoralized by the\nretreat than by any defeat he might inflict on the battlefield. When you\nhave someone on the ropes, thenbut only when you are sure they have\nno chance of recoveryyou might let them hang themselves. Let them\nbe the agents of their own destruction. The result will be the same, and\nyou won't feel half as bad.\n\nFinally, sometimes by crushing an enemy, you embitter them so\nmuch that they spend years and years plotting revenge. The Treaty of\nVersailles had such an effect on the Germans. Some would argue that\nin the long run it would be better to show some leniency. The problem\nis, your leniency involves another riskit may embolden the enemy,\nwhich still harbors a grudge, but now has some room to operate. It is\n\n\nalmost always wiser to crush your enemy. If tfiey plot revenge years\nlater, do not let your guard down, but simply crush them again.\n'.

For the first time the tables were turned. Now it was\nHsiang who sued for peace. Liu's top adviser urged him to destroy\nHsiang, crush his army, show no mercy. \u201cTo let him go would be like\nrearing a tigerit will devour you later,\u201d the adviser said. Liu agreed.\n\nMaking a false treaty, he lured Hsiang into relaxing his defense,\nthen slaughtered almost all of his army. Hsiang managed to escape.\nAlone and on foot, knowing mat Liu had put a bounty on his head, he\ncame upon a small group of his own retreating soldiers, and cried out,\n\u201cT hear Liu Pang has offered one thousand pieces of gold and a fief of\nten thousand families for my head. Let me do you a favor.\u201d Then he\nslit his own throat and died.\n\nInterpretation\n\nHsiang Yu had proven his ruthlessness on many an occasion. He\nrarely hesitated in doing away witii a rival if it served his purposes.\nBut with Liu Pang he acted differently. He respected his rival, and did\n\n\nnot want to defeat him through deception; he wanted to prove his\nsuperiority on the battlefield, even to force the clever Liu to surrender\nand to serve him. Every time he had his rival in his hands, something\nmade him hesitatea fatal sympathy with or respect for the man who,\nafter all, had once been a friend and comrade in arms. But the moment\nHsiang made it clear that he intended to do away with Liu, yet failed to\naccomplish it, he sealed his own doom. Liu would not suffer the same\nhesitation once the tables were turned.\n\nThis is the fate that faces all of us when we sympathize with our\nenemies, when pity, or the hope of reconciliation, makes us pull back\nfrom doing away with them. We only strengthen their fear and hatred\nof us. We have beaten them, and they are humiliated; yet we nurture\nthese resentful vipers who will one day kill us. Power cannot be dealt\nwith this way. It must be exterminated, crushed, and denied the chance\nto return to haunt us. This is all the truer with a former friend who has\nbecome an enemy. The law governing fatal antagonisms reads:\nReconcihation is out of die question. Only one side can win, and it\nmust win totally.\n\nLiu Pang learned this lesson well. After defeating Hsiang Yu, this\nson\n\ncondottieri wanted to hear. Once he reached Sinigagliu, Ccsare\nwould be an easy prey, caught between the citadel and their forces\nringing the town... The condottieri were sure they had military\nsuperiority, believing that the departure of the French troops had left\nCesare with only a small force. In fact, according to Machiavelli,\n[Borgia] had left Cesena with ten thousand infantrymen and three\nthousand horse, taking pains to split up his men so that they would\nmarch along parallel routes before converging on Sinigaglia. The\nreason for such a large force was that he knew, from a confession\nextracted from Ramiro de Lorca, what the condottieri had up their\nsleeve. He therefore decided to turn their own trap against them. This\nwas the masterpiece of trickery that the historian Paolo Giovio later\ncalled \u201cthe magnificent deceit.\u201d At dawn on December 3111502],\nCesare reached the outskirts of Sinigaglia... Led by Michelotto\nCorella, Cesare's advance guard of two hundred lances took up its\nposition on the canal bridge.... This control of the bridge effectively\nprevented the conspira-tors' troops from withdrawing. . . . Cesare\n\ngreeted the condottieri effusively and invited them to join him....\nMichelotto\n\nhad prepared the\n\nPalazzo Bernardino\n\nfor Cesare's use, and\n\nthe duke invited the\n\ncondottieri inside...\n\nOnce indoors the men\n\nwere quietlv arrested\n\nby guards who crept up\n\nfrom the rear... .\n\njCesare/ gave orders\n\nfor an attack on\n\nVitelli's and Orsini's\n\nsoldiers in the outlying\n\nareas.... That night,\n\nwhile their troops were\n\nbeing crushed, Miche-\n\nlotto throttled Olive-\n\nretto and Vitelli in the\n\nBernardino palace. ...\n\nA tone fell swoop,\n\n[Borgiaj had got rid of\n\nhis former generals and\n\nworst enemies.\n\nthh boroias,\n\nIvan Cloui.as,\n\nTo have ultimate\n\nvictory, you must be\n\nruthless.\n\nNapolkon Bonaparte. 1769-L821\n\nof a farmer went on to become supreme commander of the armies\nof Ch'u. Crushing his next rivalthe king of Ch'u, his own former\nleaderhe crowned himself emperor, defeated everyone in his path, and\nwent down in history as one of the greatest rulers of China, the\nimmortal Han Kao-tsu, founder of the Han Dynasty.\n\nThose who seek to achieve things should show no mercy.\n\nKautilya, Indian philosopher, third century B.C.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nWu Chao, born in A.D. 625, was the daughter of a duke, and as a\nbeautiful young woman of many charms, she was accordingly attached\nto the harem of Emperor T'ai Tsung.\n\nThe imperial harem was a dangerous place, full of young\nconcubines vying to become the emperor's favorite. Wu's beauty and\nforceful character quickly won her this battle, but, knowing that an\nemperor, like other powerful men, is a creature of whim, and that she\ncould easily be replaced, she kept her eye on the future.\n\nWu managed to seduce the emperor's dissolute son, Kao Tsung,\non the only possible occasion when she could find him alone: while he\nwas relieving himself at the royal urinal. Even so, when the emperor\ndied and Kao Tsung took over the throne, she still suffered the fate to\nwhich all wives and concubines of a deceased emperor were bound by\ntradition and law: Her head shaven, she entered a convent, for what\nwas supposed to be the rest of her life. For seven years Wu schemed to\nescape. By communicating in secret with the new emperor, and by\nbefriending his wife, the empress, she managed to get a highly unusual\nroyal edict allowing her to return to the palace and to the royal harem.\nOnce there, she fawned on the empress, while still sleeping with the\nemperor. The empress did not discourage thisshe had yet to provide the\nemperor with an heir, her position was vulnerable, and Wu was a\nvaluable ally.\n\nIn 654 Wu Chao gave birth to a child. One day the empress came\nto visit, and as soon as she had left, Wu smothered the newbornher\nown baby. When the murder was discovered, suspicion immediately\nfell on the empress, who had been on the scene moments earlier, and\nwhose jealous nature was known by all. This was precisely Wu's plan.\nShortly thereafter, the empress was charged with murder and executed.\nWu Chao was crowned empress in her place. Her new husband,\naddicted to his life of pleasure, gladly gave up the reins of government\nto Wu Chao, who was from then on known as Empress Wu.\n\nAlthough now in a position of great power, Wu hardly felt secure.\nThere were enemies everywhere; she could not let down her guard for\none moment. Indeed, when she was forty-one, she began to fear that\nher beautiful young niece was becoming the emperor's favorite. She\n\npoisoned the woman with a clay mixed into her food. In 675 her own\nson, touted as the\n\nheir apparent, was poisoned as well. The next-eldest\nsonillegitimate, but now the crown princewas exiled a little later on\ntrumped-up charges. And when the emperor died, in 683, Wu managed\nto have the son after that declared unfit for the throne. All this meant\nthat it was her youngest, most ineffectual son who finally became\nemperor. In this way she continued to rule.\n\nOver the next five years there were innumerable palace coups. All\nof them failed, and all of the conspirators were executed. By 688 mere\nwas no one left to challenge Wu. She proclaimed herself a divine\ndescendant of Buddha, and in 690 her wishes were finally granted: She\nwas named Holy and Divine \u201cEmperor\u201d of China.\n\nWu became emperor because there was literally nobody left from\nthe previous T'ang dynasty. And so she ruled unchallenged, for over a\ndecade of relative peace. In 705, at the age of eighty, she was forced to\nabdicate.\n\nInterpretation\n\nAll who knew Empress Wu remarked on her energy and\nintelligence. At the time, there was no glory available for an ambitious\nwoman beyond a few years in the imperial harem, then a lifetime\nwalled up in a convent. In Wu's gradual but remarkable rise to the top,\nshe was never naive. She knew that any hesitation, any momentary\nweakness, would spell her end. If, every time she got rid of a rival a\nnew one appeared, the solution was simple: She had to crush them all\nor be killed herself. Other emperors before her had followed the same\npath to the top, but Wuwho, as a woman, had next to no chance to gain\npowerhad to be more ruthless still.\n\nEmpress Wu's forty-year reign was one of the longest in Chinese\nhistory. Although the story of her bloody rise to power is well known,\nin China she is considered one of the period's most able and effective\nrulers.\n\nA priest asked the dying Spanish statesman and general Ramon\nMaria Narvdez\n\n(1800-1868), \u201cDoes your Excellency forgive all your enemies \u201d \u201cI\ndo not have to forgive my enemies, \u201d answered Narvdez, \u201cJ have had\nthem all shot. \u201d\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nIt is no accident that die two stories illustrating this law come\nfrom China: Chinese history abounds with examples of enemies who\nwere left alive and returned to haunt the lenient. \u201cCrush the enemy\u201d is\na key strategic tenet of Sun-tzu, the fourth-century-B.C. author of The\nArt of War. The idea is simple: Your enemies wish you ill. There is\nnothing they want more than to eliminate you. If, in your struggles\nwith them, you stop halfway or even three quarters of the way, out of\nmercy or hope of reconciliation, you only make them more\ndetermined, more embittered, and tiiey will someday take revenge.\nThey may act friendly for the time being, but this is only because you\nhave defeated them. They have no choice but to bide their time.\n\nThe solution: Have no mercy. Crush your enemies as totally as\nthey\n\nwould crush you. Ultimately the only peace and security you can\nhope for from your enemies is their disappearance.\n\nMao Tse-tung, a devoted reader of Sun-tzu and of Chinese history\ngenerally, knew the importance of this law. In 1934 the Communist\nleader and some 75,000 poorly equipped soldiers fled into the desolate\nmountains of western China to escape Chiang Kai-shek's much larger\narmy, in what has since been called the Long March.\n\nChiang was determined to eliminate every last Communist, and\nby a few years later Mao had less than 10,000 soldiers left. By 1937, in\nfact, when China was invaded by Japan, Chiang calculated that the\nCommunists were no longer a threat. He chose to give up the chase\nand concentrate on the Japanese. Ten years later the Communists had\nrecovered enough to rout Chiang's army. Chiang had forgotten the\nancient wisdom of crushing the enemy; Mao had not. Chiang was\npursued until he and his entire army fled to the island of Taiwan.\nNothing remains of his regime in mainland China to this day.\n\nThe wisdom behind \u201ccrushing the enemy\u201d is as ancient as the\nBible: Its first practitioner may have been Moses, who learned it from\nGod Himself, when He parted the Red Sea for the Jews, then let the\nwater flow back over the pursuing Egyptians so that \u201cnot so much as\none of them remained.\u201d When Moses returned from Mount Sinai with\nthe Ten Commandments and found his people worshipping the Golden\nCalf, he had every last offender slaughtered. And just before he died,\n\nhe told his followers, finally about to enter the Promised Land, that\nwhen they had defeated the tribes of Canaan they should \u201cutterly\ndestroy them . . . make no covenant with them, and show no mercy to\nthem.\u201d\n\nThe goal of total victory is an axiom of modem warfare, and was\ncodified as such by Carl von Clausewitz, the premier philosopher of\nwar. Analyzing the campaigns of Napoleon, von Clausewitz wrote,\n\u201cWe do claim that direct annihilation of the enemy's forces must\nalways be the dominant consideration... Once a major victory is\nachieved there must be no talk of rest, of breathing space . . . but only\nof the pursuit, going for the enemy again, seizing his capital, attacking\nhis reserves and anything else that might give his country aid and\ncomfort.\u201d The reason for this is that after war come negotiation and the\ndivision of territory. If you have only won a partial victory, you will\ninevitably lose in negotiation what you have gained by war.\n\nThe solution is simple: Allow your enemies no options.\nAnnihilate them and their territory is yours to carve. The goal of power\nis to control your enemies completely, to make them obey your will.\nYou cannot afford to go halfway. If they have no options, they will be\nforced to do your bidding. This law has applications far beyond the\nbattlefield. Negotiation is the insidious viper that will eat away at your\nvictory, so give your enemies nothing to negotiate, no hope, no room\nto maneuver. They are crushed and that is that.\n\nRealize this: In your struggle for power you will stir up rivalries\nand\n\ncreate enemies. There will be people you cannot win over, who\nwill remain your enemies no matter what. But whatever wound you\ninflicted on them, deliberately or not, do not take their hatred\npersonally. Just recognize that there is no possibility of peace between\nyou, especially as long as you stay in power. If you let them stick\naround, they will seek revenge, as certainly as night follows day. To\nwait for diem to show their cards is just silly; as Empress Wu\nunderstood, by then it will be too late.\n\nBe realistic: With an enemy like this around, you will never be\nsecure. Remember the lessons of history, and the wisdom of Moses\nand Mao: Never go halfway.\n\nIt is not, of course, a question of murder, it is a question of\nbanishment. Sufficiently weakened and then exiled from your court\nforever, your enemies are rendered harmless. They have no hope of\nrecovering, insinuating themselves and hurting you. And if they cannot\nbe banished, at least understand that they are plotting against you, and\npay no heed to whatever friendliness they feign. Your only weapon in\nsuch a situation is your own wariness. If you cannot banish them\nimmediately, then plot for the best time to act.\n\nImage: A Viper crushed beneadi your foot but left alive, will rear\nup and bite you with a double dose of venom. An enemy that is left\naround is like a half-dead viper that you nurse back to health. Time\nmakes the venom grow stronger.\n\nAuthority: For it must be noted, that men must either be caressed\nor else annihilated; they will revenge themselves for small injuries, but\ncannot do so for great ones; the injury therefore that we do to a man\nmust be such that we need not fear his vengeance. (Niccolo\nMachiavelli, 1469-1527)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nThis law should very rarely be ignored, but it does sometimes\nhappen that it is better to let your enemies destroy themselves, if such\na thing is possible, than to make them suffer by your hand. In warfare,\nfor example, a good general knows that if he attacks an army when it is\ncornered, its soldiers will fight much more fiercely. It is sometimes\nbetter, then, to leave them an escape route, a way out. As they retreat,\nthey wear themselves out, and are ultimately more demoralized by the\nretreat than by any defeat he might inflict on the battlefield. When you\nhave someone on the ropes, thenbut only when you are sure they have\nno chance of recoveryyou might let them hang themselves. Let them\nbe the agents of their own destruction. The result will be the same, and\nyou won't feel half as bad.\n\nFinally, sometimes by crushing an enemy, you embitter them so\nmuch that they spend years and years plotting revenge. The Treaty of\nVersailles had such an effect on the Germans. Some would argue that\nin the long run it would be better to show some leniency. The problem\nis, your leniency involves another riskit may embolden the enemy,\nwhich still harbors a grudge, but now has some room to operate. It is\n\n\nalmost always wiser to crush your enemy. If tfiey plot revenge years\nlater, do not let your guard down, but simply crush them again.\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

La Fontaine. 1621-1695\n\nTRANSGRESSION AND OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW Sir\nGuillaume de Balaun was a troubadour who roamed the South of\nFrance in the Middle Ages, going from castle to castle, reciting poetry,\nand playing the perfect knight. At the castle of Javiac he met and fell\nin love with the beautiful lady of the house, Madame Guillelma de\nJaviac. He sang her his songs, recited his poetry, played chess with her,\nand little by little she in turn fell in love with him. Guillaume had a\nfriend, Sir Pierre de Bar-jac, who traveled with him and who was also\n\nreceived at the casde. And Pierre too fell in love with a lady in Javiac,\nthe gracious but temperamental Viernetta.\n\nThen one day Pierre and Viernetta had a violent quarrel. The lady\ndismissed him, and he sought out his friend Guillaume to help heal the\nbreach and get him back in her good graces. Guillaume was about to\nleave the castle for a while, but on his return, several weeks later, he\nworked his magic, and Pierre and the lady were reconciled. Pierre felt\nthat his love had increased tenfoldthat there was no stronger love, in\nfact, than the love that follows reconciliation. The stronger and longer\nthe disagreement, he told Guillaume, the sweeter the feeling that\ncomes with peace and rapprochement.\n\nAs a troubadour, Sir Guillaume prided himself on experiencing all\nthe joys and sorrows of love. On hearing his friend's talk, he too\nwanted know the bliss of reconciliation after a quarrel. He therefore\nfeigned great anger with Lady Guillelma, stopped sending her love\nletters, and abruptly left the casde and stayed away, even during the\nfestivals and hunts. This drove the young lady wild.\n\nGuillelma sent messengers to Guillaume to find out what had\nhappened, but he turned the messengers away. He thought all this\nwould make her angry, forcing him to plead for reconciliation as Pierre\nhad. Instead, however, his absence had the opposite effect: It made\nGuillelma love him all the more. Now the lady pursued her knight,\nsending messengers and love notes of her own. This was almost\nunheard ofa lady never pursued her troubadour. And Guillaume did not\nlike it. Guillelma's forwardness made him feel she had lost some of her\ndignity. Not only was he no longer sure of his plan, he was no longer\nsure of his lady.\n\nFinally, after several months of not hearing from Guillaume,\nGuillelma gave up. She sent him no more messengers, and he began to\nwonderperhaps she was angry Perhaps the plan had worked after all So\nmuch the better if she was. He would wait no moreit was time to\nreconcile. So he put on his best robe, decked the horse in its fanciest\ncaparison, chose a magnificent helmet, and rode off to Javiac.\n\nOn hearing that her beloved had returned, Guillelma rushed to see\nhim, knelt before him, dropped her veil to kiss him, and begged\nforgiveness for whatever slight had caused his anger. Imagine his\nconfusion and despairhis plan had failed abysmally. She was not angry,\n\nshe had never been angry, she was only deeper in love, and he would\nnever experience the joy of reconciliation after a quarrel. Seeing her\nnow, and still desperate\n\nto taste that joy, he decided to try one more time: He drove her\naway with harsh words and threatening gestures. She left, this time\nvowing never to see him again.\n\nThe next morning the troubadour regretted what he had done. He\nrode back to Javiac, but the lady would not receive him, and ordered\nher servants to chase him away, across the drawbridge and over the\nhill. Guil-laume fled. Back in his chamber he collapsed and started to\ncry: He had made a terrible mistake. Over the next year, unable to see\nhis lady, he experienced the absence, the terrible absence, that can only\ninflame love. He wrote one of his most beautiful poems, \u201cMy song\nascends for mercy praying.\u201d And he sent many letters to Guillelma,\nexplaining what he had done, and begging forgiveness.\n\nAfter a great deal of this, Lady Guillelma, remembering his\nbeautiful songs, his handsome figure, and his skills in dancing and\nfalconry, found herself yearning to have him back. As penance for his\ncruelty, she ordered him to remove the nail from the little finger of his\nright hand, and to send it to her along with a poem describing his\nmiseries.\n\nHe did as she asked. Finally Guillaume de Balaun was able to\ntaste the ultimate sensationa reconciliation even surpassing that of his\ntiend Pierre.\n\nInterpretation\n\nTrying to discover the joys of reconciliation, Guillaume de\nBalaun inadvertently experienced the truth of the law of absence and\npresence. At the start of an affair, you need to heighten your presence\nin the eyes of the other. If you absent yourself too early, you may be\n\u2018orgotten. But once your lover's emotions are engaged, and the feeling\nof love has crystallized, absence inflames and excites. Giving no\nreason for your absence excites even more: The other person assumes\nhe or she is at fault. While you are away, die lover's imagination takes\nflight, and a stimulated imagination cannot help but make love grow\nstronger. Conversely, the more Guillelma pursued Guillaume, the less\nhe loved hershe had become too present, too accessible, leaving no\nroom for his imagination and fancy, so that his feelings were\n\n\nsuffocating. When she finally stopped sending messengers, he was\nable to breathe again, and to return to his plan.\n\nWhat witiidraws, what becomes scarce, suddenly seems to\ndeserve our respect and honor. What stays too long, inundating us with\nits presence, makes us disdain it. In the Middle Ages, ladies were\nconstantiy putting their knights through trials of love, sending them on\nsome long and arduous questall to create a pattern of absence and\npresence. Indeed, had Guillaume not left his lady in the first place, she\nmight have been forced to send him away, creating an absence of her\nown.\n\nAbsence diminishes minor passions and inflames great ones, as\nthe wind douses a candle and fans afire.\n\nLa Rochefoucauld, 1613-1680\n\nWhile serving under the Duke Ai of Lit, Tien Jao, resenting his\nobscure position, said to his master, \u201cI am going to wander far away\nlike a snow goose. \u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean by thai \u201d inquired the Duke.\n\n\u201cDo you see the cock \u201d said T'ien Jao in reply. \u201cIts crest is a\nsymbol of civility; its powerful talons suggest strength; its daring to\nfight any enemy denotes courage; its instinct to invite others whenever\nfood is obtained shows benevolence; and, last but not least, its\npunctuality in keeping the time through the night gives us an example\nof veracity. In spite, however, of these five virtues, the cock is daily\nkilled to fill a dish on your table. Why The reason is that it is found\nwithin our reach. On the other hand, the snow goose traverses in one\nflight a thousand li. Resting in your garden, it preys on your fishes and\nturtles and pecks your millet. Though devoid of any of the cock's five\nvirtues, yet you prize this bird for the sake of its scarcity. This being\nso, I shall fly far like a snow goose. \u201d\n\nANCIFNT CHINESE PARABLES,\n\nYu Hsiu Sen, eix, 1974\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nFor many centuries the Assyrians ruled upper Asia widi an iron\nfist. In the eighth century B.C., however, the people of Medea (now\nnorthwestern Iran) revolted against them, and finally broke free. Now\nthe Medes had to establish a new government. Determined to avoid\nany form of despotism, they refused to give ultimate power to any one\n\nman, or to establish a monarchy. Without a leader, however, the\ncountry soon fell into chaos, and fractured into small kingdoms, with\nvillage fighting against village.\n\nIn one such village lived a man named Deioces, who began to\nmake a name for himself for fair dealing and the ability to settle\ndisputes.\n\nHe did this so successfully, in fact, that soon any legal conflict in\nthe area was brought to him, and his power increased. Throughout the\nland, the law had fallen into disreputethe judges were corrupt, and no\none entrusted their cases to the courts any more, resorting to violence\ninstead. When news spread of Deioces' wisdom, incorruptibility, and\nunshakable impartiality, Medean villages far and wide turned to him to\nsettle all manner of cases. Soon he became the sole arbiter of justice in\nthe land.\n\nAt the height of his power, Deioces suddenly decided he had had\nenough. He would no longer sit in the chair of judgment, would hear\nno more suits, setde no more disputes between brother and brother,\nvillage and village. Complaining that he was spending so much time\ndealing with other people's problems that he had neglected his own\naffairs, he retired. The country once again descended into chaos. With\nthe sudden withdrawal of a powerful arbiter like Deioces, crime\nincreased, and contempt for the law was never greater. The Medes held\na meeting of all the villages to decide how to get out of their\npredicament. \u201cWe cannot continue to live in this country under these\nconditions,\u201d said one tribal leader. \u201cLet us appoint one of our number\nto rule so that we can live under orderly government, rather man losing\nour homes altogedier in the present chaos.\u201d\n\nAnd so, despite all that the Medes had suffered under the\nAssyrian despotism, they decided to set up a monarchy and name a\nking. And the man they most wanted to rule, of course, was the fair-\nminded Deioces. He was hard to convince, for he wanted nothing more\nto do with the villages\u2019 infighting and bickering, but the Medes begged\nand pleadedwithout him die country had descended into a state of\nlawlessness. Deioces finally agreed.\n\nYet he also imposed conditions. An enormous palace was to be\nconstructed for him, he was to be provided with bodyguards, and a\ncapital city was to be built from which he could rule. All of this was\n\ndone, and Deioces settled into his palace. In the center of the capital,\nthe palace was surrounded by walls, and completely inaccessible to\nordinary people. Deioces then established the terms of his rule:\nAdmission to his presence was forbidden. Communication with the\nking was only possible through messengers. No one in the royal court\ncould see him more than once a week, and then only by permission.\n\nDeioces ruled for fifty-three years, extended the Medean empire,\nand established die foundation for what would later be the Persian\nempire, under his great-great-grandson Cyrus. During Deioces' reign,\nthe people's\n\nrespect for him gradually turned into a form of worship: He was\nnot a mere mortal, they believed, but the son of a god.\n\nInterpretation\n\nDeioces was a man of great ambition. He determined early on that\nthe\n\ncountry needed a strong ruler, and that he was die man for the job.\n\nIn a land plagued with anarchy, the most powerful man is the\njudge and arbiter. So Deioces began his career by making his\nreputation as a man of impeccable fairness.\n\nAt the height of his power as a judge, however, Deioces realized\ndie truth of the law of absence and presence: By serving so many\nclients, he had become too noticeable, too available, and had lost die\nrespect he had earlier enjoyed. People were taking his services for\ngranted. The only way to regain the veneration and power he wanted\nwas to witiidraw completely, and let die Medes taste what life was like\nwidiout him.

A\nstrong presence will draw power and attention to youyou shine more\nbrighdy man those around you. But a point is inevitably reached where\ntoo much presence creates me opposite effect: The more you are seen\nand heard from, die more your value degrades. You become a habit.\nNo matter how hard you try to be different, subdy, without your\nknowing why, people respect you less and less. At the right moment\nyou must learn to witiidraw yourself before diey unconsciously push\nyou away. It is a game of hide-and-seek.\n\nThe truth of this law can most easily be appreciated in matters of\nlove and seduction. In the beginning stages of an affair, the lover's\nabsence stimulates your imagination, forming a sort of aura around\nhim or her. But mis aura fades when you know too muchwhen your\nimagination no longer has room to roam. The loved one becomes a\nperson like anyone else, a person whose presence is taken for granted.\nThis is why the seventeenth-century French courtesan Ninon de\nLenclos advised constant feints at withdrawal from one's lover. \u201cLove\nnever dies of starvation,\u201d she wrote, \u201cbut often of indigestion.\u201d\n\nThe moment you allow yourself to be treated like anyone else, it\nis too lateyou are swallowed and digested. To prevent this you need to\nstarve the other person of your presence. Force their respect by\nthreatening them with the possibility that they will lose you for good;\ncreate a pattern of presence and absence.\n\nOnce you die, everything about you will seem different You will\nbe surrounded by an instant aura of respect. People will remember\ntheir criticisms of you, their arguments with you, and will be filled\nwith regret and guilt. They are missing a presence mat will never\nreturn. But you do not have to wait until you die: By completely\nwithdrawing for a while, you create a kind of death before death. And\nwhen you come back, it will be as if you had come back from the\ndeadan air of resurrection will cling to you, and people will be relieved\nat your return. This is how Deioces made himself king.\n\nNapoleon was recognizing the law of absence and presence when\nhe said, \u201cIf I am often seen at the theater, people will cease to notice\n\nme.\u201d Today, in a world inundated with presence through the flood of\nimages, the game of withdrawal is all the more powerful. We rarely\nknow when to witiidraw anymore, and nothing seems private, so we\nare awed by anyone who is able to disappear by choice. Novelists J. D.\nSalinger and Thomas Pynchon have created cultlike followings by\nknowing when to disappear.\n\nAnother, more everyday side of this law, but one that\ndemonstrates its truth even further, is the law of scarcity in the science\nof economics. By withdrawing something from the market, you create\ninstant value. In seventeenth-century Holland, the upper classes\nwanted to make die tulip more than just a beautiful flowerthey wanted\nit to be a kind of status symbol. Making the flower scarce, indeed\nalmost impossible to obtain, they sparked what was later called\ntulipomania. A single flower was now worth more than its weight in\ngold. In our own century, similarly, the art dealer Joseph Duveen\ninsisted on making the paintings he sold as scarce and rare as possible.\nTo keep their prices elevated and their status high, he bought up whole\ncollections and stored them in his basement. The paintings that he sold\nbecame more than just paintings!they were fetish objects, their value\nincreased by their rarity. \u201cYou can get all the pictures you want at fifty\nthousand dollars apiecethat's easy,\u201d he once said. \u201cBut to get pictures\nat a quarter of a million apiecethat wants doing!\u201d\n\nImage:\n\nThe Sun.

But too many\n\nhot days and the sun overwhelms.\n\nLearn to keep yourself obscure and\n\nmake people demand your return.\n\nExtend the law of scarcity to your own skills. Make what you are\noffering the world rare and hard to find, and you instandy increase its\nvalue.\n\nThere always comes a moment when those in power overstay\ntheir welcome. We have grown tired of them, lost respect for them; we\nsee them as no different from the rest of mankind, which is to say that\nwe see them as rather worse, since we inevitably compare their current\n\nstatus in our eyes to their former one. There is an art to knowing when\nto retire. If it is done right, you regain the respect you had lost, and\nretain a part of your power.\n\nThe greatest ruler of the sixteenth century was Charles V. King of\nSpain, Hapsburg emperor, he governed an empire tiiat at one point\nincluded much of Europe and the New World. Yet at the height of his\npower, in 1557, he retired to die monastery of Yuste.

In more recent times, die film actress Greta Garbo was never\nmore admired dian when she retired, in 1941. For some her absence\ncame too soonshe was in her mid-thirtiesbut she wisely preferred to\nleave on her own terms, rather dian waiting for her audience to grow\ntired of her.\n\nMake yourself too available and die aura of power you have\ncreated around yourself will wear away. Turn the game around: Make\nyourself less accessible and you increase die value of your presence.\n\nAuthority. Use absence to create respect and esteem. If presence\ndiminishes fame, absence augments it. A man who when absent is\nregarded as a lion becomes when present something common and\nridiculous. Talents lose their luster if we become too familiar with\nthem, for the outer shell of the mind is more readily seen than its rich\ninner kernel. Even the outstanding genius makes use of retirement so\nthat men may honor him and so that the yearning aroused by his\nabsence may cause him to be esteemed. (Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nThis law only applies once a certain level of power has been\nattained. The need to withdraw only comes after you have established\nyour presence; leave too early and you do not increase your respect,\nyou are simply forgotten. When you are first entering onto the world's\nstage, create an image that is recognizable, reproducible, and is seen\neverywhere.

La Fontaine. 1621-1695\n\nTRANSGRESSION AND OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW Sir\nGuillaume de Balaun was a troubadour who roamed the South of\nFrance in the Middle Ages, going from castle to castle, reciting poetry,\nand playing the perfect knight. At the castle of Javiac he met and fell\nin love with the beautiful lady of the house, Madame Guillelma de\nJaviac. He sang her his songs, recited his poetry, played chess with her,\nand little by little she in turn fell in love with him. Guillaume had a\nfriend, Sir Pierre de Bar-jac, who traveled with him and who was also\n\nreceived at the casde. And Pierre too fell in love with a lady in Javiac,\nthe gracious but temperamental Viernetta.\n\nThen one day Pierre and Viernetta had a violent quarrel. The lady\ndismissed him, and he sought out his friend Guillaume to help heal the\nbreach and get him back in her good graces. Guillaume was about to\nleave the castle for a while, but on his return, several weeks later, he\nworked his magic, and Pierre and the lady were reconciled. Pierre felt\nthat his love had increased tenfoldthat there was no stronger love, in\nfact, than the love that follows reconciliation. The stronger and longer\nthe disagreement, he told Guillaume, the sweeter the feeling that\ncomes with peace and rapprochement.\n\nAs a troubadour, Sir Guillaume prided himself on experiencing all\nthe joys and sorrows of love. On hearing his friend's talk, he too\nwanted know the bliss of reconciliation after a quarrel. He therefore\nfeigned great anger with Lady Guillelma, stopped sending her love\nletters, and abruptly left the casde and stayed away, even during the\nfestivals and hunts. This drove the young lady wild.\n\nGuillelma sent messengers to Guillaume to find out what had\nhappened, but he turned the messengers away. He thought all this\nwould make her angry, forcing him to plead for reconciliation as Pierre\nhad. Instead, however, his absence had the opposite effect: It made\nGuillelma love him all the more. Now the lady pursued her knight,\nsending messengers and love notes of her own. This was almost\nunheard ofa lady never pursued her troubadour. And Guillaume did not\nlike it. Guillelma's forwardness made him feel she had lost some of her\ndignity. Not only was he no longer sure of his plan, he was no longer\nsure of his lady.\n\nFinally, after several months of not hearing from Guillaume,\nGuillelma gave up. She sent him no more messengers, and he began to\nwonderperhaps she was angry Perhaps the plan had worked after all So\nmuch the better if she was. He would wait no moreit was time to\nreconcile. So he put on his best robe, decked the horse in its fanciest\ncaparison, chose a magnificent helmet, and rode off to Javiac.\n\nOn hearing that her beloved had returned, Guillelma rushed to see\nhim, knelt before him, dropped her veil to kiss him, and begged\nforgiveness for whatever slight had caused his anger. Imagine his\nconfusion and despairhis plan had failed abysmally. She was not angry,\n\nshe had never been angry, she was only deeper in love, and he would\nnever experience the joy of reconciliation after a quarrel. Seeing her\nnow, and still desperate\n\nto taste that joy, he decided to try one more time: He drove her\naway with harsh words and threatening gestures. She left, this time\nvowing never to see him again.\n\nThe next morning the troubadour regretted what he had done. He\nrode back to Javiac, but the lady would not receive him, and ordered\nher servants to chase him away, across the drawbridge and over the\nhill. Guil-laume fled. Back in his chamber he collapsed and started to\ncry: He had made a terrible mistake. Over the next year, unable to see\nhis lady, he experienced the absence, the terrible absence, that can only\ninflame love. He wrote one of his most beautiful poems, \u201cMy song\nascends for mercy praying.\u201d And he sent many letters to Guillelma,\nexplaining what he had done, and begging forgiveness.\n\nAfter a great deal of this, Lady Guillelma, remembering his\nbeautiful songs, his handsome figure, and his skills in dancing and\nfalconry, found herself yearning to have him back. As penance for his\ncruelty, she ordered him to remove the nail from the little finger of his\nright hand, and to send it to her along with a poem describing his\nmiseries.\n\nHe did as she asked. Finally Guillaume de Balaun was able to\ntaste the ultimate sensationa reconciliation even surpassing that of his\ntiend Pierre.\n\nInterpretation\n\nTrying to discover the joys of reconciliation, Guillaume de\nBalaun inadvertently experienced the truth of the law of absence and\npresence. At the start of an affair, you need to heighten your presence\nin the eyes of the other. If you absent yourself too early, you may be\n\u2018orgotten. But once your lover's emotions are engaged, and the feeling\nof love has crystallized, absence inflames and excites. Giving no\nreason for your absence excites even more: The other person assumes\nhe or she is at fault. While you are away, die lover's imagination takes\nflight, and a stimulated imagination cannot help but make love grow\nstronger. Conversely, the more Guillelma pursued Guillaume, the less\nhe loved hershe had become too present, too accessible, leaving no\nroom for his imagination and fancy, so that his feelings were\n\n\nsuffocating. When she finally stopped sending messengers, he was\nable to breathe again, and to return to his plan.\n\nWhat witiidraws, what becomes scarce, suddenly seems to\ndeserve our respect and honor. What stays too long, inundating us with\nits presence, makes us disdain it. In the Middle Ages, ladies were\nconstantiy putting their knights through trials of love, sending them on\nsome long and arduous questall to create a pattern of absence and\npresence. Indeed, had Guillaume not left his lady in the first place, she\nmight have been forced to send him away, creating an absence of her\nown.\n\nAbsence diminishes minor passions and inflames great ones, as\nthe wind douses a candle and fans afire.\n\nLa Rochefoucauld, 1613-1680\n\nWhile serving under the Duke Ai of Lit, Tien Jao, resenting his\nobscure position, said to his master, \u201cI am going to wander far away\nlike a snow goose. \u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean by thai \u201d inquired the Duke.\n\n\u201cDo you see the cock \u201d said T'ien Jao in reply. \u201cIts crest is a\nsymbol of civility; its powerful talons suggest strength; its daring to\nfight any enemy denotes courage; its instinct to invite others whenever\nfood is obtained shows benevolence; and, last but not least, its\npunctuality in keeping the time through the night gives us an example\nof veracity. In spite, however, of these five virtues, the cock is daily\nkilled to fill a dish on your table. Why The reason is that it is found\nwithin our reach. On the other hand, the snow goose traverses in one\nflight a thousand li. Resting in your garden, it preys on your fishes and\nturtles and pecks your millet. Though devoid of any of the cock's five\nvirtues, yet you prize this bird for the sake of its scarcity. This being\nso, I shall fly far like a snow goose. \u201d\n\nANCIFNT CHINESE PARABLES,\n\nYu Hsiu Sen, eix, 1974\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nFor many centuries the Assyrians ruled upper Asia widi an iron\nfist. In the eighth century B.C., however, the people of Medea (now\nnorthwestern Iran) revolted against them, and finally broke free. Now\nthe Medes had to establish a new government. Determined to avoid\nany form of despotism, they refused to give ultimate power to any one\n\nman, or to establish a monarchy. Without a leader, however, the\ncountry soon fell into chaos, and fractured into small kingdoms, with\nvillage fighting against village.\n\nIn one such village lived a man named Deioces, who began to\nmake a name for himself for fair dealing and the ability to settle\ndisputes.\n\nHe did this so successfully, in fact, that soon any legal conflict in\nthe area was brought to him, and his power increased. Throughout the\nland, the law had fallen into disreputethe judges were corrupt, and no\none entrusted their cases to the courts any more, resorting to violence\ninstead. When news spread of Deioces' wisdom, incorruptibility, and\nunshakable impartiality, Medean villages far and wide turned to him to\nsettle all manner of cases. Soon he became the sole arbiter of justice in\nthe land.\n\nAt the height of his power, Deioces suddenly decided he had had\nenough. He would no longer sit in the chair of judgment, would hear\nno more suits, setde no more disputes between brother and brother,\nvillage and village. Complaining that he was spending so much time\ndealing with other people's problems that he had neglected his own\naffairs, he retired. The country once again descended into chaos. With\nthe sudden withdrawal of a powerful arbiter like Deioces, crime\nincreased, and contempt for the law was never greater. The Medes held\na meeting of all the villages to decide how to get out of their\npredicament. \u201cWe cannot continue to live in this country under these\nconditions,\u201d said one tribal leader. \u201cLet us appoint one of our number\nto rule so that we can live under orderly government, rather man losing\nour homes altogedier in the present chaos.\u201d\n\nAnd so, despite all that the Medes had suffered under the\nAssyrian despotism, they decided to set up a monarchy and name a\nking. And the man they most wanted to rule, of course, was the fair-\nminded Deioces. He was hard to convince, for he wanted nothing more\nto do with the villages\u2019 infighting and bickering, but the Medes begged\nand pleadedwithout him die country had descended into a state of\nlawlessness. Deioces finally agreed.\n\nYet he also imposed conditions. An enormous palace was to be\nconstructed for him, he was to be provided with bodyguards, and a\ncapital city was to be built from which he could rule. All of this was\n\ndone, and Deioces settled into his palace. In the center of the capital,\nthe palace was surrounded by walls, and completely inaccessible to\nordinary people. Deioces then established the terms of his rule:\nAdmission to his presence was forbidden. Communication with the\nking was only possible through messengers. No one in the royal court\ncould see him more than once a week, and then only by permission.\n\nDeioces ruled for fifty-three years, extended the Medean empire,\nand established die foundation for what would later be the Persian\nempire, under his great-great-grandson Cyrus. During Deioces' reign,\nthe people's\n\nrespect for him gradually turned into a form of worship: He was\nnot a mere mortal, they believed, but the son of a god.\n\nInterpretation\n\nDeioces was a man of great ambition. He determined early on that\nthe\n\ncountry needed a strong ruler, and that he was die man for the job.\n\nIn a land plagued with anarchy, the most powerful man is the\njudge and arbiter. So Deioces began his career by making his\nreputation as a man of impeccable fairness.\n\nAt the height of his power as a judge, however, Deioces realized\ndie truth of the law of absence and presence: By serving so many\nclients, he had become too noticeable, too available, and had lost die\nrespect he had earlier enjoyed. People were taking his services for\ngranted. The only way to regain the veneration and power he wanted\nwas to witiidraw completely, and let die Medes taste what life was like\nwidiout him. As he expected, diey came begging for him to rule.\n\nOnce Deioces had discovered the truth of this law, he carried it to\nits ultimate realization. In the palace his people had built for him, none\ncould see him except a few courtiers, and those only rarely. As\nHerodotus wrote, \u201cThere was a risk that if they saw him habitually, it\nmight lead to jealousy and resentment, and plots would follow; but if\nnobody saw him, the legend would grow that he was a being of a\ndifferent order from mere men.\u201d\n\nA man said to a Dervish: \u201cWhy do I not see you more often \u201d The\nDervish\n\nreplied, \"Because the words 'Why have you not been to see me\u2019\nare\n\nsweeter to my ear than the words 'Why have you come again\u2019\n\nMulla Jami, quoted in Idries Shah's Caravan of Dreams, 1968\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nEverything in the world depends on absence and presence.

A man who is willing to commit suicide has the initiative.\u201d\n\nFischer finally arrived in Reykjavik, but the problems, and the\nthreat of cancellation, continued. He disliked the hall where the match\nwas to be fought, he criticized the lighting, he complained about die\nnoise of the cameras, he even hated the chairs in which he and Spassky\n\nwere to sit. Now the Soviet Union took the initiative and threatened to\nwithdraw their man.\n\nThe bluff apparendy worked: After all die weeks of waiting, the\nendless and infuriating negotiations, Fischer agreed to play. Everyone\nwas relieved, no one more than Spassky. But on die day of the official\nintroductions, Fischer arrived very late, and on the day when the\n\u201cMatch of the Century\u201d was to begin, he was late again. This time,\nhowever, the consequences would be dire: If he showed up too late he\nwould forfeit die first game. What was going on Was he playing some\nsort of mind game Or was Bobby Fischer perhaps afraid of Boris\nSpassky It seemed to the assembled grand masters, and to Spassky,\nthat this young kid from Brooklyn had a terrible case of the jitters. At\n5:09 Fischer showed up, exactly one minute before die match was to\nbe canceled.\n\nThe first game of a chess tournament is critical, since it sets the\ntone for die months to come. It is often a slow and quiet struggle, with\nthe two players preparing themselves for the war and trying to read\neach other's strategies. This game was different Fischer made a terrible\nmove early on, perhaps the worst of his career, and when Spassky had\nhim on die ropes, he seemed to give up. Yet Spassky knew diat Fischer\nnever gave up. Even when facing checkmate, he fought to the bitter\nend, wearing the opponent down. This time, diough, he seemed\nresigned. Then suddenly he broke out a bold move that put the room in\na buzz. The move shocked Spassky, but he recovered and managed to\nwin the game. But no one could figure out what Fischer was up to.\nHad he lost deliberately Or was he rattled Unset-ded Even, as some\nthought, insane\n\nAfter his defeat in the first game, Fischer complained all the more\nloudly about die room, die cameras, and everything else. He also failed\nto\n\nshow up on time for die second game. This time the organizers\nhad had enough: He was given a forfeit. Now he was down two games\nto none, a position from which no one had ever come back to win a\nchess championship. Fischer was clearly unhinged. Yet in the third\ngame, as all those who witnessed it remember, he had a ferocious look\nin his eye, a look that clearly bothered Spassky. And despite the hole\nhe had dug for himself, he seemed supremely confident. He did make\n\nwhat appeared to be another blunder, as he had in the first gamebut his\ncocky air made Spassky smell a trap. Yet despite die Russian's\nsuspicions, he could not figure out the trap, and before he knew it\nFischer had checkmated him. In fact Fischer's unorthodox tactics had\ncompletely unnerved his opponent. At the end of the game, Fischer\nleaped up and rushed out, yelling to his confederates as he smashed a\nfist into his palm, \u201cI'm crushing him with brute force!\u201d\n\nIn the next games Fischer pulled moves that no one had seen from\nhim before, moves that were not his style. Now Spassky started to\nmake blunders. After losing the sixth game, he started to cry. One\ngrand master said, \u201cAfter diis, Spassky's got to ask himself if it's safe\nto go back to Russia.\u201d After the eighth game Spassky decided he knew\nwhat was happening: Bobby Fischer was hypnotizing him. He decided\nnot to look Fischer in the eye; he lost anyway.\n\nAfter the fourteenth game he called a staff conference and\nannounced, \u201cAn attempt is being made to control my mind.\u201d He\nwondered whether the orange juice they drank at the chess table could\nhave been drugged. Maybe chemicals were being blown into die air.\nFinally Spassky went public, accusing the Fischer team of putting\nsomething in the chairs that was altering Spassky's mind. The KGB\nwent on alert: Boris Spassky was embarrassing the Soviet Union!\n\nThe chairs were taken apart and X-rayed. A chemist found\nnothing unusual in them. The only things anyone found anywhere, in\nfact, were two dead flies in a lighting fixture. Spassky began to\ncomplain of hallucinations. He tried to keep playing, but his mind was\nunraveling. He could not go on. On September 2, he resigned.\nAlthough still relatively young, he never recovered from diis defeat.\n\nInterpretation\n\nIn previous games between Fischer and Spassky, Fischer had not\nfared well. Spassky had an uncanny ability to read his opponent's\nstrategy and use it against him. Adaptable and patient, he would build\nattacks that would defeat not in seven moves but in seventy. He\ndefeated Fischer every time mey played because he saw much further\nahead, and because he was a brilliant psychologist who never lost\ncontrol. One master said, \u201cHe doesn't just look for the best move. He\nlooks for the move that will disturb the man he is playing.\u201d\n\nFischer, however, finally understood that this was one of the keys\nto Spassky's success: He played on your predictability, defeated you at\nyour own game. Everything Fischer did for die championship match\nwas an at-\n\ntempt to put the initiative on his side and to keep Spassky off-\nbalance. Clearly the endless waiting had an effect on Spassky's psyche.\nMost powerful of all, tfiough, were Fischer's deliberate blunders and\nhis appearance of having no clear strategy. In fact, he was doing\neverything he could to scramble his old patterns, even if it meant\nlosing die first match and forfeiting the second.\n\nSpassky was known for his sangfroid and levelheadedness, but\n\nor the first time in his life he could not figure out his opponent. He\nslowly melted down, until at die end he was die one who seemed\ninsane.\nChess contains die concentrated essence of life: First, because to\nwin you have to be supremely patient and farseeing; and second,\nbecause the game is built on patterns, whole sequences of moves that\nhave been played before and will be played again, with slight\nalterations, in any one match. Your opponent analyzes the patterns you\nare playing and uses diem to try to foresee your moves. Allowing him\nnotiiing predictable to base his strategy on gives you a big advantage.\nIn chess as in life, when people cannot figure out what you are doing,\ndiey are kept in a state of terrorwaiting, uncertain, confused.\n\nLife at court is a serious, melancholy game of chess, which\nrequires us to draw\n\nup our pieces and batteries, form a plan, pursue it, parry that of\nour\n\nadversary. Sometimes, however, it is better to take risks\n\nand play the most capricious, unpredictable move.\n\nJean de La Bruyere, 1645-1696\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nNodiing is more terrifying dian the sudden and unpredictable.\nThat is why\n\nwe are so frightened by earthquakes and tornadoes: We do not\nknow when\n\nthey will strike. After one has occurred, we wait in terror for the\nnext one.\n\n\nTo a lesser degree, diis is the effect tiiat unpredictable human\nbehavior has\nonus.\n\nAnimals behave in set patterns, which is why we are able to hunt\nand kill them. Only man has the capacity to consciously alter his\nbehavior, to improvise and overcome the weight of routine and habit.\nYet most men do not realize diis power. They prefer die comforts o!\nroutine, of giving in to the animal nature that has diem repeating die\nsame compulsive actions time and time again. They do this because it\nrequires no effort, and because diey mistakenly believe that if they do\nnot unsetde others, they will be left alone. Understand: A person of\npower instills a kind of fear by deliberately unsetding those around\nhim to keep the initiative on his side. You sometimes need to strike\nwitiiout warning, to make others tremble when they least expect it. It is\na device that the powerful have used for centuries.\n\nFilippo Maria, the last of die Visconti dukes of Milan in fifteenth-\ncentury Italy, consciously did die opposite of what everyone expected\nof him. For instance, he might suddenly shower a courtier witii\nattention, and dien, once die man had come to expect a promotion to\nhigher office,\n\nhe allowed him a fair amount of latitude in handling his paintings,\nthen one day, for no apparent reason, he told die man he would no\nlonger give him any work to sell.

In the end, die more capricious you appear,\ndie more respect you will garner. Only die terminally subordinate act\nin a predictable manner.\n\n\nImage: The Cyclone. A wind that cannot be foreseen.

(Han-fei-tzu,\nChinese philosopher, third century B.C.)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nSometimes predictability can work in your favor: By creating a\npattern for people to be familiar and comfortable with, you can lull\nthem to sleep. They have prepared everything according to their\npreconceived notions about you. You can use this in several ways:\nFirst, it sets up a smoke screen, a comfortable front behind which you\ncan carry on deceptive actions. Second, it allows you on rare occasions\nto do something completely against the pattern, unsettling your\nopponent so deeply he will fall to the ground wimout being pushed.\n\nIn 1974 Muhammad Ali and George Foreman were scheduled to\nfight for the world heavyweight boxing championship. Everyone knew\nwhat would happen: Big George Foreman would try to land a\nknockout punch while Ali would dance around him, wearing him out.\nThat was Ali's way of fighting, his pattern, and he had not changed it\nin more than ten years. But in this case it seemed to give Foreman the\nadvantage: He had a devastating punch, and if he waited, sooner or\nlater Ali would have to come to him. Ali, the master strategist, had\nother plans: In press conferences before the big fight, he said he was\ngoing to change his style and punch it out with Foreman. No one, least\nof all Foreman, believed this for a second. That plan would be suicide\non Ali's part; he was playing the comedian, as usual. Then, before the\nfight, Ali's trainer loosened the ropes around the ring, something a\ntrainer would do if his boxer were intending to slug it out. But no one\nbelieved this ploy; it had to be a setup.\n\nTo everyone's amazement, Ali did exacdy what he had said he\nwould do. As Foreman waited for him to dance around, Ali went right\nup to him and slugged it out. He completely upset his opponent's\nstrategy. At a loss, Foreman ended up wearing himself out, not by\nchasing Ali but by throwing punches wildly, and taking more and more\ncounterpunches. Finally, Ali landed a dramatic right cross that knocked\n\nout Foreman. The habit of assuming that a person's behavior will fit its\nprevious patterns is so strong that not even Ali's announcement of a\nstrategy change was enough to upset it. Foreman walked into a trapthe\ntrap he had been told to expect.\n\nA warning: Unpredictability can work against you sometimes,\nespecially if you are in a subordinate position. There are times when it\nis better to let people feel comfortable and settled around you than to\ndisturb them. Too much unpredictability will be seen as a sign of\nindecisiveness, or even of some more serious psychic problem.\nPatterns are powerful, and you can terrify people by disrupting them.\nSuch power should only be used judiciously.\n'.

The two men\nhad been scheduled to meet for the World Championship of Chess, but\nFischer had not arrived on time and the match was on hold. Fischer\nhad problems with the size of the prize money, problems with the way\nthe money was to be distributed, problems with the logistics of holding\nthe match in Iceland. He might back out at any moment.\n\nSpassky tried to be patient. His Russian bosses felt that Fischer\nwas humiliating him and told him to walk away, but Spassky wanted\nthis match. He knew he could destroy Fischer, and nothing was going\nto spoil die greatest victory of his career. \u201cSo it seems that all our work\nmay come to nothing,\u201d Spassky told a comrade. \u201cBut what can we do\nIt is Bobby's move.

Below is an excerpt from my book titled '48 Laws of Power', specifically from Chapter '48 Laws of Power', Section 'LAW 18'. The original text is: 'DO NOT BUILD FORTRESSES\n\nTO PROTECT YOURSELF\n\nISOLATION IS DANGEROUS\n\nJUDGMENT\n\nThe world is dangerous and enemies are everywhere everyone has\nto protect themselves. A fortress seems the safest. But isolation\nexposes you to more dangers than it protects you fromit cuts you off\nfrom valuable information, it makes you conspicuous and an easy\ntarget. Better to circulate among people, find allies, mingle. You are\nshielded from your enemies by the crowd.\n\nTRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW,\n\nCh'in Shih Huang Ti, the first emperor of China (221-210 B.C.),\nwas the mightiest man of his day. His empire was vaster and more\npowerful than that of Alexander the Great. He had conquered all of the\nkingdoms surrounding his own kingdom of Ch'in and unified them into\none massive realm called China. But in the last years of his life, few, if\nanyone, saw him.\n\nThe emperor lived in the most magnificent palace built to that\ndate, in the capital of Hsien-yang. The palace had 270 pavilions; all of\nthese were connected by secret underground passageways, allowing\nthe emperor to move through the palace without anyone seeing him.\nHe slept in a different room every night, and anyone who inadvertendy\nlaid eyes on him was instandy beheaded. Only a handful of men knew\nhis whereabouts, and if they revealed it to anyone, they, too, were put\nto deadi.\n\nThe first emperor had grown so terrified of human contact that\nwhen he had to leave die palace he traveled incognito, disguising\nhimself carefully. On one such trip through the provinces, he suddenly\ndied. His body was bore back to the capital in the emperor's carriage,\nwith a cart packed with salted fish trailing behind it to cover up die\nsmell of the rotting corpseno one was to know of his death. He died\n\n\nalone, far from his wives, his family, his friends, and his courtiers,\naccompanied only by a minister and a handful of eunuchs.\n\nInterpretation\n\nShih Huang Ti started off as the king of Ch'in, a fearless warrior\nof unbridled ambition. Writers of die time described him as a man with\n\u201ca waspish nose, eyes like slits, the voice of a jackal, and the heart of a\ntiger or wolf.\u201d He could be merciful sometimes, but more often he\n\u201cswallowed men up without a scruple.\u201d It was through trickery and\nviolence that he conquered the provinces surrounding his own and\ncreated China, forging a single nation and culture out of many. He\nbroke up the feudal system, and to keep an eye on die many members\nof the royal families that were scattered across the realm's various\nkingdoms, he moved 120,000 of them to the capital, where he housed\nthe most important courtiers in the vast palace of Hsien-yang. He\nconsolidated the many walls on the borders and built them into me\nGreat Wall of China. He standardized die country's laws, its written\nlanguage, even die size of its cartwheels.\n\nAs part of this process of unification, however, the first emperor\noutlawed the writings and teachings of Confucius, the philosopher\nwhose ideas on the moral life had already become virtually a religion\nin Chinese culture.

A principal instigator of the war had been the nobility, which\ndeeply resented me growing power of the throne and yearned for the\ndays of feudalism, when the lords ruled their own fiefdoms and the\nking had little authority over them.

They may appear impregnable, but once you retire to one,\neveryone knows where you are; and a siege does not have to succeed\nto tum your fortress into a prison.

His vesture was dabbled in blood\nand his broad brow, with all the features of the face, was sprinkled\nwith the scarlet horror... .. .A throng of the revellers at once threw\nthemselves into the black apartment, and, seizing the mummer, whose\ntall figure stood erect and motionless within the shadow of the ebony\nclock, gasped in unutterable horror at finding the grave cerements and\ncorpse-like mask, which they handled with so violent a rudeness,\nuntenanted by any tangible form. And now was acknowledged the\npresence of the Red Death. He had come like a thief in the night. And\none by one dropped the revellers in the blood-bedewed halls of their\nrevel, and died each in the despairing posture of his fall. And the life\nof the ebony clock went out with that of the last of the gay. And the\nflames of the tripods expired. And Darkness and Decay and the Red\nDeath held illimitable dominion over all.\nthe masque of the red death, Edgar Allan Poe. 1809-1849\nBecause humans are social creatures by nature, power depends on\nsocial interaction and circulation. To make yourself powerful you must\nplace yourself at the center of things, as Louis XIV did at Versailles.\nAll activity should revolve around you, and you should be aware of\neverything happening on the street, and of anyone who might be\nhatching plots against you. The danger for most people comes when\nthey feel threatened. In such times they tend to retreat and close ranks,\n\n\nto find security in a kind of fortress. In doing so, however, they come\nto rely for information on a smaller and smaller circle, and lose\nperspective on events around them. They lose maneuverability and\nbecome easy targets, and their isolation makes them paranoid. As in\nwarfare and most games of strategy, isolation often precedes defeat\nand death.\n\nIn moments of uncertainty and danger, you need to fight this\ndesire to turn inward. Instead, make yourself more accessible, seek out\nold allies and make new ones, force yourself into more and more\ndifferent circles. This has been the trick of powerful people for\ncenturies.\n\nThe Roman statesman Cicero was born into the lower nobility,\nand had little chance of power unless he managed to make a place for\nhimself among the aristocrats who controlled the city. He succeeded\nbrilliantly, identifying everyone with influence and figuring out how\nthey were connected to one another. He mingled everywhere, knew\neveryone, and had such a vast network of connections that an enemy\nhere could easily be counterbalanced by an ally there.\n\nThe French statesman Talleyrand played the game the same way.\nAlthough he came from one of the oldest aristocratic families in\nFrance, he made a point of always staying in touch with what was\nhappening in the streets of Paris, allowing him to foresee trends and\ntroubles. He even got a certain pleasure out of mingling with shady\ncriminal types, who supplied him with valuable information. Every\ntime there was a crisis, a transition of powerthe end of the Directory,\nthe fall of Napoleon, the abdication of Louis XVIIIhe was able to\nsurvive and even thrive, because he never closed himself up in a small\ncircle but always forged connections with the new order.\n\nThis law pertains to kings and queens, and to those of the highest\npower: The moment you lose contact with your people, seeking\nsecurity in isolation, rebellion is brewing. Never imagine yourself so\nelevated that you can afford to cut yourself off from even the lowest\nechelons. By retreating to a fortress, you make yourself an easy target\nfor your plotting subjects, who view your isolation as an insult and a\nreason for rebellion.\n\nSince humans are such social creatures, it follows that the social\narts that make us pleasant to be around can be practiced only by\n\n\nconstant exposure and circulation. The more you are in contact with\nothers, the more graceful and at ease you become. Isolation, on the\nother hand, engenders an awkwardness in your gestures, and leads to\n\u2018urther isolation, as people start avoiding you.\n\nIn 1545 Duke Cosimo I de' Medici decided that to ensure the\nimmor-\ntality of his name he would commission frescoes for the main\nchapel of the church of San Lorenzo in Florence. He had many great\npainters to choose from, and in the end he picked Jacopo da Pontormo.\nGetting on in years, Pontormo wanted to make these frescoes his chef\nd'oeuvre and legacy. His first decision was to close the chapel off with\nwalls, partitions, and blinds. He wanted no one to witness the creation\nof his masterpiece, or to steal his ideas. He would outdo Michelangelo\nhimself. When some young men broke into the chapel out of curiosity,\nJacopo sealed it off even further.\n\nPontormo filled the chapel's ceiling with biblical scenesthe\nCreation, Adam and Eve, Noah's ark, on and on. At the top of the\nmiddle wall he painted Christ in his majesty, raising the dead on\nJudgment Day. The artist worked on the chapel for eleven years, rarely\nleaving it, since he had developed a phobia for human contact and was\nafraid his ideas would be stolen.\n\nPontormo died before completing the frescoes, and none of diem\nhas survived. But the great Renaissance writer Vasari, a friend of\nPontormo's who saw the frescoes shortly after the artist's death, left a\ndescription of what they looked like. There was a total lack of\nproportion. Scenes bumped against scenes, figures in one story being\njuxtaposed witfi those in another, in maddening numbers. Pontormo\nhad become obsessed with detail but had lost any sense of the overall\ncomposition. Vasari left off his description of die frescoes by writing\ndiat if he continued, \u201cI think I would go mad and become entangled in\nthis painting, just as I believe mat in the eleven years of time Jacopo\nspent on it, he entangled himself and anyone else who saw it.\u201d Instead\nof crowning Pontormo's career, the work became his undoing.\n\nThese frescoes were visual equivalents of die effects of isolation\non die human mind: a loss of proportion, an obsession with detail\ncombined with an inability to see die larger picture, a kind of\nextravagant ugliness that no longer communicates. Clearly, isolation is\n\n\nas deadly for the creative arts as for die social arts. Shakespeare is die\nmost famous writer in history because, as a dramatist for die popular\nstage, he opened himself up to die masses, making his work accessible\nto people no matter what Uieir education and taste. Artists who hole\nthemselves up in their fortress lose a sense of proportion, tiieir work\ncommunicating only to dieir small circle. Such art remains cornered\nand powerless.\n\nFinally, since power is a human creation, it is inevitably increased\nby contact with other people. Instead of falling into the fortress\nmentality, view die world in die following manner: It is like a vast\nVersailles, with every room communicating with anotiier. You need to\nbe permeable, able to float in and out of different circles and mix witfi\ndifferent types. That kind of mobility and social contact will protect\nyou from plotters, who will be unable to keep secrets from you, and\nfrom your enemies, who will be unable to isolate you from your allies.\nAlways on the move, you mix and mingle in die rooms of die palace,\nnever sitting or settling in one place. No hunter can fix his aim on such\na swift-moving creature.\n\nImage: The Fortress. High up on the hill, the citadel becomes a\nsymbol of all that is hateful in power and authority. The citizens of the\ntown betray you to the first enemy that comes. Cut off from\ncommunication and intelligence, the citadel falls with ease.\n\nAuthority: A good and wise prince, desirous of maintaining that\ncharacter, and to avoid giving the opportunity to his sons to become\noppressive, will never build fortresses, so that they may place their\nreliance upon the good will of meir subjects, and not upon the strength\nof citadels. (Niccolo Machiavelli, 1469-1527)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nIt is hardly ever right and propitious to choose isolation. Without\nkeeping an ear on what is happening in the streets, you will be unable\nto protect yourself. About the only thing that constant human contact\ncannot facilitate is thought. The weight of society's pressure to\nconform, and die lack of distance from other people, can make it\nimpossible to think clearly about what is going on around you. As a\ntemporary recourse, men, isolation can help you to gain perspective.\nMany a serious thinker has been produced in prisons, where we have\nnothing to do but think. Machiavelli could write The Prince only once\n\nhe found himself in exile and isolated on a farm far from the political\nintrigues of Florence.\n\nThe danger is, however, that mis kind of isolation will sire all\nkinds of strange and perverted ideas. You may gain perspective on the\nlarger picture, but you lose a sense of your own smallness and\nlimitations. Also, the more isolated you are, the harder it is to break\nout of your isolation when you choose toit sinks you deep into its\nquicksand without your noticing. If you need time to think, then,\nchoose isolation only as a last resort, and only in small doses. Be\ncareful to keep your way back into society open.\n'.

His empire was vaster and more\npowerful than that of Alexander the Great. He had conquered all of the\nkingdoms surrounding his own kingdom of Ch'in and unified them into\none massive realm called China. But in the last years of his life, few, if\nanyone, saw him.\n\nThe emperor lived in the most magnificent palace built to that\ndate, in the capital of Hsien-yang. The palace had 270 pavilions; all of\nthese were connected by secret underground passageways, allowing\nthe emperor to move through the palace without anyone seeing him.\nHe slept in a different room every night, and anyone who inadvertendy\nlaid eyes on him was instandy beheaded. Only a handful of men knew\nhis whereabouts, and if they revealed it to anyone, they, too, were put\nto deadi.\n\nThe first emperor had grown so terrified of human contact that\nwhen he had to leave die palace he traveled incognito, disguising\nhimself carefully. On one such trip through the provinces, he suddenly\ndied. His body was bore back to the capital in the emperor's carriage,\nwith a cart packed with salted fish trailing behind it to cover up die\nsmell of the rotting corpseno one was to know of his death. He died\n\n\nalone, far from his wives, his family, his friends, and his courtiers,\naccompanied only by a minister and a handful of eunuchs.\n\nInterpretation\n\nShih Huang Ti started off as the king of Ch'in, a fearless warrior\nof unbridled ambition. Writers of die time described him as a man with\n\u201ca waspish nose, eyes like slits, the voice of a jackal, and the heart of a\ntiger or wolf.\u201d He could be merciful sometimes, but more often he\n\u201cswallowed men up without a scruple.\u201d It was through trickery and\nviolence that he conquered the provinces surrounding his own and\ncreated China, forging a single nation and culture out of many. He\nbroke up the feudal system, and to keep an eye on die many members\nof the royal families that were scattered across the realm's various\nkingdoms, he moved 120,000 of them to the capital, where he housed\nthe most important courtiers in the vast palace of Hsien-yang. He\nconsolidated the many walls on the borders and built them into me\nGreat Wall of China. He standardized die country's laws, its written\nlanguage, even die size of its cartwheels.\n\nAs part of this process of unification, however, the first emperor\noutlawed the writings and teachings of Confucius, the philosopher\nwhose ideas on the moral life had already become virtually a religion\nin Chinese culture. On Shih Huang Ti's order, tiiousands of books\nrelating to Confucius were burned, and anyone who quoted Confucius\nwas to be beheaded.

They lose maneuverability and\nbecome easy targets, and their isolation makes them paranoid. As in\nwarfare and most games of strategy, isolation often precedes defeat\nand death.\n\nIn moments of uncertainty and danger, you need to fight this\ndesire to turn inward. Instead, make yourself more accessible, seek out\nold allies and make new ones, force yourself into more and more\ndifferent circles. This has been the trick of powerful people for\ncenturies.\n\nThe Roman statesman Cicero was born into the lower nobility,\nand had little chance of power unless he managed to make a place for\nhimself among the aristocrats who controlled the city. He succeeded\nbrilliantly, identifying everyone with influence and figuring out how\nthey were connected to one another. He mingled everywhere, knew\neveryone, and had such a vast network of connections that an enemy\nhere could easily be counterbalanced by an ally there.\n\nThe French statesman Talleyrand played the game the same way.\nAlthough he came from one of the oldest aristocratic families in\nFrance, he made a point of always staying in touch with what was\nhappening in the streets of Paris, allowing him to foresee trends and\ntroubles. He even got a certain pleasure out of mingling with shady\ncriminal types, who supplied him with valuable information. Every\ntime there was a crisis, a transition of powerthe end of the Directory,\nthe fall of Napoleon, the abdication of Louis XVIIIhe was able to\nsurvive and even thrive, because he never closed himself up in a small\ncircle but always forged connections with the new order.\n\nThis law pertains to kings and queens, and to those of the highest\npower: The moment you lose contact with your people, seeking\nsecurity in isolation, rebellion is brewing. Never imagine yourself so\nelevated that you can afford to cut yourself off from even the lowest\nechelons. By retreating to a fortress, you make yourself an easy target\nfor your plotting subjects, who view your isolation as an insult and a\nreason for rebellion.\n\nSince humans are such social creatures, it follows that the social\narts that make us pleasant to be around can be practiced only by\n\n\nconstant exposure and circulation. The more you are in contact with\nothers, the more graceful and at ease you become. Isolation, on the\nother hand, engenders an awkwardness in your gestures, and leads to\n\u2018urther isolation, as people start avoiding you.\n\nIn 1545 Duke Cosimo I de' Medici decided that to ensure the\nimmor-\ntality of his name he would commission frescoes for the main\nchapel of the church of San Lorenzo in Florence. He had many great\npainters to choose from, and in the end he picked Jacopo da Pontormo.\nGetting on in years, Pontormo wanted to make these frescoes his chef\nd'oeuvre and legacy. His first decision was to close the chapel off with\nwalls, partitions, and blinds. He wanted no one to witness the creation\nof his masterpiece, or to steal his ideas. He would outdo Michelangelo\nhimself. When some young men broke into the chapel out of curiosity,\nJacopo sealed it off even further.\n\nPontormo filled the chapel's ceiling with biblical scenesthe\nCreation, Adam and Eve, Noah's ark, on and on. At the top of the\nmiddle wall he painted Christ in his majesty, raising the dead on\nJudgment Day. The artist worked on the chapel for eleven years, rarely\nleaving it, since he had developed a phobia for human contact and was\nafraid his ideas would be stolen.\n\nPontormo died before completing the frescoes, and none of diem\nhas survived. But the great Renaissance writer Vasari, a friend of\nPontormo's who saw the frescoes shortly after the artist's death, left a\ndescription of what they looked like. There was a total lack of\nproportion. Scenes bumped against scenes, figures in one story being\njuxtaposed witfi those in another, in maddening numbers. Pontormo\nhad become obsessed with detail but had lost any sense of the overall\ncomposition. Vasari left off his description of die frescoes by writing\ndiat if he continued, \u201cI think I would go mad and become entangled in\nthis painting, just as I believe mat in the eleven years of time Jacopo\nspent on it, he entangled himself and anyone else who saw it.\u201d Instead\nof crowning Pontormo's career, the work became his undoing.\n\nThese frescoes were visual equivalents of die effects of isolation\non die human mind: a loss of proportion, an obsession with detail\ncombined with an inability to see die larger picture, a kind of\nextravagant ugliness that no longer communicates. Clearly, isolation is\n\n\nas deadly for the creative arts as for die social arts. Shakespeare is die\nmost famous writer in history because, as a dramatist for die popular\nstage, he opened himself up to die masses, making his work accessible\nto people no matter what Uieir education and taste. Artists who hole\nthemselves up in their fortress lose a sense of proportion, tiieir work\ncommunicating only to dieir small circle. Such art remains cornered\nand powerless.\n\nFinally, since power is a human creation, it is inevitably increased\nby contact with other people. Instead of falling into the fortress\nmentality, view die world in die following manner: It is like a vast\nVersailles, with every room communicating with anotiier. You need to\nbe permeable, able to float in and out of different circles and mix witfi\ndifferent types. That kind of mobility and social contact will protect\nyou from plotters, who will be unable to keep secrets from you, and\nfrom your enemies, who will be unable to isolate you from your allies.\nAlways on the move, you mix and mingle in die rooms of die palace,\nnever sitting or settling in one place. No hunter can fix his aim on such\na swift-moving creature.\n\nImage: The Fortress. High up on the hill, the citadel becomes a\nsymbol of all that is hateful in power and authority. The citizens of the\ntown betray you to the first enemy that comes. Cut off from\ncommunication and intelligence, the citadel falls with ease.\n\nAuthority: A good and wise prince, desirous of maintaining that\ncharacter, and to avoid giving the opportunity to his sons to become\noppressive, will never build fortresses, so that they may place their\nreliance upon the good will of meir subjects, and not upon the strength\nof citadels. (Niccolo Machiavelli, 1469-1527)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nIt is hardly ever right and propitious to choose isolation. Without\nkeeping an ear on what is happening in the streets, you will be unable\nto protect yourself. About the only thing that constant human contact\ncannot facilitate is thought. The weight of society's pressure to\nconform, and die lack of distance from other people, can make it\nimpossible to think clearly about what is going on around you. As a\ntemporary recourse, men, isolation can help you to gain perspective.\nMany a serious thinker has been produced in prisons, where we have\nnothing to do but think. Machiavelli could write The Prince only once\n\nhe found himself in exile and isolated on a farm far from the political\nintrigues of Florence.\n\nThe danger is, however, that mis kind of isolation will sire all\nkinds of strange and perverted ideas. You may gain perspective on the\nlarger picture, but you lose a sense of your own smallness and\nlimitations. Also, the more isolated you are, the harder it is to break\nout of your isolation when you choose toit sinks you deep into its\nquicksand without your noticing. If you need time to think, then,\nchoose isolation only as a last resort, and only in small doses. Be\ncareful to keep your way back into society open.\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

If you make diis distinction well,\nyou will succeed widi-out needing to coerce anyone too much. But if\nyou deal blindly with whomever crosses your padi, you will have a life\nof constant sorrow, if you even live tiiat long. Being able to recognize\ntypes of people, and to act accordingly, is critical. The following are\n\ndie five most dangerous and difficult types of mark in the jungle, as\nidentified by artistscon and otherwiseof the past.\n\nTLIK HK\\ K\\CK OK\n\nkoi'k nv. \\\n\n[Lope de] Aguirre's character is amply illustrated in an anecdote\nfrom the. chronicle of Garcilaso de la Vega, who related that in 1548\nAguirre was a member of a platoon of soldiers escorting Indian slaves\nfrom the mines at Potosl [Bolivia] to a royal treasury depot. The\nIndians were illegally burdened with great quantities of silver, and a\nlocal official arrested Aguirre, sentencing him to receive two hundred\nlashes in lieu of a fine for oppressing the Indians. \"The soldier Aguirre,\nhaving received a notification of the sentence, besought the alcalde\nthat, instead of flogging him, he would put him to death, for that he\nwas a gentleman by birth.... All this had no effect on the alcalde, who\nordered the executioner to bring a beast, and execute the sentence. The\nexecutioner came to the\n\nThe Arrogant and Proud Man. Although he may initially disguise\nit, tiiis man's touchy pride makes him very dangerous. Any perceived\nslight will lead to a vengeance of overwhelming violence. You may\nsay to yourself, \u201cBut I only said such-and-such at a party, where\neveryone was drunk. ...\u201d It does not matter. There is no sanity behind\nhis overreaction, so do not waste time trying to figure him out. If at\nany point in your dealings with a person you sense an oversensitive\nand overactive pride, flee. Whatever you are hoping for from him isn't\nworth it.\n\nThe Hopelessly Insecure Man. This man is related to the proud\nand arrogant type, but is less violent and harder to spot. His ego is\nfragile, his sense of self insecure, and if he feels himself deceived or\nattacked, the hurt will simmer. He will attack you in bites tiiat will take\nforever to get big enough for you to notice. If you find you have\ndeceived or harmed such a man, disappear for a long time. Do not stay\naround him or he will nibble you to death.\n\nMr. Suspicion. Anotiier variant on the breeds above, this is a\nfuture Joe Stalin. He sees what he wants to seeusually the worstin\nother people, and imagines that everyone is after him. Mr. Suspicion is\nin fact the least dangerous of the three: Genuinely unbalanced, he is\neasy to deceive, just as Stalin himself was constandy deceived. Play on\n\nhis suspicious nature to get him to turn against odier people. But if you\ndo become die target of his suspicions, watch out.\n\nThe Serpent with a Long Memory. If hurt or deceived, this man\nwill show no anger on the surface; he will calculate and wait. Then,\nwhen he is in a position to turn the tables, he will exact a revenge\nmarked by a coldblooded shrewdness. Recognize this man by his\ncalculation and cunning in the different areas of his life. He is usually\ncold and unaffectionate. Be doubly careful of this snake, and if you\nhave somehow injured him, either crush him completely or get him out\nof your sight.\n\nThe Plain, Unassuming, and Often Unintelligent Man. Ah, your\nears prick up when you find such a tempting victim. But this man is a\nlot harder\n\nto deceive than you imagine. Falling for a ruse often takes\nintelligence and imaginationa sense of die possible rewards. The blunt\nman will not take die bait because he does not recognize it. He is diat\nunaware. The danger widi this man is not mat he will harm you or seek\nrevenge, but merely that he will waste your time, energy, resources,\nand even your sanity in trying to deceive him. Have a test ready for a\nmarka joke, a story. If his reaction is utterly literal, this is die type you\nare dealing with. Continue at your own risk.\n\nTRANSGRESSIONS OF THE LAW\n\nTransgression I\n\nIn the early part of the thirteenth century, Muhammad, the shah of\nKhwarezm, managed after many wars to forge a huge empire,\nextending west to present-day Turkey and south to Afghanistan. The\nempire's center was the great Asian capital of Samarkand. The shah\nhad a powerful, well-trained army, and could mobilize 200,000\nwarriors within days.\n\nIn 1219 Muhammad received an embassy from a new tribal\nleader to the east, Genghis Khan. The embassy included all sorts of\ngifts to the great Muhammad, representing the finest goods from\nKhan's small but growing Mongol empire. Genghis Khan wanted to\nreopen die Silk Route to Europe, and offered to share it with\nMuhammad, while promising peace between the two empires.\n\nMuhammad did not know this upstart from the east, who, it\nseemed to him, was extremely arrogant to try to talk as an equal to one\n\nso clearly his superior. He ignored Khan's offer. Khan tried again: This\ntime he sent a caravan of a hundred camels filled with the rarest\narticles he had plundered from China. Before the caravan reached\nMuhammad, however, Inalchik, die governor of a region bordering on\nSamarkand, seized it for himself, and executed its leaders.\n\nGenghis Khan was sure diat this was a mistakethat Inalchik had\nacted without Muhammad's approval. He sent yet another mission to\nMuhammad, reiterating his offer and asking that the governor be\npunished. This time Muhammad himself had one of the ambassadors\nbeheaded, and sent the other two back with shaved headsa horrifying\ninsult in the Mongol code of honor. Khan sent a message to die shah:\n\u201cYou have chosen war. What will happen will happen, and what it is to\nbe we know not; only God knows.\u201d Mobilizing his forces, in 1220 he\nattacked Inalchik's province, where he seized the capital, captured the\ngovernor, and ordered him executed by having molten silver poured\ninto his eyes and ears.\n\nOver the next year, Khan led a series of guerrilla-like campaigns\nagainst die shah's much larger army. His metiiod was totally novel for\nthe timehis soldiers could move very fast on horseback, and had\nmastered the art of firing widi bow and arrow while mounted. The\nspeed and flexibility of his forces allowed him to deceive Muhammad\nas to his intentions and die directions of his movements. Eventually he\nmanaged first to sur-\n\nprison, and put Aguirre on the beast.... The beast was driven on,\nand he received the lashes. ...\" When freed, Aguirre announced his\nintention of killing the official who had sentenced him, the alcalde\nEsquivel. Esquivel's term of office expired and he fled to Lima, three\nhundred twenty leagues away, but within fifteen days Aguirre had\ntracked him there. The frightened judge journeyed to Quito, a trip of\nfour hundred leagues, and in twenty days Aguirre arrived.\n\n\u201cWhen Esquivel heard of his presence,\u201d according to Garcilaso,\n\u201che made another journey of five hundred leagues to Cuzco; but in a\nfew days Aguirre also arrived, having travelled on foot and without\nshoes, saying that a whipped man has no business to ride a horse, or to\ngo where he would be seen by others. In this way, Aguirre followed his\njudge for three years, and four months.\u201d Wearying of the pursuit,\nEsquivel remained at Cuzco, a city so sternly governed that he felt he\n\nwould be safe from Aguirre. He took a house near the cathedral and\nnever ventured outdoors without a sword and a dagger. \"However, on a\ncertain Monday, at noon, Aguirre entered his house, and having\nwalked all over it, and having traversed a corridor, a saloon, a\nchamber, and an inner\n\nchamber where the\n\njudge kept his books,\n\nhe at last found him\n\nasleep over one of his\n\nbooks, and slabbed him\n\nto death. The murderer\n\nthen went out, but\n\nwhen he came to the\n\ndoor of the house, he\n\nfound that he had\n\nforgotten his hat, and\n\nhad the temerity to\n\nreturn and fetch it, and\n\nthen walked down\n\nthe street.\"\n\nthe golden dream:\n\nseekers of el dorado,\n\nWalker Chapman,\n\nA troublesome Crow seated herself on the back of a Sheep. The\nSheep, much against his will, carried her backward and forward for a\nlong time, and at last said, \u201cIf you had treated a dog in this way, you\nwould have had your deserts from his sharp teeth.\u201d To this the Crow\nreplied, \"I despise the weak, and yield to the strong. I know whom I\nmay bully, and whom I must flatter; and thus I hope to prolong my life\nto a good old age.\n\nFABLES,\n\nAesop, sixth century b.c.\n\nround Samarkand, then to seize it. Muhammad fled, and a year\nlater died, his vast empire broken and destroyed. Genghis Khan was\nsole master of Samarkand, the Silk Route, and most of northern Asia.\nInterpretation\n\nNever assume that die person you are dealing with is weaker or\nless important than you are. Some men are slow to take offense, which\nmay make you misjudge the thickness of their skin, and fail to worry\nabout insulting them. But should you offend their honor and their\npride, tiiey will overwhelm you with a violence that seems sudden and\nextreme given their slowness to anger. If you want to turn people\ndown, it is best to do so politely and respectfully, even if you feel their\nrequest is impudent or their offer ridiculous. Never reject them with an\ninsult until you know them better; you may be dealing witii a Genghis\nKhan.\n\nTransgression IT\n\nIn the late 1910s some of the best swindlers in America formed a\ncon-artist ring based in Denver, Colorado. In the winter months they\nwould spread across the southern states, plying their trade. In 1920 Joe\nFurey, a leader of the ring, was working his way through Texas,\nmaking hundreds of thousands of dollars with classic con games. In\nFort Worth, he met a sucker named J. Frank Norfleet, a cattleman who\nowned a large ranch. Norfleet fell for the con. Convinced of die riches\nto come, he emptied his bank account of $45,000 and handed it over to\nFurey and his confederates. A few days later they gave him his\n\u201cmillions,\u201d which turned out to be a few good dollars wrapped around\na packet of newspaper clippings.\n\nFurey and his men had worked such cons a hundred times before,\nand the sucker was usually so embarrassed by his gullibility that he\nquietly learned his lesson and accepted the loss. But Norfleet was not\nlike otiier suckers. He went to die police, who told him there was httle\nthey could do. \u201cThen I'll go after those people myself,\u201d Norfleet told\nthe detectives. \u201cI'll get them, too, if it takes die rest of my life.\u201d His\nwife took over the ranch as Norfleet scoured the country, looking for\nothers who had been fleeced in the same game. One such sucker came\nforward, and the two men identified one of the con artists in San\nFrancisco, and managed to get him locked up. The man committed\nsuicide rather tiian face a long term in prison.\n\nNorfleet kept going. He tracked down another of the con artists in\nMontana, roped him like a calf, and dragged him through die muddy\nstreets to the town jail. He traveled not only across the country but to\nEngland, Canada, and Mexico in search of Joe Furey, and also of\n\nFurey's right-hand man, W. B. Spencer. Finding Spencer in Montreal,\nNorfleet chased him through the streets. Spencer escaped but the\nrancher stayed on his trail and caught up with him in Salt Lake City.\nPreferring the mercy of the law to Norfleet's wrath, Spencer turned\nhimself in.\n\nNorfleet found Furey in Jacksonville, Florida, and personally\nhauled him off to face justice in Texas. But he wouldn't stop there: He\ncontinued on to Denver, determined to break up the entire ring.\nSpending not only\n\nlarge sums of money but another year of his life in the pursuit, he\nmanaged to put all of the con ring's leaders behind bars. Even some he\ndidn't catch had grown so terrified of him that they too turned\nthemselves in.\n\nAfter five years of hunting, Norfleet had single-handedly\ndestroyed the country's largest confederation of con artists. The effort\nbankrupted him and ruined his marriage, but he died a satisfied man.\nInterpretation\n\nMost men accept the humiliation of being conned with a sense of\nresignation. They learn their lesson, recognizing that there is no such\nthing as a free lunch, and that they have usually been brought down by\ntheir own greed for easy money. Some, however, refuse to take their\nmedicine. Instead of reflecting on their own gullibility and avarice,\nthey see themselves as totally innocent victims.\n\nMen like this may seem to be crusaders for justice and honesty,\nbut they are actually immoderately insecure. Being fooled, being\nconned, has activated their self-doubt, and they are desperate to repair\nthe damage. Were the mortgage on Norfleet's ranch, the collapse of his\nmarriage, and the years of borrowing money and living in cheap hotels\nworth his revenge over his embarrassment at being fleeced To the\nNorfleets of the world, overcoming their embarrassment is worth any\nprice.\n\nAll people have insecurities, and often the best way to deceive a\nsucker is to play upon his insecurities. But in the realm of power,\neverything is a question of degree, and the person who is decidedly\nmore insecure than the average mortal presents great dangers. Be\nwarned: If you practice deception or trickery of any sort, study your\nmark well. Some people's insecurity and ego fragility cannot tolerate\n\nthe slightest offense. To see if you are dealing with such a type, test\nthem firstmake, say, a mild joke at their expense. A confident person\nwill laugh; an overly insecure one will react as if personally insulted. If\nyou suspect you are dealing with this type, find another victim.\n\nTransgression III\n\nIn the fifth century B.C., Ch'ung-erh, the prince of Ch'in (in\npresent-day China), had been forced into exile. He lived modesdyeven,\nsometimes, in povertywaiting for the time when he could return home\nand resume his princely life. Once he was passing through the state of\nCheng, where the ruler, not knowing who he was, treated him rudely.\nThe ruler's minister, Shu Chan, saw this and said, \u201cThis man is a\nworthy prince. May Your Highness treat him with great courtesy and\nthereby place him under an obligation!\u201d But the ruler, able to see only\nthe prince's lowly station, ignored this advice and insulted the prince\nagain. Shu Chan again warned his master, saying, \u201cIf Your Highness\ncannot treat Ch'ung-erh with courtesy, you should put him to death, to\navoid calamity in the future.\u201d The ruler only scoffed.\n\nYears later, the prince was finally able to return home, his\ncircumstances gready changed. He did not forget who had been kind to\nhim, and\n\nwho had been insolent, during his years of poverty. Least of all\ndid he forget his treatment at the hands of the ruler of Cheng. At his\nfirst opportunity he assembled a vast army and marched on Cheng,\ntaking eight cities, destroying the kingdom, and sending the ruler into\nan exile of his own. Interpretation\n\nYou can never be sure who you are dealing with. A man who is of\nlittie importance and means today can be a person of power tomorrow.\nWe forget a lot in our lives, but we rarely forget an insult.\n\nHow was me ruler of Cheng to know that Prince Ch'ung-erh was\nan ambitious, calculating, cunning type, a serpent with a long memory\nThere was really no way for him to know, you may saybut since mere\nwas no way, it would have been better not to tempt the fates by finding\nout. There is notfiing to be gained by insulting a person unnecessarily.\nSwallow the impulse to offend, even if the other person seems weak.\nThe satisfaction is meager compared to the danger mat someday he or\nshe will be in a position to hurt you.\n\nTransgression IV\n\nThe year of 1920 had been a particularly bad one for American\nart dealers. Big buyersdie robber-baron generation of die previous\ncenturywere getting to an age where they were dying off like flies, and\nno new millionaires had emerged to take dieir place. Things were so\nbad diat a number of the major dealers decided to pool their resources,\nan unheard-of event, since art dealers usually get along like cats and\ndogs.\n\nJoseph Duveen, art dealer to the richest tycoons of America, was\nsuffering more man the others mat year, so he decided to go along with\nthis alliance. The group now consisted of the five biggest dealers in the\ncountry. Looking around for a new client, they decided mat their last\nbest hope was Henry Ford, then the wealthiest man in America. Ford\nhad yet to venture into the art market, and he was such a big target that\nit made sense for them to work togedier.\n\nThe dealers decided to assemble a list, \u201cThe 100 Greatest\nPaintings in me World\u201d (all of which they happened to have in stock),\nand to offer the lot of them to Ford. With one purchase he could make\nhimself the world's greatest collector. The consortium worked for\nweeks to produce a magnificent object: a three-volume set of books\ncontaining beautiful reproductions of the paintings, as well as\nscholarly texts accompanying each picture. Next they made a personal\nvisit to Ford at his home in Dearborn, Michigan. There mey were\nsurprised by the simplicity of his house: Mr. Ford was obviously an\nextremely unaffected man.\n\nFord received them in his study. Looking through the book, he\nexpressed astonishment and delight. The excited dealers began\nimagining the millions of dollars mat would shortly flow into their\ncoffers. Finally, however, Ford looked up from die book and said,\n\u201cGendemen, beautiful books like tiiese, with beautiful colored pictures\nlike these, must cost an awful lot!\u201d \u201cBut Mr. Ford!\u201d exclaimed\nDuveen, \"we don't expect you to buy these\n\nbooks. We got tiiem up especially for you, to show you the\npictures. These books are a present to you.\u201c Ford seemed puzzled.\n\u201dGendemen,\u201c he said, \u201dit is extremely nice of you, but I really don't\nsee how I can accept a beautiful, expensive present like mis from\nstrangers.\u201c Duveen explained to Ford that the reproductions in the\nbooks showed paintings mey had hoped to sell to him. Ford finally\n\nunderstood. \u201dBut gendemen,\u201c he exclaimed, \u2019what would I want widi\ndie original pictures when the ones right here in these books are so\nbeautiful\" Interpretation\n\nJoseph Duveen prided himself on studying his victims and clients\nin advance, figuring out dieir weaknesses and die peculiarities of dieir\ntastes before he ever met diem. He was driven by desperation to drop\nthis tactic just once, in his assault on Henry Ford. It took him mondis\nto recover from his misjudgment, both mentally and monetarily. Ford\nwas the unassuming plain-man type who just isn't worth the botiier. He\nwas the incarnation of those literal-minded folk who do not possess\nenough imagination to be deceived. From then on, Duveen saved his\nenergies for the Mellons and Morgans of the worldmen crafty enough\nor him to entrap in his snares.\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nThe ability to measure people and to know who you're dealing\nwith is die most important skill of all in gadiering and conserving\npower. Without it you are blind: Not only will you offend the wrong\npeople, you will choose the wrong types to work on, and will think you\nare flattering people when you are actually insulting them. Before\nembarking on any move, take the measure of your mark or potential\nopponent. Otiierwise you will waste time and make mistakes. Study\npeople's weaknesses, the chinks in dieir armor, dieir areas of bodi pride\nand insecurity. Know tiieir ins and outs before you even decide\nwhetiier or not to deal widi diem.\n\nTwo final words of caution: First, in judging and measuring your\nopponent, never rely on your instincts. You will make the greatest\nmistakes of all if you rely on such inexact indicators. Notiiing can\nsubstitute for gathering concrete knowledge. Study and spy on your\nopponent for however long it takes; diis will pay off in die long run.\n\nSecond, never trust appearances. Anyone widi a serpent's heart\ncan use a show of kindness to cloak it; a person who is blustery on die\noutside is often really a coward. Learn to see through appearances and\ntheir contradictions. Never trust die version that people give of\nthemselvesit is utterly unreliable.\n\nImage: The Hunter. He does not lay the same trap for a wolf as\nfor a fox. He does not set bait where no one will take it. He knows his\nprey thoroughly, its habits and hideaways, and hunts accordingly.\n\n\nAutiiority:; Be convinced, that there are no persons so\ninsignificant and inconsiderable, but may, some time or other, have it\nin their power to be of use to you; which they certainly will not, if you\nhave once shown them contempt. Wrongs are often forgiven, but\ncontempt never is. Our pride remembers it for ever. (Lord Chesterfield,\n1694-1773)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nWhat possible good can come from ignorance about other people\nLearn to tell die lions from the lambs or pay the price.

If you make diis distinction well,\nyou will succeed widi-out needing to coerce anyone too much. But if\nyou deal blindly with whomever crosses your padi, you will have a life\nof constant sorrow, if you even live tiiat long.

The following are\n\ndie five most dangerous and difficult types of mark in the jungle, as\nidentified by artistscon and otherwiseof the past.\n\nTLIK HK\\ K\\CK OK\n\nkoi'k nv. \\\n\n[Lope de] Aguirre's character is amply illustrated in an anecdote\nfrom the. chronicle of Garcilaso de la Vega, who related that in 1548\nAguirre was a member of a platoon of soldiers escorting Indian slaves\nfrom the mines at Potosl [Bolivia] to a royal treasury depot. The\nIndians were illegally burdened with great quantities of silver, and a\nlocal official arrested Aguirre, sentencing him to receive two hundred\nlashes in lieu of a fine for oppressing the Indians. \"The soldier Aguirre,\nhaving received a notification of the sentence, besought the alcalde\nthat, instead of flogging him, he would put him to death, for that he\nwas a gentleman by birth.... All this had no effect on the alcalde, who\nordered the executioner to bring a beast, and execute the sentence. The\nexecutioner came to the\n\nThe Arrogant and Proud Man. Although he may initially disguise\nit, tiiis man's touchy pride makes him very dangerous. Any perceived\nslight will lead to a vengeance of overwhelming violence. You may\nsay to yourself, \u201cBut I only said such-and-such at a party, where\neveryone was drunk. ...\u201d It does not matter. There is no sanity behind\nhis overreaction, so do not waste time trying to figure him out. If at\nany point in your dealings with a person you sense an oversensitive\nand overactive pride, flee. Whatever you are hoping for from him isn't\nworth it.\n\nThe Hopelessly Insecure Man. This man is related to the proud\nand arrogant type, but is less violent and harder to spot. His ego is\nfragile, his sense of self insecure, and if he feels himself deceived or\nattacked, the hurt will simmer. He will attack you in bites tiiat will take\nforever to get big enough for you to notice. If you find you have\ndeceived or harmed such a man, disappear for a long time. Do not stay\naround him or he will nibble you to death.\n\nMr. Suspicion. Anotiier variant on the breeds above, this is a\nfuture Joe Stalin. He sees what he wants to seeusually the worstin\nother people, and imagines that everyone is after him. Mr. Suspicion is\nin fact the least dangerous of the three: Genuinely unbalanced, he is\neasy to deceive, just as Stalin himself was constandy deceived. Play on\n\nhis suspicious nature to get him to turn against odier people. But if you\ndo become die target of his suspicions, watch out.\n\nThe Serpent with a Long Memory. If hurt or deceived, this man\nwill show no anger on the surface; he will calculate and wait. Then,\nwhen he is in a position to turn the tables, he will exact a revenge\nmarked by a coldblooded shrewdness. Recognize this man by his\ncalculation and cunning in the different areas of his life. He is usually\ncold and unaffectionate. Be doubly careful of this snake, and if you\nhave somehow injured him, either crush him completely or get him out\nof your sight.\n\nThe Plain, Unassuming, and Often Unintelligent Man. Ah, your\nears prick up when you find such a tempting victim. But this man is a\nlot harder\n\nto deceive than you imagine. Falling for a ruse often takes\nintelligence and imaginationa sense of die possible rewards. The blunt\nman will not take die bait because he does not recognize it. He is diat\nunaware. The danger widi this man is not mat he will harm you or seek\nrevenge, but merely that he will waste your time, energy, resources,\nand even your sanity in trying to deceive him. Have a test ready for a\nmarka joke, a story. If his reaction is utterly literal, this is die type you\nare dealing with. Continue at your own risk.\n\nTRANSGRESSIONS OF THE LAW\n\nTransgression I\n\nIn the early part of the thirteenth century, Muhammad, the shah of\nKhwarezm, managed after many wars to forge a huge empire,\nextending west to present-day Turkey and south to Afghanistan. The\nempire's center was the great Asian capital of Samarkand. The shah\nhad a powerful, well-trained army, and could mobilize 200,000\nwarriors within days.\n\nIn 1219 Muhammad received an embassy from a new tribal\nleader to the east, Genghis Khan. The embassy included all sorts of\ngifts to the great Muhammad, representing the finest goods from\nKhan's small but growing Mongol empire. Genghis Khan wanted to\nreopen die Silk Route to Europe, and offered to share it with\nMuhammad, while promising peace between the two empires.\n\nMuhammad did not know this upstart from the east, who, it\nseemed to him, was extremely arrogant to try to talk as an equal to one\n\nso clearly his superior. He ignored Khan's offer. Khan tried again: This\ntime he sent a caravan of a hundred camels filled with the rarest\narticles he had plundered from China. Before the caravan reached\nMuhammad, however, Inalchik, die governor of a region bordering on\nSamarkand, seized it for himself, and executed its leaders.\n\nGenghis Khan was sure diat this was a mistakethat Inalchik had\nacted without Muhammad's approval. He sent yet another mission to\nMuhammad, reiterating his offer and asking that the governor be\npunished. This time Muhammad himself had one of the ambassadors\nbeheaded, and sent the other two back with shaved headsa horrifying\ninsult in the Mongol code of honor. Khan sent a message to die shah:\n\u201cYou have chosen war. What will happen will happen, and what it is to\nbe we know not; only God knows.\u201d Mobilizing his forces, in 1220 he\nattacked Inalchik's province, where he seized the capital, captured the\ngovernor, and ordered him executed by having molten silver poured\ninto his eyes and ears.\n\nOver the next year, Khan led a series of guerrilla-like campaigns\nagainst die shah's much larger army. His metiiod was totally novel for\nthe timehis soldiers could move very fast on horseback, and had\nmastered the art of firing widi bow and arrow while mounted. The\nspeed and flexibility of his forces allowed him to deceive Muhammad\nas to his intentions and die directions of his movements. Eventually he\nmanaged first to sur-\n\nprison, and put Aguirre on the beast.... The beast was driven on,\nand he received the lashes. ...\" When freed, Aguirre announced his\nintention of killing the official who had sentenced him, the alcalde\nEsquivel. Esquivel's term of office expired and he fled to Lima, three\nhundred twenty leagues away, but within fifteen days Aguirre had\ntracked him there. The frightened judge journeyed to Quito, a trip of\nfour hundred leagues, and in twenty days Aguirre arrived.\n\n\u201cWhen Esquivel heard of his presence,\u201d according to Garcilaso,\n\u201che made another journey of five hundred leagues to Cuzco; but in a\nfew days Aguirre also arrived, having travelled on foot and without\nshoes, saying that a whipped man has no business to ride a horse, or to\ngo where he would be seen by others. In this way, Aguirre followed his\njudge for three years, and four months.\u201d Wearying of the pursuit,\nEsquivel remained at Cuzco, a city so sternly governed that he felt he\n\nwould be safe from Aguirre. He took a house near the cathedral and\nnever ventured outdoors without a sword and a dagger. \"However, on a\ncertain Monday, at noon, Aguirre entered his house, and having\nwalked all over it, and having traversed a corridor, a saloon, a\nchamber, and an inner\n\nchamber where the\n\njudge kept his books,\n\nhe at last found him\n\nasleep over one of his\n\nbooks, and slabbed him\n\nto death. The murderer\n\nthen went out, but\n\nwhen he came to the\n\ndoor of the house, he\n\nfound that he had\n\nforgotten his hat, and\n\nhad the temerity to\n\nreturn and fetch it, and\n\nthen walked down\n\nthe street.\"\n\nthe golden dream:\n\nseekers of el dorado,\n\nWalker Chapman,\n\nA troublesome Crow seated herself on the back of a Sheep. The\nSheep, much against his will, carried her backward and forward for a\nlong time, and at last said, \u201cIf you had treated a dog in this way, you\nwould have had your deserts from his sharp teeth.\u201d To this the Crow\nreplied, \"I despise the weak, and yield to the strong.

Some men are slow to take offense, which\nmay make you misjudge the thickness of their skin, and fail to worry\nabout insulting them. But should you offend their honor and their\npride, tiiey will overwhelm you with a violence that seems sudden and\nextreme given their slowness to anger. If you want to turn people\ndown, it is best to do so politely and respectfully, even if you feel their\nrequest is impudent or their offer ridiculous. Never reject them with an\ninsult until you know them better; you may be dealing witii a Genghis\nKhan.\n\nTransgression IT\n\nIn the late 1910s some of the best swindlers in America formed a\ncon-artist ring based in Denver, Colorado. In the winter months they\nwould spread across the southern states, plying their trade. In 1920 Joe\nFurey, a leader of the ring, was working his way through Texas,\nmaking hundreds of thousands of dollars with classic con games. In\nFort Worth, he met a sucker named J. Frank Norfleet, a cattleman who\nowned a large ranch. Norfleet fell for the con. Convinced of die riches\nto come, he emptied his bank account of $45,000 and handed it over to\nFurey and his confederates. A few days later they gave him his\n\u201cmillions,\u201d which turned out to be a few good dollars wrapped around\na packet of newspaper clippings.\n\nFurey and his men had worked such cons a hundred times before,\nand the sucker was usually so embarrassed by his gullibility that he\nquietly learned his lesson and accepted the loss. But Norfleet was not\nlike otiier suckers. He went to die police, who told him there was httle\nthey could do. \u201cThen I'll go after those people myself,\u201d Norfleet told\nthe detectives. \u201cI'll get them, too, if it takes die rest of my life.\u201d His\nwife took over the ranch as Norfleet scoured the country, looking for\nothers who had been fleeced in the same game. One such sucker came\nforward, and the two men identified one of the con artists in San\nFrancisco, and managed to get him locked up. The man committed\nsuicide rather tiian face a long term in prison.\n\nNorfleet kept going. He tracked down another of the con artists in\nMontana, roped him like a calf, and dragged him through die muddy\nstreets to the town jail. He traveled not only across the country but to\nEngland, Canada, and Mexico in search of Joe Furey, and also of\n\nFurey's right-hand man, W. B. Spencer. Finding Spencer in Montreal,\nNorfleet chased him through the streets. Spencer escaped but the\nrancher stayed on his trail and caught up with him in Salt Lake City.\nPreferring the mercy of the law to Norfleet's wrath, Spencer turned\nhimself in.\n\nNorfleet found Furey in Jacksonville, Florida, and personally\nhauled him off to face justice in Texas. But he wouldn't stop there: He\ncontinued on to Denver, determined to break up the entire ring.\nSpending not only\n\nlarge sums of money but another year of his life in the pursuit, he\nmanaged to put all of the con ring's leaders behind bars. Even some he\ndidn't catch had grown so terrified of him that they too turned\nthemselves in.\n\nAfter five years of hunting, Norfleet had single-handedly\ndestroyed the country's largest confederation of con artists. The effort\nbankrupted him and ruined his marriage, but he died a satisfied man.\nInterpretation\n\nMost men accept the humiliation of being conned with a sense of\nresignation. They learn their lesson, recognizing that there is no such\nthing as a free lunch, and that they have usually been brought down by\ntheir own greed for easy money. Some, however, refuse to take their\nmedicine. Instead of reflecting on their own gullibility and avarice,\nthey see themselves as totally innocent victims.\n\nMen like this may seem to be crusaders for justice and honesty,\nbut they are actually immoderately insecure. Being fooled, being\nconned, has activated their self-doubt, and they are desperate to repair\nthe damage. Were the mortgage on Norfleet's ranch, the collapse of his\nmarriage, and the years of borrowing money and living in cheap hotels\nworth his revenge over his embarrassment at being fleeced To the\nNorfleets of the world, overcoming their embarrassment is worth any\nprice.\n\nAll people have insecurities, and often the best way to deceive a\nsucker is to play upon his insecurities. But in the realm of power,\neverything is a question of degree, and the person who is decidedly\nmore insecure than the average mortal presents great dangers. Be\nwarned: If you practice deception or trickery of any sort, study your\nmark well. Some people's insecurity and ego fragility cannot tolerate\n\nthe slightest offense. To see if you are dealing with such a type, test\nthem firstmake, say, a mild joke at their expense. A confident person\nwill laugh; an overly insecure one will react as if personally insulted. If\nyou suspect you are dealing with this type, find another victim.\n\nTransgression III\n\nIn the fifth century B.C., Ch'ung-erh, the prince of Ch'in (in\npresent-day China), had been forced into exile. He lived modesdyeven,\nsometimes, in povertywaiting for the time when he could return home\nand resume his princely life. Once he was passing through the state of\nCheng, where the ruler, not knowing who he was, treated him rudely.\nThe ruler's minister, Shu Chan, saw this and said, \u201cThis man is a\nworthy prince. May Your Highness treat him with great courtesy and\nthereby place him under an obligation!\u201d But the ruler, able to see only\nthe prince's lowly station, ignored this advice and insulted the prince\nagain. Shu Chan again warned his master, saying, \u201cIf Your Highness\ncannot treat Ch'ung-erh with courtesy, you should put him to death, to\navoid calamity in the future.\u201d The ruler only scoffed.\n\nYears later, the prince was finally able to return home, his\ncircumstances gready changed. He did not forget who had been kind to\nhim, and\n\nwho had been insolent, during his years of poverty. Least of all\ndid he forget his treatment at the hands of the ruler of Cheng. At his\nfirst opportunity he assembled a vast army and marched on Cheng,\ntaking eight cities, destroying the kingdom, and sending the ruler into\nan exile of his own. Interpretation\n\nYou can never be sure who you are dealing with. A man who is of\nlittie importance and means today can be a person of power tomorrow.\nWe forget a lot in our lives, but we rarely forget an insult.\n\nHow was me ruler of Cheng to know that Prince Ch'ung-erh was\nan ambitious, calculating, cunning type, a serpent with a long memory\nThere was really no way for him to know, you may saybut since mere\nwas no way, it would have been better not to tempt the fates by finding\nout. There is notfiing to be gained by insulting a person unnecessarily.\nSwallow the impulse to offend, even if the other person seems weak.\nThe satisfaction is meager compared to the danger mat someday he or\nshe will be in a position to hurt you.\n\nTransgression IV\n\nThe year of 1920 had been a particularly bad one for American\nart dealers. Big buyersdie robber-baron generation of die previous\ncenturywere getting to an age where they were dying off like flies, and\nno new millionaires had emerged to take dieir place. Things were so\nbad diat a number of the major dealers decided to pool their resources,\nan unheard-of event, since art dealers usually get along like cats and\ndogs.\n\nJoseph Duveen, art dealer to the richest tycoons of America, was\nsuffering more man the others mat year, so he decided to go along with\nthis alliance. The group now consisted of the five biggest dealers in the\ncountry. Looking around for a new client, they decided mat their last\nbest hope was Henry Ford, then the wealthiest man in America. Ford\nhad yet to venture into the art market, and he was such a big target that\nit made sense for them to work togedier.\n\nThe dealers decided to assemble a list, \u201cThe 100 Greatest\nPaintings in me World\u201d (all of which they happened to have in stock),\nand to offer the lot of them to Ford. With one purchase he could make\nhimself the world's greatest collector. The consortium worked for\nweeks to produce a magnificent object: a three-volume set of books\ncontaining beautiful reproductions of the paintings, as well as\nscholarly texts accompanying each picture. Next they made a personal\nvisit to Ford at his home in Dearborn, Michigan. There mey were\nsurprised by the simplicity of his house: Mr. Ford was obviously an\nextremely unaffected man.\n\nFord received them in his study. Looking through the book, he\nexpressed astonishment and delight. The excited dealers began\nimagining the millions of dollars mat would shortly flow into their\ncoffers. Finally, however, Ford looked up from die book and said,\n\u201cGendemen, beautiful books like tiiese, with beautiful colored pictures\nlike these, must cost an awful lot!\u201d \u201cBut Mr. Ford!\u201d exclaimed\nDuveen, \"we don't expect you to buy these\n\nbooks. We got tiiem up especially for you, to show you the\npictures. These books are a present to you.\u201c Ford seemed puzzled.\n\u201dGendemen,\u201c he said, \u201dit is extremely nice of you, but I really don't\nsee how I can accept a beautiful, expensive present like mis from\nstrangers.\u201c Duveen explained to Ford that the reproductions in the\nbooks showed paintings mey had hoped to sell to him. Ford finally\n\nunderstood. \u201dBut gendemen,\u201c he exclaimed, \u2019what would I want widi\ndie original pictures when the ones right here in these books are so\nbeautiful\" Interpretation\n\nJoseph Duveen prided himself on studying his victims and clients\nin advance, figuring out dieir weaknesses and die peculiarities of dieir\ntastes before he ever met diem. He was driven by desperation to drop\nthis tactic just once, in his assault on Henry Ford. It took him mondis\nto recover from his misjudgment, both mentally and monetarily. Ford\nwas the unassuming plain-man type who just isn't worth the botiier. He\nwas the incarnation of those literal-minded folk who do not possess\nenough imagination to be deceived. From then on, Duveen saved his\nenergies for the Mellons and Morgans of the worldmen crafty enough\nor him to entrap in his snares.\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nThe ability to measure people and to know who you're dealing\nwith is die most important skill of all in gadiering and conserving\npower. Without it you are blind: Not only will you offend the wrong\npeople, you will choose the wrong types to work on, and will think you\nare flattering people when you are actually insulting them. Before\nembarking on any move, take the measure of your mark or potential\nopponent. Otiierwise you will waste time and make mistakes. Study\npeople's weaknesses, the chinks in dieir armor, dieir areas of bodi pride\nand insecurity. Know tiieir ins and outs before you even decide\nwhetiier or not to deal widi diem.\n\nTwo final words of caution: First, in judging and measuring your\nopponent, never rely on your instincts. You will make the greatest\nmistakes of all if you rely on such inexact indicators. Notiiing can\nsubstitute for gathering concrete knowledge. Study and spy on your\nopponent for however long it takes; diis will pay off in die long run.\n\nSecond, never trust appearances. Anyone widi a serpent's heart\ncan use a show of kindness to cloak it; a person who is blustery on die\noutside is often really a coward. Learn to see through appearances and\ntheir contradictions. Never trust die version that people give of\nthemselvesit is utterly unreliable.\n\nImage: The Hunter. He does not lay the same trap for a wolf as\nfor a fox.

The original text is: 'DO NOT COMMIT TO ANYONE\n\nJUDGMENT\n\nIt is the fool who always rushes to take sides. Do not commit to\nany side or cause but yourself. By maintaining your independence, you\nbecome the master of others playing people against one another,\nmaking them pursue you.\n\nPART I: DO NOT COMMIT TO ANYONE, BUT BE\nCOURTED BY ALL\n\nIf you allow people to feel they possess you to any degree, you\nlose all power over them. By not committing your affections, they will\nonly try harder to win you over. Stay aloof and you gain the power that\ncomes from their attention and frustrated desire. Play the Virgin\nQueen: Give them hope but never satisfaction.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nWhen Queen Elizabeth I ascended the throne of England, in 1558,\nthere was much to-do about her finding a husband. The issue was\ndebated in Parliament, and was a main topic of conversation among\nEnglishmen of all classes; they often disagreed as to whom she should\nmarry, but everyone thought she should marry as soon as possible, for\na queen must have a king, and must bear heirs for the kingdom. The\ndebates raged on for years. Meanwhile the most handsome and eligible\nbachelors in the realmSir Robert Dudley, the Earl of Essex, Sir Walter\nRaleighvied for Elizabeth's hand. She did not discourage them, but she\nseemed to be in no hurry, and her hints as to which man might be her\nfavorite often contradicted each other. In 1566, Parliament sent a\ndelegation to Elizabeth urging her to marry before she was too old to\nbear children. She did not argue, nor did she discourage the delegation,\nbut she remained a virgin nonetheless.\n\nThe delicate game that Elizabeth played with her suitors slowly\nmade her the subject of innumerable sexual fantasies and the object of\ncultish worship. The court physician, Simon Forman, used his diary to\n\ndescribe his dreams of deflowering her. Painters represented her as\nDiana and other goddesses. The poet Edmund Spenser a/d others\nwrote eulogies to the Virgin Queen. She was referred to as \"th\n\nThroughout Europe, kings and princes knew that a marriage with\nElizabeth would seal an alliance between England and any nation. The\nking of Spain wooed her, as did the prince of Sweden and the archduke\nof Austria. She politely refused them all.\n\nThe great diplomatic issue of Elizabeth's day was posed by the\nrevolt of the Flemish and Dutch Lowlands, which were then\npossessions of Spain. Should England break its alliance with Spain and\nchoose France as its main ally on the Continent, thereby encouraging\nFlemish and Dutch independence By 1570 it had come to seem that an\nalliance with France would be England's wisest course. France had two\neligible men of noble blood, the dukes of Anjou and Alencon, brothers\nof the French king. Would either of them marry Elizabeth Both had\nadvantages, and Elizabeth kept the hopes of both alive. The issue\nsimmered for years. The duke of Anjou made sev-\n\neral visits to England, kissed Elizabeth in public, even called her\nby pet names; she appeared to requite his affections. Meanwhile, as\nshe flirted with the two brothers, a treaty was signed that sealed peace\nbetween France and England. By 1582 Elizabeth felt she could break\noff the courtship. In the case of the duke of Anjou in particular, she did\nso witii great relief: For the sake of diplomacy she had allowed herseli\nto be courted by a man whose presence she could not stand and whom\nshe found physically repulsive. Once peace between France and\nEngland was secure, she dropped the unctuous duke as politely as she\ncould.\n\nBy this time Elizabeth was too old to bear children. She was\naccordingly able to live the rest of her life as she desired, and she died\ndie Virgin Queen. She left no direct heir, but ruled through a period of\nincomparable peace and cultural fertility.\n\nInterpretation\n\nElizabeth had good reason not to marry: She had witnessed die\nmistakes of Mary Queen of Scots, her cousin. Resisting the idea o\nbeing ruled by a woman, the Scots expected Mary to marry and marry\nwisely. To wed a foreigner would be unpopular; to favor any particular\nnoble house would open up terrible rivalries. In the end Mary chose\n\n\nLord Darnley, a Catholic. In doing so she incurred the wrath of\nScodand's Protestants, and endless turmoil ensued.\n\nElizabeth knew that marriage can often lead to a female ruler's\nundoing: By marrying and committing to an alliance widi one party or\nnation, the queen becomes embroiled in conflicts that are not of her\nchoosing, conflicts which may eventually overwhelm her or lead her\ninto a futile war. Also, die husband becomes the de facto ruler, and\noften tries to do away with his wife the queen, as Darnley tried to get\nrid of Mary. Elizabeth learned the lesson well. She had two goals as a\ntuler: to a oid marriage and to avoid war. She managed to combine\nthese goals by umgling die possibility of marriage in order to forge\nalliances. The moment she committed to any single suitor would have\nbeen the moment she lost her power. She had to emanate mystery and\ndesirability, never discouraging anyone's hopes but never yielding.\n\nThrough this lifelong game of flirting and withdrawing, Elizabedi\ndominated die country and every man who sought to conquer her. As\nthe center of attention, she was in control. Keeping her independence\nabove all, Elizabeth protected her power and made herself an object of\nworship.\n\nI would rather be a beggar and single than a queen and married.\n\nQueen Elizabeth I, 1533-1603\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nSince power depends greatly on appearances, you must learn the\ntricks that will enhance your image. Refusing to commit to a person or\ngroup is one of these. When you hold yourself back, you incur not\nanger but a kind\n\nof respect. You instantly seem powerful because you make\nyourself un-graspable, rather than succumbing to the group, or to the\nrelationship, as most people do. This aura of power only grows with\ntime: As your reputation for independence grows, more and more\npeople will come to desire you, wanting to be the one who gets you to\ncommit. Desire is like a virus: If we see that someone is desired by\nother people, we tend to find this person desirable too.\n\nThe moment you commit, the magic is gone. You become like\neveryone else. People will try all kinds of underhanded methods to get\nyou to commit. They will give you gifts, shower you with favors, all to\nput you under obligation. Encourage the attention, stimulate their\n\ninterest, but do not commit at any cost. Accept the gifts and favors if\nyou so desire, but be careful to maintain your inner aloofness. You\ncannot inadvertentiy allow yourself to feel obligated to anyone.\n\nRemember, though: The goal is not to put people off, or to make\nit seem that you are incapable of commitment. Like the Virgin Queen,\nyou need to stir the pot, excite interest, lure people with the possibility\nof having you. You have to bend to their attention occasionally,\nthenbut never too far.\n\nThe Greek soldier and statesman Alcibiades played this game to\nperfection. It was Alcibiades who inspired and led the massive\nAthenian armada that invaded Sicily in 414 B.C. When envious\nAthenians back home tried to bring him down by accusing him of\ntrumped-up charges, he defected to the enemy, the Spartans, instead of\nfacing a trial back home. Then, after the Athenians were defeated at\nSyracuse, he left Sparta for Persia, even though the power of Sparta\nwas now on the rise. Now, however, both die Athenians and the\nSpartans courted Alcibiades because of his influence with tile Persians;\nand the Per tans showered him with honors because of his power over\nthe Athenians and the Spartans. He made promises to every side but\ncommitted to none, and in die end he held all the cards.\n\nIf you aspire to power and influence, try the Alcibiades tactic: Put\nyourself in the middle between competing powers. Lure one side with\nthe promise of your help; the other side, always wanting to outdo its\nenemy, will pursue you as well. As each side vies for your attention,\nyou will immediately seem a person of great influence and desirability.\nMore power will accrue to you than if you had rashly committed to\none side. To perfect this tactic you need to keep yourself inwardly free\nfrom emotional entanglements, and to view all those around you as\npawns in your rise to the top. You cannot let yourself become the\nlackey for any cause.\n\nIn die midst of die 1968 U.S. presidential election, Henry\nKissinger made a phone call to Richard Nixon's team. Kissinger had\nbeen allied with Nelson Rockefeller, who had unsuccessfully sought\nthe Republican nomination. Now Kissinger offered to supply the\nNixon camp with valuable inside information on the negotiations for\npeace in Vietnam that were then going on in Paris. He had a man on\n\n\ndie negotiating team keeping him informed of die latest developments.\nThe Nixon team gladly accepted his offer.\n\nAt the same time, however, Kissinger also approached the\nDemocratic nominee, Hubert Humphrey, and offered his aid. The\nHumphrey people\n\nasked him for inside information on Nixon and he supplied it.\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d Kissinger told Humphrey's people, \u201cI've hated Nixon for\nyears.\u201d In fact he had no interest in either side. What he really wanted\nwas what he got: the promise of a high-level cabinet post from both\nNixon and Humphrey. Whichever man won the election, Kissinger's\ncareer was secure.\nThe winner, of course, was Nixon, and Kissinger duly went on to\nhis cabinet post. Even so, he was careful never to appear too much of a\nNixon man. When Nixon was reelected in 1972, men much more loyal\nto him than Kissinger were fired. Kissinger was also the only Nixon\nhigh official to survive Watergate and serve under the next president,\nGerald Ford. By maintaining a little distance he thrived in turbulent\ntimes.\nThose who use this strategy often notice a strange phenomenon:\nPeople who rush to the support of others tend to gain little respect in\nthe process, for their help is so easily obtained, while those who stand\nback find themselves besieged with supplicants. Their aloofness is\npowerful, and everyone wants them on their side.\n\nWhen Picasso, after early years of poverty, had become the most\nsuccessful artist in the world, he did not commit himself to this dealer\nor that dealer, although they now besieged him from all sides with\nattractive offers and grand promises. Instead, he appeared to have no\ninterest in their services; this technique drove them wild, and as they\nfought over him his prices only rose. When Henry Kissinger, as U.S.\nsecretary of state, wanted to reach detente with the Soviet Union, he\nmade no concessions or conciliatory gestures, but courted China\ninstead. This infuriated and also scared the Sovietsthey were already\npolitica'ly isolated and feared further isolation if the United States and\nChina came together. Kissinger's move pushed them to the negotiating\ntable. The tactic has a parallel in seduction: When you want to seduce\na woman, Stendhal advises, court her sister first.\n\n\nStay aloof and people will come to you. It will become a\nchallenge for them to win your affections.

One\nday thev saw a fox that had been wounded by hunters lying helpless\nunder a tree, and gathered round it. The crows said, \u201c We will take the\nupper half of the fox. \u201d \u201c Then we will take the lower half,\u201dsaid the\nkites. The fox laughed at this, and said, \u201cI always thought the kites\nwere superior in creation to the crows; as such they must get the upper\nhalf of my body, of which my head, with the brain and other delicate\nthings in it, forms a portion.\u201d \u201cOh, yes, that is right, \u201d said the kites,\n\u201cwe will have that part of the fox. \u201d \u201c Not at all, \u201d said the crows, \u201cwe\n\nmust have it, as already agreed. \u201d Then a war arose between the rival\nparties, and a great many fell on both sides, and the remaining few\nescaped with difficulty. The fox continued there for some days,\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nIn the late fifteenth century, the strongest city-states in\nItalyVenice, Florence, Rome, and Milanfound themselves constandy\nsquabbling. Hovering above their struggles were the nations of France\nand Spain, ready to grab whatever they could from the weakened\nItalian powers. And trapped in the middle was the small state of\nMantua, ruled by the young Duke Gianfrancesco Gonzaga. Mantua\nwas strategically located in northern Italy, and it seemed only a matter\nof time before one of the powers swallowed it up and it ceased to exist\nas an independent kingdom.\n\nGonzaga was a fierce warrior and a skilled commander of troops,\nand he became a kind of mercenary general for whatever side paid him\nbest. In the year 1490, he married Isabella d'Este, daughter of the ruler\nof another small Italian duchy, Ferrara. Since he now spent most of his\ntime away fron Mantua, it fell to Isabella to rule in his stead.\n\nIsabella's first true test as ruler came in 1498, when King Louis\nXII of France was preparing armies to attack Milan. In their usual\nperfidious fashion, the Italian states immediately looked for ways to\nprofit from Milan's difficulties. Pope Alexander VI promised not to\nintervene, thereby giving the French carte blanche. The Venetians\nsignaled mat they would not help Milan, eitiierand in exchange for\ntiiis, they hoped the French would give them Mantua. The ruler of\nMilan, Lodovico Sforza, suddenly found himself alone and abandoned.\nHe turned to Isabella d'Este, one of his closest friends (also rumored to\nbe his lover), and begged her to persuade Duke Gonzaga to come to\nhis aid. Isabella tried, but her husband balked, for he saw Sforza's\ncause as hopeless. And so, in 1499, Louis swooped down on Milan and\ntook it widi ease.\n\nIsabella now faced a dilemma: If she stayed loyal to Lodovico,\nthe French would now move against her. But if, instead, she allied\nherself with France, she would make enemies elsewhere in Italy,\ncompromising Mantua once Louis eventually withdrew. And if she\nlooked to Venice or Rome for help, they would simply swallow up\nMantua under the cloak of coming to her aid. Yet she had to do\n\nsomething. The mighty king of France was breathing down her neck:\nShe decided to befriend him, as she had befriended Lodovico Sforza\nbefore himwith alluring gifts, witty, intelligent letters, and the\npossibility of her company, for Isabella was famous as a woman of\nincomparable beauty and charm.\n\nIn 1500 Louis invited Isabella to a great party in Milan to\ncelebrate his victory. Leonardo da Vinci built an enormous mechanical\nlion for the affair: When die lion opened its mouth, it spewed fresh\nlilies, the symbols of French royalty. At die party Isabella wore one of\nher celebrated dresses (she had by far the largest wardrobe of any of\nthe Italian princesses), and just as she had hoped, she charmed and\ncaptivated Louis, who ignored all the other ladies vying for his\nattention. She soon became his constant companion, and in exchange\nfor her friendship he pledged to protect Mantua's independence from\nVenice.\n\nAs one danger receded, however, another, more worrying one\narose, this time from die soudi, in the form of Cesare Borgia. Starting\nin 1500, Borgia had marched steadily northward, gobbling up all the\nsmall kingdoms in his path in the name of his father, Pope Alexander.\nIsabella understood Cesare perfecdy: He could be neidier trusted nor in\nany way offended. He had to be cajoled and kept at arm's lengdi.\nIsabella began by sending him giftsfalcons, prize dogs, perfumes, and\ndozens of masks, which she knew he always wore when he walked die\nstreets of Rome. She sent messengers widi flattering greetings\n(aldiough these messengers also acted as her spies). At one point\nCesare asked if he could house some troops in Mantua; Isabella\nmanaged to dissuade him politely, knowing full well diat once die\ntroops were quartered in die city, they would never leave.\n\nEven while Isabella was charming Cesare, she convinced\neveryone around her to take care never to utter a harsh word about\nhim, since he had spies everywhere and would use the slightest pretext\nfor invasion. When Isabella had a child, she asked Cesare to be the\ngodfather. She even dangled in front of him the possibility of a\nmarriage between her family and his. Somehow it all worked, for\nalthough elsewhere he seized everything in his path, he spared Mantua.\n\nIn 1503 Cesare's fadier, Alexander, died, and a few years later the\nnew pope, Julius II, went to war to drive die French troops from Italy.\n\n\nWhen the ruler of FerraraAlfonso, Isabella's brothersided widi the\nFrench, Julius decided to attack and humble him. Once again Isabella\nfound herself in the middle: die pope on one side, the French and her\nbrother on the ouier. She dared not ally herself with either, but to\noffend either would be equally disastrous. Again she played die double\ngame at which she had become so expert. On die one hand she got her\nhusband Gonzaga to fight for the pope, knowing he would not fight\nvery hard. On the other she let French troops pass through Mantua to\ncome to Ferrara's aid. While she publicly complained that the French\nhad \u201cinvaded\u201d her territory, she privately supplied diem with valuable\ninformation. To make die invasion plausible to Julius, she even had die\nFrench pretend to plunder Mantua. It worked once again: The pope left\nMantua alone.\n\nIn 1513, after a lengdiy siege, Julius defeated Ferrara, and die\nFrench troops withdrew. Worn out by the effort, the pope died a few\nmontiis later. Widi his death, the nightmarish cycle of batties and petty\nsquabbles began to repeat itself.\n\nleisurely feeding on the dead kites and crows, and then left the\nplace hale and hearty, observing, \u201cThe weak benefit by the quarrels of\nthe mighty.\u201d\n\nINDIAN FABLES\n\nMen of great abilities are slow to act, for it is easier to avoid\noccasions for committing yourself than to come well out of a\ncommitment. Such occasions test your judgment; it is safer to avoid\nthem than to emerge victorious from them. One obligation leads to a\ngreater one, and you come very near to the brink of disaster.\n\nBaltasar Gracian, 1601-1658\n\nTHE EAGLE AND THE SOW\n\nAn eagle built a nest on a tree, and hatched out some eaglets. And\na wild sow brought her litter under the tree. The eagle used to fly off\nafter her prey, and bring it back to her young. And the sow rooted\naround the tree and hunted in the woods, and when night came she\nwould bring her young something to eat. And the eagle and the sow\nlived in neighborly fashion. And a grimalkin laid her plans to destroy\nthe eaglets and the little sucking pigs. She went to the eagle, and said:\n\u201cEagle, you had better not fly very far away. Beware of the sow; she is\nplanning an evil design. She is going to undermine the roots of the\n\ntree. You see she is rooting all the time.\u201d Then the grimalkin went to\nthe sow and said: \u201cSow, you have not a good neighbor. Last evening I\nheard the eagle saying to her eaglets: \"My dear little eaglets, I am going\nto treat you to a nice little pig. Just as soon as the sow is gone, I will\nbring you a little young sucking pig.\u201d From that time the eagle ceased\nto fly out after prey, and the sow did not go any more into the forest.\nThe eaglets and the young pigs perished of starvation, and grimalkin\nfeasted on them.\n\nFABLES,\n\nLeo Tolstoy, 1828-1910\n\nA great deal changed in Italy during Isabella's reign: Popes came\nand went, Cesare Borgia rose and then fell, Venice lost its empire,\nMilan was invaded, Florence fell into decline, and Rome was sacked\nby die Hapsburg Emperor Charles V. Through all this, tiny Mantua not\nonly survived but thrived, its court die envy of Italy. Its weakh and\nsovereignty would remain intact for a century after Isabella's death, in\n1539.\n\nInterpretation\n\nIsabella d'Este understood Italy's political situation with amazing\nclarity: Once you took the side of any of the forces in the field, you\nwere doomed. The powerful would take you over, the weak would\nwear you down. Any new alliance would lead to a new enemy, and as\nthis cycle stirred up more conflict, odier forces would be dragged in,\nuntil you could no longer extricate yourself. Eventually you would\ncollapse from exhaustion.\n\nIsabella steered her kingdom on the only course that would bring\nher safely through. She would not allow herself to lose her head\nthrough loyalty to a duke or a king. Nor would she try to stop the\nconflict that raged around herthat would only drag her into it. And in\nany case the conflict was to her advantage. If the various parties were\nfighting to the death, and exhausting tiiemselves in the process, they\nwere in no position to gobble up Mantua. The source of Isabella's\npower was her clever ability to seem interested in the affairs and\ninterests of each side, while actually committing to no one but herself\nand her kingdom.\n\nOnce you step into a fight that is not of your own choosing, you\nlose all initiative. The combatants' interests become your interests; you\n\nbecome tiieir tool. Learn to control yourself, to restrain your natural\ntendency to take sides and join the fight. Be friendly and charming to\neach of the combatants, then step back as tiiey collide. With every\nbattle tiiey grow weaker, while you grow stronger widi every battle\nyou avoid.\n\nWhen the snipe and the mussel struggle, the fisherman gets the\nbenefit.\n\nAncient Chinese saying\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nTo succeed in the game of power, you have to master your\nemotions. But even if you succeed in gaining such self-control, you\ncan never control die temperamental dispositions of those around you.\nAnd tiiis presents a great danger. Most people operate in a whirlpool of\nemotions, constantiy reacting, churning up squabbles and conflicts.\nYour self-control and autonomy will only bother and infuriate them.\nThey will try to draw you into die whirlpool, begging you to take sides\nin tiieir endless battles, or to make peace for them. If you succumb to\ntheir emotional entreaties, little by little you will find your mind and\ntime occupied by their problems. Do not allow whatever compassion\nand pity you possess to suck you in. You can never win in tiiis game;\ndie conflicts can only multiply.\n\nOn the other hand, you cannot completely stand aside, for diat\nwould\n\ncause needless offense. To play the game properly, you must seem\ninterested in other people's problems, even sometimes appear to take\ntheir side. But while you make outward gestures of support, you must\nmaintain your inner energy and sanity by keeping your emotions\ndisengaged. No matter how hard people try to pull you in, never let\nyour interest in tiieir affairs and petty squabbles go beyond the surface.\nGive them gifts, listen wim a sympathetic look, even occasionally play\nthe charmerbut inwardly keep both the friendly kings and the\nperfidious Borgias at arm's length. By refusing to commit and thus\nmaintaining your autonomy you retain the initiative: Your moves stay\nmatters of your own choosing, not defensive reactions to the push-and-\npull of those around you.\n\nSlowness to pick up your weapons can be a weapon itself,\nespecially if you let other people exhaust themselves fighting, then\n\ntake advantage of their exhaustion. In ancient China, the kingdom of\nChin once invaded the kingdom of Hsing. Huan, the ruler of a nearby\nprovince, thought he should rush to Hsing's defense, but his adviser\ncounseled him to wait: \u201cHsing is not yet going to ruin,\u201d he said, \u201cand\nChin is not yet exhausted. If Chin is not exhausted, [we] cannot\nbecome very influential. Moreover, the merit of supporting a state in\ndanger is not as great as the virtue of reviving a ruined one.\u201d The\nadviser's argument won the day, and as he had predicted, Huan later\nhad the glory bodi of rescuing Hsing from the brink of destruction and\nthen of conquering an exhausted Chin. He stayed out of the fighting\nuntil the forces engaged in it had worn each other down, at which point\nit was safe for him to intervene.\n\nThat is what holding back from the fray allows you: time to\nposition yourself to take advantage of the situation once one side starts\nto lose. You can also take the game a step further, by promising your\nsupport to both sides in a conflict while maneuvering so that the one to\ncome out ahead in the struggle is you. This was what Castruccio\nCastracani, ruler of the Italian town of Lucca in the fourteenth century,\ndid when he had designs on the town of Pistoia. A siege would have\nbeen expensive, costing both lives and money, but Castruccio knew\nthat Pistoia contained two rival factions, the Blacks and the Whites,\nwhich hated one another. He negotiated with die Blacks, promising to\nhelp mem against the Whites; then, without their knowledge, he\npromised the Whites he would help them against the Blacks. And\nCastruccio kept his promiseshe sent an army to a Black-controlled gate\nto the city, which the sentries of course welcomed in. Meanwhile\nanother of his armies entered through a White-controlled gate. The two\narmies united in the middle, occupied the town, killed the leaders of\nboth factions, ended die internal war, and took Pistoia for Castruccio.\n\nPreserving your autonomy gives you options when people come\nto blowsyou can play the mediator, broker the peace, while really\nsecuring your own interests. You can pledge support to one side and\nthe other may have to court you with a higher bid. Or, like Castruccio,\nyou can appear to take bodi sides, then play the antagonists against\neach odier.\n\nOftentimes when a conflict breaks out, you are tempted to side\nwith the stronger party, or the one that offers you apparent advantages\n\n\nin an al-\n\nI'HE PRICE OF ENVY\n\nWhile a poor woman stood in the marketplace selling cheeses, a\ncat came along and carried off a cheese. A dog saw the pilferer and\ntried to take the cheese away from him. The cat stood up to the dog. So\nthey pitched into each other. The dog barked and snapped; the cat spat\nand scratched, but they could bring the battle to no decision. \u201cLet's go\nto the fox and have him referee the matter,\u201d the cat finally suggested.\n\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d said the dog. So they went to the fox. The fox listened\nto their arguments with a judicious air.\n\n\u201cFoolish animals,\u201d he chided them, \u201cwhy carry on like that If both\nof you are willing, I'll divide the cheese in two and you'll both be\nsatisfied.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d said the cat and the dog. So the fox took out his knife\nand cut the cheese in two, but, instead of cutting it lengthwise, he cut it\nin the width. \u201cMy half is smaller!\u201d protested the dog. The fox looked\njudiciously through his spectacles at the dog's share.\n\n\u201cYou're right, quite right!\u201d he decided. So he went and bit off a\npiece of the cat's share.\n\n\u201cThat will make it even!\u201d he said. When the cat saw what the fox\ndid she began to yowl:\n\n\"Just look! My part's\n\nsmaller now!\"\n\nThe fox again put on\n\nhis spectacles and\n\nlooked judiciously at\n\nthe cat's share.\n\n\u201cRight you are!\u201d said\n\nthe fox. \"Just a\n\nmoment, and I'll make\n\nit right.\"\n\nAnd he went and bit\n\noff a piece from the\n\ndog's cheese\n\nThis went on so long,\n\nwith the fox nibbling\n\nfirst at the dog's and\n\n\nthen at the cat's share,\n\nthat he finally ate up\n\nthe whole cheese before\n\ntheir eyes.\n\nA TREASURY OH JEWISH I'OLKLORt,\n\nNathan Ausubel, ed., 1948\n\nliance. This is risky business. First, it is often difficult to foresee\nwhich side will prevail in the long run.

Gesturing for the man to keep quiet,\nTalleyrand replied, \u201cNot a word! I'll tell you who we are tomorrow.\u201d\nHe well knew that only fools rush into a situationthat by committing\ntoo quickly you lose your maneuverability. People also respect you\nless: Perhaps tomorrow, they think, you will commit to another,\ndifferent cause, since you gave yourself so easily to this one. Good\nfortune is a fickle god and will often pass from one side to the other.\nCommitment to one side deprives you of the advantage of time and the\nluxury of waiting. Let others fall in love with this group or that; for\nyour part don't rush in, don't lose your head.\n\nFinally, there are occasions when it is wisest to drop all pretence\nof appearing supportive and instead to trumpet your independence and\nself-reliance. The aristocratic pose of independence is particularly\nimportant for those who need to gain respect. George Washington\nrecognized this in his work to establish the young American republic\non firm ground. As president, Washington avoided the temptation of\nmaking an alliance with France or England, despite the pressure on\nhim to do so. He wanted the country to earn the world's respect\nthrough its independence. Although a treaty with France might have\nhelped in the short term, in the long run he knew it would be more\n\neffective to establish the nation's autonomy. Europe would have to see\nthe United States as an equal power.\n\nRemember: You have only so much energy and so much time.\nEvery moment wasted on the affairs of others subtracts from your\nstrength. You may be afraid that people will condemn you as heartless,\nbut in the end, maintaining your independence and self-reliance will\ngain you more respect and place you in a position of power from\nwhich you can choose to help others on your own initiative.\n\nImage: A Thicket of Shrubs.

Play the Virgin\nQueen: Give them hope but never satisfaction.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nWhen Queen Elizabeth I ascended the throne of England, in 1558,\nthere was much to-do about her finding a husband. The issue was\ndebated in Parliament, and was a main topic of conversation among\nEnglishmen of all classes; they often disagreed as to whom she should\nmarry, but everyone thought she should marry as soon as possible, for\na queen must have a king, and must bear heirs for the kingdom. The\ndebates raged on for years. Meanwhile the most handsome and eligible\nbachelors in the realmSir Robert Dudley, the Earl of Essex, Sir Walter\nRaleighvied for Elizabeth's hand. She did not discourage them, but she\nseemed to be in no hurry, and her hints as to which man might be her\nfavorite often contradicted each other. In 1566, Parliament sent a\ndelegation to Elizabeth urging her to marry before she was too old to\nbear children. She did not argue, nor did she discourage the delegation,\nbut she remained a virgin nonetheless.\n\nThe delicate game that Elizabeth played with her suitors slowly\nmade her the subject of innumerable sexual fantasies and the object of\ncultish worship. The court physician, Simon Forman, used his diary to\n\ndescribe his dreams of deflowering her. Painters represented her as\nDiana and other goddesses. The poet Edmund Spenser a/d others\nwrote eulogies to the Virgin Queen. She was referred to as \"th\n\nThroughout Europe, kings and princes knew that a marriage with\nElizabeth would seal an alliance between England and any nation. The\nking of Spain wooed her, as did the prince of Sweden and the archduke\nof Austria. She politely refused them all.\n\nThe great diplomatic issue of Elizabeth's day was posed by the\nrevolt of the Flemish and Dutch Lowlands, which were then\npossessions of Spain. Should England break its alliance with Spain and\nchoose France as its main ally on the Continent, thereby encouraging\nFlemish and Dutch independence By 1570 it had come to seem that an\nalliance with France would be England's wisest course. France had two\neligible men of noble blood, the dukes of Anjou and Alencon, brothers\nof the French king. Would either of them marry Elizabeth Both had\nadvantages, and Elizabeth kept the hopes of both alive. The issue\nsimmered for years. The duke of Anjou made sev-\n\neral visits to England, kissed Elizabeth in public, even called her\nby pet names; she appeared to requite his affections. Meanwhile, as\nshe flirted with the two brothers, a treaty was signed that sealed peace\nbetween France and England. By 1582 Elizabeth felt she could break\noff the courtship. In the case of the duke of Anjou in particular, she did\nso witii great relief: For the sake of diplomacy she had allowed herseli\nto be courted by a man whose presence she could not stand and whom\nshe found physically repulsive. Once peace between France and\nEngland was secure, she dropped the unctuous duke as politely as she\ncould.\n\nBy this time Elizabeth was too old to bear children. She was\naccordingly able to live the rest of her life as she desired, and she died\ndie Virgin Queen. She left no direct heir, but ruled through a period of\nincomparable peace and cultural fertility.\n\nInterpretation\n\nElizabeth had good reason not to marry: She had witnessed die\nmistakes of Mary Queen of Scots, her cousin. Resisting the idea o\nbeing ruled by a woman, the Scots expected Mary to marry and marry\nwisely. To wed a foreigner would be unpopular; to favor any particular\nnoble house would open up terrible rivalries. In the end Mary chose\n\n\nLord Darnley, a Catholic. In doing so she incurred the wrath of\nScodand's Protestants, and endless turmoil ensued.\n\nElizabeth knew that marriage can often lead to a female ruler's\nundoing: By marrying and committing to an alliance widi one party or\nnation, the queen becomes embroiled in conflicts that are not of her\nchoosing, conflicts which may eventually overwhelm her or lead her\ninto a futile war. Also, die husband becomes the de facto ruler, and\noften tries to do away with his wife the queen, as Darnley tried to get\nrid of Mary. Elizabeth learned the lesson well. She had two goals as a\ntuler: to a oid marriage and to avoid war. She managed to combine\nthese goals by umgling die possibility of marriage in order to forge\nalliances. The moment she committed to any single suitor would have\nbeen the moment she lost her power. She had to emanate mystery and\ndesirability, never discouraging anyone's hopes but never yielding.\n\nThrough this lifelong game of flirting and withdrawing, Elizabedi\ndominated die country and every man who sought to conquer her. As\nthe center of attention, she was in control. Keeping her independence\nabove all, Elizabeth protected her power and made herself an object of\nworship.\n\nI would rather be a beggar and single than a queen and married.\n\nQueen Elizabeth I, 1533-1603\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nSince power depends greatly on appearances, you must learn the\ntricks that will enhance your image. Refusing to commit to a person or\ngroup is one of these. When you hold yourself back, you incur not\nanger but a kind\n\nof respect. You instantly seem powerful because you make\nyourself un-graspable, rather than succumbing to the group, or to the\nrelationship, as most people do. This aura of power only grows with\ntime: As your reputation for independence grows, more and more\npeople will come to desire you, wanting to be the one who gets you to\ncommit. Desire is like a virus: If we see that someone is desired by\nother people, we tend to find this person desirable too.\n\nThe moment you commit, the magic is gone. You become like\neveryone else. People will try all kinds of underhanded methods to get\nyou to commit. They will give you gifts, shower you with favors, all to\nput you under obligation. Encourage the attention, stimulate their\n\ninterest, but do not commit at any cost. Accept the gifts and favors if\nyou so desire, but be careful to maintain your inner aloofness. You\ncannot inadvertentiy allow yourself to feel obligated to anyone.\n\nRemember, though: The goal is not to put people off, or to make\nit seem that you are incapable of commitment. Like the Virgin Queen,\nyou need to stir the pot, excite interest, lure people with the possibility\nof having you. You have to bend to their attention occasionally,\nthenbut never too far.\n\nThe Greek soldier and statesman Alcibiades played this game to\nperfection. It was Alcibiades who inspired and led the massive\nAthenian armada that invaded Sicily in 414 B.C. When envious\nAthenians back home tried to bring him down by accusing him of\ntrumped-up charges, he defected to the enemy, the Spartans, instead of\nfacing a trial back home. Then, after the Athenians were defeated at\nSyracuse, he left Sparta for Persia, even though the power of Sparta\nwas now on the rise. Now, however, both die Athenians and the\nSpartans courted Alcibiades because of his influence with tile Persians;\nand the Per tans showered him with honors because of his power over\nthe Athenians and the Spartans. He made promises to every side but\ncommitted to none, and in die end he held all the cards.\n\nIf you aspire to power and influence, try the Alcibiades tactic: Put\nyourself in the middle between competing powers. Lure one side with\nthe promise of your help; the other side, always wanting to outdo its\nenemy, will pursue you as well. As each side vies for your attention,\nyou will immediately seem a person of great influence and desirability.\nMore power will accrue to you than if you had rashly committed to\none side. To perfect this tactic you need to keep yourself inwardly free\nfrom emotional entanglements, and to view all those around you as\npawns in your rise to the top. You cannot let yourself become the\nlackey for any cause.\n\nIn die midst of die 1968 U.S. presidential election, Henry\nKissinger made a phone call to Richard Nixon's team. Kissinger had\nbeen allied with Nelson Rockefeller, who had unsuccessfully sought\nthe Republican nomination. Now Kissinger offered to supply the\nNixon camp with valuable inside information on the negotiations for\npeace in Vietnam that were then going on in Paris. He had a man on\n\n\ndie negotiating team keeping him informed of die latest developments.\nThe Nixon team gladly accepted his offer.\n\nAt the same time, however, Kissinger also approached the\nDemocratic nominee, Hubert Humphrey, and offered his aid. The\nHumphrey people\n\nasked him for inside information on Nixon and he supplied it.\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d Kissinger told Humphrey's people, \u201cI've hated Nixon for\nyears.\u201d In fact he had no interest in either side. What he really wanted\nwas what he got: the promise of a high-level cabinet post from both\nNixon and Humphrey. Whichever man won the election, Kissinger's\ncareer was secure.\nThe winner, of course, was Nixon, and Kissinger duly went on to\nhis cabinet post. Even so, he was careful never to appear too much of a\nNixon man. When Nixon was reelected in 1972, men much more loyal\nto him than Kissinger were fired. Kissinger was also the only Nixon\nhigh official to survive Watergate and serve under the next president,\nGerald Ford. By maintaining a little distance he thrived in turbulent\ntimes.\nThose who use this strategy often notice a strange phenomenon:\nPeople who rush to the support of others tend to gain little respect in\nthe process, for their help is so easily obtained, while those who stand\nback find themselves besieged with supplicants. Their aloofness is\npowerful, and everyone wants them on their side.\n\nWhen Picasso, after early years of poverty, had become the most\nsuccessful artist in the world, he did not commit himself to this dealer\nor that dealer, although they now besieged him from all sides with\nattractive offers and grand promises. Instead, he appeared to have no\ninterest in their services; this technique drove them wild, and as they\nfought over him his prices only rose. When Henry Kissinger, as U.S.\nsecretary of state, wanted to reach detente with the Soviet Union, he\nmade no concessions or conciliatory gestures, but courted China\ninstead. This infuriated and also scared the Sovietsthey were already\npolitica'ly isolated and feared further isolation if the United States and\nChina came together. Kissinger's move pushed them to the negotiating\ntable. The tactic has a parallel in seduction: When you want to seduce\na woman, Stendhal advises, court her sister first.\n\n\nStay aloof and people will come to you. It will become a\nchallenge for them to win your affections. As long as you imitate the\nwise Virgin Queen and stimulate their hopes, you will remain a magnet\nof attention and desire.\n\nImage:\n\nThe Virgin Queen.\n\nThe center of attention,\n\ndesire, and worship. Never\n\nsuccumbing to one suitor or the\n\nother, the Virgin Queen keeps\n\nthem all revolving around\n\nher like planets, unable to\n\nleave her orbit but never\n\ngetting any closer\n\nto her.\n\nAuthority: Do not commit yourself to anybody or anything, for\nthat is to be a slave, a slave to every man. . . . Above all, keep yourself\nfree of commitments and obligations they are the device of another to\nget you into his power. .. . (Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658)\n\nPART II: DO NOT COMMIT TO ANYONE-STAY ABOVE\nTHE FRAY\n\nDo not let people drag you into their petty fights and squabbles.\nSeem interested and supportive, but find a way to remain neutral; let\nothers do the fighting while you stand back, watch and wait. When the\nfighting parties are good and tired they will be ripe for the picking.\nYou can make it a practice, in fact, to stir up quarrels between other\npeople, and then offer to mediate, gaining power as the go-between.\n\nThe kites and the crows made an agreement among themselves\nthat thev should go halves in everything obtained in the forest. One\nday thev saw a fox that had been wounded by hunters lying helpless\nunder a tree, and gathered round it. The crows said, \u201c We will take the\nupper half of the fox. \u201d \u201c Then we will take the lower half,\u201dsaid the\nkites. The fox laughed at this, and said, \u201cI always thought the kites\nwere superior in creation to the crows; as such they must get the upper\nhalf of my body, of which my head, with the brain and other delicate\nthings in it, forms a portion.\u201d \u201cOh, yes, that is right, \u201d said the kites,\n\u201cwe will have that part of the fox. \u201d \u201c Not at all, \u201d said the crows, \u201cwe\n\nmust have it, as already agreed. \u201d Then a war arose between the rival\nparties, and a great many fell on both sides, and the remaining few\nescaped with difficulty. The fox continued there for some days,\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nIn the late fifteenth century, the strongest city-states in\nItalyVenice, Florence, Rome, and Milanfound themselves constandy\nsquabbling. Hovering above their struggles were the nations of France\nand Spain, ready to grab whatever they could from the weakened\nItalian powers. And trapped in the middle was the small state of\nMantua, ruled by the young Duke Gianfrancesco Gonzaga. Mantua\nwas strategically located in northern Italy, and it seemed only a matter\nof time before one of the powers swallowed it up and it ceased to exist\nas an independent kingdom.\n\nGonzaga was a fierce warrior and a skilled commander of troops,\nand he became a kind of mercenary general for whatever side paid him\nbest. In the year 1490, he married Isabella d'Este, daughter of the ruler\nof another small Italian duchy, Ferrara. Since he now spent most of his\ntime away fron Mantua, it fell to Isabella to rule in his stead.\n\nIsabella's first true test as ruler came in 1498, when King Louis\nXII of France was preparing armies to attack Milan. In their usual\nperfidious fashion, the Italian states immediately looked for ways to\nprofit from Milan's difficulties. Pope Alexander VI promised not to\nintervene, thereby giving the French carte blanche. The Venetians\nsignaled mat they would not help Milan, eitiierand in exchange for\ntiiis, they hoped the French would give them Mantua. The ruler of\nMilan, Lodovico Sforza, suddenly found himself alone and abandoned.\nHe turned to Isabella d'Este, one of his closest friends (also rumored to\nbe his lover), and begged her to persuade Duke Gonzaga to come to\nhis aid. Isabella tried, but her husband balked, for he saw Sforza's\ncause as hopeless. And so, in 1499, Louis swooped down on Milan and\ntook it widi ease.\n\nIsabella now faced a dilemma: If she stayed loyal to Lodovico,\nthe French would now move against her. But if, instead, she allied\nherself with France, she would make enemies elsewhere in Italy,\ncompromising Mantua once Louis eventually withdrew. And if she\nlooked to Venice or Rome for help, they would simply swallow up\nMantua under the cloak of coming to her aid. Yet she had to do\n\nsomething. The mighty king of France was breathing down her neck:\nShe decided to befriend him, as she had befriended Lodovico Sforza\nbefore himwith alluring gifts, witty, intelligent letters, and the\npossibility of her company, for Isabella was famous as a woman of\nincomparable beauty and charm.\n\nIn 1500 Louis invited Isabella to a great party in Milan to\ncelebrate his victory. Leonardo da Vinci built an enormous mechanical\nlion for the affair: When die lion opened its mouth, it spewed fresh\nlilies, the symbols of French royalty. At die party Isabella wore one of\nher celebrated dresses (she had by far the largest wardrobe of any of\nthe Italian princesses), and just as she had hoped, she charmed and\ncaptivated Louis, who ignored all the other ladies vying for his\nattention. She soon became his constant companion, and in exchange\nfor her friendship he pledged to protect Mantua's independence from\nVenice.\n\nAs one danger receded, however, another, more worrying one\narose, this time from die soudi, in the form of Cesare Borgia. Starting\nin 1500, Borgia had marched steadily northward, gobbling up all the\nsmall kingdoms in his path in the name of his father, Pope Alexander.\nIsabella understood Cesare perfecdy: He could be neidier trusted nor in\nany way offended. He had to be cajoled and kept at arm's lengdi.\nIsabella began by sending him giftsfalcons, prize dogs, perfumes, and\ndozens of masks, which she knew he always wore when he walked die\nstreets of Rome. She sent messengers widi flattering greetings\n(aldiough these messengers also acted as her spies). At one point\nCesare asked if he could house some troops in Mantua; Isabella\nmanaged to dissuade him politely, knowing full well diat once die\ntroops were quartered in die city, they would never leave.\n\nEven while Isabella was charming Cesare, she convinced\neveryone around her to take care never to utter a harsh word about\nhim, since he had spies everywhere and would use the slightest pretext\nfor invasion. When Isabella had a child, she asked Cesare to be the\ngodfather. She even dangled in front of him the possibility of a\nmarriage between her family and his. Somehow it all worked, for\nalthough elsewhere he seized everything in his path, he spared Mantua.\n\nIn 1503 Cesare's fadier, Alexander, died, and a few years later the\nnew pope, Julius II, went to war to drive die French troops from Italy.\n\n\nWhen the ruler of FerraraAlfonso, Isabella's brothersided widi the\nFrench, Julius decided to attack and humble him. Once again Isabella\nfound herself in the middle: die pope on one side, the French and her\nbrother on the ouier. She dared not ally herself with either, but to\noffend either would be equally disastrous. Again she played die double\ngame at which she had become so expert. On die one hand she got her\nhusband Gonzaga to fight for the pope, knowing he would not fight\nvery hard. On the other she let French troops pass through Mantua to\ncome to Ferrara's aid. While she publicly complained that the French\nhad \u201cinvaded\u201d her territory, she privately supplied diem with valuable\ninformation. To make die invasion plausible to Julius, she even had die\nFrench pretend to plunder Mantua. It worked once again: The pope left\nMantua alone.\n\nIn 1513, after a lengdiy siege, Julius defeated Ferrara, and die\nFrench troops withdrew. Worn out by the effort, the pope died a few\nmontiis later. Widi his death, the nightmarish cycle of batties and petty\nsquabbles began to repeat itself.\n\nleisurely feeding on the dead kites and crows, and then left the\nplace hale and hearty, observing, \u201cThe weak benefit by the quarrels of\nthe mighty.\u201d\n\nINDIAN FABLES\n\nMen of great abilities are slow to act, for it is easier to avoid\noccasions for committing yourself than to come well out of a\ncommitment. Such occasions test your judgment; it is safer to avoid\nthem than to emerge victorious from them. One obligation leads to a\ngreater one, and you come very near to the brink of disaster.\n\nBaltasar Gracian, 1601-1658\n\nTHE EAGLE AND THE SOW\n\nAn eagle built a nest on a tree, and hatched out some eaglets. And\na wild sow brought her litter under the tree. The eagle used to fly off\nafter her prey, and bring it back to her young. And the sow rooted\naround the tree and hunted in the woods, and when night came she\nwould bring her young something to eat. And the eagle and the sow\nlived in neighborly fashion. And a grimalkin laid her plans to destroy\nthe eaglets and the little sucking pigs. She went to the eagle, and said:\n\u201cEagle, you had better not fly very far away. Beware of the sow; she is\nplanning an evil design. She is going to undermine the roots of the\n\ntree. You see she is rooting all the time.\u201d Then the grimalkin went to\nthe sow and said: \u201cSow, you have not a good neighbor. Last evening I\nheard the eagle saying to her eaglets: \"My dear little eaglets, I am going\nto treat you to a nice little pig. Just as soon as the sow is gone, I will\nbring you a little young sucking pig.\u201d From that time the eagle ceased\nto fly out after prey, and the sow did not go any more into the forest.\nThe eaglets and the young pigs perished of starvation, and grimalkin\nfeasted on them.\n\nFABLES,\n\nLeo Tolstoy, 1828-1910\n\nA great deal changed in Italy during Isabella's reign: Popes came\nand went, Cesare Borgia rose and then fell, Venice lost its empire,\nMilan was invaded, Florence fell into decline, and Rome was sacked\nby die Hapsburg Emperor Charles V. Through all this, tiny Mantua not\nonly survived but thrived, its court die envy of Italy. Its weakh and\nsovereignty would remain intact for a century after Isabella's death, in\n1539.\n\nInterpretation\n\nIsabella d'Este understood Italy's political situation with amazing\nclarity: Once you took the side of any of the forces in the field, you\nwere doomed. The powerful would take you over, the weak would\nwear you down. Any new alliance would lead to a new enemy, and as\nthis cycle stirred up more conflict, odier forces would be dragged in,\nuntil you could no longer extricate yourself. Eventually you would\ncollapse from exhaustion.\n\nIsabella steered her kingdom on the only course that would bring\nher safely through. She would not allow herself to lose her head\nthrough loyalty to a duke or a king. Nor would she try to stop the\nconflict that raged around herthat would only drag her into it. And in\nany case the conflict was to her advantage. If the various parties were\nfighting to the death, and exhausting tiiemselves in the process, they\nwere in no position to gobble up Mantua. The source of Isabella's\npower was her clever ability to seem interested in the affairs and\ninterests of each side, while actually committing to no one but herself\nand her kingdom.\n\nOnce you step into a fight that is not of your own choosing, you\nlose all initiative. The combatants' interests become your interests; you\n\nbecome tiieir tool. Learn to control yourself, to restrain your natural\ntendency to take sides and join the fight. Be friendly and charming to\neach of the combatants, then step back as tiiey collide. With every\nbattle tiiey grow weaker, while you grow stronger widi every battle\nyou avoid.\n\nWhen the snipe and the mussel struggle, the fisherman gets the\nbenefit.\n\nAncient Chinese saying\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nTo succeed in the game of power, you have to master your\nemotions. But even if you succeed in gaining such self-control, you\ncan never control die temperamental dispositions of those around you.\nAnd tiiis presents a great danger. Most people operate in a whirlpool of\nemotions, constantiy reacting, churning up squabbles and conflicts.\nYour self-control and autonomy will only bother and infuriate them.\nThey will try to draw you into die whirlpool, begging you to take sides\nin tiieir endless battles, or to make peace for them. If you succumb to\ntheir emotional entreaties, little by little you will find your mind and\ntime occupied by their problems. Do not allow whatever compassion\nand pity you possess to suck you in. You can never win in tiiis game;\ndie conflicts can only multiply.\n\nOn the other hand, you cannot completely stand aside, for diat\nwould\n\ncause needless offense. To play the game properly, you must seem\ninterested in other people's problems, even sometimes appear to take\ntheir side. But while you make outward gestures of support, you must\nmaintain your inner energy and sanity by keeping your emotions\ndisengaged. No matter how hard people try to pull you in, never let\nyour interest in tiieir affairs and petty squabbles go beyond the surface.\nGive them gifts, listen wim a sympathetic look, even occasionally play\nthe charmerbut inwardly keep both the friendly kings and the\nperfidious Borgias at arm's length. By refusing to commit and thus\nmaintaining your autonomy you retain the initiative: Your moves stay\nmatters of your own choosing, not defensive reactions to the push-and-\npull of those around you.\n\nSlowness to pick up your weapons can be a weapon itself,\nespecially if you let other people exhaust themselves fighting, then\n\ntake advantage of their exhaustion. In ancient China, the kingdom of\nChin once invaded the kingdom of Hsing. Huan, the ruler of a nearby\nprovince, thought he should rush to Hsing's defense, but his adviser\ncounseled him to wait: \u201cHsing is not yet going to ruin,\u201d he said, \u201cand\nChin is not yet exhausted. If Chin is not exhausted, [we] cannot\nbecome very influential. Moreover, the merit of supporting a state in\ndanger is not as great as the virtue of reviving a ruined one.\u201d The\nadviser's argument won the day, and as he had predicted, Huan later\nhad the glory bodi of rescuing Hsing from the brink of destruction and\nthen of conquering an exhausted Chin. He stayed out of the fighting\nuntil the forces engaged in it had worn each other down, at which point\nit was safe for him to intervene.\n\nThat is what holding back from the fray allows you: time to\nposition yourself to take advantage of the situation once one side starts\nto lose. You can also take the game a step further, by promising your\nsupport to both sides in a conflict while maneuvering so that the one to\ncome out ahead in the struggle is you. This was what Castruccio\nCastracani, ruler of the Italian town of Lucca in the fourteenth century,\ndid when he had designs on the town of Pistoia. A siege would have\nbeen expensive, costing both lives and money, but Castruccio knew\nthat Pistoia contained two rival factions, the Blacks and the Whites,\nwhich hated one another. He negotiated with die Blacks, promising to\nhelp mem against the Whites; then, without their knowledge, he\npromised the Whites he would help them against the Blacks. And\nCastruccio kept his promiseshe sent an army to a Black-controlled gate\nto the city, which the sentries of course welcomed in. Meanwhile\nanother of his armies entered through a White-controlled gate. The two\narmies united in the middle, occupied the town, killed the leaders of\nboth factions, ended die internal war, and took Pistoia for Castruccio.\n\nPreserving your autonomy gives you options when people come\nto blowsyou can play the mediator, broker the peace, while really\nsecuring your own interests. You can pledge support to one side and\nthe other may have to court you with a higher bid. Or, like Castruccio,\nyou can appear to take bodi sides, then play the antagonists against\neach odier.\n\nOftentimes when a conflict breaks out, you are tempted to side\nwith the stronger party, or the one that offers you apparent advantages\n\n\nin an al-\n\nI'HE PRICE OF ENVY\n\nWhile a poor woman stood in the marketplace selling cheeses, a\ncat came along and carried off a cheese. A dog saw the pilferer and\ntried to take the cheese away from him. The cat stood up to the dog. So\nthey pitched into each other. The dog barked and snapped; the cat spat\nand scratched, but they could bring the battle to no decision. \u201cLet's go\nto the fox and have him referee the matter,\u201d the cat finally suggested.\n\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d said the dog. So they went to the fox. The fox listened\nto their arguments with a judicious air.\n\n\u201cFoolish animals,\u201d he chided them, \u201cwhy carry on like that If both\nof you are willing, I'll divide the cheese in two and you'll both be\nsatisfied.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d said the cat and the dog. So the fox took out his knife\nand cut the cheese in two, but, instead of cutting it lengthwise, he cut it\nin the width. \u201cMy half is smaller!\u201d protested the dog. The fox looked\njudiciously through his spectacles at the dog's share.\n\n\u201cYou're right, quite right!\u201d he decided. So he went and bit off a\npiece of the cat's share.\n\n\u201cThat will make it even!\u201d he said. When the cat saw what the fox\ndid she began to yowl:\n\n\"Just look! My part's\n\nsmaller now!\"\n\nThe fox again put on\n\nhis spectacles and\n\nlooked judiciously at\n\nthe cat's share.\n\n\u201cRight you are!\u201d said\n\nthe fox. \"Just a\n\nmoment, and I'll make\n\nit right.\"\n\nAnd he went and bit\n\noff a piece from the\n\ndog's cheese\n\nThis went on so long,\n\nwith the fox nibbling\n\nfirst at the dog's and\n\n\nthen at the cat's share,\n\nthat he finally ate up\n\nthe whole cheese before\n\ntheir eyes.\n\nA TREASURY OH JEWISH I'OLKLORt,\n\nNathan Ausubel, ed., 1948\n\nliance. This is risky business. First, it is often difficult to foresee\nwhich side will prevail in the long run. But even if you guess right and\nally yourself with the stronger party, you may find yourself swallowed\nup and lost, or conveniendy forgotten, when they become victors. Side\nwith the weaker, on the other hand, and you are doomed. But play a\nwaiting game and you cannot lose.\n\nIn France's July Revolution of 1830, after three days of riots, the\nstatesman Talleyrand, now elderly, sat by his Paris window, listening\nto the pealing bells that signaled the riots were over. Turning to an\nassistant, he said, \u201cAh, the bells! We're winning.\u201d \u201cWho's 'we,' mon\nprince\u201d the assistant asked. Gesturing for the man to keep quiet,\nTalleyrand replied, \u201cNot a word! I'll tell you who we are tomorrow.\u201d\nHe well knew that only fools rush into a situationthat by committing\ntoo quickly you lose your maneuverability. People also respect you\nless: Perhaps tomorrow, they think, you will commit to another,\ndifferent cause, since you gave yourself so easily to this one. Good\nfortune is a fickle god and will often pass from one side to the other.\nCommitment to one side deprives you of the advantage of time and the\nluxury of waiting. Let others fall in love with this group or that; for\nyour part don't rush in, don't lose your head.\n\nFinally, there are occasions when it is wisest to drop all pretence\nof appearing supportive and instead to trumpet your independence and\nself-reliance. The aristocratic pose of independence is particularly\nimportant for those who need to gain respect. George Washington\nrecognized this in his work to establish the young American republic\non firm ground. As president, Washington avoided the temptation of\nmaking an alliance with France or England, despite the pressure on\nhim to do so. He wanted the country to earn the world's respect\nthrough its independence. Although a treaty with France might have\nhelped in the short term, in the long run he knew it would be more\n\neffective to establish the nation's autonomy. Europe would have to see\nthe United States as an equal power.\n\nRemember: You have only so much energy and so much time.\nEvery moment wasted on the affairs of others subtracts from your\nstrength. You may be afraid that people will condemn you as heartless,\nbut in the end, maintaining your independence and self-reliance will\ngain you more respect and place you in a position of power from\nwhich you can choose to help others on your own initiative.\n\nImage: A Thicket of Shrubs.

If you play too many\nparties against one another, they will see through the maneuver and\nwill gang up on you. If you keep your growing number of suitors\nwaiting too long, you will inspire not desire but distrust. People will\nstart to lose interest. Eventually you may find it worthwhile to commit\nto one sideif only for appearances\u2019 sake, to prove you are capable of\nattachment.\n\nEven men, however, the key will be to maintain your inner\nindependenceto keep yourself from getting emotionally involved.\nPreserve the unspoken option of being able to leave at any moment\nand reclaim your freedom if the side you are allied with starts to\ncollapse.

The cable came from a reliable\nsourceWilliam Ralston, owner of the Bank of Californiabut\nHarpending nevertheless took it as a practical joke, probably inspired\nby the recent discovery of huge diamond mines in South Africa. True,\nwhen reports had first come in of gold being discovered in the western\nUnited States, everyone had been skeptical, and those had turned out to\nbe true. But a diamond mine in the West! Harpending showed the\ncable to his fellow financier Baron Rothschild (one of the richest men\nin the world), saying it must be a joke. The baron, however, replied,\n\u201cDon't be too sure about that. America is a very large country. It has\nfurnished the world with many surprises already. Perhaps it has others\nin store.\u201d Harpending prompdy took the first ship back to the States.\n\nWhen Harpending reached San Francisco, tiiere was an\nexcitement in the air recalling the Gold Rush days of the late 1840s.\nTwo crusty prospectors named Philip Armold and John Slack had been\nthe ones to find the diamond mine. They had not divulged its location,\nin Wyoming, but had led a highly respected mining expert to it several\nweeks back, taking a circular route so he could not guess his\nwhereabouts. Once there, the expert had watched as die miners dug up\n\ndiamonds. Back in San Francisco the expert had taken die gems to\nvarious jewelers, one of whom had estimated tfieir worth at $1.5\nmillion.\n\nHarpending and Ralston now asked Amold and Slack to\naccompany them back to New York, where the jeweler Charles Tiffany\nwould verify the original estimates. The prospectors responded\nuneasilythey smelled a trap: How could tiiey trust diese city slickers\nWhat if Tiffany and the financiers managed to steal die whole mine out\nfrom under them Ralston tried to allay their fears by giving them\n$100,000 and placing another $300,000 in escrow for them. If the deal\nwent through, they would be paid an additional $300,000. The miners\nagreed.\n\nThe litde group traveled to New York, where a meeting was held\nat die mansion of Samuel L. Barlow. The cream of the city's\naristocracy was in attendanceGeneral George Brinton McClellan,\ncommander of the Union forces in the Civil War; General Benjamin\nBuder; Horace Greeley, editor of the newspaper the New York\nTribune; Harpending; Ralston; and Tiffany. Only Slack and Arnold\nwere missingas tourists in the city, they had decided to go sight-seeing.\n\nWhen Tiffany announced diat the gems were real and worth a\nfortune, the financiers could barely control dieir excitement. They\nwired Roth-schild and other tycoons to tell them about the diamond\nmine and inviting them to share in the investment. At the same time,\nthey also told the prospectors that they wanted one more test: They\ninsisted tiiat a mining expert of their choosing accompany Slack and\nAmold to the site to verify its weahh. The prospectors reluctandy\nagreed. In the meantime, diey said,\n\nNow, there is nothing of which a man is prouder than of\nintellectual ability, for it is this that gives him his commanding place in\nthe animal world. It is an exceedingly rash thing to let anyone see that\nyou are decidedly superior to him in this respect, and to let other\npeople see it too.... Hence, while rank and riches may always reckon\nupon deferential treatment in society, that is something which\nintellectual ability can never expect: To be ignored is the greatest\nfavour shown to it; and if people notice it at all, it is because they\nregard it as a piece of impertinence, or else as something to which its\npossessor has no legitimate right, and upon which he dares to pride\n\nhimself; and in retaliation and revenge for his conduct, people secretly\ntry and humiliate him in some other way; and if they wait to do this, it\nis only for a fitting opportunity. A man may be as humble as possible\nin his demeanour, and yet hardly ever get people to overlook his crime\nin standing intellectually above them. In the Garden of Roses, Sadi\nmakes the remark: \u201cYou should know that foolish people are a\nhundredfold more averse to meeting the wise than the wise are\nindisposed for the company of the foolish.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, it is a real recommendation to be stupid. For\njust as warmth is agreeable to the body, so it does the mind good to\nfeel its superiority; and a man will seek company likely to give him\nthis feeling, as instinctively as he will approach the fireplace or walk in\nthe sun if he wants to get warm. But this means that he will be disliked\non account of his superiority; and if a man is to be liked, he must really\nbe inferior in point of intellect.\n\nArthur\n\nschopeniiauhr,\n\n1788-1860\n\nthey had to return to San Francisco. The jewels that Tiffany had\nexamined they left with Harpending for safekeeping.\n\nSeveral weeks later, a man named Louis Janin, the best mining\nexpert in the country, met the prospectors in San Francisco. Janin was\na born skeptic who was determined to make sure that the mine was not\na fraud. Accompanying Janin were Harpending, and several other\ninterested financiers. As with the previous expert, the prospectors led\nthe team through a complex series of canyons, completely confusing\nthem as to their whereabouts. Arriving at the site, the financiers\nwatched in amazement as Janin dug the area up, leveling anthills,\nturning over boulders, and finding emeralds, rubies, sapphires, and\nmost of all diamonds. The dig lasted eight days, and by the end, Janin\nwas convinced: He told the investors that they now possessed the\nrichest field in mining history. \u201cWith a hundred men and proper\nmachinery,\u201d he told them, \u201cI would guarantee to send out one million\ndollars in diamonds every thirty days.\u201d\n\nReturning to San Francisco a few days later, Ralston, Harpending,\nand company acted fast to form a $10 million corporation of private\ninvestors. First, however, they had to get rid of Arnold and Slack. That\n\nmeant hiding their excitementthey certainly did not want to reveal the\n\u2018ield's real value. So they played possum. Who knows if Janin is right,\nthey told the prospectors, the mine may not be as rich as we think. This\njust made the prospectors angry. Trying a different tactic, the\n\u2018inanciers told the two men that if they insisted on having shares in the\nmine, they would end up being fleeced by the unscrupulous tycoons\nand investors who would run the corporation; better, they said, to take\nthe $700,000 already offeredan enormous sum at the timeand put their\ngreed aside. This the prospectors seemed to understand, and they\n\u2018inally agreed to take the money, in return signing the rights to the site\nover to the financiers, and leaving maps to it.\n\nNews of the mine spread like wildfire. Prospectors fanned out\nacross Wyoming. Meanwhile Harpending and group began spending\nthe millions they had collected from their investors, buying equipment,\nhiring the best men in the business, and furnishing luxurious offices in\nNew York and San Francisco.\n\nA few weeks later, on their first trip back to the site, they learned\nthe hard trutii: Not a single diamond or ruby was to be found. It was all\na fake. They were ruined. Harpending had unwittingly lured the richest\nmen in the world into the biggest scam of the century.\n\nInterpretation\n\nAmold and Slack pulled off their stupendous con not by using a\nfake engineer or bribing Tiffany: All of the experts had been real. All\nof them honestly believed in the existence of the mine and in the value\nof the gems. What had fooled them all was nothing else than Arnold\nand Slack themselves. The two men seemed to be such rubes, such\nhayseeds, so naive, that no one for an instant had believed them\ncapable of an audacious scam. The prospectors had simply observed\nthe law of appearing more stupid than the markthe deceiver's First\nCommandment.\n\nThe logistics of the con were quite simple. Months before Arnold\nand Slack announced the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of the diamond mine, they\ntraveled to Europe, where they purchased some real gems for around\n$12,000 (part of the money they had saved from their days as gold\nminers). They then salted the \u201cmine\u201d with these gems, which the first\nexpert dug up and brought to San Francisco. The jewelers who had\nappraised these stones, including Tiffany himself, had gotten caught up\n\n\nin the fever and had grossly overestimated their value. Then Ralston\ngave the prospectors $100,000 as security, and immediately after their\ntrip to New York they simply went to Amsterdam, where they bought\nsacks of uncut gems, before returning to San Francisco. The second\ntime they salted the mine, there were many more jewels to be found.\n\nThe effectiveness of the scheme, however, rested not on tricks\nlike these but on the fact that Arnold and Slack played their parts to\nperfection. On their trip to New York, where they mingled with\nmillionaires and tycoons, they played up their clodhopper image,\nwearing pants and coats a size or two too small and acting incredulous\nat everything they saw in the big city. No one believed that these\ncountry simpletons could possibly be conning the most devious,\nunscrupulous financiers of the time. And once Harpending, Ralston,\nand even Rothschild accepted the mine's existence, anyone who\ndoubted it was questioning the intelligence of the world's most\nsuccessful businessmen.\n\nIn the end, Harpending's reputation was ruined and he never\nrecovered; Rothschild learned his lesson and never fell for another\ncon; Slack took his money and disappeared from view, never to be\nfound. Arnold simply went home to Kentucky. After all, his sale of his\nmining rights had been legitimate; the buyers had taken the best\nadvice, and if the mine had run out of diamonds, that was their\nproblem. Arnold used the money to greatly enlarge his farm and open\nup a bank of his own.\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nThe feeling that someone else is more intelligent than we are is\nalmost intolerable. We usually try to justify it in different ways: \u201cHe\nonly has book knowledge, whereas I have real knowledge.\u201d \u201cHer\nparents paid for her to get a good education. If my parents had had as\nmuch money, if I had been as privileged... .\u201d \u201cHe's not as smart as he\nthinks.\u201d Last but not least: \u201cShe may know her narrow little field better\nthan I do, but beyond that she's really not smart at all. Even Einstein\nwas a boob outside physics.\u201d\n\nGiven how important the idea of intelligence is to most people's\nvanity, it is critical never inadvertendy to insult or impugn a person's\nbrain power. That is an unforgivable sin. But if you can make this iron\ntule work for you, it opens up all sorts of avenues of deception.\n\nSubliminally reassure people that they are more intelligent than you\nare, or even that you are a bit of a moron, and you can run rings around\nthem. The feeling of intellectual superiority you give them will disarm\ntheir suspicion-muscles.\n\nIn 1865 the Prussian councillor Otto von Bismarck wanted\nAustria to\n\nsign a certain treaty. The treaty was totally in the interests of\nPrussia and against the interests of Austria, and Bismarck would have\nto strategize to get the Austrians to agree to it. But the Austrian\nnegotiator, Count Blome, was an avid cardplayer. His particular game\nwas quinze, and he often said mat he could judge a man's character by\nthe way he played quinze. Bismarck knew of tiiis saying of Blome's.\n\nThe night before the negotiations were to begin, Bismarck\ninnocendy engaged Blome in a game of quinze. The Prussian would\nlater write, \u201cThat was the very last time I ever played quinze. I played\nso recklessly that everyone was astonished. I lost several diousand\ntalers [the currency of the time], but I succeeded in fooling [Blome],\nfor he believed me to be more venturesome than I am and I gave way.\u201d\nBesides appearing reckless, Bismarck also played the widess fool,\nsaying ridiculous tilings and bumbling about with a surplus of nervous\nenergy.\n\nAll this made Blome feel he had gathered valuable information.\nHe knew mat Bismarck was aggressivethe Prussian already had that\nreputation, and the way he played had confirmed it. And aggressive\nmen, Blome knew, can be foolish And rash. Accordingly, when the\ntime came to sign the treaty, Blome thought he had the advantage. A\nheedless fool like Bismarck, he thought, is incapable of cold-blooded\ncalculation and deception, so he only glanced at the treaty before\nsigning ithe failed to read the fine print. As soon as the ink was dry, a\njoyous Bismarck exclaimed in his face, \u201cWell, I could never have\nbelieved that I should find an Austrian diplomat willing to sign that\ndocument!\u201d\n\nThe Chinese have a phrase, \u201cMasquerading as a swine to kill the\ntiger.\u201d This refers to an ancient hunting technique in which the hunter\nclothes himself in the hide and snout of a pig, and mimics its grunting.\nThe mighty tiger thinks a pig is coming his way, and lets it get close,\n\n\nsavoring the prospect of an easy meal. But it is the hunter who has the\nlast laugh.\n\nMasquerading as a swine works wonders on those who, like\ntigers, are arrogant and overconfident: The easier they think it is to\nprey on you, the more easily you can turn the tables. This trick is also\nuseful if you are ambitious yet find yourself low in the hierarchy:\nAppearing less intelligent than you are, even a bit of a fool, is the\nperfect disguise. Look like a harmless pig and no one will believe you\nharbor dangerous ambitions. They may even promote you since you\nseem so likable, and subservient. Claudius before he became emperor\nof Rome, and the prince of France who later became Louis XIII, used\nthis tactic when those above them suspected they might have designs\non the dirone. By playing die fool as young men, diey were left alone.\nWhen the time came for them to strike, and to act with vigor and\ndecisiveness, they caught everyone off-guard.\n\nIntelligence is the obvious quality to downplay, but why stop\nthere Taste and sophistication rank close to intelligence on die vanity\nscale; make people feel they are more sophisticated tiian you are and\ndieir guard will come down. As Amold and Slack knew, an air of\ncomplete naivete can work wonders. Those fancy financiers were\nlaughing at diem behind their\n\nbacks, but who laughed loudest in the end In general, men,\nalways make people believe they are smarter and more sophisticated\nthan you are. They will keep you around because you make them feel\nbetter about themselves, and the longer you are around, the more\nopportunities you will have to deceive them.\n\nImage:\n\nThe Opossum. In playing\n\ndead, the opossum plays stupid.\n\nMany a predator has therefore left it\n\nalone. Who could believe that such an\n\nugly, unintelligent, nervous little creature\n\ncould be capable of such deception\n\nAuthority: Know how to make use of stupidity: The wisest man\nplays this card at times. There are occasions when the highest wisdom\nconsists in appearing not to knowyou must not be ignorant but capable\nof playing it. It is not much good being wise among fools and sane\n\namong lunatics. He who poses as a fool is not a fool. The best way to\nbe well received by all is to clothe yourself in the skin of the dumbest\nof brutes. (Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nTo reveal the true nature of your intelligence rarely pays; you\nshould get in the habit of downplaying it at all times. If people\ninadvertently learn the truththat you are actually much smarter than\nyou lookthey will admire you more for being discreet than for making\nyour brilliance show. At the start of your climb to the top, of course,\nyou cannot play too stupid: You may want to let your bosses know, in a\nsubtle way, that you are smarter than the competition around you. As\nyou climb the ladder, however, you should to some degree try to\ndampen your brilliance.\n\nThere is, however, one situation where it pays to do the opposite\nwhen you can cover up a deception with a show of intelligence. In\nmatters of smarts as in most things, appearances are what count. If you\nseem to have authority and knowledge, people will believe what you\nsay. This can be very useful in getting you out of a scrape.\n\nThe art dealer Joseph Duveen was once attending a soiree at the\nNew York home of a tycoon to whom he had recently sold a Diirer\npainting for\n\na high price. Among die guests was a young French art critic who\nseemed extremely knowledgeable and confident. Wanting to impress\nthis man, the tycoon's daughter showed him the Diirer, which had not\nyet been hung. The critic studied it for a time, then finally said, \u201cYou\nknow, I don't think this Diirer is right.\u201d He followed the young woman\nas she hurried to tell her father what he had said, and listened as the\nmagnate, deeply unsetded, turned to Duveen for reassurance. Duveen\njust laughed. \u201cHow very amusing,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you realize, young\nman, that at least twenty other art experts here and in Europe have\nbeen taken in too, and have said that painting isn't genuine And now\nyou've made the same mistake.\u201d His confident tone and air of authority\nintimidated the Frenchman, who apologized for his mistake.\n\nDuveen knew that the art market was flooded with fakes, and that\nmany paintings had been falsely ascribed to old masters. He tried his\nbest to distinguish the real from the fake, but in his zeal to sell he often\noverplayed a work's authenticity. What mattered to him was that the\n\n\nbuyer believed he had bought a Diirer, and that Duveen himself\nconvinced everyone of his \u201cexpertness\u201d through his air of\nirreproachable authority. Thus, it is important to be able to play the\nprofessor when necessary and never impose such an attitude for its\nown sake.\n'.

The cable came from a reliable\nsourceWilliam Ralston, owner of the Bank of Californiabut\nHarpending nevertheless took it as a practical joke, probably inspired\nby the recent discovery of huge diamond mines in South Africa. True,\nwhen reports had first come in of gold being discovered in the western\nUnited States, everyone had been skeptical, and those had turned out to\nbe true. But a diamond mine in the West!

A\nheedless fool like Bismarck, he thought, is incapable of cold-blooded\ncalculation and deception, so he only glanced at the treaty before\nsigning ithe failed to read the fine print. As soon as the ink was dry, a\njoyous Bismarck exclaimed in his face, \u201cWell, I could never have\nbelieved that I should find an Austrian diplomat willing to sign that\ndocument!\u201d\n\nThe Chinese have a phrase, \u201cMasquerading as a swine to kill the\ntiger.\u201d This refers to an ancient hunting technique in which the hunter\nclothes himself in the hide and snout of a pig, and mimics its grunting.\nThe mighty tiger thinks a pig is coming his way, and lets it get close,\n\n\nsavoring the prospect of an easy meal. But it is the hunter who has the\nlast laugh.\n\nMasquerading as a swine works wonders on those who, like\ntigers, are arrogant and overconfident: The easier they think it is to\nprey on you, the more easily you can turn the tables. This trick is also\nuseful if you are ambitious yet find yourself low in the hierarchy:\nAppearing less intelligent than you are, even a bit of a fool, is the\nperfect disguise. Look like a harmless pig and no one will believe you\nharbor dangerous ambitions. They may even promote you since you\nseem so likable, and subservient. Claudius before he became emperor\nof Rome, and the prince of France who later became Louis XIII, used\nthis tactic when those above them suspected they might have designs\non the dirone. By playing die fool as young men, diey were left alone.\nWhen the time came for them to strike, and to act with vigor and\ndecisiveness, they caught everyone off-guard.\n\nIntelligence is the obvious quality to downplay, but why stop\nthere Taste and sophistication rank close to intelligence on die vanity\nscale; make people feel they are more sophisticated tiian you are and\ndieir guard will come down. As Amold and Slack knew, an air of\ncomplete naivete can work wonders. Those fancy financiers were\nlaughing at diem behind their\n\nbacks, but who laughed loudest in the end In general, men,\nalways make people believe they are smarter and more sophisticated\nthan you are. They will keep you around because you make them feel\nbetter about themselves, and the longer you are around, the more\nopportunities you will have to deceive them.\n\nImage:\n\nThe Opossum. In playing\n\ndead, the opossum plays stupid.\n\nMany a predator has therefore left it\n\nalone. Who could believe that such an\n\nugly, unintelligent, nervous little creature\n\ncould be capable of such deception\n\nAuthority: Know how to make use of stupidity: The wisest man\nplays this card at times. There are occasions when the highest wisdom\nconsists in appearing not to knowyou must not be ignorant but capable\nof playing it. It is not much good being wise among fools and sane\n\namong lunatics. He who poses as a fool is not a fool. The best way to\nbe well received by all is to clothe yourself in the skin of the dumbest\nof brutes. (Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nTo reveal the true nature of your intelligence rarely pays; you\nshould get in the habit of downplaying it at all times. If people\ninadvertently learn the truththat you are actually much smarter than\nyou lookthey will admire you more for being discreet than for making\nyour brilliance show. At the start of your climb to the top, of course,\nyou cannot play too stupid: You may want to let your bosses know, in a\nsubtle way, that you are smarter than the competition around you. As\nyou climb the ladder, however, you should to some degree try to\ndampen your brilliance.\n\nThere is, however, one situation where it pays to do the opposite\nwhen you can cover up a deception with a show of intelligence. In\nmatters of smarts as in most things, appearances are what count. If you\nseem to have authority and knowledge, people will believe what you\nsay. This can be very useful in getting you out of a scrape.\n\nThe art dealer Joseph Duveen was once attending a soiree at the\nNew York home of a tycoon to whom he had recently sold a Diirer\npainting for\n\na high price. Among die guests was a young French art critic who\nseemed extremely knowledgeable and confident. Wanting to impress\nthis man, the tycoon's daughter showed him the Diirer, which had not\nyet been hung. The critic studied it for a time, then finally said, \u201cYou\nknow, I don't think this Diirer is right.\u201d He followed the young woman\nas she hurried to tell her father what he had said, and listened as the\nmagnate, deeply unsetded, turned to Duveen for reassurance. Duveen\njust laughed. \u201cHow very amusing,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you realize, young\nman, that at least twenty other art experts here and in Europe have\nbeen taken in too, and have said that painting isn't genuine And now\nyou've made the same mistake.\u201d His confident tone and air of authority\nintimidated the Frenchman, who apologized for his mistake.\n\nDuveen knew that the art market was flooded with fakes, and that\nmany paintings had been falsely ascribed to old masters. He tried his\nbest to distinguish the real from the fake, but in his zeal to sell he often\noverplayed a work's authenticity. What mattered to him was that the\n\n\nbuyer believed he had bought a Diirer, and that Duveen himself\nconvinced everyone of his \u201cexpertness\u201d through his air of\nirreproachable authority. Thus, it is important to be able to play the\nprofessor when necessary and never impose such an attitude for its\nown sake.\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

See how my sweet offspring are set In close array; first clothed in\nsoft wrappers over which is the hard but softly lined husk. And not\ncontent with this much care, nature has also given us these, sharp and\nclose-set spines, so that the hand of man cannot hurt us.\u201d Then the fig\ntree began to laugh, and after the laughter it said: \u201cYou know well that\nman is of such ingenuity that he will bereave even you of your\nchildren. But in your case he will do it by means of rods and stones;\nand when they are felled he will trample them with his feet or hit them\nwith stones, so that your offspring will emerge from their armor\ncrushed and maimed; while I am touched carefully by his hands, and\nnever, like you, with roughness.\u201d\n\nLeonardo daVinci, 1452-1519\n\nTRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW\n\nThe island of Melos is strategically situated in the heart of the\nMediterranean. In classical times, die city of Adiens dominated die sea\nand coastal areas around Greece, but Sparta, in the Peloponnese, had\n\n\nbeen Melos's original colonizer. During the Peloponnesian War, dien,\nthe Melians refused to ally diemselves with Athens and remained loyal\nto Mother Sparta. In 416 B.C. the Athenians sent an expedition against\nMelos. Before launching an all-out attack, however, they dispatched a\ndelegation to persuade die Melians to surrender and become an ally\nrather than suffer devastation and defeat.\n\n\u201cYou know as well as we do,\u201d the delegates said, \u201cmat die\nstandard of justice depends on die equality of power to compel, and\ndiat in fact die strong do what diey have die power to do and the weak\naccept what diey have to accept.\u201d When the Melians responded that\nthis denied the notion of fair play, the Athenians said that those in\npower determined what was fair and what was not. The Melians\nargued diat diis audiority belonged to die gods, not to mortals. \u201cOur\nopinion of die gods and our knowledge of men,\u201d replied a member of\nthe Athenian delegation, \u201clead us to conclude diat it is a general and\nnecessary law of nature to rule whatever one can.\u201d\n\nThe Melians would not budge. Sparta, they insisted, would come\nto their defense. The Athenians countered that die Spartans were a\nconservative, practical people, and would not help Melos because they\nhad nothing to gain and a lot to lose by doing so.\n\nFinally the Melians began to talk of honor and die principle of\nresisting brute force. \u201cDo not be led astray by a false sense of honor,\u201d\nsaid die Atiie-nians. \u201cHonor often brings men to ruin when they are\nfaced widi an obvious danger that somehow affects their pride. There\nis nothing disgraceful in giving way to the greatest city in Hellas when\nshe is offering you such reasonable terms.\u201d The debate ended. The\nMelians discussed die issue among diemselves, and decided to trust in\ndie aid of the Spartans, the will of the gods, and the lightness of their\ncause. They politely declined the Athenians\u2019 offer.\n\nA few days later the Athenians invaded Melos. The Melians\nfought nobly, even without the Spartans, who did not come to their\nrescue. It took several attempts before the Adienians could surround\nand besiege their main city, but the Melians finally surrendered. The\nAthenians wasted no timethey put to death all die men of military age\ndiat they could capture, diey sold die women and children as slaves,\nand diey repopulated die island widi their own colonists. Only a\nhandful of Melians survived.\n\nInterpretation\n\nThe Athenians were one of the most eminently practical people in\nhistory, and diey made die most practical argument they could with the\nMelians: When you are weaker, tiiere is nothing to be gained by\nfighting a useless fight. No one comes to help the weakby doing so\nuiey would only put diemselves in jeopardy. The weak are alone and\nmust submit. Fighting\n\ngives you nothing to gain but martyrdom, and in the process a lot\nof people who do not believe in your cause will die.\n\nWeakness is no sin, and can even become a strength if you learn\nhow to play it right. Had the Melians surrendered in the first place,\nthey would have been able to sabotage the Athenians in subtle ways, or\nmight have gotten what they could have out of the alliance and then\nleft it when the Athenians themselves were weakened, as in fact\nhappened several years later. Fortunes change and the mighty are often\nbrought down. Surrender conceals great power: Lulling the enemy into\ncomplacency, it gives you time to recoup, time to undermine, time for\nrevenge. Never sacrifice that time in exchange for honor in a battle that\nyou cannot win.\n\nWeak people never give way when they ought to. Cardinal de\nRetz, 1613-1679\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nSometime in the 1920s the German writer Bertolt Brecht became\na convert to the cause of Communism. From then on his plays, essays,\nand poems reflected his revolutionary fervor, and he generally tried to\nmake his ideological statements as clear as possible. When Hitler came\nto power in Germany, Brecht and his Communist colleagues became\nmarked men. He had many friends in the United StatesAmericans who\nsympatiiized with his beliefs, as well as fellow German intellectuals\nwho had fled Hider. In 1941, accordingly, Brecht emigrated to the\nUnited States, and chose to settle in Los Angeles, where he hoped to\nmake a living in the film business.\n\nOver the next few years Brecht wrote screenplays with a\npointedly an-ticapitalist slant. He had little success in Hollywood, so in\n1947, the war having ended, he decided to return to Europe. That same\nyear, however, the U.S. Congress's House Un-American Activities\nCommittee began its investigation into supposed Communist\n\n\ninfiltration in Hollywood. It began to gather information on Brecht,\nwho had so openly espoused Marxism, and on September 19, 1947,\nonly a month before he had planned to leave the United States, he\nreceived a subpoena to appear before the committee. In addition to\nBrecht, a number of other writers, producers, and directors were\nsummoned to appear as well, and this group came to be known as the\nHollywood 19.\n\nBefore going to Washington, the Hollywood 19 met to decide on\na plan of action. Their approach would be confrontational. Instead of\nanswering questions about their membership, or lack of it, in the\nCommunist Party, they would read prepared statements that would\nchallenge the aumority of the committee and argue that its activities\nwere unconstitutional. Even if this strategy meant imprisonment, it\nwould gain publicity for their cause.\n\nBrecht disagreed. What good was it, he asked, to play the martyr\nand gain a litde public sympathy if in the process they lost the ability\nto stage their plays and sell their scripts for years to come He felt\ncertain they were\n\nVoltaire was living in exile in London at a time when anti-French\nsentiment was at its highest. One day walking through the streets, he\nfound himself surrounded by an angry crowd. \u201cHang him. Hang the\nFrenchman, \u201d they yelled. Voltaire calmly addressed the mob with the\nfollowing words: \u201cMen of England! You wish to kill me because 1 am\na Frenchman. Am I not punished enough in not being born an\nEnglishman\u201d The crowd cheered his thoughtful words, and escorted\nhim safely back to his lodgings.\n\nthe little, brown book of anecdotes, Clifton Fadiman, ed., 1985\n\nall more intelligent than the members of the committee. Why\nlower themselves to the level of tfieir opponents by arguing widi them\nWhy not outfox the committee by appearing to surrender to it while\nsubdy mocking it The Hollywood 19 listened to Brecht politely, but\ndecided to stick to their plan, leaving Brecht to go his own way.\n\nThe committee finally summoned Brecht on October 30. They\nexpected him to do what others among the Hollywood 19 who had\ntestified before him had done: Argue, refuse to answer questions,\nchallenge the committee's right to hold its hearing, even yell and hurl\ninsults. Much to dieir surprise, however, Brecht was the very picture of\n\ncongeniality. He wore a suit (something he rarely did), smoked a cigar\n(he had heard that the committee chairman was a passionate cigar\nsmoker), answered their questions politely, and generally deferred to\ntheir authority.\n\nUnlike the other witnesses, Brecht answered the question of\nwhether he belonged to the Communist Party: He was not a member,\nhe said, which happened to be the truth. One committee member asked\nhim, \u201cIs it true you have written a number of revolutionary plays\u201d\nBrecht had written many plays with overt Communist messages, but he\nresponded, \u201cI have written a number of poems and songs and plays in\nthe fight against Hider and, of course, diey can be considered,\ntherefore, as revolutionary because I, of course, was for the overthrow\nof that government.\u201d This statement went unchallenged.\n\nBrecht's English was more than adequate, but he used an\ninterpreter throughout his testimony, a tactic that allowed him to play\nsubde games with language. When committee members found\nCommunist leanings in lines from English editions of his poems, he\nwould repeat the lines in German for the interpreter, who would then\nretranslate them; and somehow they would cjome out innocuous. At\none point a committee member read one of Brecht's revolutionary\npoems out loud in English, and asked him if he had written it. \u201cNo,\u201d he\nresponded, \u201cI wrote a German poem, which is very different from\nthis.\u201d The audior's elusive answers baffled the committee members,\nbut his politeness and the way he yielded to their authority made it\nimpossible for them to get angry with him.\n\nAfter only an hour of questioning, the committee members had\nhad enough. \u201cThank you very much,\u201d said the chairman, \u201cYou are a\ngood example to the [other] witnesses.\u201d Not only did diey free him,\ndiey offered to help him if he had any trouble with immigration\nofficials who might detain him for their own reasons. The following\nday, Brecht left the United States, never to return.\n\nInterpretation\n\nThe Hollywood 19's confrontational approach won them a lot of\nsympathy, and years later they gained a kind of vindication in public\nopinion. But they were also blacklisted, and lost valuable years of\nprofitable working time. Brecht, on the other hand, expressed his\ndisgust at the committee more indirectiy. It was not that he changed his\n\nbeliefs or compromised his values; instead, during his short testimony,\nhe kept die upper hand by ap-\n\npearing to yield while all the time running circles around the\ncommittee with vague responses, outright lies that went unchallenged\nbecause they were wrapped in enigmas, and word games. In the end he\nkept die freedom to continue his revolutionary writing (as opposed to\nsuffering imprisonment or detainment in die United States), even while\nsubdy mocking die committee and its authority with his pseudo-\nobedience.\n\nKeep in mind die following: People trying to make a show of\ntheir authority are easily deceived by die surrender tactic. Your\noutward sign of submission makes diem feel important; satisfied that\nyou respect them, they become easier targets for a later counterattack,\nor for the kind of indirect ridicule used by Brecht. Measuring your\npower over time, never sacrifice long-term maneuverability for the\nshort-lived glories of martyrdom.\n\nWhen the great lord passes, the wise peasant bows deeply and\nsilently farts.\n\nEthiopian proverb\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nWhat gets us into trouble in the realm of power is often our own\noverreac-tion to the moves of our enemies and rivals. That\noverreaction creates problems we would have avoided had we been\nmore reasonable. It also has an endless rebound effect, for die enemy\nthen overreacts as well, much as die Athenians did to die Melians. It is\nalways our first instinct to react, to meet aggression with some other\nkind of aggression. But die next time someone pushes you and you\nfind yourself starting to react, try this: Do not resist or fight back, but\nyield, turn die odier cheek, bend. You will find tiiat this often\nneutralizes dieir behaviorthey expected, even wanted you to react with\nforce and so diey are caught off-guard and confounded by your lack of\nresistance. By yielding, you in fact control the situation, because your\nsurrender is part of a larger plan to lull them into believing they have\ndefeated you.\n\nThis is die essence of the surrender tactic: Inwardly you stay firm,\nbut outwardly you bend. Deprived of a reason to get angry, your\nopponents will often be bewildered instead. And diey are unlikely to\n\nreact with more violence, which would demand a reaction from you.\nInstead you are allowed the time and space to plot the countermoves\nthat will bring them down. In die battle of die intelligent against die\nbrutal and die aggressive, the surrender tactic is die supreme weapon.\nIt does require self-control: Those who genuinely surrender give up\ntheir freedom, and may be crushed by the humiliation of their defeat.\nYou have to remember that you only appear to surrender, like the\nanimal that plays dead to save its hide.\n\nWe have seen diat it can be better to surrender than to fight; faced\nwitii a more powerful opponent and a sure defeat, it is often also better\nto surrender than to run away. Running away may save you for the\ntime being, but the aggressor will eventually catch up with you. If you\nsurrender instead, you have an opportunity to coil around your enemy\nand strike with your fangs from close up.\n\nIn 473 B.C., in ancient China, King Goujian of Yue suffered a\nhorrible defeat from the ruler of Wu in the battle of Fujiao. Goujian\nwanted to flee, but he had an adviser who told him to surrender and to\nplace himself in the service of the ruler of Wu, from which position he\ncould study the man and plot his revenge. Deciding to follow this\nadvice, Goujian gave the ruler all of his riches, and went to work in his\nconqueror's stables as the lowest servant. For three years he humbled\nhimself before the ruler, who then, finally satisfied of his loyalty,\nallowed him to return home. Inwardly, however, Goujian had spent\nthose three years gathering information and plotting revenge. When a\nterrible drought struck Wu, and the kingdom was weakened by inner\nturmoil, he raised an army, invaded, and won with ease. That is the\npower behind surrender: It gives you the time and the flexibility to plot\na devastating counterblow. Had Goujian run away, he would have lost\nthis chance.\n\nWhen foreign trade began to threaten Japanese independence in\nthe mid-nineteenth century, die Japanese debated how to defeat the\noreigners. One minister, Hotta Masayoshi, wrote a memorandum in\n857 that influenced Japanese policy for years to come: \u201cI am\ntherefore convinced that our policy should be to conclude friendly\nalliances, to send ships to foreign countries everywhere and conduct\ntrade, to copy the foreigners where they are at their best and so repair\nour own shortcomings, to foster our national strength and complete our\n\n\narmaments, and so gradually subject the foreigners to our influence\nuntil in the end all the countries of the world know the blessings of\nperfect tranquillity and our hegemony is acknowledged throughout the\nglobe.\u201d This is a brilliant application of the Law: Use surrender to gain\naccess to your enemy. Learn his ways, insinuate yourself with him\nslowly, outwardly conform to his customs, but inwardly maintain your\nown culture. Eventually you will emerge victorious, for while he\nconsiders you weak and inferior, and takes no precautions against you,\nyou are using the time to catch up and surpass him. This soft,\npermeable form of invasion is often the best, for the enemy has\nnothing to react against, prepare for, or resist. And had Japan resisted\nWestern influence by force, it might well have suffered a devastating\ninvasion that would have permanendy altered its culture.\n\nSurrender can also offer a way of mocking your enemies, of\nturning their power against them, as it did for Brecht. Milan Kundera's\nnovel The Joke, based on the author's experiences in a penal camp in\nCzechoslovakia, tells the story of how the prison guards organized a\nrelay race, guards against prisoners. For the guards this was a chance\nto show off their physical superiority. The prisoners knew they were\nexpected to lose, so they went out of their way to obligemiming\nexaggerated exertion while barely moving, running a few yards and\ncollapsing, limping, jogging ever so slowly while the guards raced\nahead at full speed. Both by joining the race and by losing it, they had\nobliged the guards obediently; but their \u201coverobedience\u201d had mocked\nthe event to the point of ruining it. Overobe-diencesurrenderwas here a\nway to demonstrate superiority in a reverse manner. Resistance would\nhave engaged the prisoners in the cycle of\n\nviolence, lowering them to the guards' level. Overobeying the\nguards, however, made them ridiculous, yet they could not righdy\npunish the prisoners, who had only done what they asked.\n\nPower is always in fluxsince the game is by nature fluid, and an\narena of constant struggle, those with power almost always find\nthemselves eventually on the downward swing. If you find yourself\ntemporarily weakened, the surrender tactic is perfect for raising\nyourself up againit disguises your ambition; it teaches you patience\nand self-control, key skills in the game; and it puts you in the best\npossible position for taking advantage of your oppressor's sudden\n\n\nslide. If you run away or fight back, in die long run you cannot win. If\nyou surrender, you will almost always emerge victorious.\n\nImage: An Oak Tree. The oak that resists the wind loses its\nbranches one by one, and with nothing left to protect it, the trunk\nfinally snaps. The oak that bends lives longer, its trunk growing wider,\nits roots deeper and more tenacious.\n\nAuthority: Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye\nand a tooth for a tooth: But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but\nwhosoever shall smite thee on titiy right cheek, turn to him the other\nalso. And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat,\nlet them have thy cloak also. And whosoever shall compel thee to go a\nmile, go with him twain. (Jesus Christ, in Matthew 5:38-41)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nThe point of surrendering is to save your hide for a later date\nwhen you can reassert yourself. It is precisely to avoid martyrdom that\none surrenders, but there are times when the enemy will not relent, and\nmartyrdom seems the only way out. Furthermore, if you are willing to\ndie, others may gain power and inspiration from your example.\n\nYet martyrdom, surrender's reversal, is a messy, inexact tactic,\nand is as violent as die aggression it combats. For every famous martyr\nthere are thousands more who have inspired neither a religion nor a\nrebellion, so that if martyrdom does sometimes grant a certain power,\nit does so unpredictably. More important, you will not be around to\nenjoy that power, such as it is. And there is finally something selfish\nand arrogant about martyrs, as if they felt their followers were less\nimportant than their own glory.\n\nWhen power deserts you, it is best to ignore this Law's reversal.\nLeave martyrdom alone: The pendulum will swing back your way\neventually, and you should stay alive to see it.\n'.

It took several attempts before the Adienians could surround\nand besiege their main city, but the Melians finally surrendered. The\nAthenians wasted no timethey put to death all die men of military age\ndiat they could capture, diey sold die women and children as slaves,\nand diey repopulated die island widi their own colonists. Only a\nhandful of Melians survived.\n\nInterpretation\n\nThe Athenians were one of the most eminently practical people in\nhistory, and diey made die most practical argument they could with the\nMelians: When you are weaker, tiiere is nothing to be gained by\nfighting a useless fight. No one comes to help the weakby doing so\nuiey would only put diemselves in jeopardy. The weak are alone and\nmust submit. Fighting\n\ngives you nothing to gain but martyrdom, and in the process a lot\nof people who do not believe in your cause will die.\n\nWeakness is no sin, and can even become a strength if you learn\nhow to play it right. Had the Melians surrendered in the first place,\nthey would have been able to sabotage the Athenians in subtle ways, or\nmight have gotten what they could have out of the alliance and then\nleft it when the Athenians themselves were weakened, as in fact\nhappened several years later. Fortunes change and the mighty are often\nbrought down. Surrender conceals great power: Lulling the enemy into\ncomplacency, it gives you time to recoup, time to undermine, time for\nrevenge. Never sacrifice that time in exchange for honor in a battle that\nyou cannot win.\n\nWeak people never give way when they ought to. Cardinal de\nRetz, 1613-1679\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nSometime in the 1920s the German writer Bertolt Brecht became\na convert to the cause of Communism. From then on his plays, essays,\nand poems reflected his revolutionary fervor, and he generally tried to\nmake his ideological statements as clear as possible. When Hitler came\nto power in Germany, Brecht and his Communist colleagues became\nmarked men. He had many friends in the United StatesAmericans who\nsympatiiized with his beliefs, as well as fellow German intellectuals\nwho had fled Hider. In 1941, accordingly, Brecht emigrated to the\nUnited States, and chose to settle in Los Angeles, where he hoped to\nmake a living in the film business.\n\nOver the next few years Brecht wrote screenplays with a\npointedly an-ticapitalist slant. He had little success in Hollywood, so in\n1947, the war having ended, he decided to return to Europe. That same\nyear, however, the U.S. Congress's House Un-American Activities\nCommittee began its investigation into supposed Communist\n\n\ninfiltration in Hollywood. It began to gather information on Brecht,\nwho had so openly espoused Marxism, and on September 19, 1947,\nonly a month before he had planned to leave the United States, he\nreceived a subpoena to appear before the committee. In addition to\nBrecht, a number of other writers, producers, and directors were\nsummoned to appear as well, and this group came to be known as the\nHollywood 19.\n\nBefore going to Washington, the Hollywood 19 met to decide on\na plan of action. Their approach would be confrontational. Instead of\nanswering questions about their membership, or lack of it, in the\nCommunist Party, they would read prepared statements that would\nchallenge the aumority of the committee and argue that its activities\nwere unconstitutional. Even if this strategy meant imprisonment, it\nwould gain publicity for their cause.\n\nBrecht disagreed. What good was it, he asked, to play the martyr\nand gain a litde public sympathy if in the process they lost the ability\nto stage their plays and sell their scripts for years to come He felt\ncertain they were\n\nVoltaire was living in exile in London at a time when anti-French\nsentiment was at its highest. One day walking through the streets, he\nfound himself surrounded by an angry crowd. \u201cHang him. Hang the\nFrenchman, \u201d they yelled. Voltaire calmly addressed the mob with the\nfollowing words: \u201cMen of England! You wish to kill me because 1 am\na Frenchman. Am I not punished enough in not being born an\nEnglishman\u201d The crowd cheered his thoughtful words, and escorted\nhim safely back to his lodgings.\n\nthe little, brown book of anecdotes, Clifton Fadiman, ed., 1985\n\nall more intelligent than the members of the committee. Why\nlower themselves to the level of tfieir opponents by arguing widi them\nWhy not outfox the committee by appearing to surrender to it while\nsubdy mocking it The Hollywood 19 listened to Brecht politely, but\ndecided to stick to their plan, leaving Brecht to go his own way.\n\nThe committee finally summoned Brecht on October 30. They\nexpected him to do what others among the Hollywood 19 who had\ntestified before him had done: Argue, refuse to answer questions,\nchallenge the committee's right to hold its hearing, even yell and hurl\ninsults. Much to dieir surprise, however, Brecht was the very picture of\n\ncongeniality. He wore a suit (something he rarely did), smoked a cigar\n(he had heard that the committee chairman was a passionate cigar\nsmoker), answered their questions politely, and generally deferred to\ntheir authority.\n\nUnlike the other witnesses, Brecht answered the question of\nwhether he belonged to the Communist Party: He was not a member,\nhe said, which happened to be the truth. One committee member asked\nhim, \u201cIs it true you have written a number of revolutionary plays\u201d\nBrecht had written many plays with overt Communist messages, but he\nresponded, \u201cI have written a number of poems and songs and plays in\nthe fight against Hider and, of course, diey can be considered,\ntherefore, as revolutionary because I, of course, was for the overthrow\nof that government.\u201d This statement went unchallenged.\n\nBrecht's English was more than adequate, but he used an\ninterpreter throughout his testimony, a tactic that allowed him to play\nsubde games with language. When committee members found\nCommunist leanings in lines from English editions of his poems, he\nwould repeat the lines in German for the interpreter, who would then\nretranslate them; and somehow they would cjome out innocuous. At\none point a committee member read one of Brecht's revolutionary\npoems out loud in English, and asked him if he had written it. \u201cNo,\u201d he\nresponded, \u201cI wrote a German poem, which is very different from\nthis.\u201d The audior's elusive answers baffled the committee members,\nbut his politeness and the way he yielded to their authority made it\nimpossible for them to get angry with him.\n\nAfter only an hour of questioning, the committee members had\nhad enough. \u201cThank you very much,\u201d said the chairman, \u201cYou are a\ngood example to the [other] witnesses.\u201d Not only did diey free him,\ndiey offered to help him if he had any trouble with immigration\nofficials who might detain him for their own reasons. The following\nday, Brecht left the United States, never to return.\n\nInterpretation\n\nThe Hollywood 19's confrontational approach won them a lot of\nsympathy, and years later they gained a kind of vindication in public\nopinion. But they were also blacklisted, and lost valuable years of\nprofitable working time. Brecht, on the other hand, expressed his\ndisgust at the committee more indirectiy. It was not that he changed his\n\nbeliefs or compromised his values; instead, during his short testimony,\nhe kept die upper hand by ap-\n\npearing to yield while all the time running circles around the\ncommittee with vague responses, outright lies that went unchallenged\nbecause they were wrapped in enigmas, and word games. In the end he\nkept die freedom to continue his revolutionary writing (as opposed to\nsuffering imprisonment or detainment in die United States), even while\nsubdy mocking die committee and its authority with his pseudo-\nobedience.\n\nKeep in mind die following: People trying to make a show of\ntheir authority are easily deceived by die surrender tactic. Your\noutward sign of submission makes diem feel important; satisfied that\nyou respect them, they become easier targets for a later counterattack,\nor for the kind of indirect ridicule used by Brecht. Measuring your\npower over time, never sacrifice long-term maneuverability for the\nshort-lived glories of martyrdom.\n\nWhen the great lord passes, the wise peasant bows deeply and\nsilently farts.\n\nEthiopian proverb\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nWhat gets us into trouble in the realm of power is often our own\noverreac-tion to the moves of our enemies and rivals. That\noverreaction creates problems we would have avoided had we been\nmore reasonable. It also has an endless rebound effect, for die enemy\nthen overreacts as well, much as die Athenians did to die Melians. It is\nalways our first instinct to react, to meet aggression with some other\nkind of aggression. But die next time someone pushes you and you\nfind yourself starting to react, try this: Do not resist or fight back, but\nyield, turn die odier cheek, bend. You will find tiiat this often\nneutralizes dieir behaviorthey expected, even wanted you to react with\nforce and so diey are caught off-guard and confounded by your lack of\nresistance. By yielding, you in fact control the situation, because your\nsurrender is part of a larger plan to lull them into believing they have\ndefeated you.\n\nThis is die essence of the surrender tactic: Inwardly you stay firm,\nbut outwardly you bend. Deprived of a reason to get angry, your\nopponents will often be bewildered instead. And diey are unlikely to\n\nreact with more violence, which would demand a reaction from you.\nInstead you are allowed the time and space to plot the countermoves\nthat will bring them down. In die battle of die intelligent against die\nbrutal and die aggressive, the surrender tactic is die supreme weapon.\nIt does require self-control: Those who genuinely surrender give up\ntheir freedom, and may be crushed by the humiliation of their defeat.\nYou have to remember that you only appear to surrender, like the\nanimal that plays dead to save its hide.\n\nWe have seen diat it can be better to surrender than to fight; faced\nwitii a more powerful opponent and a sure defeat, it is often also better\nto surrender than to run away. Running away may save you for the\ntime being, but the aggressor will eventually catch up with you. If you\nsurrender instead, you have an opportunity to coil around your enemy\nand strike with your fangs from close up.\n\nIn 473 B.C., in ancient China, King Goujian of Yue suffered a\nhorrible defeat from the ruler of Wu in the battle of Fujiao. Goujian\nwanted to flee, but he had an adviser who told him to surrender and to\nplace himself in the service of the ruler of Wu, from which position he\ncould study the man and plot his revenge. Deciding to follow this\nadvice, Goujian gave the ruler all of his riches, and went to work in his\nconqueror's stables as the lowest servant. For three years he humbled\nhimself before the ruler, who then, finally satisfied of his loyalty,\nallowed him to return home. Inwardly, however, Goujian had spent\nthose three years gathering information and plotting revenge. When a\nterrible drought struck Wu, and the kingdom was weakened by inner\nturmoil, he raised an army, invaded, and won with ease. That is the\npower behind surrender: It gives you the time and the flexibility to plot\na devastating counterblow. Had Goujian run away, he would have lost\nthis chance.\n\nWhen foreign trade began to threaten Japanese independence in\nthe mid-nineteenth century, die Japanese debated how to defeat the\noreigners. One minister, Hotta Masayoshi, wrote a memorandum in\n857 that influenced Japanese policy for years to come: \u201cI am\ntherefore convinced that our policy should be to conclude friendly\nalliances, to send ships to foreign countries everywhere and conduct\ntrade, to copy the foreigners where they are at their best and so repair\nour own shortcomings, to foster our national strength and complete our\n\n\narmaments, and so gradually subject the foreigners to our influence\nuntil in the end all the countries of the world know the blessings of\nperfect tranquillity and our hegemony is acknowledged throughout the\nglobe.\u201d This is a brilliant application of the Law: Use surrender to gain\naccess to your enemy. Learn his ways, insinuate yourself with him\nslowly, outwardly conform to his customs, but inwardly maintain your\nown culture. Eventually you will emerge victorious, for while he\nconsiders you weak and inferior, and takes no precautions against you,\nyou are using the time to catch up and surpass him. This soft,\npermeable form of invasion is often the best, for the enemy has\nnothing to react against, prepare for, or resist. And had Japan resisted\nWestern influence by force, it might well have suffered a devastating\ninvasion that would have permanendy altered its culture.\n\nSurrender can also offer a way of mocking your enemies, of\nturning their power against them, as it did for Brecht. Milan Kundera's\nnovel The Joke, based on the author's experiences in a penal camp in\nCzechoslovakia, tells the story of how the prison guards organized a\nrelay race, guards against prisoners. For the guards this was a chance\nto show off their physical superiority. The prisoners knew they were\nexpected to lose, so they went out of their way to obligemiming\nexaggerated exertion while barely moving, running a few yards and\ncollapsing, limping, jogging ever so slowly while the guards raced\nahead at full speed. Both by joining the race and by losing it, they had\nobliged the guards obediently; but their \u201coverobedience\u201d had mocked\nthe event to the point of ruining it. Overobe-diencesurrenderwas here a\nway to demonstrate superiority in a reverse manner. Resistance would\nhave engaged the prisoners in the cycle of\n\nviolence, lowering them to the guards' level. Overobeying the\nguards, however, made them ridiculous, yet they could not righdy\npunish the prisoners, who had only done what they asked.\n\nPower is always in fluxsince the game is by nature fluid, and an\narena of constant struggle, those with power almost always find\nthemselves eventually on the downward swing. If you find yourself\ntemporarily weakened, the surrender tactic is perfect for raising\nyourself up againit disguises your ambition; it teaches you patience\nand self-control, key skills in the game; and it puts you in the best\npossible position for taking advantage of your oppressor's sudden\n\n\nslide. If you run away or fight back, in die long run you cannot win. If\nyou surrender, you will almost always emerge victorious.\n\nImage: An Oak Tree. The oak that resists the wind loses its\nbranches one by one, and with nothing left to protect it, the trunk\nfinally snaps. The oak that bends lives longer, its trunk growing wider,\nits roots deeper and more tenacious.\n\nAuthority: Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye\nand a tooth for a tooth: But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but\nwhosoever shall smite thee on titiy right cheek, turn to him the other\nalso. And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat,\nlet them have thy cloak also. And whosoever shall compel thee to go a\nmile, go with him twain. (Jesus Christ, in Matthew 5:38-41)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nThe point of surrendering is to save your hide for a later date\nwhen you can reassert yourself. It is precisely to avoid martyrdom that\none surrenders, but there are times when the enemy will not relent, and\nmartyrdom seems the only way out. Furthermore, if you are willing to\ndie, others may gain power and inspiration from your example.\n\nYet martyrdom, surrender's reversal, is a messy, inexact tactic,\nand is as violent as die aggression it combats. For every famous martyr\nthere are thousands more who have inspired neither a religion nor a\nrebellion, so that if martyrdom does sometimes grant a certain power,\nit does so unpredictably. More important, you will not be around to\nenjoy that power, such as it is. And there is finally something selfish\nand arrogant about martyrs, as if they felt their followers were less\nimportant than their own glory.\n\nWhen power deserts you, it is best to ignore this Law's reversal.\nLeave martyrdom alone: The pendulum will swing back your way\neventually, and you should stay alive to see it.\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Wu was a growing power, but it lacked the great history and\ncivilization of the Middle Kingdom, for centuries die center of Chinese\n\nculture. By defeating the Middle Kingdom, the king of Wu would\ninstantly raise his status.\n\nThe war began with great fanfare and several victories, but it soon\nbogged down. A victory on one front would leave the Wu armies\nvulnerable on another. The king's chief minister and adviser, Wu Tzu-\nhsiu, warned him that the barbarous state of Yueh, to the south, was\nbeginning to notice the kingdom of Wu's problems and had designs to\ninvade. The king only laughed at such worriesone more big victory\nand the great Middle Kingdom would be his.\n\nIn the year 490, Wu Tzu-hsiu sent his son away to safety in the\nkingdom of Ch'i. In doing so he sent the king a signal that he\ndisapproved of the war, and that he believed the king's selfish ambition\nwas leading Wu to ruin. The king, sensing betrayal, lashed out at his\nminister, accusing him of a lack of loyalty and, in a fit of anger,\nordered him to kill himself. Wu Tzu-hsiu obeyed his king, but before\nhe plunged the knife into his chest, he cried, \u201cTear out my eyes, oh\nKing, and fix them on the gate of Wu, so that I may see the triumphant\nentry of Yueh.\u201d\n\nAs Wu Tzu-hsiu had predicted, within a few years a Yueh army\npassed beneath the gate of Wu. As the barbarians surrounded the\npalace, the king remembered his minister's last wordsand felt the dead\nman's disembodied eyes watching his disgrace. Unable to bear his\nshame, the king killed himself, \u201ccovering his face so that he would not\nhave to meet the reproachful gaze of his minister in the next world.\u201d\n\nInterpretation\n\nThe story of Wu is a paradigm of all the empires that have come\nto ruin by overreaching. Drunk with success and sick with ambition,\nsuch empires expand to grotesque proportions and meet a ruin that is\ntotal. This is what happened to ancient Athens, which lusted for the\nfaraway island of Sicily and ended up losing its empire. The Romans\nstretched the boundaries of their empire to encompass vast territories;\nin doing so they increased their vulnerability, and the chances of\ninvasion from yet another barbarian tribe. Their useless expansion led\ntheir empire into oblivion.\n\nFor the Chinese, the fate of the kingdom of Wu serves as an\nelemental lesson on what happens when you dissipate your forces on\nseveral fronts, losing sight of distant dangers for the sake of present\n\n\ngain. \u201cIf you are not in danger,\u201d says Sun-tzu, \u201cdo not fight.\u201d It is\nalmost a physical law: What is bloated beyond its proportions\ninevitably collapses. The mind must not wander from goal to goal, or\nbe distracted by success from its sense of purpose and proportion.\nWhat is concentrated, coherent, and connected to its past has power.\nWhat is dissipated, divided, and distended rots and falls to the ground.\nThe bigger it bloats, the harder it falls.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nThe Rothschild banking family had humble beginnings in the\nJewish ghetto of Frankfurt, Germany. The city's harsh laws made it\nimpossible for Jews to mingle outside the ghetto, but the Jews had\nturned this into a virtueit made them self-reliant, and zealous to\npreserve their culture at all costs. Mayer Amschel, the first of the\nRothschilds to accumulate wealth by lending money, in the late\neighteenth century, well understood the power that comes from this\nkind of concentration and cohesion.\n\nFirst, Mayer Amschel allied himself witii one family, the\npowerful princes of Thurn und Taxis. Instead of spreading his services\nout, he made himself these princes' primary banker. Second, he\nentrusted none of his business to outsiders, using only his children and\nclose relatives. The more unified and tight-knit the family, the more\npowerful it would become. Soon Mayer Amschel's five sons were\nrunning the business. And when Mayer Amschel lay dying, in 1812, he\nrefused to name a principal heir, instead setting up all of his sons to\ncontinue the family tradition, so that they would stay united and would\nresist the dangers of diffusion and of infiltration by outsiders.\n\nOnce Mayer Amschel's sons controlled the family business, they\ndecided mat the key to wealth on a larger scale was to secure a\nfoothold in die finances of Europe as a whole, rather tiian being tied to\nany one country or prince. Of the five brothers, Nathan had already\nopened up shop in London. In 1813 James moved to Paris. Amschel\nremained in Frankfurt, Salomon established himself in Vienna, and\nKarl, the youngest son, went to Naples. With each sphere of influence\ncovered, they could tighten their hold on Europe's financial markets.\n\nThis widespread network, of course, opened the Rodischilds to\nthe very danger of which their fadier had warned mem: diffusion,\ndivision, dissension. They avoided mis danger, and established\n\nthemselves as the most powerful force in European finance and\npolitics, by once again resorting to the strategy of the ghettoexcluding\noutsiders, concentrating their forces. The Rothschilds established the\nfastest courier system in Europe, allowing them to get news of events\nbefore all their competitors. They held a virtual monopoly on\ninformation. And their internal communications and correspondence\nwere written in Frankfurt Yiddish, and in a code that only the brothers\ncould decipher. There was no point in stealing mis information no one\ncould understand it. \u201cEven the shewdest bankers cannot find their way\nthrough the Rothschild maze,\u201d admitted a financier who had tried to\ninfiltrate the clan.\n\nIn 1824 James Rothschild decided it was time to get married. This\npresented a problem for the Rothschilds, since it meant incorporating\nan outsider into the Rothschild clan, an outsider who could betray its\nsecrets. James therefore decided to marry within the family, and chose\nthe daughter of his brother Salomon. The brothers were ecstaticthis\nwas the perfect solution to their marriage problems. James's choice\nnow became the family policy: Two years later, Nathan married off his\ndaughter to\n\nhissing at everyone who passes by, you bring upon yourself the\nderision of all beholders. 1 confess that I am only formed to move\nupon the ground; but how graceful is my make! How well turned my\nlimbs! How highly finished my whole body! How great my strength!\nHow astonishing my speed! I had much rather be confined to one\nelement, and be admired in that, than be a goose in all!\"\n\nFABLES FROM BOCCACCIO AND CHAUCER,\n\nDr. John Aikin, 1747-1822\n\nBeware of dissipating your powers; strive constantly to\nconcentrate them. Genius thinks it can do whatever it sees others\ndoing, but it is sure to repent of every ill-judged outlay.\n\nJohann von Goethe, 1749-1832\n\nSalomon's son. In die years to come, the five brotiiers arranged\neighteen matches among their children, sixteen of these being\ncontracted between first cousins.\n\n\u201cWe are like the mechanism of a watch: Each part is essential,\u201d\nsaid brother Salomon. As in a watch, every part of the business moved\nin concert with every other, and the inner workings were invisible to\n\nthe world, which only saw die movement of the hands. While odier\nrich and powerful families suffered irrecoverable downturns during the\ntumultous first half of the nineteenth century, the tight-knit Rothschilds\nmanaged not only to preserve but to expand dieir unprecedented\nwealth.\n\nInterpretation\n\nThe Rothschilds were born in strange times. They came from a\nplace diat had not changed in centuries, but lived in an age that gave\nbirth to the Industrial Revolution, die French Revolution, and an\nendless series of upheavals. The Rotiichilds kept die past alive,\nresisted Uie patterns of dispersion of their era and for this are\nemblematic of the law of concentration.\n\nNo one represents this better than James Rodischild, die son who\nestablished himself in Paris. In his lifetime James witnessed die defeat\nof Napoleon, die restoration of die Bourbon monarchy, the bourgeois\nmonarchy of Orleans, the return to a republic, and finally the\nenthronement of Napoleo i III. French styles and fashions changed at a\nrelentiess pace during all this turmoil. Without appearing to be a relic\nof the past, James steered his family as if die ghetto lived on widiin\ndiem. He kept alive his clan's inner cohesion and strength. Only\nthrough such an anchoring in die past was die family able to tiirive\namidst such chaos. Concentration was die foundation of the\nRothschilds' power, wealth, and stability.\n\nThe best strategy is always to be very strong; first in general, then\n\nat the decisive point. . . . There is no higher and simpler law of\nstrategy\n\nthan that of keeping one's forces concentrated. . . . In short the\n\nfirst principle is: act with the utmost concentration.\n\nOn War, Carl von Clausewitz, 1 7801831\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nThe world is plagued by greater and greater divisionwitiiin\ncountries, political groups, families, even individuals. We are all in a\nstate of total distraction and diffusion, hardly able to keep our minds in\none direction before we are pulled in a thousand others. The modern\nworld's level of conflict is higher tiian ever, and we have internalized it\nin our own lives.\n\nThe solution is a form of retreat inside ourselves, to the past, to\nmore concentrated forms of thought and action. As Schopenhauer\nwrote, \u201cIntellect is a magnitude of intensity, not a magnitude of\nextensity.\u201d Napoleon knew die value of concentrating your forces at\ndie enemy's weakest spot\n\nit was the secret of his success on the battlefield. But his\nwillpower and his mind were equally modeled on this notion. Single-\nmindedness of purpose, total concentration on the goal, and the use of\nthese qualities against people less focused, people in a state of\ndistractionsuch an arrow will find its mark every time and overwhelm\nthe enemy.\n\nCasanova attributed his success in life to his ability to concentrate\non a single goal and push at it until it yielded. It was his ability to give\nhimself over completely to the women he desired that made him so\nintensely seductive. For the weeks or months that one of these women\nlived in his orbit, he thought of no one else. When he was imprisoned\nin the treacherous \u201cleads\u201d of the doge's palace in Venice, a prison from\nwhich no one had ever escaped, he concentrated his mind on the single\ngoal of escape, day after day. A change of cells, which meant that\nmonths of digging had all been for naught, did not discourage him; he\npersisted and eventually escaped. \u201cI have always believed,\u201d he later\nwrote, \u201cthat when a man gets it into his head to do something, and\nwhen he exclusively occupies himself in that design, he must succeed,\nwhatever the difficulties. That man will become Grand Vizier or\nPope.\u201d\n\nConcentrate c 1 a single goal, a single task, and beat it into\nsubmission. In the world of power you will constantly need help from\nother people, usually those more powerful than you. The fool flits from\none person to another, believing that he will survive by spreading\nhimself out. It is a corollary of the law of concentration, however, that\nmuch energy is saved, and more power is attained, by affixing yourself\nto a single, appropriate source of power. The scientist Nikola Tesla\nruined himself by believing that he somehow maintained his\nindependence by not having to serve a single master. He even turned\ndown J. P. Morgan, who offered him a rich contract. In the end, Tesla's\n\u201cindependence\u201d meant that he could depend on no single patron, but\n\nwas always having to toady up to a dozen of them. Later in his life he\nrealized his mistake.\n\nAll the great Renaissance painters and writers wresded with this\nproblem, none more so tilan the sixteenth-century writer Pietro\nAretino. Throughout his life Aretino suffered die indignities of having\nto please diis prince and that. At last, he had had enough, and decided\nto woo Charles V, promising the emperor the services of his powerful\npen. He finally discovered the freedom that came from attachment to a\nsingle source of power. Michelangelo found this freedom with Pope\nJulius II, Galileo with the Medicis. In the end, die single patron\nappreciates your loyalty and becomes dependent on your services; in\nthe long run the master serves die slave.\n\nFinally, power itself always exists in concentrated forms. In any\norganization it is inevitable for a small group to hold the strings. And\noften it is not diose widi the tides. In die game of power, only the fool\nflails about without fixing his target. You must find out who controls\ndie operations, who is the real director behind the scenes. As Richelieu\ndiscovered at die beginning of his rise to die top of die French political\nscene during die\n\nearly seventeenth century, it was not King Louis XIII who\ndecided things, it was the king's mother. And so he attached himself to\nher, and catapulted through the ranks of the courtiers, all the way to the\ntop.\n\nIt is enough to strike oil onceyour wealth and power are assured\nfor a lifetime.\n\nImage: The Arrow. You cannot hit two targets\n\nwith one arrow. If your thoughts stray, you\n\nmiss the enemy's heart. Mind and\n\narrow must become one. Only\n\nwith such concentration of\n\nmental and physical\n\npower can your arrow\n\nhit the target and\n\npierce the\n\nheart.\n\nAuthority: Prize intensity more than extensity. Perfection resides\nin quality, not quantity. Extent alone never rises above mediocrity, and\n\nit is die misfortune of men with wide general interests that while they\nwould like to have their finger in every pie, they have one in none.\nIntensity gives eminence, and rises to the heroic in matters sublime.\n(Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nThere are dangers in concentration, and moments when dispersion\nis the proper tactical move. Fighting the Nationalists for control of\nChina, Mao Tse-tung and the Communists fought a protracted war on\nseveral fronts, using sabotage and ambush as their main weapons.\nDispersal is often suitable for the weaker side; it is, in fact, a crucial\nprinciple of guerrilla warfare. When fighting a stronger army,\nconcentrating your forces only makes you an easier targetbetter to\ndissolve into the scenery and frustrate your enemy with the elusiveness\nof your presence.\n\nTying yourself to a single source of power has one preeminent\ndanger: If that person dies, leaves, or falls from grace, you suffer. This\nis what happened to Cesare Borgia, who derived his power from his\nfather, Pope Alexander VI. It was the pope who gave Cesare armies to\nfight with and wars to wage in his name. When he suddenly died\n(perhaps from poison),\n\nCesare was as good as dead. He had made far too many enemies\nover the years, and was now wimout his father's protection. In cases\nwhen you may need protection, then, it is often wise to entwine\nyourself around several sources of power. Such a move would be\nespecially prudent in periods of great tumult and violent change, or\nwhen your enemies are numerous. The more patrons and masters you\nserve the less risk you run if one of them falls from power. Such\ndispersion will even allow you to play one off against die other. Even\nif you concentrate on die single source of power, you still must\npractice caution, and j repare for the day when your master or patron is\nno longer there to help you.\n\nFinally, being too single-minded in purpose can make you an\nintolerable bore, especially in die arts. The Renaissance painter Paolo\nUccello was so obsessed widi perspective diat his paintings look\nlifeless and contrived.

You\n\nfly, indeed; but your\n\nflight is so heavy and\n\nclumsy, that you have\n\nno right to put yourself\n\non a level with the lark\n\nor the swallow. You can\n\nswim on the surface of\n\nthe waters, but you\n\ncannot live in them as\n\nfishes do; you cannot\n\nfind your food in that\n\nelement, nor glide\n\nsmoothly along the\n\nbottom of the waves.\n\nAnd when you walk, or\n\nrather waddle, upon\n\nthe ground, with your\n\nbroad feet and your\n\nlong neck stretched out,\n\nTRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW,\n\nIn China in the early sixth century B.C., the kingdom of Wu\nbegan a war with the neighboring northern provinces of the Middle\nKingdom. Wu was a growing power, but it lacked the great history and\ncivilization of the Middle Kingdom, for centuries die center of Chinese\n\nculture. By defeating the Middle Kingdom, the king of Wu would\ninstantly raise his status.\n\nThe war began with great fanfare and several victories, but it soon\nbogged down. A victory on one front would leave the Wu armies\nvulnerable on another. The king's chief minister and adviser, Wu Tzu-\nhsiu, warned him that the barbarous state of Yueh, to the south, was\nbeginning to notice the kingdom of Wu's problems and had designs to\ninvade. The king only laughed at such worriesone more big victory\nand the great Middle Kingdom would be his.\n\nIn the year 490, Wu Tzu-hsiu sent his son away to safety in the\nkingdom of Ch'i. In doing so he sent the king a signal that he\ndisapproved of the war, and that he believed the king's selfish ambition\nwas leading Wu to ruin. The king, sensing betrayal, lashed out at his\nminister, accusing him of a lack of loyalty and, in a fit of anger,\nordered him to kill himself. Wu Tzu-hsiu obeyed his king, but before\nhe plunged the knife into his chest, he cried, \u201cTear out my eyes, oh\nKing, and fix them on the gate of Wu, so that I may see the triumphant\nentry of Yueh.\u201d\n\nAs Wu Tzu-hsiu had predicted, within a few years a Yueh army\npassed beneath the gate of Wu. As the barbarians surrounded the\npalace, the king remembered his minister's last wordsand felt the dead\nman's disembodied eyes watching his disgrace. Unable to bear his\nshame, the king killed himself, \u201ccovering his face so that he would not\nhave to meet the reproachful gaze of his minister in the next world.\u201d\n\nInterpretation\n\nThe story of Wu is a paradigm of all the empires that have come\nto ruin by overreaching. Drunk with success and sick with ambition,\nsuch empires expand to grotesque proportions and meet a ruin that is\ntotal. This is what happened to ancient Athens, which lusted for the\nfaraway island of Sicily and ended up losing its empire. The Romans\nstretched the boundaries of their empire to encompass vast territories;\nin doing so they increased their vulnerability, and the chances of\ninvasion from yet another barbarian tribe. Their useless expansion led\ntheir empire into oblivion.\n\nFor the Chinese, the fate of the kingdom of Wu serves as an\nelemental lesson on what happens when you dissipate your forces on\nseveral fronts, losing sight of distant dangers for the sake of present\n\n\ngain. \u201cIf you are not in danger,\u201d says Sun-tzu, \u201cdo not fight.\u201d It is\nalmost a physical law: What is bloated beyond its proportions\ninevitably collapses. The mind must not wander from goal to goal, or\nbe distracted by success from its sense of purpose and proportion.\nWhat is concentrated, coherent, and connected to its past has power.\nWhat is dissipated, divided, and distended rots and falls to the ground.\nThe bigger it bloats, the harder it falls.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nThe Rothschild banking family had humble beginnings in the\nJewish ghetto of Frankfurt, Germany. The city's harsh laws made it\nimpossible for Jews to mingle outside the ghetto, but the Jews had\nturned this into a virtueit made them self-reliant, and zealous to\npreserve their culture at all costs. Mayer Amschel, the first of the\nRothschilds to accumulate wealth by lending money, in the late\neighteenth century, well understood the power that comes from this\nkind of concentration and cohesion.\n\nFirst, Mayer Amschel allied himself witii one family, the\npowerful princes of Thurn und Taxis. Instead of spreading his services\nout, he made himself these princes' primary banker. Second, he\nentrusted none of his business to outsiders, using only his children and\nclose relatives. The more unified and tight-knit the family, the more\npowerful it would become. Soon Mayer Amschel's five sons were\nrunning the business. And when Mayer Amschel lay dying, in 1812, he\nrefused to name a principal heir, instead setting up all of his sons to\ncontinue the family tradition, so that they would stay united and would\nresist the dangers of diffusion and of infiltration by outsiders.\n\nOnce Mayer Amschel's sons controlled the family business, they\ndecided mat the key to wealth on a larger scale was to secure a\nfoothold in die finances of Europe as a whole, rather tiian being tied to\nany one country or prince. Of the five brothers, Nathan had already\nopened up shop in London. In 1813 James moved to Paris. Amschel\nremained in Frankfurt, Salomon established himself in Vienna, and\nKarl, the youngest son, went to Naples. With each sphere of influence\ncovered, they could tighten their hold on Europe's financial markets.\n\nThis widespread network, of course, opened the Rodischilds to\nthe very danger of which their fadier had warned mem: diffusion,\ndivision, dissension. They avoided mis danger, and established\n\nthemselves as the most powerful force in European finance and\npolitics, by once again resorting to the strategy of the ghettoexcluding\noutsiders, concentrating their forces. The Rothschilds established the\nfastest courier system in Europe, allowing them to get news of events\nbefore all their competitors. They held a virtual monopoly on\ninformation. And their internal communications and correspondence\nwere written in Frankfurt Yiddish, and in a code that only the brothers\ncould decipher. There was no point in stealing mis information no one\ncould understand it. \u201cEven the shewdest bankers cannot find their way\nthrough the Rothschild maze,\u201d admitted a financier who had tried to\ninfiltrate the clan.\n\nIn 1824 James Rothschild decided it was time to get married. This\npresented a problem for the Rothschilds, since it meant incorporating\nan outsider into the Rothschild clan, an outsider who could betray its\nsecrets. James therefore decided to marry within the family, and chose\nthe daughter of his brother Salomon. The brothers were ecstaticthis\nwas the perfect solution to their marriage problems. James's choice\nnow became the family policy: Two years later, Nathan married off his\ndaughter to\n\nhissing at everyone who passes by, you bring upon yourself the\nderision of all beholders. 1 confess that I am only formed to move\nupon the ground; but how graceful is my make! How well turned my\nlimbs! How highly finished my whole body! How great my strength!\nHow astonishing my speed! I had much rather be confined to one\nelement, and be admired in that, than be a goose in all!\"\n\nFABLES FROM BOCCACCIO AND CHAUCER,\n\nDr. John Aikin, 1747-1822\n\nBeware of dissipating your powers; strive constantly to\nconcentrate them. Genius thinks it can do whatever it sees others\ndoing, but it is sure to repent of every ill-judged outlay.\n\nJohann von Goethe, 1749-1832\n\nSalomon's son. In die years to come, the five brotiiers arranged\neighteen matches among their children, sixteen of these being\ncontracted between first cousins.\n\n\u201cWe are like the mechanism of a watch: Each part is essential,\u201d\nsaid brother Salomon. As in a watch, every part of the business moved\nin concert with every other, and the inner workings were invisible to\n\nthe world, which only saw die movement of the hands. While odier\nrich and powerful families suffered irrecoverable downturns during the\ntumultous first half of the nineteenth century, the tight-knit Rothschilds\nmanaged not only to preserve but to expand dieir unprecedented\nwealth.\n\nInterpretation\n\nThe Rothschilds were born in strange times. They came from a\nplace diat had not changed in centuries, but lived in an age that gave\nbirth to the Industrial Revolution, die French Revolution, and an\nendless series of upheavals. The Rotiichilds kept die past alive,\nresisted Uie patterns of dispersion of their era and for this are\nemblematic of the law of concentration.\n\nNo one represents this better than James Rodischild, die son who\nestablished himself in Paris. In his lifetime James witnessed die defeat\nof Napoleon, die restoration of die Bourbon monarchy, the bourgeois\nmonarchy of Orleans, the return to a republic, and finally the\nenthronement of Napoleo i III. French styles and fashions changed at a\nrelentiess pace during all this turmoil. Without appearing to be a relic\nof the past, James steered his family as if die ghetto lived on widiin\ndiem. He kept alive his clan's inner cohesion and strength. Only\nthrough such an anchoring in die past was die family able to tiirive\namidst such chaos. Concentration was die foundation of the\nRothschilds' power, wealth, and stability.\n\nThe best strategy is always to be very strong; first in general, then\n\nat the decisive point. . . . There is no higher and simpler law of\nstrategy\n\nthan that of keeping one's forces concentrated. . . . In short the\n\nfirst principle is: act with the utmost concentration.\n\nOn War, Carl von Clausewitz, 1 7801831\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nThe world is plagued by greater and greater divisionwitiiin\ncountries, political groups, families, even individuals. We are all in a\nstate of total distraction and diffusion, hardly able to keep our minds in\none direction before we are pulled in a thousand others. The modern\nworld's level of conflict is higher tiian ever, and we have internalized it\nin our own lives.\n\nThe solution is a form of retreat inside ourselves, to the past, to\nmore concentrated forms of thought and action. As Schopenhauer\nwrote, \u201cIntellect is a magnitude of intensity, not a magnitude of\nextensity.\u201d Napoleon knew die value of concentrating your forces at\ndie enemy's weakest spot\n\nit was the secret of his success on the battlefield. But his\nwillpower and his mind were equally modeled on this notion. Single-\nmindedness of purpose, total concentration on the goal, and the use of\nthese qualities against people less focused, people in a state of\ndistractionsuch an arrow will find its mark every time and overwhelm\nthe enemy.\n\nCasanova attributed his success in life to his ability to concentrate\non a single goal and push at it until it yielded. It was his ability to give\nhimself over completely to the women he desired that made him so\nintensely seductive. For the weeks or months that one of these women\nlived in his orbit, he thought of no one else. When he was imprisoned\nin the treacherous \u201cleads\u201d of the doge's palace in Venice, a prison from\nwhich no one had ever escaped, he concentrated his mind on the single\ngoal of escape, day after day. A change of cells, which meant that\nmonths of digging had all been for naught, did not discourage him; he\npersisted and eventually escaped. \u201cI have always believed,\u201d he later\nwrote, \u201cthat when a man gets it into his head to do something, and\nwhen he exclusively occupies himself in that design, he must succeed,\nwhatever the difficulties. That man will become Grand Vizier or\nPope.\u201d\n\nConcentrate c 1 a single goal, a single task, and beat it into\nsubmission. In the world of power you will constantly need help from\nother people, usually those more powerful than you. The fool flits from\none person to another, believing that he will survive by spreading\nhimself out. It is a corollary of the law of concentration, however, that\nmuch energy is saved, and more power is attained, by affixing yourself\nto a single, appropriate source of power. The scientist Nikola Tesla\nruined himself by believing that he somehow maintained his\nindependence by not having to serve a single master. He even turned\ndown J. P. Morgan, who offered him a rich contract. In the end, Tesla's\n\u201cindependence\u201d meant that he could depend on no single patron, but\n\nwas always having to toady up to a dozen of them. Later in his life he\nrealized his mistake.\n\nAll the great Renaissance painters and writers wresded with this\nproblem, none more so tilan the sixteenth-century writer Pietro\nAretino. Throughout his life Aretino suffered die indignities of having\nto please diis prince and that. At last, he had had enough, and decided\nto woo Charles V, promising the emperor the services of his powerful\npen.

Below is an excerpt from my book titled '48 Laws of Power', specifically from Chapter '48 Laws of Power', Section 'LAW 24'. The original text is: 'PLAY THE PERFECT COURTIER\n\nJUDGMENT\n\nThe perfect courtier thrives in a world where everything revolves\naround power and political dexterity. He has mastered the art of\nindirection; he flatters, yields to superiors, and asserts power over\nothers in the most oblique and graceful manner. Learn and apply the\nlaws of courtiership and there will be no limit to how far you can rise\nin the court.\n\nCOURT SOCIETY\n\nIt is a fact of human nature r/t the structure of a court society\nforms itself around power. In the pasVthe court garnered around the\ntuler, and had many functions: Besides keeping the ruler amused, it\nwas a way to solidify the hierarchy of royalty, nobility, and the upper\nclasses, and to keep the nobility both subordinate and close to the ruler,\nso that he could keep an eye on them. The court serves power in many\nways, but most of all it glorifies the ruler, providing him with a\nmicrocosmic world that must struggle to please him.\n\nTo be a courtier was a dangerous game. A nineteenth-century\nArab traveler to the court of Darfur, in what is now Sudan, reported\nthat courtiers there had to do whatever the sultan did: If he were\ninjured, they had to suffer me same injury; if he fell off his horse\nduring a hunt, they fell, too. Mimicry like tiiis appeared in courts all\nover the world. More troublesome was the danger of displeasing the\ntulerone wrong move spelled death or exile. The successful courtier\nhad to walk a tightrope, pleasing but not pleasing too much, obeying\nbut somehow distinguishing himself from the other courtiers, while\nalso never distinguishing himself so far as to make the ruler insecure.\n\nGreat courtiers diroughout history have mastered the science of\nmanipulating people. They make die king feel more kingly; they make\neveryone else fear dieir power. They are magicians of appearance,\nknowing that most things at court are judged by how diey seem. Great\n\ncourtiers are gracious and polite; their aggression is veiled and\nindirect. Masters of the word, they never say more dian necessary,\ngetting the most out of a compliment or hidden insult. They are\nmagnets of pleasurepeople want to be around them because they know\nhow to please, yet they neitiier fawn nor humiliate tiiemselves. Great\ncourtiers become the king's favorites, enjoying the benefits of that\nposition. They often end up more powerful than the ruler, for mey are\nwizards in the accumulation of influence.\n\nMany today dismiss court life as a relic of the past, a historical\ncuriosity. They reason, according to Machiavelli, \u201cas though heaven,\nthe sun, die elements, and men had changed the order of their motions\nand power, and were different from what they were in ancient times.\u201d\nThere may be no more Sun Kings but there are still plenty of people\nwho believe the sun revolves around diem. The royal court may have\nmore or less disappeared, or at least lost its power, but courts and\ncourtiers still exist because power still exists. A courtier is rarely asked\nto fall off a horse anymore, but the laws tiiat govern court politics are\nas timeless as the laws of power. There is much to be learned, then,\nfrom great courtiers past and present.\n\nTHE LAWS OF COURT POLITICS\n\nAvoid Ostentation. It is never prudent to prattle on about yourself\nor call too much attention to your actions. The more you talk about\nyour deeds\n\nthe two no(;s\n\nBarbos, the faithful yard-dog who serves his master zealously.\nhappens to see his old acquaintance Joujou, the curly lapdog, seated at\nthe window on a soft down cushion. Sidling fondly up to her, like a\nchild to a parent, he all but weeps with emotion; and there, under the\nwindow, he whines, wags his tail, and bounds about. \u201cWhat sort of life\ndo you lead now, Joujoutka, ever since the master took you into his\nmansion You remember, no doubt, how we often used to suffer hunger\nout in the yard. What is your present service like\u201d \u201cIt would be a sin in\nme to murmur against my good fortune, \u201d answers Joujoutka. \u201cMy\nmaster cannot make enough of me. I live amidst riches and plenty, and\nI eat and drink off silver. 1 frolic with the master, and, if I get tired, I\ntake my ease on carpels or on a soft couch. And how do you get on\u201d\n\u201cT\u201d replies Barbos, letting his tail dangle like a whip, and hanging his\n\nhead. \"I live as J used to do. I suffer from cold and hunger; and here,\nwhile guarding my master's house, I have to sleep at the foot of the\nwall, and I get drenched in the rain. And if 1 bark at the wrong time, I\nam whipped. But how did you, Joujou, who were\n\nso small and weak, get taken into favor, while I jump out of my\nskin to no purpose What is it you do \u201c \u201d 'What is it you do ' A pretty\nquestion to ask!\u201c replied Joujou, mockingly. \u201dI walk upon my hind\nlegs.\"\n\nIvan Kriloff,\n\n1768-1844\n\nthe more suspicion you cause. You also stir up enough envy\namong your peers to induce treachery and backstabbing. Be careful,\never so careful, in trumpeting your own achievements, and always talk\nless about yourself than about other people. Modesty is generally\npreferable.\n\nPractice Nonchalance. Never seem to be working too hard. Your\ntalent must appear to flow naturally, with an ease that makes people\ntake you for a genius rather than a workaholic. Even when something\ndemands a lot of sweat, make it look effortlesspeople prefer to not see\nyour blood and toil, which is another form of ostentation. It is better\nfor them to marvel at how gracefully you have achieved your\naccomplishment than to wonder why it took so much work.\n\n/; is a wise thing to be polite; consequently, it is a stupid thing to\nbe rude. To make enemies by unnecessary and wilful incivility, is just\nas insane a proceeding as to set your house on fire. For politeness is\nlike a counteran avowedly false coin, with which it is foolish to be\nstingy. A sensible man will be generous in the use of it... Wax, a\nsubstance naturally hard and brittle, can be made soft by the\napplication of a little warmth, so that it will take any shape you please.\nIn the same way, by being polite and friendly, you can make people\npliable and obliging, even though they are apt to be crabbed and\nmalevolent. Hence politeness is to human nature what warmth is to\nwax.\nArthur\n\nSchopenhauer,\n1788-1860\n\nBe Frugal with Flattery. It may seem that your superiors cannot\nget enough flattery, but too much of even a good thing loses its value.\nIt also stirs up suspicion among your peers. Learn to flatter\nindirectlyby downplaying your own contribution, for example, to make\nyour master look better.\n\nArrange to Be Noticed. There is a paradox: You cannot display\nyourself too brazenly, yet you must also get yourself noticed. In the\ncourt of Louis XIV, whoever the king decided to look at rose instandy\nin the court hierarchy. You stand no chance of rising if the ruler does\nnot notice you in the swamp of courtiers. This task requires much art.\nIt is often initially a matter of being seen, in the literal sense. Pay\nattention to your physical appearance, then, and find a way to create a\ndistinctivea subtly distinctivestyle and image.\n\nAlter Your Style and Language According to the Person You Are\nDealing With. The pseudo-belief in equalitydie idea that talking and\nacting the same way with everyone, no matter what their rank, makes\nyou somehow a paragon of civilizationis a terrible mistake. Those\nbelow you will take it as a form of condescension, which it is, and\nthose above you will be offended, although they may not admit it. You\nmust change your style and your way of speaking to suit each person.\nThis is not lying, it is acting, and acting is an art, not a gift from God.\nLearn the art. This is also true for the great variety of cultures found in\nthe modern court: Never assume that your criteria of behavior and\njudgment are universal. Not only is an inability to adapt to another\nculture the height of barbarism, it puts you at a disadvantage.\n\nNever Be the Bearer of Bad News. The king kills the messenger\nwho brings bad news: This is a cliche but there is truth to it. You must\nstruggle and if necessary lie and cheat to be sure that the lot of the\nbearer of bad news falls on a colleague, never on you. Bring only good\nnews and your approach will gladden your master.\n\nIso\n\nNever Affect Friendliness and Intimacy with Your Master. He\ndoes not want a friend for a subordinate, he wants a subordinate. Never\napproach him in an easy, friendly way, or act as if you are on the best\nof termsthat is his prerogative. If he chooses to deal with you on this\nlevel, assume a wary chumminess. Otherwise err in the opposite\ndirection, and make the distance between you clear.\n\nNever Criticize Those Above You Directly. This may seem\nobvious, but there are often times when some sort of criticism is\nnecessaryto say nothing, or to give no advice, would open you to risks\nof another sort. You must learn, however, to couch your advice and\ncriticism as indirectly and as politely as possible. Think twice, or three\ntimes, before deciding you have made them sufficiently circuitous. Err\non the side of subtlety and gentieness.\n\nBe Frugal in Asking Those Above You for Favors. Nothing\nirritates a master more than having to reject someone's request. It stirs\nup guilt and resentment. Ask for favors as rarely as possible, and know\nwhen to stop. Rather than making yourself the supplicant, it is always\nbetter to earn your favors, so that the ruler bestows them willingly.\nMost important: Do not ask for favors on another person's behalf, least\nof all a friend's.\n\nNever Joke About Appearances or Taste. A lively wit and a\nhumorous disposition are essential qualities for a good courtier, and\nthere are times when vulgarity is appropriate and engaging. But avoid\nany kind of joke about appearance or taste, two highly sensitive areas,\nespecially with those above you. Do not even try it when you are away\nfrom them. You will dig your own grave.\n\nDo Not Be the Court Cynic. Express admiration for the good\nwork of others. If you constandy criticize your equals or subordinates\nsome of that criticism will rub off on you, hovering over you like a\ngray cloud wherever you go. People will groan at each new cynical\ncomment, and you will irritate them. By expressing modest admiration\nfor other people's achievements, you paradoxically call attention to\nyour own. The ability to express wonder and amazement, and seem\nlike you mean it, is a rare and dying talent, but one still greatiy valued.\n\nBe Self-observant The mirror is a miraculous invention; without it\nyou would commit great sins against beauty and decorum. You also\nneed a mirror for your actions. This can sometimes come from other\npeople telling you what they see in you, but that is not the most\ntrustworthy method: You must be the mirror, training your mind to try\nto see yourself as others see you. Are you acting too obsequious Are\nyou trying too hard to please Do you seem desperate for attention,\ngiving the impression that you are on the decline Be observant about\nyourself and you will avoid a mountain of blunders.\n\nMaster Your Emotions. As an actor in a great play, you must learn\nto cry and laugh on command and when it is appropriate. You must be\nable both to disguise your anger and frustration and to fake your\ncontentment and agreement. You must be the master of your own face.\nCall it lying if you like; but if you prefer to not play the game and to\nalways be honest and upfront, do not complain when others call you\nobnoxious and arrogant.\n\nFit the Spirit of the Times. A slight affectation of a past era can be\ncharming, as long as you choose a period at least twenty years back;\nwearing the fashions of ten years ago is ludicrous, unless you enjoy the\nrole of court jester. Your spirit and way of thinking must keep up with\nthe times, even if the times offend your sensibilities. Be too forward-\nthinking, however, and no one will understand you. It is never a good\nidea to stand out too much in this area; you are best off at least being\nable to mimic the spirit of the times.\n\nBe a Source of Pleasure. This is critical. It is an obvious law of\nhuman nature that we will flee what is unpleasant and distasteful,\nwhile charm and the promise of delight will draw us like moths to a\nflame. Make yourself the flame and you will rise to the top. Since life\nis otherwise so full of unpleasantness and pleasure so scarce, you will\nbe as indispensable as food and drink. This may seem obvious, but\nwhat is obvious is often ignored or unappreciated. There are degrees to\nthis: Not everyone can play the role of favorite, for not everyone is\nblessed with charm and wit. But we can all control our unpleasant\nqualities and obscure them when necessary.\n\nA man who knows the court is master of his gestures, of his eyes\nand\n\nof his face; he is profound, impenetrable; he dissimulates bad\noffices,\n\nsmiles at his enemies, controls his irritation, disguises his\npassions,\n\nbelies his heart, speaks and acts against his feelings.\n\nJean de La Bruyere, 16451696\n\nSCENES OF COURT LIFE: Exemplary Deeds and Fatal\nMistakes\n\nScene I\n\nAlexander the Great, conqueror of the Mediterranean basin and\nthe Middle East through to India, had had the great Aristotle as his\ntutor and mentor, and throughout his short life he remained devoted to\nphilosophy and his master's teachings. He once complained to\nAristotle that during his long campaigns he had no one with whom he\ncould discuss philosophical matters. Aristotle responded by suggesting\nthat he take Callisthenes, a former pupil of Aristotle's and a promising\nphilosopher in his own right, along on the next campaign.\n\nAristotle had schooled Callisthenes in the skills of being a\ncourtier, but\n\nthe young man secretly scoffed at them. He believed in pure\nphilosophy, in unadorned words, in speaking the naked truth. If\nAlexander loved learning so much, Callisthenes thought, he could not\nobject to one who spoke his mind. During one of Alexander's major\ncampaigns, Callisthenes spoke his mind one too many times and\nAlexander had him put to death. Interpretation\n\nIn court, honesty is a fool's game. Never be so self-absorbed as to\nbelieve that the master is interested in your criticisms of him, no matter\nhow accurate they are.\n\nScene II\n\nBeginning in the Han Dynasty two thousand years ago, Chinese\nscholars compiled a series of writings called the 21 Histories, an\nofficial biography of each dynasty, including stories, statistics, census\n\u2018igures, and war chronicles. Each history also contained a chapter\ncalled \u201cUnusual Events,\u201d and here, among the listings of earthquakes\nand floods, there would sometimes suddenly appear descriptions of\nsuch bizarre manifestations as two-headed sheep, geese flying\nbackward, stars suddenly appearing in different parts of the sky, and so\non. The earthquakes could be historically verified, but the monsters\nand weird natural phenomena were clearly inserted on purpose, and\ninvariably occurred in clusters. What could this mean\n\nThe Chinese emperor was considered more than a manhe was a\norce of nature. His kingdom was the center of the universe, and\neverything revolved around him. He embodied the world's perfection.\nTo criticize him or any of his actions would have been to criticize the\ndivine order. No minister or courtier dared approach the emperor with\neven the slightest cautionary word. But emperors were fallible and the\n\n\nkingdom suffered gready by their mistakes. Inserting sightings of\nstrange phenomena into the court chronicles was the only way to warn\nthem. The emperor would read of geese flying backward and moons\nout of orbit, and realize that he was being cautioned. His actions were\nunbalancing the universe and needed to change. Interpretation\n\nFor Chinese courtiers, the problem of how to give the emperor\nadvice was an important issue. Over the years, thousands of them had\ndied trying to warn or counsel their master. To be made safely, their\ncriticisms had to be indirectyet if they were too indirect they would not\nbe heeded. The chronicles were their solution: Identify no one person\nas the source of criticism, make the advice as impersonal as possible,\nbut let the emperor know the gravity of the situation.\n\nYour master is no longer the center of the universe, but he still\nimagines that everything revolves around him. When you criticize him\nhe sees the person criticizing, not the criticism itself. Like the Chinese\ncourtiers, you must find a way to disappear behind the warning. Use\nsymbols and other indirect methods to paint a picture of the problems\nto come, without putting your neck on the line.\n\nScene III\n\nEarly in his career, the French architect Jules Mansart received\ncommissions to design minor additions to Versailles for King Louis\nXIV. For each design he would draw up his plans, making sure they\nfollowed Louis's instructions closely. He would then present them to\nHis Majesty.\n\nThe courtier Saint-Simon described Mansart's technique in\ndealing with the king: \u201cHis particular skill was to show the king plans\nthat purposely included something imperfect about them, often dealing\nwith the gardens, which were not Mansart's specialty. The king, as\nMansart expected, would put his finger exacdy on the problem and\npropose how to solve it, at which point Mansart would exclaim for all\nto hear that he would never have seen the problem that the king had so\nmasterfully found and solved; he would burst with admiration,\nconfessing that next to the king he was but a lowly pupil.\u201d At the age\nof thirty, having used these methods time and time again, Mansart\nreceived a prestigious royal commission: Although he was less\ntalented and experienced than a number of other French designers, he\n\n\nwas to take charge of the enlargement of Versailles. He was the king's\narchitect from then on. Interpretation\n\nAs a young man, Mansart had seen how many royal craftsmen in\nthe service of Louis XIV had lost their positions not through a lack of\ntalent but through a costly social blunder. He would not make that\nmistake. Mansart always strove to make Louis feel better about\nhimself, to feed the king's vanity as publicly as possible.\n\nNever imagine that skill and talent are all mat matter. In court the\ncourtier's art is more important than his talent; never spend so much\ntime on your studies that you neglect your social skills. And the\ngreatest skill of all is the ability to make the master look more talented\nthan those around him.\n\nScene IV\n\nJean-Baptiste Isabey had become the unofficial painter of the\nNapoleonic court. During the Congress of Vienna in 1814, after\nNapoleon, defeated, had been imprisoned on the island of Elba, the\nparticipants in these meetings, which were to decide the fate of\nEurope, invited Isabey to immortalize the historic events in an epic\npainting.\n\nWhen Isabey arrived in Vienna, Talleyrand, the main negotiator\nfor the French, paid the artist a visit. Considering his role in the\nproceedings, the statesman explained, he expected to occupy center\nstage in the painting. Isabey cordially agreed. A few days later the\nDuke of Wellington, the main negotiator for the English, also\napproached Isabey, and said much the same thing that Talleyrand had.\nThe ever polite Isabey agreed that the great duke should indeed be the\ncenter of attention.\n\nBack in his studio, Isabey pondered the dilemma. If he gave the\nspotlight to either of the two men, he could create a diplomatic rift,\nstirring up all sorts of resentment at a time when peace and concord\nwere critical.\n\nWhen the painting was finally unveiled, however, both Talleyrand\nand Wellington felt honored and satisfied. The work depicts a large\nhall filled with diplomats and politicians from all over Europe. On one\nside die Duke of Wellington enters the room, and all eyes are turned\ntoward him; he is the \u201ccenter\u201d of attention. In the very center of the\npainting, meanwhile, sits Talleyrand. Interpretation\n\nIt is often very difficult to satisfy the master, but to satisfy two\nmasters in one stroke takes die genius of a great courtier. Such\npredicaments are common in the life of a courtier: By giving attention\nto one master, he displeases anotfier. You must find a way to navigate\nmis Scylla and Charybdis safely. Masters must receive tiieir due; never\ninadvertendy stir up the resentment of one in pleasing another.\n\nScene V\n\nGeorge Brummell, also known as Beau Brummell, made his mark\nin die late 1700s by the supreme elegance of his appearance, his\npopularization of shoe buckles (soon imitated by all the dandies), and\nhis clever way with words. His London house was the fashionable spot\nin town, and Brummell was the authority on all matters of fashion. If\nhe disliked your footwear, you immediately got rid of it and bought\nwhatever he was wearing. He perfected the art of tying a cravat; Lord\nByron was said to spend many a night in front of die mirror trying to\n\u2018igure out die secret behind Brummell's perfect knots.\n\nOne of Brummell's greatest admirers was the Prince of Wales,\nwho fancied himself a fashionable young man. Becoming attached to\nthe prince's court (and provided witii a royal pension), Brummell was\nsoon so sure of his own authority tiiere that he took to joking about the\nprince's weight, referring to his host as Big Ben. Since trimness of\n\u2018igure was an important quality for a dandy, this was a withering\ncriticism. At dinner once, when the service was slow, Brummell said to\nthe prince, \u201cDo ring, Big Ben.\u201d The prince rang, but when die valet\narrived he ordered the man to show Brummell the door and never\nadmit him again.\n\nDespite falling into die prince's disfavor, Brummell continued to\ntreat everyone around him with the same arrogance. Without the Prince\nof Wales' patronage to support him, he sank into horrible debt, but he\nmaintained his insolent manners, and everyone soon abandoned him.\nHe died in the most pitiable poverty, alone and deranged.\nInterpretation\n\nBeau Brummell's devastating wit was one of die qualities mat\nendeared him to the Prince of Wales. But not even he, the arbiter of\ntaste and fashion, could get away with a joke about the prince's\nappearance, least of all to his face. Never joke about a person's\nplumpness, even indirecdyand particularly when he is your master. The\n\n\npoorhouses of history are filled with people who have made such jokes\nat their master's expense.\n\nScene VI\n\nPope Urban VIII wanted to be remembered for his skills in\nwriting poetry, which unfortunately were mediocre at best. In 1629\nDuke Francesco d'Este, knowing the pope's literary pretensions, sent\nthe poet Fulvio Testi as his ambassador to the Vatican. One of Testi's\nletters to the duke reveals why he was chosen: \u201cOnce our discussion\nwas over, I kneeled to depart, but His Holiness made a signal and\nwalked to another room where he sleeps, and after reaching a small\ntable, he grabbed a bundle of papers and thus, turning to me witii a\nsmiling face, he said: 'We want Your Lordship to listen to some of our\ncompositions.' And, in fact, he read me two very long Pindaric poems,\none in praise of the most holy Virgin, and die other one about Countess\nMatilde.\u201d\n\nWe do not know exactly what Testi thought of these very long\npoems, since it would have been dangerous for him to state his opinion\nfreely, even in a letter. But he went on to write, \u201cI, following the mood,\ncommented on each line with the needed praise, and, after having\nkissed His Holiness's foot for such an unusual sign of benevolence [the\nreading of the poetry], I left.\u201d Weeks later, when the duke himself\nvisited die pope, he managed to recite entire verses of die pope's poetry\nand praised it enough to make the pope \u201cso jubilant he seemed to lose\nhis mind.\u201d Interpretation\n\nIn matters of taste you can never be too obsequious with your\nmaster. Taste is one of die ego's prickliest parts; never impugn or\nquestion the master's tastehis poetry is sublime, his dress impeccable,\nand his manner the model for all.\n\nScene VII\n\nOne afternoon in ancient China, Chao, ruler of Han from 358 to\n333 B.C., got drunk and fell asleep in the palace gardens. The court\ncrown-keeper, whose sole task was to look after die ruler's head\napparel, passed Uirough the gardens and saw his master sleeping\nwithout a coat. Since it was getting cold, die crown-keeper placed his\nown coat over the ruler, and left.\n\nWhen Chao awoke and saw the coat upon him, he asked his\nattendants, \u201cWho put more clodies on my body\u201d \u201cThe crown-keeper,\u201d\n\nthey replied. The ruler immediately called for his official coat-keeper\nand had him punished for neglecting his duties. He also called for the\ncrown-keeper, whom he had beheaded. Interpretation\n\nDo not overstep your bounds. Do what you are assigned to do, to\nthe best of your abilities, and never do more. To think that by doing\nmore you are doing better is a common blunder. It is never good to\nseem to be trying too hardit is as if you were covering up some\ndeficiency. Fulfilling a task that has not been asked of you just makes\npeople suspicious. If you are a crown-keeper, be a crown-keeper. Save\nyour excess energy for when you are not in die court.\nScene VIII\nOne day, for amusement, the Italian Renaissance painter Fra\nFilippo Lippi (1406-1469) and some friends went sailing in a small\nboat off Ancona. There they were captured by two Moorish galleys,\nwhich hauled mem off in chains to Barbary, where they were sold as\nslaves. For eighteen long months Filippo toiled with no hope of\nreturning to Italy.\nOn several occasions Filippo saw the man who had bought him\npass by, and one day he decided to sketch this man's portrait, using\nburnt coalcharcoalfrom the fire. Still in his chains, he found a white\nwall, where he drew a full-length likeness of his owner in Moorish\nclothing. The owner soon heard about this, for no one had seen such\nskill in drawing before in these parts; it seemed like a miracle, a gift\ntom God. The drawing so pleased the owner that he instantly gave\nFilippo his freedom and employed him in his court. All the big men on\nthe Barbary coast came to see the magnificent color portraits that Fra\nFilippo then proceeded to do, and finally, in gratitude for the honor in\nthis way brought upon him, Filippo's owner returned the artist safely to\nItaly. Interpretation\nWe who toil for other people have all in some way been captured\nby pirates and sold into slavery. But like Fra Filippo (if to a lesser\ndegree), most of us possess some gift, some talent, an ability to do\nsomething better than other people. Make your master a gift of your\ntalents and you will rise above other courtiers. Let him take the credit\nif necessary, it will only be temporary: Use him as a stepping stone, a\nway of displaying your talent and eventually buying your freedom\nfrom enslavement.\n\n\nScene IX\n\nAlfonso I of Aragon once had a servant who told the king that the\nnight before he had had a dream: Alfonso had given him a gift of\nweapons, horses, and clothes. Alfonso, a generous, lordly man,\ndecided it would be amusing to make this dream come true, and\npromptly gave the servant exactly these gifts.\n\nA little while later, the same servant announced to Alfonso that he\nhad had yet another dream, and in this one Alfonso had given him a\nconsiderable pile of gold florins. The king smiled and said, \u201cDon't\nbelieve in dreams from now on; they lie.\u201d Interpretation\n\nIn his treatment of the servant's first dream, Alfonso remained in\ncontrol. By making a dream come true, he claimed a godlike power for\nhimself, if in a mild and humorous way. In the second dream, however,\nall appearance of magic was gone; this was nothing but an ugly con\ngame on the servant's part. Never ask for too much, then, and know\nwhen to stop. It is the master's prerogative to giveto give when he\nwants and what he wants, and to do so without prompting. Do not give\nhim the chance to reject your requests. Better to win favors by\ndeserving them, so that they are bestowed without your asking.\n\nScene X\n\nThe great English landscape painter J. M. W. Turner (1775-1851)\nwas known for his use of color, which he applied with a brilliance and\na strange iridescence. The color in his paintings was so striking, in\nfact, that other artists never wanted his work hung next to theirs: It\ninevitably made everything around it seem dull.\n\nThe painter Sir Thomas Lawrence once had the misfortune of\nseeing Turner's masterpiece Cologne hanging in an exhibition between\ntwo works of his own. Lawrence complained bitterly to the gallery\nowner, who gave him no satisfaction: After all, someone's paintings\nhad to hang next to Turmer's. But Turner heard of Lawrence's\ncomplaint, and before the exhibition opened, he toned down the\nbrilliant golden sky in Cologne, making it as dull as the colors in\nLawrence's works. A friend of Tumer's who saw the painting\napproached the artist with a horrified look: \u201cWhat have you done to\nyour picture!\u201d he said. \u201cWell, poor Lawrence was so unhappy,\u201d Turner\nreplied, \u201cand it's only lampblack. It'll wash off after the exhibition.\u201d\nInterpretation\n\n\nMany of a courtier's anxieties have to do with the master, with\nwhom most dangers lie. Yet it is a mistake to imagine that the master is\nthe only one to determine your fate. Your equals and subordinates play\nintegral parts also. A court is a vast stew of resentments, fears, and\npowerful envy. You have to placate everyone who might someday\nharm you, deflecting their resentment and envy and diverting their\nhostility onto other people.\n\nTurner, eminent courtier, knew that his good fortune and fame\ndepended on his fellow painters as well as on his dealers and patrons.\nHow many of the great have been felled by envious colleagues! Better\ntemporarily to dull your brilliance than to suffer the slings and arrows\nof envy.\n\nScene XI\n\nWinston Churchill was an amateur artist, and after World War II\n\nhis paintings became collector's items. The American publisher Henry\nLuce, in fact, creator of Time and Life magazines, kept one of\nChurchill's landscapes hanging in his private office in New York.\nOn a tour through the United States once, Churchill visited Luce\nin his office, and the two men looked at the painting togetiier. The\npublisher remarked, \u201cIt's a good picture, but I think it needs something\nin the foregrounda sheep, perhaps.\u201d Much to Luce's horror, Churchill's\nsecretary called the publisher the next day and asked him to have the\npainting sent to England. Luce did so, mortified that he had perhaps\noffended the former prime minister. A few days later, however, the\npainting was shipped back, but slighdy altered: a single sheep now\ngrazed peacefully in the foreground. Interpretation\n\nIn stature and fame, Churchill stood head and shoulders above\nLuce, but Luce was certainly a man of power, so let us imagine a slight\nequality between them. Still, what did Churchill have to fear from an\nAmerican publisher Why bow to the criticism of a dilettante\n\nA courtin this case the entire world of diplomats and international\nstatesmen, and also of the journalists who court themis a place of\nmutual dependence. It is unwise to insult or offend the taste of people\nof power, even if they are below or equal to you. If a man like\nChurchill can swallow the criticisms of a man like Luce, he proves\nhimself a courtier without peer. (Perhaps his correction of the painting\nimplied a certain condescension as well, but he did it so subtly that\n\n\nLuce did not perceive any slight.) Imitate Churchill: Put in the sheep.\nIt is always beneficial to play the obliging courtier, even when you are\nNot serving a master.\n\nTHE DELICATE GAME OF COURTIERSHIP: A Warning\nTalleyrand was the consummate courtier, especially in serving his\nmaster Napoleon. When the two men were first getting to know each\nother, Napoleon once said in passing, \u201cI shall come to lunch at your\nhouse one of these days.\u201d Talleyrand had a house at Auteuil, in the\nsuburbs of Paris. \u201cI should be delighted, mon general,\u201d the minister\nreplied, \u201cand since my house is close to the Bois de Boulogne, you will\nbe able to amuse yourself with a bit of shooting in the afternoon.\u201d\n\n\u201cT do not like shooting,\u201d said Napoleon, \u201cBut I love hunting. Are\nthere any boars in the Bois de Boulogne\u201d Napoleon came from\nCorsica, where boar hunting was a great sport. By asking if there were\nboars in a Paris park, he showed himself still a provincial, almost a\ntube. Talleyrand did not laugh, however, but he could not resist a\npractical joke on the man who was now his master in politics, although\nnot in blood and nobility, since Talleyrand came from an old\naristocratic family. To Napoleon's question, then, he simply replied,\n\u201cVery few, mon general, but I dare say you will manage to find one.\u201d\n\nIt was arranged that Napoleon would arrive at Talleyrand's house\nthe following day at seven A.M. and would spend the morning there.\nThe \u201cboar hunt\u201d would take place in the afternoon. Throughout the\nmorning the excited general talked nothing but boar hunting.\nMeanwhile, Talleyrand secretly had his servants go to the market, buy\ntwo enormous black pigs, and take them to the great park.\n\nAfter lunch, the hunters and their hounds set off for the Bois de\nBoulogne. At a secret signal from Talleyrand, the servants loosed one\nof the pigs. \u201cI see a boar,\u201d Napoleon cried joyfully, jumping onto his\nhorse to give chase. Talleyrand stayed behind. It took half an hour of\ngalloping through the park before the \u201cboar\u201d was finally captured. At\nthe moment of triumph, however, Napoleon was approached by one of\nhis aides, who knew the creature could not possibly be a boar, and\nfeared the general would be ridiculed once the story got out: \u201cSir,\u201d he\ntold Napoleon, \u201cyou realize of course that this is not a boar but a pig.\u201d\n\nFlying into a rage, Napoleon immediately set off at a gallop for\nTalleyrand's house. He realized along the way that he would now be\n\n\nthe butt of many a joke, and that exploding at Talleyrand would only\nmake him\n\nmore ridiculous; it would be better to make a show of good\nhumor. Still, he did not hide his displeasure well.\n\nTalleyrand decided to try to soothe the general's bruised ego. He\ntold Napoleon not to go back to Paris yethe should again go hunting in\nthe park. There were many rabbits there, and hunting them had been a\nfavorite pastime of Louis XVI. Talleyrand even offered to let\nNapoleon use a set of guns that had once belonged to Louis. With\nmuch flattery and cajolery, he once again got Napoleon to agree to a\nhunt.\nThe party left for the park in the late afternoon. Along the way,\nNapoleon told Talleyrand, \u201cI'm not Louis XVI, I surely won't kill even\none rabbit.\u201d Yet that afternoon, strangely enough, the park was teeming\nwith rabbits. Napoleon killed at least fifty of them, and his mood\nchanged from anger to satisfaction. At the end of his wild shooting\nspree, however, the same aide approached him and whispered in his\near, \u201cTo tell die truth, sir, 1 am beginning to believe these are not wild\nrabbits. I suspect that rascal Talleyrand has played another joke on us.\u201d\n(The aide was right: Talleyrand had in fact sent his servants back to the\nmarket, where tiiey had purchased dozens of rabbits and then had\nreleased them in die Bois de Boulogne.)\n\nNapoleon immediately mounted his horse and galloped away, mis\ntime returning straight to Paris. He later threatened Talleyrand, warned\nhim not to tell a soul what had happened; if he became the\nlaughingstock of Paris, there would be hell to pay.\n\nIt took months for Napoleon to be able to trust Talleyrand again,\nand he never totally forgave him his humiliation.\n\nInterpretation\n\nCourtiers are like magicians: They deceptively play with\nappearances, only letting those around them see what they want diem\nto see. With so much deception and manipulation afoot, it is essential\nto keep people from seeing your tricks and glimpsing your sleight of\nhand.\n\nTalleyrand was normally the Grand Wizard of Courtiership, and\nbut for Napoleon's aide, he probably would have gotten away\ncompletely with both pleasing his master and having a joke at the\n\n\ngeneral's expense. But courtiership is a subde art, and overlooked traps\nand inadvertent mistakes can ruin your best tricks. Never risk being\ncaught in your maneuvers; never let people see your devices. If that\nhappens you instandy pass in people's perceptions from a courtier of\ngreat manners to a loamsome rogue. It is a delicate game you play;\napply the utmost attention to covering your tracks, and never let your\nmaster unmask you.\n'.

He has mastered the art of\nindirection; he flatters, yields to superiors, and asserts power over\nothers in the most oblique and graceful manner. Learn and apply the\nlaws of courtiership and there will be no limit to how far you can rise\nin the court.\n\nCOURT SOCIETY\n\nIt is a fact of human nature r/t the structure of a court society\nforms itself around power. In the pasVthe court garnered around the\ntuler, and had many functions: Besides keeping the ruler amused, it\nwas a way to solidify the hierarchy of royalty, nobility, and the upper\nclasses, and to keep the nobility both subordinate and close to the ruler,\nso that he could keep an eye on them. The court serves power in many\nways, but most of all it glorifies the ruler, providing him with a\nmicrocosmic world that must struggle to please him.\n\nTo be a courtier was a dangerous game. A nineteenth-century\nArab traveler to the court of Darfur, in what is now Sudan, reported\nthat courtiers there had to do whatever the sultan did: If he were\ninjured, they had to suffer me same injury; if he fell off his horse\nduring a hunt, they fell, too. Mimicry like tiiis appeared in courts all\nover the world. More troublesome was the danger of displeasing the\ntulerone wrong move spelled death or exile. The successful courtier\nhad to walk a tightrope, pleasing but not pleasing too much, obeying\nbut somehow distinguishing himself from the other courtiers, while\nalso never distinguishing himself so far as to make the ruler insecure.\n\nGreat courtiers diroughout history have mastered the science of\nmanipulating people. They make die king feel more kingly; they make\neveryone else fear dieir power. They are magicians of appearance,\nknowing that most things at court are judged by how diey seem. Great\n\ncourtiers are gracious and polite; their aggression is veiled and\nindirect. Masters of the word, they never say more dian necessary,\ngetting the most out of a compliment or hidden insult. They are\nmagnets of pleasurepeople want to be around them because they know\nhow to please, yet they neitiier fawn nor humiliate tiiemselves. Great\ncourtiers become the king's favorites, enjoying the benefits of that\nposition. They often end up more powerful than the ruler, for mey are\nwizards in the accumulation of influence.\n\nMany today dismiss court life as a relic of the past, a historical\ncuriosity. They reason, according to Machiavelli, \u201cas though heaven,\nthe sun, die elements, and men had changed the order of their motions\nand power, and were different from what they were in ancient times.\u201d\nThere may be no more Sun Kings but there are still plenty of people\nwho believe the sun revolves around diem. The royal court may have\nmore or less disappeared, or at least lost its power, but courts and\ncourtiers still exist because power still exists. A courtier is rarely asked\nto fall off a horse anymore, but the laws tiiat govern court politics are\nas timeless as the laws of power. There is much to be learned, then,\nfrom great courtiers past and present.\n\nTHE LAWS OF COURT POLITICS\n\nAvoid Ostentation. It is never prudent to prattle on about yourself\nor call too much attention to your actions. The more you talk about\nyour deeds\n\nthe two no(;s\n\nBarbos, the faithful yard-dog who serves his master zealously.\nhappens to see his old acquaintance Joujou, the curly lapdog, seated at\nthe window on a soft down cushion. Sidling fondly up to her, like a\nchild to a parent, he all but weeps with emotion; and there, under the\nwindow, he whines, wags his tail, and bounds about. \u201cWhat sort of life\ndo you lead now, Joujoutka, ever since the master took you into his\nmansion You remember, no doubt, how we often used to suffer hunger\nout in the yard. What is your present service like\u201d \u201cIt would be a sin in\nme to murmur against my good fortune, \u201d answers Joujoutka. \u201cMy\nmaster cannot make enough of me. I live amidst riches and plenty, and\nI eat and drink off silver. 1 frolic with the master, and, if I get tired, I\ntake my ease on carpels or on a soft couch. And how do you get on\u201d\n\u201cT\u201d replies Barbos, letting his tail dangle like a whip, and hanging his\n\nhead. \"I live as J used to do. I suffer from cold and hunger; and here,\nwhile guarding my master's house, I have to sleep at the foot of the\nwall, and I get drenched in the rain. And if 1 bark at the wrong time, I\nam whipped. But how did you, Joujou, who were\n\nso small and weak, get taken into favor, while I jump out of my\nskin to no purpose What is it you do \u201c \u201d 'What is it you do ' A pretty\nquestion to ask!\u201c replied Joujou, mockingly. \u201dI walk upon my hind\nlegs.\"\n\nIvan Kriloff,\n\n1768-1844\n\nthe more suspicion you cause. You also stir up enough envy\namong your peers to induce treachery and backstabbing. Be careful,\never so careful, in trumpeting your own achievements, and always talk\nless about yourself than about other people. Modesty is generally\npreferable.\n\nPractice Nonchalance. Never seem to be working too hard. Your\ntalent must appear to flow naturally, with an ease that makes people\ntake you for a genius rather than a workaholic. Even when something\ndemands a lot of sweat, make it look effortlesspeople prefer to not see\nyour blood and toil, which is another form of ostentation. It is better\nfor them to marvel at how gracefully you have achieved your\naccomplishment than to wonder why it took so much work.\n\n/; is a wise thing to be polite; consequently, it is a stupid thing to\nbe rude. To make enemies by unnecessary and wilful incivility, is just\nas insane a proceeding as to set your house on fire. For politeness is\nlike a counteran avowedly false coin, with which it is foolish to be\nstingy. A sensible man will be generous in the use of it... Wax, a\nsubstance naturally hard and brittle, can be made soft by the\napplication of a little warmth, so that it will take any shape you please.\nIn the same way, by being polite and friendly, you can make people\npliable and obliging, even though they are apt to be crabbed and\nmalevolent. Hence politeness is to human nature what warmth is to\nwax.\nArthur\n\nSchopenhauer,\n1788-1860\n\nBe Frugal with Flattery. It may seem that your superiors cannot\nget enough flattery, but too much of even a good thing loses its value.\nIt also stirs up suspicion among your peers. Learn to flatter\nindirectlyby downplaying your own contribution, for example, to make\nyour master look better.\n\nArrange to Be Noticed. There is a paradox: You cannot display\nyourself too brazenly, yet you must also get yourself noticed. In the\ncourt of Louis XIV, whoever the king decided to look at rose instandy\nin the court hierarchy. You stand no chance of rising if the ruler does\nnot notice you in the swamp of courtiers. This task requires much art.\nIt is often initially a matter of being seen, in the literal sense. Pay\nattention to your physical appearance, then, and find a way to create a\ndistinctivea subtly distinctivestyle and image.\n\nAlter Your Style and Language According to the Person You Are\nDealing With. The pseudo-belief in equalitydie idea that talking and\nacting the same way with everyone, no matter what their rank, makes\nyou somehow a paragon of civilizationis a terrible mistake. Those\nbelow you will take it as a form of condescension, which it is, and\nthose above you will be offended, although they may not admit it. You\nmust change your style and your way of speaking to suit each person.\nThis is not lying, it is acting, and acting is an art, not a gift from God.\nLearn the art. This is also true for the great variety of cultures found in\nthe modern court: Never assume that your criteria of behavior and\njudgment are universal. Not only is an inability to adapt to another\nculture the height of barbarism, it puts you at a disadvantage.\n\nNever Be the Bearer of Bad News. The king kills the messenger\nwho brings bad news: This is a cliche but there is truth to it. You must\nstruggle and if necessary lie and cheat to be sure that the lot of the\nbearer of bad news falls on a colleague, never on you. Bring only good\nnews and your approach will gladden your master.\n\nIso\n\nNever Affect Friendliness and Intimacy with Your Master. He\ndoes not want a friend for a subordinate, he wants a subordinate. Never\napproach him in an easy, friendly way, or act as if you are on the best\nof termsthat is his prerogative. If he chooses to deal with you on this\nlevel, assume a wary chumminess. Otherwise err in the opposite\ndirection, and make the distance between you clear.\n\nNever Criticize Those Above You Directly. This may seem\nobvious, but there are often times when some sort of criticism is\nnecessaryto say nothing, or to give no advice, would open you to risks\nof another sort. You must learn, however, to couch your advice and\ncriticism as indirectly and as politely as possible. Think twice, or three\ntimes, before deciding you have made them sufficiently circuitous. Err\non the side of subtlety and gentieness.\n\nBe Frugal in Asking Those Above You for Favors. Nothing\nirritates a master more than having to reject someone's request. It stirs\nup guilt and resentment. Ask for favors as rarely as possible, and know\nwhen to stop. Rather than making yourself the supplicant, it is always\nbetter to earn your favors, so that the ruler bestows them willingly.\nMost important: Do not ask for favors on another person's behalf, least\nof all a friend's.\n\nNever Joke About Appearances or Taste. A lively wit and a\nhumorous disposition are essential qualities for a good courtier, and\nthere are times when vulgarity is appropriate and engaging. But avoid\nany kind of joke about appearance or taste, two highly sensitive areas,\nespecially with those above you. Do not even try it when you are away\nfrom them. You will dig your own grave.\n\nDo Not Be the Court Cynic. Express admiration for the good\nwork of others. If you constandy criticize your equals or subordinates\nsome of that criticism will rub off on you, hovering over you like a\ngray cloud wherever you go. People will groan at each new cynical\ncomment, and you will irritate them. By expressing modest admiration\nfor other people's achievements, you paradoxically call attention to\nyour own. The ability to express wonder and amazement, and seem\nlike you mean it, is a rare and dying talent, but one still greatiy valued.\n\nBe Self-observant The mirror is a miraculous invention; without it\nyou would commit great sins against beauty and decorum. You also\nneed a mirror for your actions. This can sometimes come from other\npeople telling you what they see in you, but that is not the most\ntrustworthy method: You must be the mirror, training your mind to try\nto see yourself as others see you. Are you acting too obsequious Are\nyou trying too hard to please Do you seem desperate for attention,\ngiving the impression that you are on the decline Be observant about\nyourself and you will avoid a mountain of blunders.\n\nMaster Your Emotions. As an actor in a great play, you must learn\nto cry and laugh on command and when it is appropriate. You must be\nable both to disguise your anger and frustration and to fake your\ncontentment and agreement. You must be the master of your own face.\nCall it lying if you like; but if you prefer to not play the game and to\nalways be honest and upfront, do not complain when others call you\nobnoxious and arrogant.\n\nFit the Spirit of the Times. A slight affectation of a past era can be\ncharming, as long as you choose a period at least twenty years back;\nwearing the fashions of ten years ago is ludicrous, unless you enjoy the\nrole of court jester. Your spirit and way of thinking must keep up with\nthe times, even if the times offend your sensibilities. Be too forward-\nthinking, however, and no one will understand you. It is never a good\nidea to stand out too much in this area; you are best off at least being\nable to mimic the spirit of the times.\n\nBe a Source of Pleasure. This is critical. It is an obvious law of\nhuman nature that we will flee what is unpleasant and distasteful,\nwhile charm and the promise of delight will draw us like moths to a\nflame. Make yourself the flame and you will rise to the top. Since life\nis otherwise so full of unpleasantness and pleasure so scarce, you will\nbe as indispensable as food and drink. This may seem obvious, but\nwhat is obvious is often ignored or unappreciated. There are degrees to\nthis: Not everyone can play the role of favorite, for not everyone is\nblessed with charm and wit. But we can all control our unpleasant\nqualities and obscure them when necessary.\n\nA man who knows the court is master of his gestures, of his eyes\nand\n\nof his face; he is profound, impenetrable; he dissimulates bad\noffices,\n\nsmiles at his enemies, controls his irritation, disguises his\npassions,\n\nbelies his heart, speaks and acts against his feelings.\n\nJean de La Bruyere, 16451696\n\nSCENES OF COURT LIFE: Exemplary Deeds and Fatal\nMistakes\n\nScene I\n\nAlexander the Great, conqueror of the Mediterranean basin and\nthe Middle East through to India, had had the great Aristotle as his\ntutor and mentor, and throughout his short life he remained devoted to\nphilosophy and his master's teachings. He once complained to\nAristotle that during his long campaigns he had no one with whom he\ncould discuss philosophical matters. Aristotle responded by suggesting\nthat he take Callisthenes, a former pupil of Aristotle's and a promising\nphilosopher in his own right, along on the next campaign.\n\nAristotle had schooled Callisthenes in the skills of being a\ncourtier, but\n\nthe young man secretly scoffed at them. He believed in pure\nphilosophy, in unadorned words, in speaking the naked truth. If\nAlexander loved learning so much, Callisthenes thought, he could not\nobject to one who spoke his mind. During one of Alexander's major\ncampaigns, Callisthenes spoke his mind one too many times and\nAlexander had him put to death. Interpretation\n\nIn court, honesty is a fool's game. Never be so self-absorbed as to\nbelieve that the master is interested in your criticisms of him, no matter\nhow accurate they are.\n\nScene II\n\nBeginning in the Han Dynasty two thousand years ago, Chinese\nscholars compiled a series of writings called the 21 Histories, an\nofficial biography of each dynasty, including stories, statistics, census\n\u2018igures, and war chronicles. Each history also contained a chapter\ncalled \u201cUnusual Events,\u201d and here, among the listings of earthquakes\nand floods, there would sometimes suddenly appear descriptions of\nsuch bizarre manifestations as two-headed sheep, geese flying\nbackward, stars suddenly appearing in different parts of the sky, and so\non. The earthquakes could be historically verified, but the monsters\nand weird natural phenomena were clearly inserted on purpose, and\ninvariably occurred in clusters. What could this mean\n\nThe Chinese emperor was considered more than a manhe was a\norce of nature. His kingdom was the center of the universe, and\neverything revolved around him. He embodied the world's perfection.\nTo criticize him or any of his actions would have been to criticize the\ndivine order. No minister or courtier dared approach the emperor with\neven the slightest cautionary word. But emperors were fallible and the\n\n\nkingdom suffered gready by their mistakes. Inserting sightings of\nstrange phenomena into the court chronicles was the only way to warn\nthem. The emperor would read of geese flying backward and moons\nout of orbit, and realize that he was being cautioned. His actions were\nunbalancing the universe and needed to change. Interpretation\n\nFor Chinese courtiers, the problem of how to give the emperor\nadvice was an important issue. Over the years, thousands of them had\ndied trying to warn or counsel their master. To be made safely, their\ncriticisms had to be indirectyet if they were too indirect they would not\nbe heeded. The chronicles were their solution: Identify no one person\nas the source of criticism, make the advice as impersonal as possible,\nbut let the emperor know the gravity of the situation.\n\nYour master is no longer the center of the universe, but he still\nimagines that everything revolves around him. When you criticize him\nhe sees the person criticizing, not the criticism itself. Like the Chinese\ncourtiers, you must find a way to disappear behind the warning. Use\nsymbols and other indirect methods to paint a picture of the problems\nto come, without putting your neck on the line.\n\nScene III\n\nEarly in his career, the French architect Jules Mansart received\ncommissions to design minor additions to Versailles for King Louis\nXIV. For each design he would draw up his plans, making sure they\nfollowed Louis's instructions closely. He would then present them to\nHis Majesty.\n\nThe courtier Saint-Simon described Mansart's technique in\ndealing with the king: \u201cHis particular skill was to show the king plans\nthat purposely included something imperfect about them, often dealing\nwith the gardens, which were not Mansart's specialty. The king, as\nMansart expected, would put his finger exacdy on the problem and\npropose how to solve it, at which point Mansart would exclaim for all\nto hear that he would never have seen the problem that the king had so\nmasterfully found and solved; he would burst with admiration,\nconfessing that next to the king he was but a lowly pupil.\u201d At the age\nof thirty, having used these methods time and time again, Mansart\nreceived a prestigious royal commission: Although he was less\ntalented and experienced than a number of other French designers, he\n\n\nwas to take charge of the enlargement of Versailles. He was the king's\narchitect from then on. Interpretation\n\nAs a young man, Mansart had seen how many royal craftsmen in\nthe service of Louis XIV had lost their positions not through a lack of\ntalent but through a costly social blunder. He would not make that\nmistake. Mansart always strove to make Louis feel better about\nhimself, to feed the king's vanity as publicly as possible.\n\nNever imagine that skill and talent are all mat matter. In court the\ncourtier's art is more important than his talent; never spend so much\ntime on your studies that you neglect your social skills. And the\ngreatest skill of all is the ability to make the master look more talented\nthan those around him.\n\nScene IV\n\nJean-Baptiste Isabey had become the unofficial painter of the\nNapoleonic court. During the Congress of Vienna in 1814, after\nNapoleon, defeated, had been imprisoned on the island of Elba, the\nparticipants in these meetings, which were to decide the fate of\nEurope, invited Isabey to immortalize the historic events in an epic\npainting.\n\nWhen Isabey arrived in Vienna, Talleyrand, the main negotiator\nfor the French, paid the artist a visit. Considering his role in the\nproceedings, the statesman explained, he expected to occupy center\nstage in the painting. Isabey cordially agreed. A few days later the\nDuke of Wellington, the main negotiator for the English, also\napproached Isabey, and said much the same thing that Talleyrand had.\nThe ever polite Isabey agreed that the great duke should indeed be the\ncenter of attention.\n\nBack in his studio, Isabey pondered the dilemma. If he gave the\nspotlight to either of the two men, he could create a diplomatic rift,\nstirring up all sorts of resentment at a time when peace and concord\nwere critical.\n\nWhen the painting was finally unveiled, however, both Talleyrand\nand Wellington felt honored and satisfied. The work depicts a large\nhall filled with diplomats and politicians from all over Europe. On one\nside die Duke of Wellington enters the room, and all eyes are turned\ntoward him; he is the \u201ccenter\u201d of attention. In the very center of the\npainting, meanwhile, sits Talleyrand. Interpretation\n\nIt is often very difficult to satisfy the master, but to satisfy two\nmasters in one stroke takes die genius of a great courtier. Such\npredicaments are common in the life of a courtier: By giving attention\nto one master, he displeases anotfier. You must find a way to navigate\nmis Scylla and Charybdis safely. Masters must receive tiieir due; never\ninadvertendy stir up the resentment of one in pleasing another.\n\nScene V\n\nGeorge Brummell, also known as Beau Brummell, made his mark\nin die late 1700s by the supreme elegance of his appearance, his\npopularization of shoe buckles (soon imitated by all the dandies), and\nhis clever way with words. His London house was the fashionable spot\nin town, and Brummell was the authority on all matters of fashion. If\nhe disliked your footwear, you immediately got rid of it and bought\nwhatever he was wearing. He perfected the art of tying a cravat; Lord\nByron was said to spend many a night in front of die mirror trying to\n\u2018igure out die secret behind Brummell's perfect knots.\n\nOne of Brummell's greatest admirers was the Prince of Wales,\nwho fancied himself a fashionable young man. Becoming attached to\nthe prince's court (and provided witii a royal pension), Brummell was\nsoon so sure of his own authority tiiere that he took to joking about the\nprince's weight, referring to his host as Big Ben. Since trimness of\n\u2018igure was an important quality for a dandy, this was a withering\ncriticism. At dinner once, when the service was slow, Brummell said to\nthe prince, \u201cDo ring, Big Ben.\u201d The prince rang, but when die valet\narrived he ordered the man to show Brummell the door and never\nadmit him again.\n\nDespite falling into die prince's disfavor, Brummell continued to\ntreat everyone around him with the same arrogance. Without the Prince\nof Wales' patronage to support him, he sank into horrible debt, but he\nmaintained his insolent manners, and everyone soon abandoned him.\nHe died in the most pitiable poverty, alone and deranged.\nInterpretation\n\nBeau Brummell's devastating wit was one of die qualities mat\nendeared him to the Prince of Wales. But not even he, the arbiter of\ntaste and fashion, could get away with a joke about the prince's\nappearance, least of all to his face. Never joke about a person's\nplumpness, even indirecdyand particularly when he is your master. The\n\n\npoorhouses of history are filled with people who have made such jokes\nat their master's expense.\n\nScene VI\n\nPope Urban VIII wanted to be remembered for his skills in\nwriting poetry, which unfortunately were mediocre at best. In 1629\nDuke Francesco d'Este, knowing the pope's literary pretensions, sent\nthe poet Fulvio Testi as his ambassador to the Vatican. One of Testi's\nletters to the duke reveals why he was chosen: \u201cOnce our discussion\nwas over, I kneeled to depart, but His Holiness made a signal and\nwalked to another room where he sleeps, and after reaching a small\ntable, he grabbed a bundle of papers and thus, turning to me witii a\nsmiling face, he said: 'We want Your Lordship to listen to some of our\ncompositions.' And, in fact, he read me two very long Pindaric poems,\none in praise of the most holy Virgin, and die other one about Countess\nMatilde.\u201d\n\nWe do not know exactly what Testi thought of these very long\npoems, since it would have been dangerous for him to state his opinion\nfreely, even in a letter. But he went on to write, \u201cI, following the mood,\ncommented on each line with the needed praise, and, after having\nkissed His Holiness's foot for such an unusual sign of benevolence [the\nreading of the poetry], I left.\u201d Weeks later, when the duke himself\nvisited die pope, he managed to recite entire verses of die pope's poetry\nand praised it enough to make the pope \u201cso jubilant he seemed to lose\nhis mind.\u201d Interpretation\n\nIn matters of taste you can never be too obsequious with your\nmaster. Taste is one of die ego's prickliest parts; never impugn or\nquestion the master's tastehis poetry is sublime, his dress impeccable,\nand his manner the model for all.\n\nScene VII\n\nOne afternoon in ancient China, Chao, ruler of Han from 358 to\n333 B.C., got drunk and fell asleep in the palace gardens. The court\ncrown-keeper, whose sole task was to look after die ruler's head\napparel, passed Uirough the gardens and saw his master sleeping\nwithout a coat. Since it was getting cold, die crown-keeper placed his\nown coat over the ruler, and left.\n\nWhen Chao awoke and saw the coat upon him, he asked his\nattendants, \u201cWho put more clodies on my body\u201d \u201cThe crown-keeper,\u201d\n\nthey replied. The ruler immediately called for his official coat-keeper\nand had him punished for neglecting his duties. He also called for the\ncrown-keeper, whom he had beheaded. Interpretation\n\nDo not overstep your bounds. Do what you are assigned to do, to\nthe best of your abilities, and never do more. To think that by doing\nmore you are doing better is a common blunder. It is never good to\nseem to be trying too hardit is as if you were covering up some\ndeficiency. Fulfilling a task that has not been asked of you just makes\npeople suspicious. If you are a crown-keeper, be a crown-keeper. Save\nyour excess energy for when you are not in die court.\nScene VIII\nOne day, for amusement, the Italian Renaissance painter Fra\nFilippo Lippi (1406-1469) and some friends went sailing in a small\nboat off Ancona. There they were captured by two Moorish galleys,\nwhich hauled mem off in chains to Barbary, where they were sold as\nslaves. For eighteen long months Filippo toiled with no hope of\nreturning to Italy.\nOn several occasions Filippo saw the man who had bought him\npass by, and one day he decided to sketch this man's portrait, using\nburnt coalcharcoalfrom the fire. Still in his chains, he found a white\nwall, where he drew a full-length likeness of his owner in Moorish\nclothing. The owner soon heard about this, for no one had seen such\nskill in drawing before in these parts; it seemed like a miracle, a gift\ntom God. The drawing so pleased the owner that he instantly gave\nFilippo his freedom and employed him in his court. All the big men on\nthe Barbary coast came to see the magnificent color portraits that Fra\nFilippo then proceeded to do, and finally, in gratitude for the honor in\nthis way brought upon him, Filippo's owner returned the artist safely to\nItaly. Interpretation\nWe who toil for other people have all in some way been captured\nby pirates and sold into slavery. But like Fra Filippo (if to a lesser\ndegree), most of us possess some gift, some talent, an ability to do\nsomething better than other people. Make your master a gift of your\ntalents and you will rise above other courtiers. Let him take the credit\nif necessary, it will only be temporary: Use him as a stepping stone, a\nway of displaying your talent and eventually buying your freedom\nfrom enslavement.\n\n\nScene IX\n\nAlfonso I of Aragon once had a servant who told the king that the\nnight before he had had a dream: Alfonso had given him a gift of\nweapons, horses, and clothes. Alfonso, a generous, lordly man,\ndecided it would be amusing to make this dream come true, and\npromptly gave the servant exactly these gifts.\n\nA little while later, the same servant announced to Alfonso that he\nhad had yet another dream, and in this one Alfonso had given him a\nconsiderable pile of gold florins. The king smiled and said, \u201cDon't\nbelieve in dreams from now on; they lie.\u201d Interpretation\n\nIn his treatment of the servant's first dream, Alfonso remained in\ncontrol. By making a dream come true, he claimed a godlike power for\nhimself, if in a mild and humorous way. In the second dream, however,\nall appearance of magic was gone; this was nothing but an ugly con\ngame on the servant's part. Never ask for too much, then, and know\nwhen to stop. It is the master's prerogative to giveto give when he\nwants and what he wants, and to do so without prompting. Do not give\nhim the chance to reject your requests. Better to win favors by\ndeserving them, so that they are bestowed without your asking.\n\nScene X\n\nThe great English landscape painter J. M. W. Turner (1775-1851)\nwas known for his use of color, which he applied with a brilliance and\na strange iridescence. The color in his paintings was so striking, in\nfact, that other artists never wanted his work hung next to theirs: It\ninevitably made everything around it seem dull.\n\nThe painter Sir Thomas Lawrence once had the misfortune of\nseeing Turner's masterpiece Cologne hanging in an exhibition between\ntwo works of his own. Lawrence complained bitterly to the gallery\nowner, who gave him no satisfaction: After all, someone's paintings\nhad to hang next to Turmer's. But Turner heard of Lawrence's\ncomplaint, and before the exhibition opened, he toned down the\nbrilliant golden sky in Cologne, making it as dull as the colors in\nLawrence's works. A friend of Tumer's who saw the painting\napproached the artist with a horrified look: \u201cWhat have you done to\nyour picture!\u201d he said. \u201cWell, poor Lawrence was so unhappy,\u201d Turner\nreplied, \u201cand it's only lampblack. It'll wash off after the exhibition.\u201d\nInterpretation\n\n\nMany of a courtier's anxieties have to do with the master, with\nwhom most dangers lie. Yet it is a mistake to imagine that the master is\nthe only one to determine your fate. Your equals and subordinates play\nintegral parts also. A court is a vast stew of resentments, fears, and\npowerful envy. You have to placate everyone who might someday\nharm you, deflecting their resentment and envy and diverting their\nhostility onto other people.\n\nTurner, eminent courtier, knew that his good fortune and fame\ndepended on his fellow painters as well as on his dealers and patrons.\nHow many of the great have been felled by envious colleagues! Better\ntemporarily to dull your brilliance than to suffer the slings and arrows\nof envy.\n\nScene XI\n\nWinston Churchill was an amateur artist, and after World War II\n\nhis paintings became collector's items. The American publisher Henry\nLuce, in fact, creator of Time and Life magazines, kept one of\nChurchill's landscapes hanging in his private office in New York.\nOn a tour through the United States once, Churchill visited Luce\nin his office, and the two men looked at the painting togetiier. The\npublisher remarked, \u201cIt's a good picture, but I think it needs something\nin the foregrounda sheep, perhaps.\u201d Much to Luce's horror, Churchill's\nsecretary called the publisher the next day and asked him to have the\npainting sent to England. Luce did so, mortified that he had perhaps\noffended the former prime minister. A few days later, however, the\npainting was shipped back, but slighdy altered: a single sheep now\ngrazed peacefully in the foreground. Interpretation\n\nIn stature and fame, Churchill stood head and shoulders above\nLuce, but Luce was certainly a man of power, so let us imagine a slight\nequality between them. Still, what did Churchill have to fear from an\nAmerican publisher Why bow to the criticism of a dilettante\n\nA courtin this case the entire world of diplomats and international\nstatesmen, and also of the journalists who court themis a place of\nmutual dependence. It is unwise to insult or offend the taste of people\nof power, even if they are below or equal to you. If a man like\nChurchill can swallow the criticisms of a man like Luce, he proves\nhimself a courtier without peer. (Perhaps his correction of the painting\nimplied a certain condescension as well, but he did it so subtly that\n\n\nLuce did not perceive any slight.) Imitate Churchill: Put in the sheep.\nIt is always beneficial to play the obliging courtier, even when you are\nNot serving a master.\n\nTHE DELICATE GAME OF COURTIERSHIP: A Warning\nTalleyrand was the consummate courtier, especially in serving his\nmaster Napoleon. When the two men were first getting to know each\nother, Napoleon once said in passing, \u201cI shall come to lunch at your\nhouse one of these days.\u201d Talleyrand had a house at Auteuil, in the\nsuburbs of Paris. \u201cI should be delighted, mon general,\u201d the minister\nreplied, \u201cand since my house is close to the Bois de Boulogne, you will\nbe able to amuse yourself with a bit of shooting in the afternoon.\u201d\n\n\u201cT do not like shooting,\u201d said Napoleon, \u201cBut I love hunting. Are\nthere any boars in the Bois de Boulogne\u201d Napoleon came from\nCorsica, where boar hunting was a great sport. By asking if there were\nboars in a Paris park, he showed himself still a provincial, almost a\ntube. Talleyrand did not laugh, however, but he could not resist a\npractical joke on the man who was now his master in politics, although\nnot in blood and nobility, since Talleyrand came from an old\naristocratic family. To Napoleon's question, then, he simply replied,\n\u201cVery few, mon general, but I dare say you will manage to find one.\u201d\n\nIt was arranged that Napoleon would arrive at Talleyrand's house\nthe following day at seven A.M. and would spend the morning there.\nThe \u201cboar hunt\u201d would take place in the afternoon. Throughout the\nmorning the excited general talked nothing but boar hunting.\nMeanwhile, Talleyrand secretly had his servants go to the market, buy\ntwo enormous black pigs, and take them to the great park.\n\nAfter lunch, the hunters and their hounds set off for the Bois de\nBoulogne. At a secret signal from Talleyrand, the servants loosed one\nof the pigs. \u201cI see a boar,\u201d Napoleon cried joyfully, jumping onto his\nhorse to give chase. Talleyrand stayed behind. It took half an hour of\ngalloping through the park before the \u201cboar\u201d was finally captured. At\nthe moment of triumph, however, Napoleon was approached by one of\nhis aides, who knew the creature could not possibly be a boar, and\nfeared the general would be ridiculed once the story got out: \u201cSir,\u201d he\ntold Napoleon, \u201cyou realize of course that this is not a boar but a pig.\u201d\n\nFlying into a rage, Napoleon immediately set off at a gallop for\nTalleyrand's house. He realized along the way that he would now be\n\n\nthe butt of many a joke, and that exploding at Talleyrand would only\nmake him\n\nmore ridiculous; it would be better to make a show of good\nhumor. Still, he did not hide his displeasure well.\n\nTalleyrand decided to try to soothe the general's bruised ego. He\ntold Napoleon not to go back to Paris yethe should again go hunting in\nthe park. There were many rabbits there, and hunting them had been a\nfavorite pastime of Louis XVI. Talleyrand even offered to let\nNapoleon use a set of guns that had once belonged to Louis. With\nmuch flattery and cajolery, he once again got Napoleon to agree to a\nhunt.\nThe party left for the park in the late afternoon. Along the way,\nNapoleon told Talleyrand, \u201cI'm not Louis XVI, I surely won't kill even\none rabbit.\u201d Yet that afternoon, strangely enough, the park was teeming\nwith rabbits. Napoleon killed at least fifty of them, and his mood\nchanged from anger to satisfaction. At the end of his wild shooting\nspree, however, the same aide approached him and whispered in his\near, \u201cTo tell die truth, sir, 1 am beginning to believe these are not wild\nrabbits. I suspect that rascal Talleyrand has played another joke on us.\u201d\n(The aide was right: Talleyrand had in fact sent his servants back to the\nmarket, where tiiey had purchased dozens of rabbits and then had\nreleased them in die Bois de Boulogne.)\n\nNapoleon immediately mounted his horse and galloped away, mis\ntime returning straight to Paris. He later threatened Talleyrand, warned\nhim not to tell a soul what had happened; if he became the\nlaughingstock of Paris, there would be hell to pay.\n\nIt took months for Napoleon to be able to trust Talleyrand again,\nand he never totally forgave him his humiliation.\n\nInterpretation\n\nCourtiers are like magicians: They deceptively play with\nappearances, only letting those around them see what they want diem\nto see. With so much deception and manipulation afoot, it is essential\nto keep people from seeing your tricks and glimpsing your sleight of\nhand.\n\nTalleyrand was normally the Grand Wizard of Courtiership, and\nbut for Napoleon's aide, he probably would have gotten away\ncompletely with both pleasing his master and having a joke at the\n\n\ngeneral's expense. But courtiership is a subde art, and overlooked traps\nand inadvertent mistakes can ruin your best tricks. Never risk being\ncaught in your maneuvers; never let people see your devices. If that\nhappens you instandy pass in people's perceptions from a courtier of\ngreat manners to a loamsome rogue. It is a delicate game you play;\napply the utmost attention to covering your tracks, and never let your\nmaster unmask you.\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

He began his entrance into the\npublic eye by organizing a series of carefully crafted and well-timed\n\nspectacleswild-beast hunts, extravagant gladiator shows, theatrical\ncontests. On several occasions, he paid for these spectacles out of his\nown pocket. To the common man, Julius Caesar became indelibly\nassociated with these much-loved events. As he slowly rose to attain\nthe position of consul, his popularity among the masses served as the\nfoundation of his power. He had created an image of himself as a great\npublic showman.\n\nIn 49 B.C., Rome was on the brink of a civil war between rival\nleaders, Caesar and Pompey. At the height of the tension, Caesar, an\naddict of the stage, attended a theatrical performance, and afterward,\nlost in thought, he wandered in die darkness back to his camp at the\nRubicon, die river that divides Italy from Gaul, where he had been\ncampaigning. To march his army back into Italy across the Rubicon\nwould mean the beginning of a war with Pompey.\n\nBefore his staff Caesar argued both sides, forming the options like\nan actor on stage, a precursor of Hamlet. Finally, to put his soliloquy to\nan end, he pointed to a seemingly innocent apparition at the edge of\nthe rivera very tall soldier blasting a call on a trumpet, then going\nacross a bridge over the Rubiconand pronounced, \u201cLet us accept this\nas a sign from die Gods and follow where tiiey beckon, in vengeance\non our double-dealing enemies. The die is cast.\u201d All of this he spoke\nportentously and dramatically, gesturing toward the river and looking\nhis generals in the eye. He knew that these generals were uncertain in\ntheir support, but his oratory overwhelmed them widi a sense of die\ndrama of the moment, and of die need to seize the time. A more\nprosaic speech would never have had the same effect. The generals\nrallied to his cause; Caesar and his army crossed the Rubicon and by\nthe following year had vanquished Pompey, making Caesar dictator of\nRome.\n\nIn warfare, Caesar always played the leading man with gusto. He\nwas as skilled a horseman as any of his soldiers, and took pride in\noutdoing diem in feats of bravery and endurance. He entered battle\nastride die strongest mount, so that his soldiers would see him in die\nthick of batde, urging diem on, always positioning himself in the\ncenter, a godlike symbol of power and a model for them to follow. Of\nall the armies in Rome, Caesar's was the most devoted and loyal. His\n\n\nsoldiers, like die common people who had attended his entertainments,\nhad come to identify with him and with his cause.\n\nAfter the defeat of Pompey, die entertainments grew in scale.\nNodiing like mem had ever been seen in Rome. The chariot races\nbecame more spectacular, die gladiator fights more dramatic, as Caesar\nstaged fights to die deadi among the Roman nobility. He organized\nenormous mock naval batdes on an artificial lake. Plays were\nperformed in every Roman ward. A\n\n192 LAW 25\n\ngiant new theater was built that sloped dramatically down the\nTarpeian Rock. Crowds from all over the empire flocked to these\nevents, the roads to Rome lined widi visitors\u2019 tents. And in 45 B.C.,\ntiming his entry into the city for maximum effect and surprise, Caesar\nbrought Cleopatra back to Rome after his Egyptian campaign, and\nstaged even more extravagant public spectacles.\n\nThese events were more than devices to divert the masses; they\ndramatically enhanced the public's sense of Caesar's character, and\nmade him seem larger than life. Caesar was die master of his public\nimage, of which he was forever aware. When he appeared before\ncrowds he wore the most spectacular purple robes. He would be\nupstaged by no one. He was notoriously vain about his appearanceit\nwas said that one reason he enjoyed being honored by the Senate and\npeople was that on these occasions he could wear a laurel wreath,\nhiding his baldness. Caesar was a masterful orator. He knew how to\nsay a lot by saying a litde, intuited die moment to end a speech for\nmaximum effect. He never failed to incorporate a surprise into his\npublic appearancesa startling announcement tiiat would heighten their\ndrama.\n\nImmensely popular among the Roman people, Caesar was hated\nand feared by his rivals. On the ides of MarchMarch 15in die year 44\nB.C., a group of conspirators led by Brutus and Cassius surrounded\nhim in die senate and stabbed him to deadi. Even dying, however, he\nkept his sense of drama. Drawing die top of his gown over his face, he\nlet go of die clodi's lower part so diat it draped his legs, allowing him\nto die covered and decent. According to die Roman historian\nSuetonius, his final words to his old friend Brutus, who was about to\n\n\ndeliver a second blow, were in Greek, and as if rehearsed for die end of\na play: \u201cYou too, my child\u201d\n\nInterpretation\n\nThe Roman dieater was an event for the masses, attended by\ncrowds\n\nunimaginable today. Packed into enormous auditoriums, die\naudience\n\nwould be amused by raucous comedy or moved by high tragedy.\nTheater\n\nseemed to contain die essence of life, in its concentrated, dramatic\nform.\n\nLike a religious ritual, it had a powerful, instant appeal to die\ncommon\n\nman.\n\nJulius Caesar was perhaps die first public figure to understand die\nvital link between power and theater. This was because of his own\nobsessive interest in drama. He sublimated tiiis interest by making\nhimself an actor and director on the world stage. He said his lines as if\ndiey had been scripted; he gestured and moved through a crowd widi a\nconstant sense of how he appeared to his audience. He incorporated\nsurprise into his repertoire, building drama into his speeches, staging\ninto his public appearances. His gestures were broad enough for die\ncommon man to grasp diem instantiy. He became immensely popular.\n\nCaesar set die ideal for all leaders and people of power. Like him,\nyou must learn to enlarge your actions dirough dramatic techniques\nsuch as\n\nsurprise, suspense, the creation of sympathy, and symbolic\nidentification. Also like him, you must be constantiy aware of your\naudienceof what will please them and what will bore them. You must\narrange to place yourself at the center, to command attention, and\nnever to be upstaged at any cost.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II\n\nIn the year 1831, a young woman named Aurore Dupin Dudevant\nleft her husband and family in the provinces and moved to Paris. She\nwanted to be a writer; marriage, she felt, was worse than prison, for it\nleft her neither the time nor the freedom to pursue her passion. In Paris\nshe would establish her independence and make her living by writing.\n\nSoon after Dudevant arrived in the capital, however, she had to\nconfront certain harsh realities. To have any degree of freedom in Paris\nyou had to have money. For a woman, money could only come\nthrough marriage or prostitution. No woman had ever come close to\nmaking a living by writing. Women wrote as a hobby, supported by\ntheir husbands, or by an inheritance. In fact when Dudevant first\nshowed her writing to an editor, he told her, \u201cYou should make babies,\nMadame, not literature.\u201d\n\nClearly Dudevant had come to Paris to attempt the impossible. In\nthe end, though, she came up with a strategy to do what no woman had\never donea strategy to re-create herself completely, forging a public\nimage of her own making. Women writers before her had been forced\ninto a ready-made role, that of the second-rate artist who wrote mostly\nfor other women. Dudevant decided that if she had to play a role, she\nwould turn the game around: She would play the part of a man.\n\nIn 1832 a publisher accepted Dudevant's first major novel,\nIndiana. She had chosen to publish it under a pseudonym, \u201cGeorge\nSand,\u201d and all of Paris assumed this impressive new writer was male.\nDudevant had sometimes worn men's clothes before creating \u201cGeorge\nSand\u201d (she had always found men's shirts and riding breeches more\ncomfortable); now, as a public figure, she exaggerated the image. She\nadded long men's coats, gray hats, heavy boots, and dandyish cravats\nto her wardrobe. She smoked cigars and in conversation expressed\nherself like a man, unafraid to dominate the conversation or to use a\nsaucy word.\n\nThis strange \u201cmale/female\u201d writer fascinated the public. And\nunlike other women writers, Sand found herself accepted into the\nclique of male artists. She drank and smoked with them, even carried\non affairs with the most famous artists of EuropeMusset, Liszt,\nChopin. It was she who did the wooing, and also the abandoningshe\nmoved on at her discretion.\n\nThose who knew Sand well understood that her male persona\nprotected her from the public's prying eyes. Out in the world, she\nenjoyed playing the part to the extreme; in private she remained\nherself. She also realized that the character of \u201cGeorge Sand\u201d could\ngrow stale or predictable, and to avoid this she would every now and\nthen dramatically alter\n\n\nthe character she had created; instead of conducting affairs widi\nfamous men, she would begin meddling in politics, leading\ndemonstrations, inspiring student rebellions. No one would dictate to\nher die limits of the character she had created. Long after she died, and\nafter most people had stopped reading her novels, the larger-than-life\ntheatricality of that character has continued to fascinate and inspire.\n\nInterpretation\n\nThroughout Sand's public life, acquaintances and other artists\nwho spent time in her company had the feeling they were in the\npresence of a man. But in her journals and to her closest friends, such\nas Gustave Flaubert, she confessed diat she had no desire to be a man,\nbut was playing a part for public consumption. What she really wanted\nwas the power to determine her own character. She refused the limits\nher society would have set on her. She did not attain her power,\nhowever, by being herself; instead she created a persona that she could\nconstandy adapt to her own desires, a persona diat attracted attention\nand gave her presence.\n\nUnderstand this: The world wants to assign you a role in life. And\nonce you accept that role you are doomed. Your power is limited to the\ntiny amount allotted to die role you have selected or have been forced\nto assume. An actor, on the other hand, plays many roles. Enjoy that\nprotean power, and if it is beyond you, at least forge a new identity,\none of your own making, one diat has had no boundaries assigned to it\nby an envious and resentful world. This act of defiance is Promethean:\nIt makes you responsible for your own creation.\n\nYour new identity will protect you from the world precisely\nbecause it is not \u201cyou\u201d; it is a costume you put on and take off. You\nneed not take it personally. And your new identity sets you apart, gives\nyou theatrical presence. Those in the back rows can see you and hear\nyou. Those in die front rows marvel at your audacity.\n\nDo not people talk in society of a man being a great actor They do\nnot mean by that that he feels, but that he excels in simulating, though\nhe feels nothing.\n\nDenis Diderot, 1713-1784\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nThe character you seem to have been born with is not necessarily\nwho you are; beyond die characteristics you have inherited, your\n\nparents, your friends, and your peers have helped to shape your\npersonality. The Promethean task of the powerful is to take control of\nthe process, to stop allowing others that ability to limit and mold diem.\nRemake yourself into a character of power. Working on yourself like\nclay should be one of your greatest and most pleasurable life tasks. It\nmakes you in essence an artist an artist creating yourself.\n\nIn fact, the idea of self-creation comes from the world of art. For\nthou-\n\nsands of years, only kings and the highest courtiers had the\nfreedom to shape their public image and determine their own identity.\nSimilarly, only kings and the wealthiest lords could contemplate their\nown image in art, and consciously alter it. The rest of mankind played\nthe limited role that society demanded of them, and had little self-\nconsciousness.\n\nA shift in this condition can be detected in Velazquez's painting\nLas Meninas, made in 1656. The artist appears at the left of the canvas,\nstanding before a painting that he is in the process of creating, but that\nhas its back to uswe cannot see it. Beside him stands a princess, her\nattendants, and one of the court dwarves, all watching him work. The\npeople posing for the painting are not directly visible, but we can see\nthem in tiny reflections in a mirror on the back wallthe king and queen\nof Spain, who must be sitting somewhere in die foreground, outside\nthe picture.\n\nThe painting represents a dramatic change in the dynamics of\npower and the ability to determine one's own position in society. For\nVelazquez, the artist, is far more prominendy positioned than the king\nand queen. In a sense he is more powerful than they are, since he is\nclearly the one controlling the image their image. Velazquez no longer\nsaw himself as the slavish, dependent artist. He had remade himself\ninto a man of power. And indeed the first people other than aristocrats\nto play openly with their image in Western society were artists and\nwriters, and later on dandies and bohemians. Today the concept of self-\ncreation has slowly filtered down to the rest of society, and has become\nan ideal to aspire to. Like Velazquez, you must demand for yourself\nthe power to determine your position in the painting, and to create your\nown image.\n\nThe first step in the process of self-creation is self-consciousness\nbeing aware of yourself as an actor and taking control of your\nappearance and emotions. As Diderot said, the bad actor is the one\nwho is always sincere. People who wear tiieir hearts on their sleeves\nout in society are tiresome and embarrassing. Their sincerity\nnotwithstanding, it is hard to take them seriously. Those who cry in\npublic may temporarily elicit sympathy, but sympathy soon turns to\nscorn and irritation at dieir self-obsessivenessthey are crying to get\nattention, we feel, and a malicious part of us wants to deny them the\nsatisfaction.\n\nGood actors control themselves better. They can play sincere and\nheartfelt, can affect a tear and a compassionate look at will, but they\ndon't have to feel it. They externalize emotion in a form tiiat odiers can\nunderstand. Method acting is fatal in die real world. No ruler or leader\ncould possibly play the part if all of the emotions he showed had to be\nreal. So learn self-control. Adopt the plasticity of the actor, who can\nmold his or her face to die emotion required.\n\nThe second step in die process of self-creation is a variation on\ndie George Sand strategy: the creation of a memorable character, one\nthat compels attention, diat stands out above die other players on the\nstage. This was the game Abraham Lincoln played. The homespun,\ncommon country man, he knew, was a kind of president that America\nhad never had\n\nbut would delight in electing. Although many of these qualities\ncame naturally to him, he played them upthe hat and clothes, the beard.\n(No president before him had worn a beard.) Lincoln was also the first\npresident to use photographs to spread his image, helping to create the\nicon of the \u201chomespun president.\u201d\n\nGood drama, however, needs more than an_ interesting\nappearance, or a single stand-out moment. Drama takes place over\ntimeit is an unfolding event. Rhythm and timing are critical. One of the\nmost important elements in the rhythm of drama is suspense. Houdini\nfor instance, could sometimes complete his escape acts in secondsbut\nhe drew them out to minutes, to make the audience sweat.\n\nThe key to keeping the audience on the edge of their seats is\nletting events unfold slowly, then speeding them up at the right\nmoment, according to a pattern and tempo that you control. Great\n\n\nrulers from Napoleon to Mao Tse-tung have used theatrical timing to\nsurprise and divert their public. Franklin Delano Roosevelt understood\nthe importance of staging political events in a particular order and\nrhythm.\n\nAt the time of his 1932 presidential election, the United States\nwas in the midst of a dire economic crisis. Banks were failing at an\nalarming rate. Shortly after winning the election, Roosevelt went into a\nkind of retreat. He said nothing about his plans or his cabinet\nappointments. He even refused to meet the sitting president, Herbert\nHoover, to discuss the transition. By the time of Roosevelt's\ninauguration the country was in a state of high anxiety.\n\nIn his inaugural address, Roosevelt shifted gears. He made a\npowerful speech, making it clear that he intended to lead the country in\na completely new direction, sweeping away the timid gestures of his\npredecessors. From then on the pace of his speeches and public\ndecisionscabinet appointments, bold legislationunfolded at an\nincredibly rapid rate. The period after the inauguration became known\nas the \u201cHundred Days,\u201d and its success in altering the country's mood\npartly stemmed from Roosevelt's clever pacing and use of dramatic\ncontrast. He held his audience in suspense, then hit them with a series\nof bold gestures that seemed all the more momentous because they\ncame from nowhere. You must learn to orchestrate events in a similar\nmanner, never revealing all your cards at once, but unfolding them in a\nway that heightens their dramatic effect.\n\nBesides covering a multitude of sins, good drama can also\nconfuse and deceive your enemy. During World War II, the German\nplaywright Bertolt Brecht worked in Hollywood as a screenwriter.\nAfter the war he was called before the House Committee on Un-\nAmerican Activities for his supposed Communist sympathies. Other\nwriters who had been called to testify planned to humiliate the\ncommittee members with an angry emotional stand. Brecht was wiser:\nHe would play the committee like a violin, charming them while\nfooling them as well. He carefully rehearsed his responses, and\nbrought along some props, notably a cigar on which he puffed away,\nknowing the head of the committee liked cigars. And indeed he\nproceeded\n\nto beguile the committee with well-crafted responses that were\nambiguous, funny, and double-edged. Instead of an angry, heartfelt\ntirade, he ran circles around them with a staged production, and they\nlet him off scot-free.\n\nOther dramatic effects for your repertoire include the beau geste,\nan action at a climactic moment that symbolizes your triumph or your\nboldness. Caesar's dramatic crossing of the Rubicon was a beau geste a\nmove that dazzled the soldiers and gave him heroic proportions. You\nmust also appreciate the importance of stage entrances and exits. When\nCleopatra first met Caesar in Egypt, she arrived rolled up in a carpet,\nwhich she arranged to have unfurled at his feet. George Washington\ntwice left power with flourish and fanfare (first as a general, then as a\npresident who refused to sit for a third term), showing he knew how to\nmake the moment count, dramatically and symbolically. Your own\nentrances and exits should be crafted and planned as carefully.\n\nRemember that overacting can be counterproductiveit is another\nway of spending too much effort trying to attract attention. The actor\nRichard Burton discovered early in his career that by standing totally\nstill onstage, he drew attention to himself and away from the other\nactors. It is less what you do that matters, clearly, than how you do\nityour gracefulness and imposing stillness on the social stage count for\nmore than overdoing your part and moving around too much.\n\nFinally: Learn to play many roles, to be whatever the moment\nrequires. Adapt your mask to the situationbe protean in die faces you\nwear. Bismarck played this game to perfection: To a liberal he was a\nliberal, to a hawk he was a hawk. He could not be grasped, and what\ncannot be grasped cannot be consumed.\n\nImage:\n\nThe Greek Sea-God Proteus.\n\nHis power came from his ability to\n\nchange shape at will, to be whatever the\n\nmoment required. When Menelaus, brother\n\nof Agamemnon, tried to seize him, Proteus\n\ntransformed himself into a lion, then a serpent, a\n\npanther, a boar, running water, and finally a leafy tree.\n\nAuthority: Know how to be all things to all men. A discreet\nProteusa scholar among scholars, a saint among saints. That is the art\n\nof winning over everyone, for like attracts like. Take note of\ntemperaments and adapt yourself to that of each person you\nmeetfollow the lead of the serious and jovial in turn, changing your\nmood discreedy. (Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nThere can really be no reversal to this critical law: Bad theater is\nbad theater. Even appearing natural requires artin other words, acting.\nBad acting only creates embarrassment. Of course you should not be\ntoo dramaticavoid the histrionic gesture. But that is simply bad theater\nanyway, since it violates centuries-old dramatic laws against\noveracting. In essence there is no reversal to this law.\n'.

At the height of the tension, Caesar, an\naddict of the stage, attended a theatrical performance, and afterward,\nlost in thought, he wandered in die darkness back to his camp at the\nRubicon, die river that divides Italy from Gaul, where he had been\ncampaigning. To march his army back into Italy across the Rubicon\nwould mean the beginning of a war with Pompey.\n\nBefore his staff Caesar argued both sides, forming the options like\nan actor on stage, a precursor of Hamlet. Finally, to put his soliloquy to\nan end, he pointed to a seemingly innocent apparition at the edge of\nthe rivera very tall soldier blasting a call on a trumpet, then going\nacross a bridge over the Rubiconand pronounced, \u201cLet us accept this\nas a sign from die Gods and follow where tiiey beckon, in vengeance\non our double-dealing enemies. The die is cast.\u201d All of this he spoke\nportentously and dramatically, gesturing toward the river and looking\nhis generals in the eye. He knew that these generals were uncertain in\ntheir support, but his oratory overwhelmed them widi a sense of die\ndrama of the moment, and of die need to seize the time. A more\nprosaic speech would never have had the same effect. The generals\nrallied to his cause; Caesar and his army crossed the Rubicon and by\nthe following year had vanquished Pompey, making Caesar dictator of\nRome.\n\nIn warfare, Caesar always played the leading man with gusto. He\nwas as skilled a horseman as any of his soldiers, and took pride in\noutdoing diem in feats of bravery and endurance. He entered battle\nastride die strongest mount, so that his soldiers would see him in die\nthick of batde, urging diem on, always positioning himself in the\ncenter, a godlike symbol of power and a model for them to follow. Of\nall the armies in Rome, Caesar's was the most devoted and loyal. His\n\n\nsoldiers, like die common people who had attended his entertainments,\nhad come to identify with him and with his cause.\n\nAfter the defeat of Pompey, die entertainments grew in scale.\nNodiing like mem had ever been seen in Rome. The chariot races\nbecame more spectacular, die gladiator fights more dramatic, as Caesar\nstaged fights to die deadi among the Roman nobility. He organized\nenormous mock naval batdes on an artificial lake. Plays were\nperformed in every Roman ward. A\n\n192 LAW 25\n\ngiant new theater was built that sloped dramatically down the\nTarpeian Rock. Crowds from all over the empire flocked to these\nevents, the roads to Rome lined widi visitors\u2019 tents. And in 45 B.C.,\ntiming his entry into the city for maximum effect and surprise, Caesar\nbrought Cleopatra back to Rome after his Egyptian campaign, and\nstaged even more extravagant public spectacles.\n\nThese events were more than devices to divert the masses; they\ndramatically enhanced the public's sense of Caesar's character, and\nmade him seem larger than life. Caesar was die master of his public\nimage, of which he was forever aware. When he appeared before\ncrowds he wore the most spectacular purple robes. He would be\nupstaged by no one. He was notoriously vain about his appearanceit\nwas said that one reason he enjoyed being honored by the Senate and\npeople was that on these occasions he could wear a laurel wreath,\nhiding his baldness. Caesar was a masterful orator. He knew how to\nsay a lot by saying a litde, intuited die moment to end a speech for\nmaximum effect. He never failed to incorporate a surprise into his\npublic appearancesa startling announcement tiiat would heighten their\ndrama.\n\nImmensely popular among the Roman people, Caesar was hated\nand feared by his rivals. On the ides of MarchMarch 15in die year 44\nB.C., a group of conspirators led by Brutus and Cassius surrounded\nhim in die senate and stabbed him to deadi. Even dying, however, he\nkept his sense of drama. Drawing die top of his gown over his face, he\nlet go of die clodi's lower part so diat it draped his legs, allowing him\nto die covered and decent. According to die Roman historian\nSuetonius, his final words to his old friend Brutus, who was about to\n\n\ndeliver a second blow, were in Greek, and as if rehearsed for die end of\na play: \u201cYou too, my child\u201d\n\nInterpretation\n\nThe Roman dieater was an event for the masses, attended by\ncrowds\n\nunimaginable today. Packed into enormous auditoriums, die\naudience\n\nwould be amused by raucous comedy or moved by high tragedy.\nTheater\n\nseemed to contain die essence of life, in its concentrated, dramatic\nform.\n\nLike a religious ritual, it had a powerful, instant appeal to die\ncommon\n\nman.\n\nJulius Caesar was perhaps die first public figure to understand die\nvital link between power and theater. This was because of his own\nobsessive interest in drama. He sublimated tiiis interest by making\nhimself an actor and director on the world stage. He said his lines as if\ndiey had been scripted; he gestured and moved through a crowd widi a\nconstant sense of how he appeared to his audience. He incorporated\nsurprise into his repertoire, building drama into his speeches, staging\ninto his public appearances. His gestures were broad enough for die\ncommon man to grasp diem instantiy. He became immensely popular.\n\nCaesar set die ideal for all leaders and people of power. Like him,\nyou must learn to enlarge your actions dirough dramatic techniques\nsuch as\n\nsurprise, suspense, the creation of sympathy, and symbolic\nidentification. Also like him, you must be constantiy aware of your\naudienceof what will please them and what will bore them. You must\narrange to place yourself at the center, to command attention, and\nnever to be upstaged at any cost.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II\n\nIn the year 1831, a young woman named Aurore Dupin Dudevant\nleft her husband and family in the provinces and moved to Paris. She\nwanted to be a writer; marriage, she felt, was worse than prison, for it\nleft her neither the time nor the freedom to pursue her passion. In Paris\nshe would establish her independence and make her living by writing.\n\nSoon after Dudevant arrived in the capital, however, she had to\nconfront certain harsh realities. To have any degree of freedom in Paris\nyou had to have money. For a woman, money could only come\nthrough marriage or prostitution. No woman had ever come close to\nmaking a living by writing. Women wrote as a hobby, supported by\ntheir husbands, or by an inheritance. In fact when Dudevant first\nshowed her writing to an editor, he told her, \u201cYou should make babies,\nMadame, not literature.\u201d\n\nClearly Dudevant had come to Paris to attempt the impossible. In\nthe end, though, she came up with a strategy to do what no woman had\never donea strategy to re-create herself completely, forging a public\nimage of her own making. Women writers before her had been forced\ninto a ready-made role, that of the second-rate artist who wrote mostly\nfor other women. Dudevant decided that if she had to play a role, she\nwould turn the game around: She would play the part of a man.\n\nIn 1832 a publisher accepted Dudevant's first major novel,\nIndiana. She had chosen to publish it under a pseudonym, \u201cGeorge\nSand,\u201d and all of Paris assumed this impressive new writer was male.\nDudevant had sometimes worn men's clothes before creating \u201cGeorge\nSand\u201d (she had always found men's shirts and riding breeches more\ncomfortable); now, as a public figure, she exaggerated the image. She\nadded long men's coats, gray hats, heavy boots, and dandyish cravats\nto her wardrobe. She smoked cigars and in conversation expressed\nherself like a man, unafraid to dominate the conversation or to use a\nsaucy word.\n\nThis strange \u201cmale/female\u201d writer fascinated the public. And\nunlike other women writers, Sand found herself accepted into the\nclique of male artists. She drank and smoked with them, even carried\non affairs with the most famous artists of EuropeMusset, Liszt,\nChopin. It was she who did the wooing, and also the abandoningshe\nmoved on at her discretion.\n\nThose who knew Sand well understood that her male persona\nprotected her from the public's prying eyes. Out in the world, she\nenjoyed playing the part to the extreme; in private she remained\nherself. She also realized that the character of \u201cGeorge Sand\u201d could\ngrow stale or predictable, and to avoid this she would every now and\nthen dramatically alter\n\n\nthe character she had created; instead of conducting affairs widi\nfamous men, she would begin meddling in politics, leading\ndemonstrations, inspiring student rebellions. No one would dictate to\nher die limits of the character she had created. Long after she died, and\nafter most people had stopped reading her novels, the larger-than-life\ntheatricality of that character has continued to fascinate and inspire.\n\nInterpretation\n\nThroughout Sand's public life, acquaintances and other artists\nwho spent time in her company had the feeling they were in the\npresence of a man. But in her journals and to her closest friends, such\nas Gustave Flaubert, she confessed diat she had no desire to be a man,\nbut was playing a part for public consumption. What she really wanted\nwas the power to determine her own character. She refused the limits\nher society would have set on her. She did not attain her power,\nhowever, by being herself; instead she created a persona that she could\nconstandy adapt to her own desires, a persona diat attracted attention\nand gave her presence.\n\nUnderstand this: The world wants to assign you a role in life. And\nonce you accept that role you are doomed. Your power is limited to the\ntiny amount allotted to die role you have selected or have been forced\nto assume. An actor, on the other hand, plays many roles. Enjoy that\nprotean power, and if it is beyond you, at least forge a new identity,\none of your own making, one diat has had no boundaries assigned to it\nby an envious and resentful world. This act of defiance is Promethean:\nIt makes you responsible for your own creation.\n\nYour new identity will protect you from the world precisely\nbecause it is not \u201cyou\u201d; it is a costume you put on and take off. You\nneed not take it personally. And your new identity sets you apart, gives\nyou theatrical presence. Those in the back rows can see you and hear\nyou. Those in die front rows marvel at your audacity.\n\nDo not people talk in society of a man being a great actor They do\nnot mean by that that he feels, but that he excels in simulating, though\nhe feels nothing.\n\nDenis Diderot, 1713-1784\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nThe character you seem to have been born with is not necessarily\nwho you are; beyond die characteristics you have inherited, your\n\nparents, your friends, and your peers have helped to shape your\npersonality. The Promethean task of the powerful is to take control of\nthe process, to stop allowing others that ability to limit and mold diem.\nRemake yourself into a character of power. Working on yourself like\nclay should be one of your greatest and most pleasurable life tasks. It\nmakes you in essence an artist an artist creating yourself.\n\nIn fact, the idea of self-creation comes from the world of art. For\nthou-\n\nsands of years, only kings and the highest courtiers had the\nfreedom to shape their public image and determine their own identity.\nSimilarly, only kings and the wealthiest lords could contemplate their\nown image in art, and consciously alter it. The rest of mankind played\nthe limited role that society demanded of them, and had little self-\nconsciousness.\n\nA shift in this condition can be detected in Velazquez's painting\nLas Meninas, made in 1656. The artist appears at the left of the canvas,\nstanding before a painting that he is in the process of creating, but that\nhas its back to uswe cannot see it. Beside him stands a princess, her\nattendants, and one of the court dwarves, all watching him work. The\npeople posing for the painting are not directly visible, but we can see\nthem in tiny reflections in a mirror on the back wallthe king and queen\nof Spain, who must be sitting somewhere in die foreground, outside\nthe picture.\n\nThe painting represents a dramatic change in the dynamics of\npower and the ability to determine one's own position in society. For\nVelazquez, the artist, is far more prominendy positioned than the king\nand queen. In a sense he is more powerful than they are, since he is\nclearly the one controlling the image their image. Velazquez no longer\nsaw himself as the slavish, dependent artist. He had remade himself\ninto a man of power. And indeed the first people other than aristocrats\nto play openly with their image in Western society were artists and\nwriters, and later on dandies and bohemians. Today the concept of self-\ncreation has slowly filtered down to the rest of society, and has become\nan ideal to aspire to. Like Velazquez, you must demand for yourself\nthe power to determine your position in the painting, and to create your\nown image.\n\nThe first step in the process of self-creation is self-consciousness\nbeing aware of yourself as an actor and taking control of your\nappearance and emotions. As Diderot said, the bad actor is the one\nwho is always sincere. People who wear tiieir hearts on their sleeves\nout in society are tiresome and embarrassing. Their sincerity\nnotwithstanding, it is hard to take them seriously. Those who cry in\npublic may temporarily elicit sympathy, but sympathy soon turns to\nscorn and irritation at dieir self-obsessivenessthey are crying to get\nattention, we feel, and a malicious part of us wants to deny them the\nsatisfaction.\n\nGood actors control themselves better. They can play sincere and\nheartfelt, can affect a tear and a compassionate look at will, but they\ndon't have to feel it. They externalize emotion in a form tiiat odiers can\nunderstand. Method acting is fatal in die real world. No ruler or leader\ncould possibly play the part if all of the emotions he showed had to be\nreal. So learn self-control. Adopt the plasticity of the actor, who can\nmold his or her face to die emotion required.\n\nThe second step in die process of self-creation is a variation on\ndie George Sand strategy: the creation of a memorable character, one\nthat compels attention, diat stands out above die other players on the\nstage. This was the game Abraham Lincoln played. The homespun,\ncommon country man, he knew, was a kind of president that America\nhad never had\n\nbut would delight in electing. Although many of these qualities\ncame naturally to him, he played them upthe hat and clothes, the beard.\n(No president before him had worn a beard.) Lincoln was also the first\npresident to use photographs to spread his image, helping to create the\nicon of the \u201chomespun president.\u201d\n\nGood drama, however, needs more than an_ interesting\nappearance, or a single stand-out moment. Drama takes place over\ntimeit is an unfolding event. Rhythm and timing are critical. One of the\nmost important elements in the rhythm of drama is suspense. Houdini\nfor instance, could sometimes complete his escape acts in secondsbut\nhe drew them out to minutes, to make the audience sweat.\n\nThe key to keeping the audience on the edge of their seats is\nletting events unfold slowly, then speeding them up at the right\nmoment, according to a pattern and tempo that you control. Great\n\n\nrulers from Napoleon to Mao Tse-tung have used theatrical timing to\nsurprise and divert their public. Franklin Delano Roosevelt understood\nthe importance of staging political events in a particular order and\nrhythm.\n\nAt the time of his 1932 presidential election, the United States\nwas in the midst of a dire economic crisis. Banks were failing at an\nalarming rate. Shortly after winning the election, Roosevelt went into a\nkind of retreat. He said nothing about his plans or his cabinet\nappointments. He even refused to meet the sitting president, Herbert\nHoover, to discuss the transition. By the time of Roosevelt's\ninauguration the country was in a state of high anxiety.\n\nIn his inaugural address, Roosevelt shifted gears. He made a\npowerful speech, making it clear that he intended to lead the country in\na completely new direction, sweeping away the timid gestures of his\npredecessors. From then on the pace of his speeches and public\ndecisionscabinet appointments, bold legislationunfolded at an\nincredibly rapid rate. The period after the inauguration became known\nas the \u201cHundred Days,\u201d and its success in altering the country's mood\npartly stemmed from Roosevelt's clever pacing and use of dramatic\ncontrast. He held his audience in suspense, then hit them with a series\nof bold gestures that seemed all the more momentous because they\ncame from nowhere. You must learn to orchestrate events in a similar\nmanner, never revealing all your cards at once, but unfolding them in a\nway that heightens their dramatic effect.\n\nBesides covering a multitude of sins, good drama can also\nconfuse and deceive your enemy. During World War II, the German\nplaywright Bertolt Brecht worked in Hollywood as a screenwriter.\nAfter the war he was called before the House Committee on Un-\nAmerican Activities for his supposed Communist sympathies. Other\nwriters who had been called to testify planned to humiliate the\ncommittee members with an angry emotional stand. Brecht was wiser:\nHe would play the committee like a violin, charming them while\nfooling them as well. He carefully rehearsed his responses, and\nbrought along some props, notably a cigar on which he puffed away,\nknowing the head of the committee liked cigars. And indeed he\nproceeded\n\nto beguile the committee with well-crafted responses that were\nambiguous, funny, and double-edged. Instead of an angry, heartfelt\ntirade, he ran circles around them with a staged production, and they\nlet him off scot-free.\n\nOther dramatic effects for your repertoire include the beau geste,\nan action at a climactic moment that symbolizes your triumph or your\nboldness. Caesar's dramatic crossing of the Rubicon was a beau geste a\nmove that dazzled the soldiers and gave him heroic proportions. You\nmust also appreciate the importance of stage entrances and exits. When\nCleopatra first met Caesar in Egypt, she arrived rolled up in a carpet,\nwhich she arranged to have unfurled at his feet. George Washington\ntwice left power with flourish and fanfare (first as a general, then as a\npresident who refused to sit for a third term), showing he knew how to\nmake the moment count, dramatically and symbolically. Your own\nentrances and exits should be crafted and planned as carefully.\n\nRemember that overacting can be counterproductiveit is another\nway of spending too much effort trying to attract attention. The actor\nRichard Burton discovered early in his career that by standing totally\nstill onstage, he drew attention to himself and away from the other\nactors. It is less what you do that matters, clearly, than how you do\nityour gracefulness and imposing stillness on the social stage count for\nmore than overdoing your part and moving around too much.\n\nFinally: Learn to play many roles, to be whatever the moment\nrequires. Adapt your mask to the situationbe protean in die faces you\nwear. Bismarck played this game to perfection: To a liberal he was a\nliberal, to a hawk he was a hawk. He could not be grasped, and what\ncannot be grasped cannot be consumed.\n\nImage:\n\nThe Greek Sea-God Proteus.\n\nHis power came from his ability to\n\nchange shape at will, to be whatever the\n\nmoment required. When Menelaus, brother\n\nof Agamemnon, tried to seize him, Proteus\n\ntransformed himself into a lion, then a serpent, a\n\npanther, a boar, running water, and finally a leafy tree.\n\nAuthority: Know how to be all things to all men. A discreet\nProteusa scholar among scholars, a saint among saints. That is the art\n\nof winning over everyone, for like attracts like. Take note of\ntemperaments and adapt yourself to that of each person you\nmeetfollow the lead of the serious and jovial in turn, changing your\nmood discreedy. (Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nThere can really be no reversal to this critical law: Bad theater is\nbad theater. Even appearing natural requires artin other words, acting.\nBad acting only creates embarrassment. Of course you should not be\ntoo dramaticavoid the histrionic gesture. But that is simply bad theater\nanyway, since it violates centuries-old dramatic laws against\noveracting. In essence there is no reversal to this law.\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Everyone makes mistakes, but those who are\ntruly clever manage to hide them, and to make sure someone else is\nblamed. A convenient scapegoat should always be kept around for\nsuch moments.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW I\n\nNear die end of the second century A.D., as China's mighty Han\nEmpire slowly collapsed, the great general and imperial minister Ts'ao\nTs'ao emerged as the most powerful man in the country. Seeking to\nextend his power base and to rid himself of the last of his rivals, Ts'ao\nTs'ao began a campaign to take control of the strategically vital Central\nPlain. During the siege of a key city, he slightly miscalculated the\ntiming for supplies of grain to arrive from the capital. As he waited for\nthe shipment to come in, die army ran low on food, and Ts'ao Ts'ao\nwas forced to order the chief of commissariat to reduce its rations.\n\nTs'ao Ts'ao kept a tight rein on the army, and ran a network of\ninformers. His spies soon reported that the men were complaining,\ngrumbling that he was living well while diey themselves had barely\nenough to eat. Perhaps Ts'ao Ts'ao was keeping die food for himself,\nthey murmured. If the grumbling spread, Ts'ao Ts'ao could have a\nmutiny on his hands. He summoned die chief of commissariat to his\ntent.\n\n\u201cI want to ask you to lend me something, and you must not\nrefuse,\u201d Ts'ao Ts'ao told the chief. \u201cWhat is it\u201d the chief replied. \u201cI\nwant the loan of your head to show to the troops,\u201d said Ts'ao Ts'ao.\n\u201cBut I've done nodiing wrong!\u201d cried the chief. \u201cI know,\u201d said Ts'ao\nTs'ao with a sigh, \u201cbut if I do not put you to death, there will be a\nmutiny. Do not grieveafter you're gone, I'll look after your family.\u201d Put\nthis way, the request left the chief no choice, so he resigned himself to\nhis fate and was beheaded that very day. Seeing his head on public\ndisplay, die soldiers stopped grumbling. Some saw through Ts'ao\nTs'ao's gesture, but kept quiet, stunned and intimidated by his violence.\nAnd most accepted his version of who was to blame, preferring to\nbelieve in his wisdom and fairness tiian in his incompetence and\ncruelty.\n\nInterpretation\n\nTs'ao Ts'ao came to power in an extremely tumultuous time. In\nthe struggle for supremacy in the crumbling Han Empire, enemies had\nemerged from all sides. The batde for the Central Plain had proven\nmore difficult than he imagined, and money and provisions were a\nconstant concern. No wonder that under such stress, he had forgotten\nto order supplies in time.\n\nOnce it became clear that the delay was a critical mistake, and\nthat the army was seething with mutiny, Ts'ao Ts'ao had two options:\napology and excuses, or a scapegoat.

A.D. 155-220\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II\n\nFor several years Cesare Borgia campaigned to gain control of\nlarge parts of Italy in the name of his father, Pope Alexander. In the\nyear 1500 he managed to take Romagna, in northern Italy. The region\nhad for years been ruled by a series of greedy masters who had\nplundered its wealtii for themselves. Without police or any disciplining\nforce, it had descended into lawlessness, whole areas being ruled by\nrobbers and feuding families. To establish order, Cesare appointed a\nlieutenant general of die region Remirro de Oreo, \u201ca cruel and\nvigorous man,\u201d according to Niccolo Machiavelli. Cesare gave de\nOreo absolute powers.\n\nWith energy and violence, de Oreo established a severe, brutal\njustice in Romagna, and soon rid it of almost all of its lawless\nelements. But in his zeal he sometimes went too far, and after a couple\nof years the local population resented and even hated him. In\nDecember of 1502, Cesare took decisive action. He first let it be\nknown that he had not approved of de Oreo's cruel and violent deeds,\n\nwhich stemmed from the lieutenant's brutal nature. Then, on December\n22, he imprisoned de Oreo in the town of Ce-sena, and the day after\nChristmas the townspeople awoke to find a strange spectacle in the\nmiddle of the piazza: de Oreo's headless body, dressed in a lavish suit\nwith a purple cape, die head impaled beside it on a pike, the bloody\nknife and executioner's block laid out beside the head. As Machiavelli\nconcluded his comments on the affair, \u201cThe ferocity of this scene left\nthe people at once stunned and satisfied.\u201d\n\nInterpretation\n\nCesare Borgia was a master player in the game of power. Always\nplanning several moves ahead, he set his opponents die cleverest traps.\nFor this Machiavelli honored him above all others in The Prince.\n\nCesare foresaw the future with amazing clarity in Romagna: Only\nbrutal justice would bring order to the region. The process would take\nseveral years, and at first the people would welcome it. But it would\nsoon make many enemies, and the citizens would come to resent the\nimposition of such unforgiving justice, especially by outsiders. Cesare\nhimself, then, could not be seen as the agent of this justicethe people's\nhatred would cause too many problems in the future. And so he chose\nthe one man who could do the dirty work, knowing in advance that\nonce the task was done he would have to display de Oreo's head on a\npike. The scapegoat in this case had been planned from the beginning.\n\nWith Ts'ao Ts'ao, the scapegoat was an entirely innocent man; in\nthe Romagna, he was the offensive weapon in Cesare's arsenal that let\nhim get the dirty work done without bloodying his own hands. With\nthis second kind of scapegoat it is wise to separate yourself from the\nhatchet man at some point, either leaving him dangling in the wind or,\nlike Cesare, even making yourself the one to bring him to justice. Not\nonly are you free of involvement in the problem, you can appear as the\none who cleaned it up.\n\nThe Athenians regularly maintained a number of degraded and\nuseless\n\nbeings at the public expense; and when any calamity, such as\nplague,\n\ndrought, or famine, befell the city . . . [these scapegoats] were led\nabout. . .\n\nand then sacrificed, apparently by being stoned outside the city.\n\n\nThe Golden Bough, Sir James George Frazer, 1854-1941\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nThe use of scapegoats is as old as civilization itself, and examples\nof it can be found in cultures around the world. The main idea behind\nthese sacrifices is the shifting of guilt and sin to an outside\nfigureobject, animal, or manwhich is then banished or destroyed. The\nHebrews used to take a live goat (hence the term \u201cscapegoat\u201d) upon\nwhose head ihe priest would lay both hands while confessing the sins\nof the Children of Israel. Having thus had those sins transferred to it,\nthe beast would be led away and abandoned in the wilderness. With the\nAthenians and the Aztecs, the scapegoat was human, often a person\nfed and raised for the purpose. Since famine and plague were drought\nto be visited on humans by the gods, in punishment for wrongdoing,\nthe people suffered not only from the famine and plague themselves\nbut from blame and guilt. They freed themselves of guilt by\ntransferring it to an innocent person, whose death was intended to\nsatisfy the divine powers and banish the evil from their midst.\n\nIt is an extremely human response to not look inward after a\nmistake or crime, but rather to look outward and to affix blame and\nguilt on a convenient object. When the plague was ravaging Thebes,\nOedipus looked everywhere for its cause, everywhere except inside\nhimself and his own sin of incest, which had so offended the gods and\noccasioned the plague. This profound need to exteriorize one's guilt, to\nproject it on another person or object, has an immense power, which\nthe clever know how to harness. Sac-\n\nrifice is a ritual, perhaps the most ancient ritual of all; ritual too is\na well-spring of power. In the killing of de Oreo, note Cesare's\nsymbolic and ritualistic display of his body. By framing it in this\ndramatic way he focused guilt outward. The citizens of Romagna\nresponded instantly. Because it comes so naturally to us to look\noutward rather than inward, we readily accept the scapegoat's guilt.\n\nThe bloody sacrifice of the scapegoat seems a barbaric relic of the\npast, but the practice lives on to this day, if indirectly and\nsymbolically; since power depends on appearances, and those in power\nmust seem never to make mistakes, the use of scapegoats is as popular\nas ever. What modern leader will take responsibility for his blunders\nHe searches out others to blame, a scapegoat to sacrifice. When Mao\n\nTse-tung's Cultural Revolution failed miserably, he made no apologies\nor excuses to the Chinese people; instead, like Ts'ao Ts'ao before him,\nhe offered up scapegoats, including his own personal secretary and\nhigh-ranking member of the Party, Ch'en Po-ta.\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt had a reputation for honesty and fairness.\nThroughout his career, however, he faced many situations in which\nbeing the nice guy would have spelled political disasteryet he could\nnot be seen as the agent of any foul play. For twenty years, then, his\nsecretary, Louis Howe, played the role de Oreo had. He handled the\nbackroom deals, the manipulation of the press, the underhanded\ncampaign maneuvers. And whenever a mistake was committed, or a\ndirty trick contradicting Roosevelt's carefully crafted image became\npublic, Howe served as the scapegoat, and never complained.\n\nBesides conveniently shifting blame, a scapegoat can serve as a\nwarning to others. In 1631 a plot was hatched to oust France's Cardinal\nRichelieu from power, a plot that became known as \u201cThe Day of the\nDupes.\u201d It almost succeeded, since it involved the upper echelons of\ngovernment, including the queen mother. But through luck and his\nown connivances, Richelieu survived.\n\nOne of die key conspirators was a man named Marillac, the\nkeeper of the seals. Richelieu could not imprison him without\nimplicating the queen modier, an extremely dangerous tactic, so he\ntargeted Marillac's brother, a marshal in the army. This man had no\ninvolvement in the plot. Richelieu, however, afraid that other\nconspiracies might be in the air, especially in the army, decided to set\nan example. He tried the brother on trumped-up charges and had him\nexecuted. In this way he indirectly punished the real perpetrator, who\nhad thought himself protected, and warned any future conspirators that\nhe would not shrink from sacrificing the innocent to protect his own\npower.\n\nIn fact it is often wise to choose the most innocent victim possible\nas a sacrificial goat. Such people will not be powerful enough to fight\nyou, and their naive protests may be seen as protesting too muchmay\nbe seen, in other words, as a sign of their guilt. Be careful, however,\nnot to create a martyr. It is important that you remain the victim, the\npoor leader betrayed\n\n\nby the incompetence of those around you. If the scapegoat\nappears too weak and his punishment too cruel, you may end up the\nvictim of your own device. Sometimes you should find a more\npowerful scapegoatone who will elicit less sympatiry in the long run.\nIn this vein, history has time and again shown the value of using a\nclose associate as a scapegoat. This is known as the \u201cfall of the\n\u2018avorite.\u201d Most kings had a personal favorite at court, a man whom\nthey singled out, sometimes for no apparent reason, and lavished with\navors and attention. But this court favorite could serve as a convenient\nscapegoat in case of a threat to the king's reputation. The public would\nreadily believe in the scapegoat's guiltwhy would the king sacrifice his\n\u2018avorite unless he were guilty And the other courtiers, resentful of the\n\u2018avorite anyway, would rejoice at his downfall. The king, meanwhile,\nwould rid himself of a man who by that time had probably learned too\nmuch about him, perhaps becoming arrogant and even disdainful of\nhim. Choosing a close associate as a scapegoat has the same value as\nthe \u201cfall of the favorite.\u201d You may lose a friend or aide, but in the long-\nterm scheme of things, it is more important to hide your mistakes than\nto hold on to someone who one day will probably turn against you.\nBesides, you can always find a new favorite to take his place.\n\nImage: The Innocent Goat. On the Day of Atonement, the high\npriest brings the goat into the temple, places his hands on its head, and\nconfesses die people's sins, transferring guilt to the guiltless beast,\nwhich is then led to the wilderness and abandoned, the people's sins\n\nand blame vanishing with him.\n\nAuthority: Folly consists not in committing Folly, but in being\nincapable of concealing it. All men make mistakes, but the wise\nconceal die blunders they have made, while fools make them public.\nReputation depends more on what is hidden than on what is seen. If\nyou can't be good, be careful.

You need a\ncat's-paw someone who does the dirty, dangerous work for you. The\n\n\ncat's-paw grabs what you need, hurts whom you need hurt, and keeps\npeople from noticing that you are the one responsible.

One of the\ndaughters, Berenice, emerged as the leader of the rebellion, and to\nensure that she would now rule Egypt alone, she imprisoned her other\nsisters and murdered her own husband. This may have been necessary\nas a practical step to secure her rule. But that a member of the royal\nfamily, a queen no less, would so overtly exact such violence on her\nown family horrified her subjects and stirred up powerful opposition.\nFour years later this opposition was able to return Ptolemy to power,\nand he promptly had Berenice and the other elder sisters beheaded.\n\nIn 51 B.C. Ptolemy died, leaving four remaining children as heirs.\nAs was the tradition in Egypt, the eldest son, Ptolemy XIII (only ten at\nthe time), married the elder sister, Cleopatra (now eighteen), and the\ncouple took the throne together as king and queen. None of the four\nchildren felt satisfied with this; everyone, including Cleopatra, wanted\nmore power. A struggle emerged between Cleopatra and Ptolemy, each\ntrying to push the other to the side.\n\nIn 48 B.C., with the help of a government faction that feared\nCleopatra's ambitions, Ptolemy was able to force his sister to flee the\ncountry, leaving himself as sole ruler. In exile, Cleopatra schemed. She\nwanted to rule alone and to restore Egypt to its past glory, a goal she\nfelt none of her other siblings could achieve; yet as long as they were\nalive, she could not reahze'her dream. And the example of Berenice\nhad made it clear that no one would serve a queen who was seen\nmurdering her own kind. Even Ptolemy XIII had not dared murder\nCleopatra, although he knew she would plot against him from abroad.\n\nWithin a year after Cleopatra's banishment, the Roman dictator\nJulius Caesar arrived in Egypt, determined to make the country a\nRoman colony. Cleopatra saw her chance: Reentering Egypt in\n\ndisguise, she traveled hundreds of miles to reach Caesar in Alexandria.\nLegend has it that she had\n\nherself smuggled into his presence rolled up inside a carpet,\nwhich was gracefully unfurled at his feet, revealing the young queen.\nCleopatra immediately went to work on the Roman. She appealed to\nhis love of spectacle and his interest in Egyptian history, and poured on\nher feminine charms. Caesar soon succumbed and restored Cleopatra\nto the throne.\n\nCleopatra's siblings seethedshe had outmaneuvered them.\nPtolemy XIII would not wait to see what happened next: From his\npalace in Alexandria, he summoned a great army to march on the city\nand attack Caesar. In response, Caesar immediately put Ptolemy and\nthe rest of the family under house arrest. But Cleopatra's younger sister\nArsinoe escaped from the palace and placed herself at the head of the\napproaching Egyptian troops, proclaiming herself queen of Egypt.\nNow Cleopatra finally saw her chance: She convinced Caesar to\nrelease Ptolemy from house arrest, under the agreement mat he would\nbroker a truce. Of course she knew he would do the oppositethat he\nwould fight Arsinoe for control of the Egyptian army. But this was to\nCleopatra's benefit, for it would divide the royal family. Better still, it\nwould give Caesar the chance to defeat and kill her siblings in batde.\n\nReinforced by troops from Rome, Caesar swiftly defeated the\nrebels. In the Egyptians' retreat, Ptolemy drowned in the Nile. Caesar\ncaptured Arsinoe and had her sent to Rome as a prisoner. He also\nexecuted the numerous enemies who had conspired against Cleopatra,\nand imprisoned others who had opposed her. To reinforce her position\nas uncontested queen, Cleopatra now married die only sibling left,\nPtolemy XIVonly eleven at die time, and the weakest of the lot. Four\nyears later Ptolemy mysteriously died, of poison.\n\nIn 41 B.C., Cleopatra employed on a second Roman leader, Marc\nAntony, the same tactics she had used so well on Julius Caesar. After\nseducing him, she hinted to him that her sister Arsinoe, still a prisoner\nin Rome, had conspired to destroy him. Marc Antony believed her and\nprompdy had Arsinoe executed, diereby getting rid of die last of the\nsiblings who had posed such a threat to Cleopatra.\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nLegend has it mat Cleopatra succeeded dirough her seductive\ncharms, but in reality her power came from an ability to get people to\ndo her bidding without realizing diey were being manipulated. Caesar\nand Antony not only rid her of her most dangerous siblingsPtolemy\nXIII and Arsinoe they decimated all of her enemies, in both the\ngovernment and the military. The two men became her cat's-paws.\nThey entered the fire for her, did the ugly but necessary work, while\nshielding her from appearing as the destroyer of her siblings and\nfellow Egyptians. And in the end, both men acquiesced to her desire to\nrule Egypt not as a Roman colony but as an independent allied\nkingdom. And they did all mis for her widiout realizing how she had\nmanipulated them. This was persuasion of the subdest and most\npowerful kind.\n\nand crammed it in his\n\njaw.\n\nNow came the shining\n\nMistress of the fane,\n\nAnd off in haste the\n\ntwo marauders\n\nscampered.\n\nTom for his share of\n\nthe plunder had the\n\npain,\n\nWhilst Pug his palate\n\nwith the dainties\n\npampered.\n\nFABLES,\n\nJean de La Fontaine, 1621-1695\n\nTHE CROtt'-IIKN.

Do\nnot mention it in front of anyone.\u201d Jamil went out into the street and\nbegan shouting at the top of his voice: \u201cDo you believe that Omar, son\nof al-Khattab, has not become a Muslim Well, do not believe that! I am\ntelling you that he has!\u201d\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II\n\nIn the late 1920s, civil war broke out in China as the Nationalist\nand Communist parties battled for control of the country. In 1927\nChiang Kai-shek, the Nationalist leader, vowed to kill every last\nCommunist, and over die next few years he nearly accomplished his\ntask, pushing his enemies hard until, in 1934-1935, he forced them into\nthe Long March, a six-thousand-mile retreat from the southeast to the\nremote northwest, dirough harsh terrain, in which most of their ranks\nwere decimated. In late 1936 Chiang planned one last offensive to\nwipe them out, but he was caught in a mutiny: His own soldiers\ncaptured him and turned him over to the Communists. Now he could\nonly expect the worst.\n\nMeanwhile, however, the Japanese began an invasion of China,\nand much to Chiang's surprise, instead of killing him the Communist\nleader, Mao Tse-tung, proposed a deal: The Communists would let him\ngo, and would recognize him as commander of their forces as well as\nhis, if he would agree to fight alongside them against dieir common\nenemy. Chiang had expected torture and execution; now he could not\nbelieve his luck. How soft these Reds had become. Without having to\nfight a rearguard action against die Communists, he knew he could\nbeat the Japanese, and then a few years down die line he would turn\naround and destroy the Reds with ease. He had nothing to lose and\neverything to gain by agreeing to their terms.\n\nThe Communists proceeded to fight die Japanese in their usual\nfashion, with hit-and-run guerrilla tactics, while the Nationalists fought\na more conventional war. Togetiier, after several years, they succeeded\nin evicting the Japanese. Now, however, Chiang finally understood\nwhat Mao had really planned. His own army had met die brunt of the\nJapanese artillery, was greatly weakened, and would take a few years\n\nto recover. The Communists, meanwhile, had not only avoided any\ndirect hits from the Japanese, they had used the time to recoup their\nstrength, and to spread out\n\nand gain pockets of influence all over China. As soon as the war\nagainst the Japanese ended, the civil war started againbut this time the\nCommunists enveloped the weakened Nationalists and slowly beat\nthem into submission. The Japanese had served as Mao's cat's-paw,\ninadvertentiy ploughing the fields for die Communists and making\npossible dieir victory over Chiang Kai-shek.\n\nInterpretation\n\nMost leaders who had taken as powerful an enemy as Chiang Kai-\nshek prisoner would have made sure to kill him. But in doing so they\nwould have lost the chance Mao exploited. Without the experienced\nChiang as leader of the Nationalists, the fight to drive die Japanese out\nmight have lasted much longer, widi devastating results. Mao was far\ntoo clever to let anger spoil the chance to kill two birds with one stone.\nIn essence, Mao used two cat's-paws to help him attain total victory.\nFirst, he cleverly baited Chiang into taking charge of the war against\ndie Japanese. Mao knew the Nationalists led by Chiang would do most\nof the hard fighting and would succeed in pushing the Japanese out of\nChina, if tiiey did not have to concern themselves with fighting the\nCommunists at the same time. The Nationalists, then, were the first\ncat's-paw, used to evict the Japanese. But Mao also knew that in die\nprocess of leading the war against the invaders, the Japanese artillery\nand air support would decimate the conventional forces of the\nNationalists, doing damage it could take the Communists decades to\ninflict. Why waste time and lives if die Japanese could do die job\nquickly It was this wise policy of using one cat's-paw after another that\nallowed the Communists to prevail.\n\nThere are two uses of the cat's-paw: to save appearances, as\nCleopatra did, and to save energy and effort. The latter case in\nparticular demands that you plan several moves in advance, realizing\nthat a temporary move backward (letting Chiang go, say) can lead to a\ngiant leap forward. If you are temporarily weakened and need time to\nrecover, it will often serve you well to use those around you botii as a\nscreen to hide your intentions and as a cat's-paw to do your work for\nyou. Look for a powerful third party who shares an enemy with you (if\n\n\nor different reasons), then take advantage of their superior power to\ndeal blows which would have cost you much more energy, since you\nare weaker. You can even gendy guide them into hostilities. Always\nsearch out die overly aggressive as potential cat's-pawsdiey are often\nmore than willing to get into a fight, and you can choose just the right\n\u2018ight for your purposes.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW III\n\nKuriyama Daizen was an adept of Cha-no-yu (Hot Water for Tea,\nthe Japanese tea ceremony) and a student of the teachings of the great\ntea master Sen no Rikyu.

He was going to India, the land\nfrom which the bird came, and asked it whether he could bring\nanything back for it. The bird asked for its freedom, but was refused.\nSo he asked the merchant to visit a jungle in India and announce his\ncaptivity to the free birds who were there. The merchant did so, and no\nsooner had he spoken when a wild bird, just like his own, fell senseless\nout of a tree on to the ground. The merchant thought that this must be a\nrelative of his own bird, and felt sad that he should have caused this\ndeath. When he got home, the bird asked him whether he had brought\ngood news from India. \u201cNo,\u201dsaid the merchant, \"1 fear that my news is\nbad. One of\n\nrelative who had fallen into debt. But although Soemon had\nmanaged to bail out his relative, he had simply displaced the burden\nonto himself. Daizen knew Soemon wellhe neither cared nor\nunderstood much about money, and could easily get into trouble\nthrough slowness in repaying the loan, which had been made by a\nwealthy merchant called Kawachiya Sanemon. Yet if Daizen offered to\nhelp Soemon pay back the loan, he would refuse, out of pride, and\nmight even be offended.\n\nOne day Daizen visited his friend, and after touring the garden\nand looking at Soemon's prized peonies, they retired to his reception\nroom. Here Daizen saw a painting by the master Kano Tennyu. \u201cAh,\u201d\nDaizen exclaimed, \u201ca splendid piece of painting. ... I don't know when\nI have seen anything I like better.\u201d After several more bouts of praise,\nSoemon had no choice: \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201csince you like it so much, I\nhope you will do me the favor of accepting it.\u201d\n\nAt first Daizen refused, but when Soemon insisted he gave in.\nThe next day Soemon in turn received a package from Daizen. Inside it\n\n\nwas a beautiful and delicate vase, which Daizen, in an accompanying\nnote, asked his friend to accept as a token of his appreciation for the\npainting that Soemon had so graciously given him the day before. He\nexplained that the vase had been made by Sen no Rikyu himself, and\nbore an inscription from Emperor Hideyoshi. If Soemon did not care\nfor the vase, Daizen suggested, he might make a gift of it to an\nadherent of Cha-no-yuperhaps the merchant Kawachiya Sanemon,\nwho had often expressed a desire to possess it. \u201cI hear,\u201d Daizen\ncontinued, \u201che has a fine piece of fancy paper [the 300-ryo I.0.U.]\nwhich you would much like. It is possible you might arrange an\nexchange.\u201d\n\nRealizing what his gracious friend was up to, Soemon took the\nvase to the wealthy lender. \u201cHowever did you get this,\u201d exclaimed\nSanemon, when Soemon showed him the vase. \u201cI have often heard of\nit, but this is the first time I have ever seen it. It is such a treasure that\nit is never allowed outside the gate!\u201d He instandy offered to exchange\nthe debt note for the flower vase, and to give Soemon 300 ryo more on\ntop of it. But Soemon, who did not care for money, only wanted the\ndebt note back, and Sanemon gladly gave it to him. Then Soemon\nimmediately hurried to Daizen's house to thank him for his clever\nsupport.\n\nInterpretation\n\nKuriyama Daizen understood that the granting of a favor is never\nsimple: If it is done with fuss and obviousness, its receiver feels\nburdened by an obligation. This may give the doer a certain power, but\nit is a power that will eventually self-destruct, for it will stir up\nresentment and resistance. A favor done indirecdy and elegantly has\nten times more power. Daizen knew a direct approach would only have\noffended Soemon. By letting his friend give him the painting, however,\nhe made Soemon feel that he too had pleased his friend with a gift. In\nthe end, all three parties emerged from the encounter feeling fulfilled\nin their own way.\n\nIn essence, Daizen made himself the cat's-paw, the tool to take the\nchestnuts out of the fire. He must have felt some pain in losing the\nvase, but he gained not only the painting but, more important, the\npower of the courtier. The courtier uses his gloved hand to soften any\nblows against him, disguise his scars, and make the act of rescue more\n\nelegant and clean. By helping others, the courtier eventually helps\nhimself. Daizen's example provides the paradigm for every favor done\nbetween friends and peers: never impose your favors. Search out ways\nto make yourself the cat's-paw, indirectly extricating your friends from\ndistress without imposing yourself or making them feel obligated to\nyou.\n\nOne should not be too straightforward. Go and see the forest. The\nstraight trees are cut down, the crooked ones are left standing.\n\nKautilya, Indian philosopher, third century B.C.\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nAs a leader you may imagine that constant diligence, and the\nappearance of working harder than anyone else, signify power.\nActually, though, they have the opposite effect: They imply weakness.\nWhy are you working so hard Perhaps you are incompetent, and have\nto put in extra effort just to keep up; perhaps you are one of those\npeople who does not know how to delegate, and has to meddle in\neverything. The truly powerful, on the other hand, seem never to be in\na hurry or overburdened. While others work their fingers to the bone,\nthey take their leisure. They know how to find the right people to put\nin the effort while they save their energy and keep their hands out of\nthe fire. Similarly, you may believe that by taking on the dirty work\nyourself, involving yourself directly in unpleasant actions, you impose\nyour power and instill fear. In fact you make yourself look ugly, and\nabusive of your high position. Truly powerful people keep their hands\nclean. Only good things surround them, and die only announcements\nthey make are of glorious achievements.\n\nYou will often find it necessary, of course, to expend energy, or to\neffect an evil but necessary action. But you must never appear to be\nthis action's agent. Find a cat's-paw. Develop the arts of finding, using,\nand, in time, getting rid of these people when their cat's-paw role has\nbeen fulfilled.\n\nOn the eve of an important river battle, the great third-century\nChinese strategist Chuko Liang found himself falsely accused of\nsecretly working for die other side.

Instead of trying to manufacture\nthe arrows, an impossible task, Liang took a dozen boats and had\n\nbundles of straw lashed to their sides.

The key to planning such a\nstrategy is the ability to think far ahead, to imagine ways in which\nother people can be baited into doing the job for you.\n\nAn essential element in making this strategy work is to disguise\nyour goal, shrouding it in mystery, like the strange enemy boats\nappearing dimly in the mist. When your rivals cannot be sure what you\nare after, they will react in ways that often work against them in the\nlong run. In fact they will become your cat's-paws. If you disguise\nyour intentions, it is much easier to guide them into moves mat\naccomplish exacdy what you want done, but prefer not to do yourself.\nThis may require planning several moves in advance, like a billiard\n\nball that bounces off the sides a few times before heading into the right\npocket.\n\nThe early-twentieth-century American con artist Yellow Kid Weil\nknew that no matter how skillfully he homed in on the perfect wealthy\nsucker, if he, a stranger, approached mis man directly, the sucker might\nbecome suspicious. So Weil would find someone the sucker already\nknew to serve as a cat's-pawsomeone lower on the totem pole who was\nhimself an unlikely target, and would therefore be less suspicious. Weil\nwould interest mis man in a scheme promising incredible weahh.\nConvinced the scheme was for real, the cat's-paw would often suggest,\nwithout prompting, that his boss or wealthy friend should get involved:\nHaving more cash to invest, this man would increase the size of the\npot, making bigger bucks for all concerned. The cat's-paw would then\ninvolve the wealthy sucker who had been Weil's target all along, but\nwho would not suspect a trap, since it was his trusty subordinate who\nhad roped him in. Devices like mis are often the best way to approach\na person of power: Use an associate or subordinate to hook you up\nwith your primary target. The cat's-paw establishes your credibility\nand shields you from the unsavory appearance of being too pushy in\nyour courtship.\n\nThe easiest and most effective way to use a cat's-paw is often to\nplant information with him that he will then spread to your primary\ntarget. False or planted information is a powerful tool, especially if\nspread by a dupe whom no one suspects. You will find it very easy to\nplay innocent and disguise yourself as the source.\n\nThe strategic therapist Dr. Milton H. Erickson would often\nencounter among his patients a married couple in which the wife\nwanted the therapy but the husband absolutely refused it. Rather than\nwasting energy trying to deal with the man direcdy, Dr. Erickson\nwould see the wife alone, and as she talked he would interject\ninterpretations of the husband's behavior that he knew would rile the\nhusband up if he heard them. Sure enough, die wife would tell her\nhusband what the doctor had said. After a few weeks die\n\nhusband would be so furious he would insist on joining his wife\nin the sessions so he could set the doctor straight.\n\nFinally, you may well find cases in which deliberately offering\nyourself as the cat's-paw will ultimately gain you great power. This is\n\n\nthe ruse of the perfect courtier. Its symbol is Sir Walter Raleigh, who\nonce placed his own cloak on the muddy ground so that Queen\nElizabeth would not sully her shoes. As the instrument that protects a\nmaster or peer from unpleasantness or danger, you gain immense\nrespect, which sooner or later will pay dividends. And remember: If\nyou can make your assistance subde and gracious rather than boastful\nand burdensome, your recompense will be that much die more\nsatisfying and powerful.\n\nImage: The Cat's-Paw.\n\nIt has long claws to grab\n\nthings. It is soft and\n\npadded. Take hold of the cat\n\nand use its paw to pluck\n\nthings out of the fire, to claw\n\nyour enemy, to play with the\n\nmouse before devouring it.\n\nSometimes you hurt the\n\ncat, but most often it\n\ndoesn't feel a thing.\n\nAuthority: Do everything pleasant yourself, everything unpleasant\nthrough third parties.

Let only the good come from you and the\nevil from others. (Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nThe cat's-paw and the scapegoat must be used with extreme\ncaution and delicacy. They are like screens that hide your own\ninvolvement in dirty work from the public; if at any moment the screen\nis lifted and you are seen as the manipulator, the puppet master, the\nwhole dynamic turns aroundyour hand will be seen everywhere, and\nyou will be blamed for misfortunes you may have had nothing to do\nwith. Once the truth is revealed, events will snowball beyond your\ncontrol.\n\nIn 1572, Queen Catherine de' Medicis of France conspired to do\naway with Gaspard de Coligny, an admiral in the French navy and a\nleading member of the Huguenot (French Protestant) community.\nColigny was close to Catherine's son, Charles IX, and she feared his\n\ngrowing influence on the young king. So she arranged for a member of\nthe Guise family, one of the most powerful royal clans in France, to\nassassinate him.\n\nSecretly, however, Catherine had another plan: She wanted the\nHuguenots to blame the Guises for killing one of their leaders, and to\ntake revenge. With one blow, she would erase or injure two threatening\nrivals, Coligny and the Guise family. Yet both plans went awry. The\nassassin missed his target, only wounding Coligny; knowing Catherine\nas his enemy, he strongly suspected it was she who had set up the\nattack on him, and he told the king so. Eventually the failed\nassassination and the arguments that ensued from it set off a chain of\nevents that led to a bloody civil war between Catholics and Protestants,\nculminating in the horrifying Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Eve, in\nwhich thousands of Protestants were killed.\n\nIf you have to use a cat's-paw or a scapegoat in an action of great\nconsequence, be very careful: Too much can go wrong. It is often\nwiser to use such dupes in more innocent endeavors, where mistakes\nor miscalculations will cause no serious harm.\n\nFinally, there are moments when it is advantageous to not\ndisguise your involvement or responsibility, but rather to take the\nblame yourself for some mistake. If you have power and are secure in\nit, you should sometimes play the penitent: With a sorrowful look, you\nask for forgiveness from those weaker than you. It is the ploy of the\nking who makes a show of his own sacrifices for die good of die\npeople. Similarly, upon occasion you may want to appear as the agent\nof punishment in order to instill fear and trembling in your\nsubordinates. Instead of the cat's-paw you show your own mighty hand\nas a threatening gesture. Play such a card sparingly. If you play it too\noften, fear will turn into resentment and hatred. Before you know it,\nsuch emotions will spark a vigorous opposition that will someday\nbring you down. Get in the habit of using a cat's-pawit is far safer.\n\n'.

Seeking to\nextend his power base and to rid himself of the last of his rivals, Ts'ao\nTs'ao began a campaign to take control of the strategically vital Central\nPlain. During the siege of a key city, he slightly miscalculated the\ntiming for supplies of grain to arrive from the capital. As he waited for\nthe shipment to come in, die army ran low on food, and Ts'ao Ts'ao\nwas forced to order the chief of commissariat to reduce its rations.\n\nTs'ao Ts'ao kept a tight rein on the army, and ran a network of\ninformers. His spies soon reported that the men were complaining,\ngrumbling that he was living well while diey themselves had barely\nenough to eat. Perhaps Ts'ao Ts'ao was keeping die food for himself,\nthey murmured. If the grumbling spread, Ts'ao Ts'ao could have a\nmutiny on his hands. He summoned die chief of commissariat to his\ntent.\n\n\u201cI want to ask you to lend me something, and you must not\nrefuse,\u201d Ts'ao Ts'ao told the chief. \u201cWhat is it\u201d the chief replied. \u201cI\nwant the loan of your head to show to the troops,\u201d said Ts'ao Ts'ao.\n\u201cBut I've done nodiing wrong!\u201d cried the chief. \u201cI know,\u201d said Ts'ao\nTs'ao with a sigh, \u201cbut if I do not put you to death, there will be a\nmutiny.

Seeing his head on public\ndisplay, die soldiers stopped grumbling.

A.D. 155-220\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II\n\nFor several years Cesare Borgia campaigned to gain control of\nlarge parts of Italy in the name of his father, Pope Alexander. In the\nyear 1500 he managed to take Romagna, in northern Italy. The region\nhad for years been ruled by a series of greedy masters who had\nplundered its wealtii for themselves. Without police or any disciplining\nforce, it had descended into lawlessness, whole areas being ruled by\nrobbers and feuding families. To establish order, Cesare appointed a\nlieutenant general of die region Remirro de Oreo, \u201ca cruel and\nvigorous man,\u201d according to Niccolo Machiavelli. Cesare gave de\nOreo absolute powers.\n\nWith energy and violence, de Oreo established a severe, brutal\njustice in Romagna, and soon rid it of almost all of its lawless\nelements. But in his zeal he sometimes went too far, and after a couple\nof years the local population resented and even hated him. In\nDecember of 1502, Cesare took decisive action. He first let it be\nknown that he had not approved of de Oreo's cruel and violent deeds,\n\nwhich stemmed from the lieutenant's brutal nature. Then, on December\n22, he imprisoned de Oreo in the town of Ce-sena, and the day after\nChristmas the townspeople awoke to find a strange spectacle in the\nmiddle of the piazza: de Oreo's headless body, dressed in a lavish suit\nwith a purple cape, die head impaled beside it on a pike, the bloody\nknife and executioner's block laid out beside the head. As Machiavelli\nconcluded his comments on the affair, \u201cThe ferocity of this scene left\nthe people at once stunned and satisfied.\u201d\n\nInterpretation\n\nCesare Borgia was a master player in the game of power. Always\nplanning several moves ahead, he set his opponents die cleverest traps.\nFor this Machiavelli honored him above all others in The Prince.\n\nCesare foresaw the future with amazing clarity in Romagna: Only\nbrutal justice would bring order to the region. The process would take\nseveral years, and at first the people would welcome it. But it would\nsoon make many enemies, and the citizens would come to resent the\nimposition of such unforgiving justice, especially by outsiders. Cesare\nhimself, then, could not be seen as the agent of this justicethe people's\nhatred would cause too many problems in the future. And so he chose\nthe one man who could do the dirty work, knowing in advance that\nonce the task was done he would have to display de Oreo's head on a\npike. The scapegoat in this case had been planned from the beginning.\n\nWith Ts'ao Ts'ao, the scapegoat was an entirely innocent man; in\nthe Romagna, he was the offensive weapon in Cesare's arsenal that let\nhim get the dirty work done without bloodying his own hands. With\nthis second kind of scapegoat it is wise to separate yourself from the\nhatchet man at some point, either leaving him dangling in the wind or,\nlike Cesare, even making yourself the one to bring him to justice. Not\nonly are you free of involvement in the problem, you can appear as the\none who cleaned it up.\n\nThe Athenians regularly maintained a number of degraded and\nuseless\n\nbeings at the public expense; and when any calamity, such as\nplague,\n\ndrought, or famine, befell the city . . . [these scapegoats] were led\nabout. . .\n\nand then sacrificed, apparently by being stoned outside the city.\n\n\nThe Golden Bough, Sir James George Frazer, 1854-1941\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nThe use of scapegoats is as old as civilization itself, and examples\nof it can be found in cultures around the world. The main idea behind\nthese sacrifices is the shifting of guilt and sin to an outside\nfigureobject, animal, or manwhich is then banished or destroyed. The\nHebrews used to take a live goat (hence the term \u201cscapegoat\u201d) upon\nwhose head ihe priest would lay both hands while confessing the sins\nof the Children of Israel. Having thus had those sins transferred to it,\nthe beast would be led away and abandoned in the wilderness. With the\nAthenians and the Aztecs, the scapegoat was human, often a person\nfed and raised for the purpose. Since famine and plague were drought\nto be visited on humans by the gods, in punishment for wrongdoing,\nthe people suffered not only from the famine and plague themselves\nbut from blame and guilt. They freed themselves of guilt by\ntransferring it to an innocent person, whose death was intended to\nsatisfy the divine powers and banish the evil from their midst.\n\nIt is an extremely human response to not look inward after a\nmistake or crime, but rather to look outward and to affix blame and\nguilt on a convenient object. When the plague was ravaging Thebes,\nOedipus looked everywhere for its cause, everywhere except inside\nhimself and his own sin of incest, which had so offended the gods and\noccasioned the plague. This profound need to exteriorize one's guilt, to\nproject it on another person or object, has an immense power, which\nthe clever know how to harness. Sac-\n\nrifice is a ritual, perhaps the most ancient ritual of all; ritual too is\na well-spring of power. In the killing of de Oreo, note Cesare's\nsymbolic and ritualistic display of his body. By framing it in this\ndramatic way he focused guilt outward. The citizens of Romagna\nresponded instantly. Because it comes so naturally to us to look\noutward rather than inward, we readily accept the scapegoat's guilt.\n\nThe bloody sacrifice of the scapegoat seems a barbaric relic of the\npast, but the practice lives on to this day, if indirectly and\nsymbolically; since power depends on appearances, and those in power\nmust seem never to make mistakes, the use of scapegoats is as popular\nas ever. What modern leader will take responsibility for his blunders\nHe searches out others to blame, a scapegoat to sacrifice. When Mao\n\nTse-tung's Cultural Revolution failed miserably, he made no apologies\nor excuses to the Chinese people; instead, like Ts'ao Ts'ao before him,\nhe offered up scapegoats, including his own personal secretary and\nhigh-ranking member of the Party, Ch'en Po-ta.\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt had a reputation for honesty and fairness.\nThroughout his career, however, he faced many situations in which\nbeing the nice guy would have spelled political disasteryet he could\nnot be seen as the agent of any foul play. For twenty years, then, his\nsecretary, Louis Howe, played the role de Oreo had. He handled the\nbackroom deals, the manipulation of the press, the underhanded\ncampaign maneuvers. And whenever a mistake was committed, or a\ndirty trick contradicting Roosevelt's carefully crafted image became\npublic, Howe served as the scapegoat, and never complained.\n\nBesides conveniently shifting blame, a scapegoat can serve as a\nwarning to others. In 1631 a plot was hatched to oust France's Cardinal\nRichelieu from power, a plot that became known as \u201cThe Day of the\nDupes.\u201d It almost succeeded, since it involved the upper echelons of\ngovernment, including the queen mother. But through luck and his\nown connivances, Richelieu survived.\n\nOne of die key conspirators was a man named Marillac, the\nkeeper of the seals. Richelieu could not imprison him without\nimplicating the queen modier, an extremely dangerous tactic, so he\ntargeted Marillac's brother, a marshal in the army. This man had no\ninvolvement in the plot. Richelieu, however, afraid that other\nconspiracies might be in the air, especially in the army, decided to set\nan example. He tried the brother on trumped-up charges and had him\nexecuted. In this way he indirectly punished the real perpetrator, who\nhad thought himself protected, and warned any future conspirators that\nhe would not shrink from sacrificing the innocent to protect his own\npower.\n\nIn fact it is often wise to choose the most innocent victim possible\nas a sacrificial goat. Such people will not be powerful enough to fight\nyou, and their naive protests may be seen as protesting too muchmay\nbe seen, in other words, as a sign of their guilt. Be careful, however,\nnot to create a martyr. It is important that you remain the victim, the\npoor leader betrayed\n\n\nby the incompetence of those around you. If the scapegoat\nappears too weak and his punishment too cruel, you may end up the\nvictim of your own device. Sometimes you should find a more\npowerful scapegoatone who will elicit less sympatiry in the long run.\nIn this vein, history has time and again shown the value of using a\nclose associate as a scapegoat. This is known as the \u201cfall of the\n\u2018avorite.\u201d Most kings had a personal favorite at court, a man whom\nthey singled out, sometimes for no apparent reason, and lavished with\navors and attention. But this court favorite could serve as a convenient\nscapegoat in case of a threat to the king's reputation. The public would\nreadily believe in the scapegoat's guiltwhy would the king sacrifice his\n\u2018avorite unless he were guilty And the other courtiers, resentful of the\n\u2018avorite anyway, would rejoice at his downfall. The king, meanwhile,\nwould rid himself of a man who by that time had probably learned too\nmuch about him, perhaps becoming arrogant and even disdainful of\nhim. Choosing a close associate as a scapegoat has the same value as\nthe \u201cfall of the favorite.\u201d You may lose a friend or aide, but in the long-\nterm scheme of things, it is more important to hide your mistakes than\nto hold on to someone who one day will probably turn against you.\nBesides, you can always find a new favorite to take his place.\n\nImage: The Innocent Goat. On the Day of Atonement, the high\npriest brings the goat into the temple, places his hands on its head, and\nconfesses die people's sins, transferring guilt to the guiltless beast,\nwhich is then led to the wilderness and abandoned, the people's sins\n\nand blame vanishing with him.\n\nAuthority: Folly consists not in committing Folly, but in being\nincapable of concealing it. All men make mistakes, but the wise\nconceal die blunders they have made, while fools make them public.\nReputation depends more on what is hidden than on what is seen.

One of the\ndaughters, Berenice, emerged as the leader of the rebellion, and to\nensure that she would now rule Egypt alone, she imprisoned her other\nsisters and murdered her own husband. This may have been necessary\nas a practical step to secure her rule. But that a member of the royal\nfamily, a queen no less, would so overtly exact such violence on her\nown family horrified her subjects and stirred up powerful opposition.\nFour years later this opposition was able to return Ptolemy to power,\nand he promptly had Berenice and the other elder sisters beheaded.\n\nIn 51 B.C. Ptolemy died, leaving four remaining children as heirs.\nAs was the tradition in Egypt, the eldest son, Ptolemy XIII (only ten at\nthe time), married the elder sister, Cleopatra (now eighteen), and the\ncouple took the throne together as king and queen. None of the four\nchildren felt satisfied with this; everyone, including Cleopatra, wanted\nmore power. A struggle emerged between Cleopatra and Ptolemy, each\ntrying to push the other to the side.\n\nIn 48 B.C., with the help of a government faction that feared\nCleopatra's ambitions, Ptolemy was able to force his sister to flee the\ncountry, leaving himself as sole ruler. In exile, Cleopatra schemed. She\nwanted to rule alone and to restore Egypt to its past glory, a goal she\nfelt none of her other siblings could achieve; yet as long as they were\nalive, she could not reahze'her dream. And the example of Berenice\nhad made it clear that no one would serve a queen who was seen\nmurdering her own kind. Even Ptolemy XIII had not dared murder\nCleopatra, although he knew she would plot against him from abroad.\n\nWithin a year after Cleopatra's banishment, the Roman dictator\nJulius Caesar arrived in Egypt, determined to make the country a\nRoman colony. Cleopatra saw her chance: Reentering Egypt in\n\ndisguise, she traveled hundreds of miles to reach Caesar in Alexandria.\nLegend has it that she had\n\nherself smuggled into his presence rolled up inside a carpet,\nwhich was gracefully unfurled at his feet, revealing the young queen.\nCleopatra immediately went to work on the Roman. She appealed to\nhis love of spectacle and his interest in Egyptian history, and poured on\nher feminine charms. Caesar soon succumbed and restored Cleopatra\nto the throne.\n\nCleopatra's siblings seethedshe had outmaneuvered them.\nPtolemy XIII would not wait to see what happened next: From his\npalace in Alexandria, he summoned a great army to march on the city\nand attack Caesar. In response, Caesar immediately put Ptolemy and\nthe rest of the family under house arrest. But Cleopatra's younger sister\nArsinoe escaped from the palace and placed herself at the head of the\napproaching Egyptian troops, proclaiming herself queen of Egypt.\nNow Cleopatra finally saw her chance: She convinced Caesar to\nrelease Ptolemy from house arrest, under the agreement mat he would\nbroker a truce. Of course she knew he would do the oppositethat he\nwould fight Arsinoe for control of the Egyptian army. But this was to\nCleopatra's benefit, for it would divide the royal family. Better still, it\nwould give Caesar the chance to defeat and kill her siblings in batde.\n\nReinforced by troops from Rome, Caesar swiftly defeated the\nrebels. In the Egyptians' retreat, Ptolemy drowned in the Nile. Caesar\ncaptured Arsinoe and had her sent to Rome as a prisoner. He also\nexecuted the numerous enemies who had conspired against Cleopatra,\nand imprisoned others who had opposed her. To reinforce her position\nas uncontested queen, Cleopatra now married die only sibling left,\nPtolemy XIVonly eleven at die time, and the weakest of the lot. Four\nyears later Ptolemy mysteriously died, of poison.\n\nIn 41 B.C., Cleopatra employed on a second Roman leader, Marc\nAntony, the same tactics she had used so well on Julius Caesar.

Do\nnot mention it in front of anyone.\u201d Jamil went out into the street and\nbegan shouting at the top of his voice: \u201cDo you believe that Omar, son\nof al-Khattab, has not become a Muslim Well, do not believe that! I am\ntelling you that he has!\u201d\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II\n\nIn the late 1920s, civil war broke out in China as the Nationalist\nand Communist parties battled for control of the country. In 1927\nChiang Kai-shek, the Nationalist leader, vowed to kill every last\nCommunist, and over die next few years he nearly accomplished his\ntask, pushing his enemies hard until, in 1934-1935, he forced them into\nthe Long March, a six-thousand-mile retreat from the southeast to the\nremote northwest, dirough harsh terrain, in which most of their ranks\nwere decimated. In late 1936 Chiang planned one last offensive to\nwipe them out, but he was caught in a mutiny: His own soldiers\ncaptured him and turned him over to the Communists. Now he could\nonly expect the worst.\n\nMeanwhile, however, the Japanese began an invasion of China,\nand much to Chiang's surprise, instead of killing him the Communist\nleader, Mao Tse-tung, proposed a deal: The Communists would let him\ngo, and would recognize him as commander of their forces as well as\nhis, if he would agree to fight alongside them against dieir common\nenemy. Chiang had expected torture and execution; now he could not\nbelieve his luck. How soft these Reds had become. Without having to\nfight a rearguard action against die Communists, he knew he could\nbeat the Japanese, and then a few years down die line he would turn\naround and destroy the Reds with ease. He had nothing to lose and\neverything to gain by agreeing to their terms.\n\nThe Communists proceeded to fight die Japanese in their usual\nfashion, with hit-and-run guerrilla tactics, while the Nationalists fought\na more conventional war. Togetiier, after several years, they succeeded\nin evicting the Japanese. Now, however, Chiang finally understood\nwhat Mao had really planned. His own army had met die brunt of the\nJapanese artillery, was greatly weakened, and would take a few years\n\nto recover. The Communists, meanwhile, had not only avoided any\ndirect hits from the Japanese, they had used the time to recoup their\nstrength, and to spread out\n\nand gain pockets of influence all over China. As soon as the war\nagainst the Japanese ended, the civil war started againbut this time the\nCommunists enveloped the weakened Nationalists and slowly beat\nthem into submission. The Japanese had served as Mao's cat's-paw,\ninadvertentiy ploughing the fields for die Communists and making\npossible dieir victory over Chiang Kai-shek.\n\nInterpretation\n\nMost leaders who had taken as powerful an enemy as Chiang Kai-\nshek prisoner would have made sure to kill him. But in doing so they\nwould have lost the chance Mao exploited. Without the experienced\nChiang as leader of the Nationalists, the fight to drive die Japanese out\nmight have lasted much longer, widi devastating results. Mao was far\ntoo clever to let anger spoil the chance to kill two birds with one stone.\nIn essence, Mao used two cat's-paws to help him attain total victory.\nFirst, he cleverly baited Chiang into taking charge of the war against\ndie Japanese. Mao knew the Nationalists led by Chiang would do most\nof the hard fighting and would succeed in pushing the Japanese out of\nChina, if tiiey did not have to concern themselves with fighting the\nCommunists at the same time. The Nationalists, then, were the first\ncat's-paw, used to evict the Japanese. But Mao also knew that in die\nprocess of leading the war against the invaders, the Japanese artillery\nand air support would decimate the conventional forces of the\nNationalists, doing damage it could take the Communists decades to\ninflict. Why waste time and lives if die Japanese could do die job\nquickly It was this wise policy of using one cat's-paw after another that\nallowed the Communists to prevail.\n\nThere are two uses of the cat's-paw: to save appearances, as\nCleopatra did, and to save energy and effort. The latter case in\nparticular demands that you plan several moves in advance, realizing\nthat a temporary move backward (letting Chiang go, say) can lead to a\ngiant leap forward. If you are temporarily weakened and need time to\nrecover, it will often serve you well to use those around you botii as a\nscreen to hide your intentions and as a cat's-paw to do your work for\nyou. Look for a powerful third party who shares an enemy with you (if\n\n\nor different reasons), then take advantage of their superior power to\ndeal blows which would have cost you much more energy, since you\nare weaker. You can even gendy guide them into hostilities. Always\nsearch out die overly aggressive as potential cat's-pawsdiey are often\nmore than willing to get into a fight, and you can choose just the right\n\u2018ight for your purposes.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW III\n\nKuriyama Daizen was an adept of Cha-no-yu (Hot Water for Tea,\nthe Japanese tea ceremony) and a student of the teachings of the great\ntea master Sen no Rikyu.

He was going to India, the land\nfrom which the bird came, and asked it whether he could bring\nanything back for it. The bird asked for its freedom, but was refused.\nSo he asked the merchant to visit a jungle in India and announce his\ncaptivity to the free birds who were there. The merchant did so, and no\nsooner had he spoken when a wild bird, just like his own, fell senseless\nout of a tree on to the ground. The merchant thought that this must be a\nrelative of his own bird, and felt sad that he should have caused this\ndeath. When he got home, the bird asked him whether he had brought\ngood news from India. \u201cNo,\u201dsaid the merchant, \"1 fear that my news is\nbad. One of\n\nrelative who had fallen into debt. But although Soemon had\nmanaged to bail out his relative, he had simply displaced the burden\nonto himself. Daizen knew Soemon wellhe neither cared nor\nunderstood much about money, and could easily get into trouble\nthrough slowness in repaying the loan, which had been made by a\nwealthy merchant called Kawachiya Sanemon. Yet if Daizen offered to\nhelp Soemon pay back the loan, he would refuse, out of pride, and\nmight even be offended.\n\nOne day Daizen visited his friend, and after touring the garden\nand looking at Soemon's prized peonies, they retired to his reception\nroom. Here Daizen saw a painting by the master Kano Tennyu. \u201cAh,\u201d\nDaizen exclaimed, \u201ca splendid piece of painting. ... I don't know when\nI have seen anything I like better.\u201d After several more bouts of praise,\nSoemon had no choice: \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201csince you like it so much, I\nhope you will do me the favor of accepting it.\u201d\n\nAt first Daizen refused, but when Soemon insisted he gave in.\nThe next day Soemon in turn received a package from Daizen. Inside it\n\n\nwas a beautiful and delicate vase, which Daizen, in an accompanying\nnote, asked his friend to accept as a token of his appreciation for the\npainting that Soemon had so graciously given him the day before. He\nexplained that the vase had been made by Sen no Rikyu himself, and\nbore an inscription from Emperor Hideyoshi. If Soemon did not care\nfor the vase, Daizen suggested, he might make a gift of it to an\nadherent of Cha-no-yuperhaps the merchant Kawachiya Sanemon,\nwho had often expressed a desire to possess it. \u201cI hear,\u201d Daizen\ncontinued, \u201che has a fine piece of fancy paper [the 300-ryo I.0.U.]\nwhich you would much like. It is possible you might arrange an\nexchange.\u201d\n\nRealizing what his gracious friend was up to, Soemon took the\nvase to the wealthy lender. \u201cHowever did you get this,\u201d exclaimed\nSanemon, when Soemon showed him the vase. \u201cI have often heard of\nit, but this is the first time I have ever seen it. It is such a treasure that\nit is never allowed outside the gate!\u201d He instandy offered to exchange\nthe debt note for the flower vase, and to give Soemon 300 ryo more on\ntop of it. But Soemon, who did not care for money, only wanted the\ndebt note back, and Sanemon gladly gave it to him. Then Soemon\nimmediately hurried to Daizen's house to thank him for his clever\nsupport.\n\nInterpretation\n\nKuriyama Daizen understood that the granting of a favor is never\nsimple: If it is done with fuss and obviousness, its receiver feels\nburdened by an obligation. This may give the doer a certain power, but\nit is a power that will eventually self-destruct, for it will stir up\nresentment and resistance. A favor done indirecdy and elegantly has\nten times more power. Daizen knew a direct approach would only have\noffended Soemon. By letting his friend give him the painting, however,\nhe made Soemon feel that he too had pleased his friend with a gift. In\nthe end, all three parties emerged from the encounter feeling fulfilled\nin their own way.\n\nIn essence, Daizen made himself the cat's-paw, the tool to take the\nchestnuts out of the fire. He must have felt some pain in losing the\nvase, but he gained not only the painting but, more important, the\npower of the courtier. The courtier uses his gloved hand to soften any\nblows against him, disguise his scars, and make the act of rescue more\n\nelegant and clean. By helping others, the courtier eventually helps\nhimself. Daizen's example provides the paradigm for every favor done\nbetween friends and peers: never impose your favors. Search out ways\nto make yourself the cat's-paw, indirectly extricating your friends from\ndistress without imposing yourself or making them feel obligated to\nyou.\n\nOne should not be too straightforward. Go and see the forest. The\nstraight trees are cut down, the crooked ones are left standing.\n\nKautilya, Indian philosopher, third century B.C.\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nAs a leader you may imagine that constant diligence, and the\nappearance of working harder than anyone else, signify power.\nActually, though, they have the opposite effect: They imply weakness.\nWhy are you working so hard Perhaps you are incompetent, and have\nto put in extra effort just to keep up; perhaps you are one of those\npeople who does not know how to delegate, and has to meddle in\neverything. The truly powerful, on the other hand, seem never to be in\na hurry or overburdened. While others work their fingers to the bone,\nthey take their leisure. They know how to find the right people to put\nin the effort while they save their energy and keep their hands out of\nthe fire. Similarly, you may believe that by taking on the dirty work\nyourself, involving yourself directly in unpleasant actions, you impose\nyour power and instill fear. In fact you make yourself look ugly, and\nabusive of your high position. Truly powerful people keep their hands\nclean. Only good things surround them, and die only announcements\nthey make are of glorious achievements.\n\nYou will often find it necessary, of course, to expend energy, or to\neffect an evil but necessary action. But you must never appear to be\nthis action's agent. Find a cat's-paw. Develop the arts of finding, using,\nand, in time, getting rid of these people when their cat's-paw role has\nbeen fulfilled.\n\nOn the eve of an important river battle, the great third-century\nChinese strategist Chuko Liang found himself falsely accused of\nsecretly working for die other side. As proof of his loyalty, his\ncommander ordered him to produce 100,000 arrows for the army\nwithin three days, or be put to death. Instead of trying to manufacture\nthe arrows, an impossible task, Liang took a dozen boats and had\n\nbundles of straw lashed to their sides. In the late afternoon, when mist\nalways blanketed the river, he floated the boats toward the enemy\ncamp. Fearing a trap from the wily Chuko Liang, the enemy did not\nattack the barely visible boats with boats of their own,\n\nyour relations collapsed and fell at my feet when I mentioned\nyour captivity. \u201c As soon as these words were spoken the merchant's\nbird collapsed and fell to the bottom of the cage. \u201dThe news of his\nkinsman 's death has killed him, too,\u201c thought the merchant.\nSorrowfully he picked up the bird and put it on the windowsill. At\nonce the bird revived and flew to a nearby tree. *Now you know,\u201c the\nbird said, \u201dthat what you thought was disaster was in fact good news\nfor me. And how the message, the suggestion of how to behave in\norder to free myself, was transmitted to me through you, my captor. \"\nAnd he flew away, free at last.\n\ntales of the dervishes, Idries Shah, 1967\n\nDAVID AND BAT1ISHKBA\n\nAt the turn of the year, when kings take the field, David sent Joab\nout with his other officers and all the Israelite forces, and they ravaged\nAmnion and laid siege to Rabbah, while David remained in Jerusalem.\nOne evening David got up from his couch and, as he walked about on\nthe roof of the palace, he saw from there a woman bathing and she was\nvery beautiful. He sent to inquire who she was, and the answer came,\n\"It must be Bathsheba, daughter of Eliam and wife of\n\nUriah the Hittite \"\n\nDavid wrote a letter to\n\nJoab and sent Uriah\n\nwith it. He wrote in the\n\nletter: \"Put Uriah\n\nopposite the enemy\n\nwhere the fighting is\n\nfiercest and then fall\n\nback, and leave him to\n\nmeet his death. \"...\n\nJoab ... stationed\n\nUriah at a point where\n\nhe knew they would\n\nput up a stout fight. The\n\nmen of the city sallied\n\nout and engaged Joab,\n\nand some of David's\n\nguards fell; Uriah the\n\nHittite was also killed.\n\nJoab sent David a\n\ndispatch with all the\n\nnews of the battle...\n\nWhen Uriah's wife\n\nheard that her husband\n\nwas dead, she mourned\n\nfor him; and when the\n\nperiod of mourning\n\nwas over, David sent\n\nfor her and brought her\n\ninto his house. She\n\nbecame his wife and\n\nbore him a son.\n\nOLD TESTAMENT, 2SAMUHL, 11-12\n\nbut showered them with arrows from the bank. As Liang's boats\ninched closer, they redoubled the rain of arrows, which stuck in the\nthick straw. After several hours, the men hiding on board sailed the\nvessels quickly downstream, where Chuko Liang met diem and\ncollected his 100,000 arrows.\n\nChuko Liang would never do work that others could do for himhe\nwas always thinking up tricks like this one. The key to planning such a\nstrategy is the ability to think far ahead, to imagine ways in which\nother people can be baited into doing the job for you.\n\nAn essential element in making this strategy work is to disguise\nyour goal, shrouding it in mystery, like the strange enemy boats\nappearing dimly in the mist. When your rivals cannot be sure what you\nare after, they will react in ways that often work against them in the\nlong run. In fact they will become your cat's-paws. If you disguise\nyour intentions, it is much easier to guide them into moves mat\naccomplish exacdy what you want done, but prefer not to do yourself.\nThis may require planning several moves in advance, like a billiard\n\nball that bounces off the sides a few times before heading into the right\npocket.\n\nThe early-twentieth-century American con artist Yellow Kid Weil\nknew that no matter how skillfully he homed in on the perfect wealthy\nsucker, if he, a stranger, approached mis man directly, the sucker might\nbecome suspicious. So Weil would find someone the sucker already\nknew to serve as a cat's-pawsomeone lower on the totem pole who was\nhimself an unlikely target, and would therefore be less suspicious. Weil\nwould interest mis man in a scheme promising incredible weahh.\nConvinced the scheme was for real, the cat's-paw would often suggest,\nwithout prompting, that his boss or wealthy friend should get involved:\nHaving more cash to invest, this man would increase the size of the\npot, making bigger bucks for all concerned. The cat's-paw would then\ninvolve the wealthy sucker who had been Weil's target all along, but\nwho would not suspect a trap, since it was his trusty subordinate who\nhad roped him in. Devices like mis are often the best way to approach\na person of power: Use an associate or subordinate to hook you up\nwith your primary target. The cat's-paw establishes your credibility\nand shields you from the unsavory appearance of being too pushy in\nyour courtship.\n\nThe easiest and most effective way to use a cat's-paw is often to\nplant information with him that he will then spread to your primary\ntarget. False or planted information is a powerful tool, especially if\nspread by a dupe whom no one suspects. You will find it very easy to\nplay innocent and disguise yourself as the source.\n\nThe strategic therapist Dr. Milton H. Erickson would often\nencounter among his patients a married couple in which the wife\nwanted the therapy but the husband absolutely refused it. Rather than\nwasting energy trying to deal with the man direcdy, Dr. Erickson\nwould see the wife alone, and as she talked he would interject\ninterpretations of the husband's behavior that he knew would rile the\nhusband up if he heard them. Sure enough, die wife would tell her\nhusband what the doctor had said. After a few weeks die\n\nhusband would be so furious he would insist on joining his wife\nin the sessions so he could set the doctor straight.\n\nFinally, you may well find cases in which deliberately offering\nyourself as the cat's-paw will ultimately gain you great power. This is\n\n\nthe ruse of the perfect courtier. Its symbol is Sir Walter Raleigh, who\nonce placed his own cloak on the muddy ground so that Queen\nElizabeth would not sully her shoes. As the instrument that protects a\nmaster or peer from unpleasantness or danger, you gain immense\nrespect, which sooner or later will pay dividends. And remember: If\nyou can make your assistance subde and gracious rather than boastful\nand burdensome, your recompense will be that much die more\nsatisfying and powerful.\n\nImage: The Cat's-Paw.\n\nIt has long claws to grab\n\nthings. It is soft and\n\npadded. Take hold of the cat\n\nand use its paw to pluck\n\nthings out of the fire, to claw\n\nyour enemy, to play with the\n\nmouse before devouring it.\n\nSometimes you hurt the\n\ncat, but most often it\n\ndoesn't feel a thing.\n\nAuthority: Do everything pleasant yourself, everything unpleasant\nthrough third parties. By adopting the first course you win favor, by\ntaking the second you deflect ill will. Important affairs often require\nrewards and punishments. Let only the good come from you and the\nevil from others. (Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nThe cat's-paw and the scapegoat must be used with extreme\ncaution and delicacy. They are like screens that hide your own\ninvolvement in dirty work from the public; if at any moment the screen\nis lifted and you are seen as the manipulator, the puppet master, the\nwhole dynamic turns aroundyour hand will be seen everywhere, and\nyou will be blamed for misfortunes you may have had nothing to do\nwith. Once the truth is revealed, events will snowball beyond your\ncontrol.\n\nIn 1572, Queen Catherine de' Medicis of France conspired to do\naway with Gaspard de Coligny, an admiral in the French navy and a\nleading member of the Huguenot (French Protestant) community.\nColigny was close to Catherine's son, Charles IX, and she feared his\n\ngrowing influence on the young king. So she arranged for a member of\nthe Guise family, one of the most powerful royal clans in France, to\nassassinate him.\n\nSecretly, however, Catherine had another plan: She wanted the\nHuguenots to blame the Guises for killing one of their leaders, and to\ntake revenge. With one blow, she would erase or injure two threatening\nrivals, Coligny and the Guise family. Yet both plans went awry. The\nassassin missed his target, only wounding Coligny; knowing Catherine\nas his enemy, he strongly suspected it was she who had set up the\nattack on him, and he told the king so. Eventually the failed\nassassination and the arguments that ensued from it set off a chain of\nevents that led to a bloody civil war between Catholics and Protestants,\nculminating in the horrifying Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Eve, in\nwhich thousands of Protestants were killed.\n\nIf you have to use a cat's-paw or a scapegoat in an action of great\nconsequence, be very careful: Too much can go wrong. It is often\nwiser to use such dupes in more innocent endeavors, where mistakes\nor miscalculations will cause no serious harm.\n\nFinally, there are moments when it is advantageous to not\ndisguise your involvement or responsibility, but rather to take the\nblame yourself for some mistake. If you have power and are secure in\nit, you should sometimes play the penitent: With a sorrowful look, you\nask for forgiveness from those weaker than you. It is the ploy of the\nking who makes a show of his own sacrifices for die good of die\npeople. Similarly, upon occasion you may want to appear as the agent\nof punishment in order to instill fear and trembling in your\nsubordinates. Instead of the cat's-paw you show your own mighty hand\nas a threatening gesture. Play such a card sparingly. If you play it too\noften, fear will turn into resentment and hatred. Before you know it,\nsuch emotions will spark a vigorous opposition that will someday\nbring you down. Get in the habit of using a cat's-pawit is far safer.\n\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

And this was in fact to occur, as science\nwas popularized, from the Renaissance on down through succeeding\ncenturies. With the immense growth of knowledge and its spread\nthrough printing in modern times, the mass of the half educated, the\neagerly gullible prey of the quack, also increased, became indeed a\nmajority; real power could be based on their wishes, opinions,\npreferences, and rejections.

This kind of power will lift\nyou to another realm: You will no longer have to struggle or use\nsubterfuge to enforce your will. You are adored and can do no wrong.\n\nYou might think it a gargantuan task to create such a following,\nbut in fact it is fairly simple. As humans, we have a desperate need to\nbelieve in something, anything. This makes us eminently gullible: We\nsimply cannot endure long periods of doubt, or of the emptiness that\ncomes from a lack of something to believe in. Dangle in front of us\nsome new cause, elixir, get-rich-quick scheme, or the latest\ntechnological trend or art movement and we leap from the water as one\nto take the bait. Look at history: The chronicles of the new trends and\ncults that have made a mass following for diem-selves could fill a\nlibrary. After a few centuries, a few decades, a few years, a few\nmonths, they generally look ridiculous, but at the time they seem so\nattractive, so transcendental, so divine.\n\nAlways in a rush to believe in something, we will manufacture\nsaints and faiths out of nothing. Do not let this gullibility go to waste:\nMake yourself the object of worship. Make people form a cult around\nyou.\n\nThe great European charlatans of the sixteenth and seventeenth\ncenturies mastered the art of cultmaking. They lived, as we do now, in\na time of transformation: Organized religion was on the wane, science\non the rise. People were desperate to rally around a new cause or faith.\nThe charlatans had begun by peddling health elixirs and alchemic\nshortcuts to wealth. Moving quickly from town to town, they\noriginally focused on small groupsuntil, by accident, they stumbled on\na truth of human nature: The larger the group they gathered around\nthemselves, the easier it was to deceive.\n\nThe charlatan would station himself on a high wooden platform\n(hence the term \u201cmountebank\u201d) and crowds would swarm around him.\nIn a group setting, people were more emotional, less able to reason.\nHad the charlatan spoken to them individually, they might have found\n\nhim ridiculous, but lost in a crowd they got caught up in a communal\nmood of rapt attention. It became impossible for them to find the\ndistance to be skeptical. Any deficiencies in the charlatan's ideas were\nhidden by the zeal of the mass. Passion and enthusiasm swept tiirough\nthe crowd like a contagion, and they reacted violently to anyone who\ndared to spread a seed of doubt. Both consciously studying this\ndynamic over decades of experiment and spontaneously adapting to\nthese situations as diey happened, the charlatans perfected the science\nof attracting and holding a crowd, molding die crowd into followers\nand die followers into a cult.\n\nThe gimmicks of the charlatans may seem quaint today, but there\nare thousands of charlatans among us still, using the same tried-and-\ntrue methods their predecessors refined centuries ago, only changing\ndie names of their elixirs and modernizing the look of their cults. We\nfind diese latter-day charlatans in all arenas of lifebusiness, fashion,\npolitics, art. Many of them, perhaps, are following in the charlatan\ntradition without having any knowledge of its history, but you can be\nmore systematic and deliberate. Simply follow die five steps of\ncultmaking that our charlatan ancestors perfected over the years.\n\nStep 1: Keep It Vague; Keep It Simple. To create a cult you must\nfirst attract attention. This you should do not through actions, which\nare too clear and readable, but through words, which are hazy and\ndeceptive. Your initial speeches, conversations, and interviews must\ninclude two elements: on uie one hand the promise of somediing great\nand transformative, and on die other a total vagueness. This\ncombination will stimulate all kinds of hazy dreams in your listeners,\nwho will make dieir own connections and see what they want to see.\n\nTo make your vagueness attractive, use words of great resonance\nbut cloudy meaning, words full of heat and enthusiasm. Fancy tides for\nsimple things are helpful, as are the use of numbers and the creation of\nnew words for vague concepts. All of these create the impression of\nspecialized knowledge, giving you a veneer of profundity. By the same\ntoken, try to make the subject of your cult new and fresh, so diat few\nwill understand it. Done right, the combination of vague promises,\ncloudy but alluring concepts, and fiery endiusiasm will stir people's\nsouls and a group will form around you.\n\nTalk too vaguely and you have no credibility. But it is more\ndangerous to be specific. If you explain in detail the benefits people\nwill gain by following your cult, you will be expected to satisfy mem.\n\nAs a corollary to its vagueness your appeal should also be simple.\nMost people's problems have complex causes: deep-rooted neurosis,\ninterconnected social factors, roots that go way back in time and are\nexceedingly hard to unravel. Few, however, have the patience to deal\nwith this; most people want to hear that a simple solution will cure\ntheir problems. The ability to offer mis kind of solution will give you\ngreat power and build you a following. Instead of the complicated\nexplanations of real life, retwm to die primitive solutions of our\nancestors, to good old country remedies, to mysterious panaceas.\n\nStep 2: Emphasize the Visual and the Sensual over the\nIntellectual.\n\nOnce people have begun to gadier around you, two dangers will\npresent themselves: boredom and skepticism. Boredom will make\npeople go elsewhere; skepticism will allow them the distance to think\nrationally about whatever it is you are offering, blowing away die mist\nyou have artfully created and revealing your ideas for what tiiey are.\nYou need to amuse the bored, then, and ward off die cynics.\n\nencountered science and education at some time, though briefly\nand unsuccessfully.... The great mass of mankind has always been\npredisposed to marvel at mysteries, and this was especially true at\ncertain historic periods when the secure foundations of life seemed\nshaken and old values, economic or spiritual, long accepted as\ncertainties, could no longer be relied upon. Then the numbers of the\ncharlatan's dupes multipliedthe \u201cself killers,\u201d as a seventeenth-century\nEnglishman called them.\n\nthe power of the\n\ncharlatan,\n\nGrete de Francesco,\n\nTHE OWI. WHO WAS GOD\n\nOnce upon a starless midnight there was an owl who sat on the\nbranch of an oak tree. Two ground moles tried to slip quietly by,\nunnoticed. \u201cYou!\u201dsaid the owl. \u201cWho\u201d they quavered, in fear and\nastonishment, for they could not believe it was possible for anyone to\nsee them in that thick darkness. \u201cYou two!\u201d said the owl. The moles\n\n\nhurried away and told the other creatures of the field and forest that the\nowl was the greatest and wisest of all animals because he could see in\nthe dark\n\nand because he could answer any question. \u201cI'll see about that,\u201d\nsaid a secretary bird, and he called on the owl one night when it was\nagain very dark. \u201cHow many claws am 1 holding up \u201d said the\nsecretary bird. \u201cTwo,\u201d said the owl, and that was right. \u201cCan you give\nme another expression for 'that is to say' or 'namely\u201d asked the\nsecretary bird. \u201cTo wit,\u201dsaid the owl. \u201cWhy does a lover call on his\nlove\u201d asked the secretary bird. \u201cTo woo,\u201d said the owl. The secretary\nbird hastened back to the other creatures and reported that the owl was\nindeed the greatest and wisest animal in the world because he could\nsee in the dark and because he could answer any question. \u201cCan he see\nin the daytime, too\u201d asked a red fox. \u201c Yes,\u201d echoed a dormouse and a\nFrench poodle. \u201cCan he see in the daytime, too\u201d All the other creatures\nlaughed loudly at this silly question, and they set upon the red fox and\nhis friends and drove them out of the region. Then they sent a\nmessenger to the owl and asked him to be their leader. When the owl\nappeared among the animals it was high noon and the sun was shining\nbrightly. He walked very slowly, which gave him an appearance of\ngreat dignity, and he peered about him with large, staring eyes, which\ngave him an air\n\nThe best way to do this is through theater, or other devices of its\nkind. Surround yourself widi luxury, dazzle your followers with visual\nsplendor, fill their eyes with spectacle. Not only will this keep them\nfrom seeing the ridiculousness of your ideas, the holes in your belief\nsystem, it will also attract more attention, more followers. Appeal to\nall the senses: Use incense for scent, soothing music for hearing,\ncolorful charts and graphs for die eye. You might even tickle the mind,\nperhaps by using new technological gadgets to give your cult a\npseudo-scientific veneeras long as you do not make anyone really\nthink. Use die exoticdistant cultures, strange customsto create\ndieatrical effects, and to make the most banal and ordinary affairs seem\nsigns of somediing extraordinary.\n\nStep 3: Borrow the Forms of Organized Religion to Structure the\nGroup. Your cultlike following is growing; it is time to organize it.\nFind a way both elevating and comforting. Organized religions have\n\n\nlong held unquestioned authority for large numbers of people, and\ncontinue to do so in our supposedly secular age. And even if the\nreligion itself has faded some, its forms still resonate with power. The\nlofty and holy associations of organized religion can be endlessly\nexploited. Create rituals for your followers; organize diem into a\nhierarchy, ranking them in grades of sanctity, and giving diem names\nand tides mat resound with religious overtones; ask diem for sacrifices\nmat will fill your coffers and increase your power. To emphasize your\ngadiering's quasi-religious nature, talk and act like a prophet. You are\nnot a dictator, after all; you are a priest, a guru, a sage, a shaman, or\nany odier word diat hides your real power in the mist of religion.\n\nStep 4: Disguise Your Source of Income. Your group has grown,\nand you have structured it in a churchlike form. Your coffers are\nbeginning to fill wim your followers' money. Yet you must never be\nseen as hungry for money and the power it brings. It is at diis moment\nthat you must disguise die source of your income.\n\nYour followers want to believe diat if they follow you all sorts of\ngood things will fall into dieir lap. By surrounding yourself widi\nluxury you become living proof of the soundness of your belief\nsystem. Never reveal that your wealth actually comes from your\nfollowers' pockets; instead, make it seem to come from die trum of\nyour mediods. Followers will copy your each and every move in die\nbelief mat it will bring diem the same results, and dieir imitative\nenthusiasm will blind diem to the charlatan nature of your wealdi.\n\nStep 5: Set Up an Us-Versus-Them Dynamic. The group is now\nlarge and diriving, a magnet attracting more and more particles. If you\nare not careful, though, inertia will set in, and time and boredom will\ndemagnetize die group. To keep your followers united, you must now\ndo what all religions and belief systems have done: create an us-\nversus-diem dynamic. First, make sure your followers believe they are\npart of an exclusive\n\nclub, unified by a bond of common goals. Then, to strengdien this\nbond, manufacture the notion of a devious enemy out to ruin you.\nThere is a force of nonbelievers that will do anything to stop you. Any\noutsider who tries to reveal the charlatan nature of your belief system\ncan now be described as a member of this devious force.\n\nIf you have no enemies, invent one. Given a straw man to react\nagainst, your followers will tighten and cohere. They have your cause\nto believe in and infidels to destroy.\n\nOBSERVANCES OF THE LAW\n\nObservance I\n\nIn the year 1653, a twenty-seven-year-old Milan man named\nFrancesco Giuseppe Borri claimed to have had a vision. He went\naround town telling one and all mat the archangel Michael had\nappeared to him and announced that he had been chosen to be the\ncapitano generate of the Army of the New Pope, an army that would\nseize and revitalize the world. The archangel had further revealed that\nBorri now had the power to see people's souls, and that he would soon\ndiscover the philosopher's stonea long-sought-after substance that\ncould change base metals into gold. Friends and acquaintances who\nheard Borri explain the vision, and who witnessed the change that had\ncome over him, were impressed, for Borri had previously devoted\nhimself to a life of wine, women, and gambling. Now he gave all that\nup, plunging himself into the study of alchemy and talking only of\nmysticism and the occult.\n\nThe transformation was so sudden and miraculous, and Borri's\nwords were so filled with enthusiasm, that he began to create a\nfollowing. Unfortunately the Italian Inquisition began to notice him as\nwellthey prosecuted anyone who delved into the occultso he left Italy\nand began to wander Europe, from Austria to Holland, telling one and\nall that \u201cto those who follow me all joy shall be granted.\u201d Wherever\nBorri stayed he attracted followers. His method was simple: He spoke\nof his vision, which had grown more and more elaborate, and offered\nto \u201clook into\u201d the soul of anyone who believed him (and they were\nmany). Seemingly in a trance, he would stare at this new follower for\nseveral minutes, then claim to have seen the person's soul, degree of\nenlightenment, and potential for spiritual greatness. If what he saw\nshowed promise, he would add the person to his growing order o\ndisciples, an honor indeed.\n\nThe cult had six degrees, into which the disciples were assigned\naccording to what Borri had glimpsed in their souls. With work and\ntotal devotion to the cult they could graduate to a higher degree.\nBorriwhom they called \u201cHis Excellency,\u201d and \u201cUniversal\n\n\nDoctor\u2019demanded from them die strictest vows of poverty. All the\ngoods and moneys they possessed had to be turned over to him. But\ndiey did not mind handing over their property, for Borri had told them,\n\"I shall soon bring my chemical\n\nof tremendous importance. \u201cHe's God!\u201d screamed a Plymouth\nRock hen. And the others took up the cry \u201cHe's God!\u201dSo they followed\nhim wherever he went and when he began to bump into things they\nbegan to bump into things, too. Finally he came to a concrete highway\nand he started up the middle of it and all the other creatures followed\nhim. Presently a hawk, who was acting as outrider, observed a truck\ncoming toward them at fifty miles an hour, and he reported to the\nsecretary bird and the secretary bird reported to the owl. \u201c There's\ndanger ahead,\u201d said the secretary bird. \u201c To wit \u201d said the owl. The\nsecretary bird told him. \u201cA ren 't you afraid \u201d He asked. \u201cWho\u201d said the\nowl calmly, for he could not see the truck. \u201cHe's God!\u201d cried all the\ncreatures again, and they were still crying \u201cHe's God!\u201d when the truck\nhit them and ran them down. Some of the animals were merely injured,\nbut most of them, including the owl, were killed. Moral: You can fool\ntoo many of the people too much of the time.\n\nthe thurber carnival, James Thurber , 1894-1961\n\nTo become the founder of a new religion one must he\npsychologically infallible in one's knowledge of a certain average type\nof souls who have not yet recognized that they belong together.\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche, 1844-1900\n\nMen are so simple of\n\nmind, and so much\n\ndominated by their\n\nimmediate needs, that a\n\ndeceitful man will\n\nalways find plenty who\n\nare ready to be\n\ndeceived.\n\nNicroLO Machiavem.i, 1469-1527\n\n111!'. IKMI'LK OF III, VII]\n\n[In the late 1780s] the Scottish quack James Graham .. . was\nwinning a large following and great riches in London.... [Graham]\nmaintained a show of great scientific technique. In 1772 ... he had\n\nvisited Philadelphia, where he met Benjamin Franklin and became\ninterested in the latter's experiments with electricity. These appear to\nhave inspired the apparatus in the \u201cTemple of Health,\u201d\n\nstudies to a happy conclusion by the discovery of the\nphilosopher's stone, and by this means we shall all have as much gold\nas we desire.\"\n\nGiven his growing wealtii, Borri began to change his style of\nliving. Renting the most splendid apartment in the city into which he\nhad temporarily setded, he would furnish it with fabulous furniture and\naccessories, which he had begun to collect. He would drive through the\ncity in a coach studded with jewels, with six magnificent black horses\nat its head. He never stayed too long in one place, and when he\ndisappeared, saying he had more souls to gather into his flock, his\nreputation only grew in his absence. He became famous, although in\nact he had never done a single concrete thing.\n\nFrom all over Europe, the blind, the crippled, and the desperate\ncame to visit Borri, for word had spread that he had healing powers.\nHe asked no fee for his services, which only made him seem more\nmarvelous, and indeed some claimed tfiat in this or mat city he had\n\nperformed a miracle cure. By only\nencouraged people's imaginations\nproportions. His wealdi, for exam\nsums he was collecting from his\n\nhinting at his accomplishments, he\nto blow diem up to fantastic\nple, actually came from the vast\nincreasingly select group of rich\n\ndisciples; yet it was presumed that he had in fact perfected the\nphilosopher's stone. The Church continued to pursue him, denouncing\nhim for heresy and witchcraft, and Borri's response to these charges\nwas a dignified silence; this only enhanced his reputation and made his\nollowers more passionate. Only die great are persecuted, after all;\nhow many understood Jesus Christ in his own time Borri did not have\nto say a wordhis followers now called the Pope the Antichrist.\n\nAnd so Borri's power grew and grew, until one day he left the city\nof Amsterdam (where he had setded for a while), absconding with\nhuge sums of borrowed money and diamonds that had been entrusted\nto him. (He claimed to be able to remove the flaws from diamonds\nthrough the power of his gifted mind.) Now he was on the run. The\nInquisition eventually caught up with him, and for the last twenty\nyears of his life he was imprisoned in Rome. But so great was the\n\n\nbelief in his occult powers that to his dying day he was visited by\nwealthy believers, including Queen Christina of Sweden. Supplying\nhim with money and materials, diese visitors allowed him to continue\nhis search for die elusive philosopher's stone. Interpretation\n\nBefore he formed his cult, Borri seems to have stumbled on a\ncritical discovery. Tiring of his life of debauchery, he had decided to\ngive it up and to devote himself to the occult, a genuine interest of his.\nHe must have noticed, however, mat when he alluded to a mystical\nexperience (rather than physical exhaustion) as die source of his\nconversion, people of all classes wanted to hear more. Realizing the\npower he could gain by ascribing the change to sometiiing external and\nmysterious, he went further widi his manufactured visions. The\ngrander the vision, and the more sacrifices he asked for, die more\nappealing and believable his story seemed to become.\n\nRemember: People are not interested in die trutii about change.\nThey\n\ndo not want to hear that it has come from hard work, or from\nanything as banal as exhaustion, boredom, or depression; they are\ndying to believe in something romantic, otherworldly. They want to\nhear of angels and out-of-body experiences. Indulge them. Hint at the\nmystical source of some personal change, wrap it in ethereal colors,\nand a cuklike following will form around you. Adapt to people's needs:\nThe messiah must mirror the desires of his followers. And always aim\nhigh. The bigger and bolder your illusion, the better.\n\nObservance II\n\nIn the mid-1700s, word spread in Europe's fashionable society of\na Swiss country doctor named Michael Schiippach who practiced a\ndifferent kind of medicine: He used the healing powers of nature to\nperform miraculous cures. Soon well-to-do people from all over the\nContinent, their ailments both serious and mild, were making the trek\nto the alpine village of Lang-nau, where Schiippach lived and worked.\nTrudging tiirough the mountains, these visitors witnessed the most\ndramatic natural landscapes that Europe has to offer. By the time they\nreached Langnau, they were already feeling transformed and on their\nway to health.\n\nSchiippach, who had become known as simply the \u201cMountain\nDoctor,\u201d had a small pharmacy in town. This place became quite a\n\n\nscene: Crowds of people from many different countries would cram\nthe small room, its walls lined with colorful bottles filled with herbal\ncures. Where most doctors of the time prescribed foul-tasting\nconcoctions that bore incomprehensible Latin titles (as medicines often\ndo still), Schiippach's cures had names such as \u201cThe Oil of Joy,\u201d\n\u201cLittle Flower's Heart,\u201d or \u201cAgainst the Monster,\u201d and they tasted\nsweet and pleasing.\n\nVisitors to Langnau would have to wait patiently for a visit with\nthe Mountain Doctor, because every day some eighty messengers\nwould arrive at the pharmacy bearing flasks of urine from all over\nEurope. Schiippach claimed he could diagnose what ailed you simply\nby looking at a sample of your urine and reading a written description\nof your ailment. (Naturally he read the description very carefully\nbefore prescribing a cure.) When he finally had a spare minute (the\nurine samples took up much of his time), he would call the visitor into\nhis office in the pharmacy. He would then examine this person's urine\nsample, explaining that its appearance would tell him everything he\nneeded to know. Country people had a sense for these things, he would\nsaytheir wisdom came from living a simple, godly life with none of the\ncomplications of urban living. This personal consultation would also\ninclude a discussion as to how one might bring one's soul more into\nharmony with nature.\n\nSchiippach had devised many forms of treatment, each\nprofoundly unlike the usual medical practices of the time. He was a\nbeliever, for instance, in electric shock tiierapy. To those who\nwondered whether this was in keeping with his belief in the healing\npower of nature, he would explain that electricity is a natural\nphenomenon; he was merely imitating the\n\nthe fabulous establishment he opened in London for the sale of\nhis elixirs... In the chief room, where he received patients, stood \u201cthe\nlargest air pump in the world \u201d to assist him in his \u201cphilosophical\ninvestigations\u201d into disease, and also a \u201cstupendous metallic\nconductor,\u201d a richly gilded pedestal surrounded with retorts and vials\nof \u201cetherial and other essences. \u201d .. .According to J. Ennemoser, who\npublished a history of magic in 1844 at Leipzig, Graham's \u201chouse ...\nunited the useful with the pleasurable. Everywhere the utmost\nmagnificence was displayed. Even in the outer court, averred an eye-\n\n\nwitness, it seemed as though art, invention, and riches had been\nexhausted. On the side walls in the chambers an arc-shaped glow was\nprovided by artificial electric light; star rays darted forth; transparent\nglasses of all colors were placed with clever selection and much taste.\nAll this, the same eyewitness assures us, was ravishing and exalted the\nimagination to the highest degree.\u201d Visitors were given a printed sheet\nof rules for healthy living. In the Great Apollo Apartment they might\njoin in mysterious rituals, accompanied by chants: \u201cHail, Vital Air,\naethereal! Magnetic Magic, hail!\u201d And while they hailed the\n\nmagic of magnetism, the windows were darkened, revealing a\nceiling studded with electric stars and a young and lovely \u201cRosy\nGoddess of Health \u201d in a niche.... Every evening this Temple of Health\nwas crowded with guests; it had become the fashion to visit it and try\nthe great twelve-foot bed of state, the \u201cGrand Celestial Bed, \u201d said to\ncure any disease. . . . This bed, according to Ennemoser, \u201cstood in a\nsplendid room, into which a cylinder led from an adjoining chamber to\nconduct the healing currents ... at the same time all sorts of pleasing\nscents of strengthening herbs and Oriental incense were also brought\nin through glass tubes. The heavenly bed itself rested upon six solid\ntransparent pillars; the bedclothes were of purple and sky-blue Atlas\nsilk, spread over a mattress saturated with Arabian perfumed waters to\nsuit the tastes of the Persian court. The chamber in which it was placed\nhe called the Sanctum Sanctorum. ... To add to all this, there were the\nmelodious notes of the harmonica, soft flutes, agreeable voices, and a\ngreat organ.\u201d\n\nthe power of the\n\ncharlatan,\n\nCrete de Francesco,\n\npower of lightning. One of his patients claimed to be inhabited by\nseven devils. The doctor cured him with electrical shocks, and as he\nadministered these he exclaimed that he could see the devils flying out\nof the man's body, one by one. Another man claimed to have\nswallowed a hay wagon and its driver, which were causing him\nmassive pains in the chest. The Mountain Doctor listened patientiy,\nclaimed to be able to hear the crack of a whip in the man's belly,\npromised to cure him, and gave him a sedative and a purgative. The\nman fell asleep on a chair outside the pharmacy. As soon as he awoke\n\nhe vomited, and as he vomited a hay wagon sped past him (the\nMountain Doctor had hired it for die occasion), the crack of its whip\nmaking him feel that somehow he had indeed expelled it under die\ndoctor's care.\n\nOver die years, the Mountain Doctor's fame grew. He was\nconsulted by the powerfuleven the writer Goethe made die trek to his\nvillageand he became the center of a cult of nature in which everything\nnatural was considered worthy of worship. Schiippach was careful to\ncreate effects mat would entertain and inspire his patients. A professor\nwho visited him once wrote, \u201cOne stands or sits in company, one plays\ncards, sometimes with a young woman; now a concert is given, now a\nlunch or supper, and now a litde ballet is presented. Widi a very happy\neffect, die freedom of nature is everywhere united widi die pleasures of\ndie beau monde, and if the doctor is not able to heal any diseases, he\ncan at least cure hypochondria and die vapors.\u201d Interpretation\n\nSchiippach had begun his career as an ordinary village doctor. He\nwould sometimes use in his practice some of the village remedies he\nhad grown up with, and apparendy he noticed some results, for soon\ndiese herbal tinctures and natural forms of healing became his\nspecialty. And in fact his natural form of healing did have profound\npsychological effects on his patients. Where die normal drugs of the\ntime created fear and pain, Schiip-pach's treatments were comfortable\nand soothing. The resulting improvement in die patient's mood was a\ncritical element in the cures he brought about. His patients believed so\ndeeply in his skills that they willed diem-selves into health. Instead of\nscoffing at their irrational explanations for their ailments, Schiippach\nused their hypochondria to make it seem that he had effected a great\ncure.\n\nThe case of die Mountain Doctor teaches us valuable lessons in\ndie creation of a cultiike following. First, you must find a way to\nengage people's will, to make dieir belief in your powers strong\nenough that they imagine all sorts of benefits. Their belief will have a\nself-fulfilling quality, but you must make sure that it is you, rather than\ndieir own will, who is seen as the agent of transformation. Find die\nbelief, cause, or fantasy that will make diem believe widi a passion and\ntiiey will imagine die rest, worshipping you as healer, prophet, genius,\nwhatever you like.\n\nSecond, Schiippach teaches us the everlasting power of belief in\nnature, and in simplicity. Nature, in reality, is full of much tiiat is\nterrifying poisonous plants, fierce animals, sudden disasters, plagues.\nBelief in die\n\nhealing, comforting quality of nature is really a constructed myth,\na romanticism. But the appeal to nature can bring you great power,\nespecially in complicated and stressful times.\n\nThis appeal, however, must be handled right. Devise a kind of\ntheater of nature in which you, as the director, pick and choose the\nqualities that fit the romanticism of the times. The Mountain Doctor\nplayed the part to perfection, playing up his homespun wisdom and\nwit, and staging his cures as dramatic pieces. He did not make himself\none with nature; instead he molded nature into a cult, an artificial\nconstruction. To create a \u201cnatural\u201d effect you actually have to work\nhard, making nature theatrical and delightfully pagan. Otherwise no\none will notice. Nature too must follow trends and be progressive.\n\nObservance III\n\nIn 1788, at the age of fifty-five, the doctor and scientist Franz\nMesmer was at a crossroads. He was a pioneer in the study of animal\nmagnetismthe belief that animals contain magnetic matter, and that a\ndoctor or specialist can effect miraculous cures by working on this\ncharged substancebut in Vienna, where he lived, his theories had met\nwith scorn and ridicule from the medical establishment. In treating\nwomen for convulsions, Mesmer claimed to have worked a number of\ncures, his proudest achievement being the restoration of sight to a\nblind girl. But another doctor who examined the young girl said she\nwas as blind as ever, an assessment with which she herself agreed.\nMesmer countered that his enemies were out to slander him by\nwinning her over to their side. This claim only elicited more ridicule.\nClearly the sober-minded Viennese were the wrong audience for his\ntheories, and so he decided to move to Paris and start again.\n\nRenting a splendid apartment in his new city, Mesmer decorated it\nappropriately. Stained glass in most of the windows created a religious\nfeeling, and mirrors on all the walls produced an hypnotic effect. The\ndoctor advertised that in his apartment he would give demonstrations\nof the powers of animal magnetism, inviting the diseased and\nmelancholic to feel its powers. Soon Parisians of all classes (but\n\nmostiy women, who seemed more attracted to the idea than men did)\nwere paying for entry to witness the miracles that Mesmer promised.\n\nInside the apartment, the scents of orange blossom and exotic\nincense wafted through special vents. As the initiates filtered into the\nsalon where the demonstrations took place, they heard harp music and\nthe lulling sounds of a female vocalist coming from another room. In\nthe center of the salon was a long oval container filled with water that\nMesmer claimed had been magnetized. From holes in the container's\nmetal lid protruded long movable iron rods. The visitors were\ninstructed to sit around the container, place these magnetized rods on\nthe body part that gave them pains or problems, and then hold hands\nwith their neighbors, sitting as close as possible to one another to help\nthe magnetic force pass between their bodies. Sometimes, too, they\nwere attached to each other by cords.\n\nMesmer would leave the room, and \u201cassistant magnetizers\u201dall\nhand-\n\nIn the town of Tarnopol lived a man by the name of Reb Feivel.\nOne day, as he sat in his house deeply absorbed in his Talmud, he\nheard a loud noise outside. When he went to the window he saw a lot\nof little pranksters. \u201cUp to some new piece of mischief, no doubt,\u201d he\nthought.\n\n\u201cChildren, run quickly to the synagogue,\u201d he cried, leaning out\nand improvising the first story that occurred to him. \u201c You 'II see there\na sea monster, and what a monster! It's a creature with five feet, three\neyes, and a beard like that of a goat, only it's green!\u201d\n\nAnd sure enough the children scampered off and Reb Feivel\nreturned to his studies. He smiled into his beard as he thought of the\ntrick he had played on those little rascals. It wasn 't long before his\nstudies were interrupted again, this time by running footsteps. When\nhe went to the window he saw several Jews running. \u201cWhere are you\nrunning\u201d he called out.\n\n\u201cTo the synagogue!\u201d answered the Jews. \u201cHaven'tyou heard\nThere's a sea monster, there's a creature with five legs, three eyes, and\na beard like that of a goat, only it's green!\u201d Reb Feivel laughed with\nglee, thinking of the trick he had played,\n\nand sat down again to his Talmud. But no sooner had he begun to\nconcentrate when suddenly he heard a dinning tumult outside. And\n\nwhat did he see A great crowd of men, women and children, all\nrunning toward the synagogue. \u201cWhat's up\u201d he cried, sticking his head\nout of the window. \u201c What a question! Why, don't you know\u201d they\nanswered. \u201cRight in front of the synagogue there 's a sea monster. It's a\ncreature with five legs, three eyes, and a beard like that of a goat, only\nit's green!\u201d And as the crowd hurried by, Reb Feivel suddenly noticed\nthat the rabbi himself was among them. \u201cLord of the world!\u201d he\nexclaimed. \u201cIf the rabbi himself is running with them surely there must\nbe something happening. Where there's smoke there's fire!\u201d Without\nfurther thought Reb Feivel grabbed his hat, left his house, and also\nbegan running. \u201cWho can tell\u201d he muttered to himself as he ran, all out\nof breath, toward the synagogue.\n\na treasury of\n\njewish folklore,\n\nsome and strapping young menwould enter with jars of\nmagnetized water that they would sprinkle on the patients, rubbing the\nhealing fluid on their bodies, massaging it into their skin, moving them\ntoward a trancelike state. And after a few minutes a kind of delirium\nwould overcome the women. Some would sob, some would shriek and\ntear their hair, others would laugh hysterically. At the height of the\ndelirium Mesmer would reenter the salon, dressed in a flowing silk\nrobe embroidered with golden flowers and carrying a white magnetic\nrod. Moving around the container, he would stroke and soothe the\npatients until calm was restored. Many women would later attribute the\nstrange power he had on them to his piercing look, which, they\nthought, was exciting or quieting the magnetic fluids in their bodies.\n\nWithin months of his arrival in Paris, Mesmer became the rage.\nHis supporters included Marie-Antoinette herself, the queen of France,\nwife of Louis XVI. As in Vienna, he was condemned by the official\nfaculty of medicine, but it did not matter. His growing following of\npupils and patients paid him handsomely.\n\nMesmer expanded his theories to proclaim that all humanity could\nbe brought into harmony through the power of magnetism, a concept\nwith much appeal during the French Revolution. A cult of Mesmerism\nspread across the country; in many towns, \u201cSocieties of Harmony\u201d\nsprang up to experiment with magnetism. These societies eventually\n\nbecame notorious: They tended to be led by libertines who would turn\ntheir sessions into a kind of group orgy.\n\nAt the height of Mesmer's popularity, a French commission\npublished a report based on years of testing the theory of animal\nmagnetism. The conclusion: Magnetism's effects on the body actually\ncame from a kind of group hysteria and autosuggestion. The report\nwas well documented, and ruined Mesmer's reputation in France. He\nleft the country and went into retirement. Only a few years later,\nhowever, imitators sprang up all over Europe and the cult of\nMesmerism spread once again, its believers more numerous than ever.\nInterpretation\n\nMesmer's career can be broken into two parts. When still in\nVienna, he clearly believed in the validity of his theory, and did all he\ncould to prove it. But his growing frustration and the disapproval of his\ncolleagues made him adopt another strategy. First he moved to Paris,\nwhere no one knew him, and where his extravagant theories found a\nmore fruitful soil. Then he appealed to the French love of theater and\nspectacle, making his apartment into a kind of magical world in which\na sensory overload of smells, sights, and sounds entranced his\ncustomers. Most important, from now on he practiced his magnetism\nonly on a group. The group provided the setting in which the\nmagnetism would have its proper effect, one believer infecting the\nother, overwhelming any individual doubter.\n\nMesmer thus passed from being a confirmed advocate of\nmagnetism to the role of a charlatan using every trick in the book to\ncaptivate the pub-\n\nlie. The biggest trick of all was to play on the repressed sexuality\nthat bubbles under the surface of any group setting. In a group, a\nlonging for social unity, a longing older than civilization, cries out to\nbe awakened. This desire may be subsumed under a unifying cause,\nbut beneath it is a repressed sexuality that the charlatan knows how to\nexploit and manipulate for his own purposes.\n\nThis is the lesson that Mesmer teaches us: Our tendency to doubt,\nthe distance that allows us to reason, is broken down when we join a\ngroup. The warmth and infectiousness of the group overwhelm the\nskeptical individual. This is the power you gain by creating a cult.\nAlso, by playing on people's repressed sexuality, you lead them into\n\nmistaking their excited feelings for signs of your mystical strength.\nYou gain untold power by working on people's unrealized desire for a\nkind of promiscuous and pagan unity.\n\nRemember too that the most effective cults mix religion with\nscience. Take the latest technological trend or fad and blend it with a\nnoble cause, a mystical faith, a new form of healing. People's\ninterpretations of your hybrid cult will run rampant, and they will\nattribute powers to you that you had never even thought to claim.\n\nImage: The Magnet. An unseen force draws objects to it, which in\nturn become magnetized themselves, drawing other pieces to them, the\nmagnetic power of toe whole constantly increasing. But take away the\noriginal magnet and it all falls apart. Become the magnet, the invisible\nforce that attracts people's imaginations and holds them together. Once\nthey have clustered around you, no power can wrest them away.\n\nAuthority: The charlatan achieves his great power by simply\nopening a possibility for men to believe what they already want to\nbelieve. . . . The credulous cannot keep at a distance; they crowd\naround the wonder worker, entering his personal aura, surrendering\nthemselves to illusion with a heavy solemnity, like cattle. (Grete de\nFrancesco)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nOne reason to create a following is that a group is often easier to\ndeceive than an individual, and turns over to you that much more\npower. This comes, however, with a danger: If at any moment the\ngroup sees through you, you will find yourself facing not one deceived\nsoul but an angry crowd that will tear you to pieces as avidly as it once\n\u2018ollowed you. The charlatans constantly faced this danger, and were\nalways ready to move out of town as it inevitably became clear that\ntheir elixirs did not work and their ideas were sham. Too slow and they\npaid with their lives. In playing with the crowd, you are playing with\n\u2018ire, and must constantly keep an eye out for any sparks of doubt, any\nenemies who will turn the crowd against you. When you play with the\nemotions of a crowd, you have to know how to adapt, attuning\nyourself instantaneously to all of the moods and desires that a group\nwill produce. Use spies, be on top of everything, and keep your bags\npacked.\n\n\nFor this reason you may often prefer to deal with people one by\none. Isolating them from their normal milieu can have the same effect\nas putting them in a groupit makes them more prone to suggestion and\nintimidation. Choose the right sucker and if he eventually sees through\nyou he may prove easier to escape than a crowd.\n'.

And this was in fact to occur, as science\nwas popularized, from the Renaissance on down through succeeding\ncenturies. With the immense growth of knowledge and its spread\nthrough printing in modern times, the mass of the half educated, the\neagerly gullible prey of the quack, also increased, became indeed a\nmajority; real power could be based on their wishes, opinions,\npreferences, and rejections. The charlatan's empire accordingly\nwidened with the modem dissemination of knowledge; since he\noperated on the basis of science, however much he perverted it,\nproducing gold with a technique borrowed from chemistry and his\nwonderful balsams with the apparatus of medicine, he could not appeal\nto an entirely ignorant folk.

This kind of power will lift\nyou to another realm: You will no longer have to struggle or use\nsubterfuge to enforce your will. You are adored and can do no wrong.\n\nYou might think it a gargantuan task to create such a following,\nbut in fact it is fairly simple. As humans, we have a desperate need to\nbelieve in something, anything. This makes us eminently gullible: We\nsimply cannot endure long periods of doubt, or of the emptiness that\ncomes from a lack of something to believe in. Dangle in front of us\nsome new cause, elixir, get-rich-quick scheme, or the latest\ntechnological trend or art movement and we leap from the water as one\nto take the bait. Look at history: The chronicles of the new trends and\ncults that have made a mass following for diem-selves could fill a\nlibrary. After a few centuries, a few decades, a few years, a few\nmonths, they generally look ridiculous, but at the time they seem so\nattractive, so transcendental, so divine.\n\nAlways in a rush to believe in something, we will manufacture\nsaints and faiths out of nothing. Do not let this gullibility go to waste:\nMake yourself the object of worship. Make people form a cult around\nyou.\n\nThe great European charlatans of the sixteenth and seventeenth\ncenturies mastered the art of cultmaking. They lived, as we do now, in\na time of transformation: Organized religion was on the wane, science\non the rise. People were desperate to rally around a new cause or faith.\nThe charlatans had begun by peddling health elixirs and alchemic\nshortcuts to wealth. Moving quickly from town to town, they\noriginally focused on small groupsuntil, by accident, they stumbled on\na truth of human nature: The larger the group they gathered around\nthemselves, the easier it was to deceive.\n\nThe charlatan would station himself on a high wooden platform\n(hence the term \u201cmountebank\u201d) and crowds would swarm around him.\nIn a group setting, people were more emotional, less able to reason.\nHad the charlatan spoken to them individually, they might have found\n\nhim ridiculous, but lost in a crowd they got caught up in a communal\nmood of rapt attention. It became impossible for them to find the\ndistance to be skeptical. Any deficiencies in the charlatan's ideas were\nhidden by the zeal of the mass. Passion and enthusiasm swept tiirough\nthe crowd like a contagion, and they reacted violently to anyone who\ndared to spread a seed of doubt. Both consciously studying this\ndynamic over decades of experiment and spontaneously adapting to\nthese situations as diey happened, the charlatans perfected the science\nof attracting and holding a crowd, molding die crowd into followers\nand die followers into a cult.\n\nThe gimmicks of the charlatans may seem quaint today, but there\nare thousands of charlatans among us still, using the same tried-and-\ntrue methods their predecessors refined centuries ago, only changing\ndie names of their elixirs and modernizing the look of their cults. We\nfind diese latter-day charlatans in all arenas of lifebusiness, fashion,\npolitics, art. Many of them, perhaps, are following in the charlatan\ntradition without having any knowledge of its history, but you can be\nmore systematic and deliberate. Simply follow die five steps of\ncultmaking that our charlatan ancestors perfected over the years.\n\nStep 1: Keep It Vague; Keep It Simple. To create a cult you must\nfirst attract attention. This you should do not through actions, which\nare too clear and readable, but through words, which are hazy and\ndeceptive. Your initial speeches, conversations, and interviews must\ninclude two elements: on uie one hand the promise of somediing great\nand transformative, and on die other a total vagueness. This\ncombination will stimulate all kinds of hazy dreams in your listeners,\nwho will make dieir own connections and see what they want to see.\n\nTo make your vagueness attractive, use words of great resonance\nbut cloudy meaning, words full of heat and enthusiasm. Fancy tides for\nsimple things are helpful, as are the use of numbers and the creation of\nnew words for vague concepts. All of these create the impression of\nspecialized knowledge, giving you a veneer of profundity. By the same\ntoken, try to make the subject of your cult new and fresh, so diat few\nwill understand it. Done right, the combination of vague promises,\ncloudy but alluring concepts, and fiery endiusiasm will stir people's\nsouls and a group will form around you.\n\nTalk too vaguely and you have no credibility. But it is more\ndangerous to be specific. If you explain in detail the benefits people\nwill gain by following your cult, you will be expected to satisfy mem.\n\nAs a corollary to its vagueness your appeal should also be simple.\nMost people's problems have complex causes: deep-rooted neurosis,\ninterconnected social factors, roots that go way back in time and are\nexceedingly hard to unravel. Few, however, have the patience to deal\nwith this; most people want to hear that a simple solution will cure\ntheir problems. The ability to offer mis kind of solution will give you\ngreat power and build you a following. Instead of the complicated\nexplanations of real life, retwm to die primitive solutions of our\nancestors, to good old country remedies, to mysterious panaceas.\n\nStep 2: Emphasize the Visual and the Sensual over the\nIntellectual.\n\nOnce people have begun to gadier around you, two dangers will\npresent themselves: boredom and skepticism. Boredom will make\npeople go elsewhere; skepticism will allow them the distance to think\nrationally about whatever it is you are offering, blowing away die mist\nyou have artfully created and revealing your ideas for what tiiey are.\nYou need to amuse the bored, then, and ward off die cynics.\n\nencountered science and education at some time, though briefly\nand unsuccessfully.... The great mass of mankind has always been\npredisposed to marvel at mysteries, and this was especially true at\ncertain historic periods when the secure foundations of life seemed\nshaken and old values, economic or spiritual, long accepted as\ncertainties, could no longer be relied upon. Then the numbers of the\ncharlatan's dupes multipliedthe \u201cself killers,\u201d as a seventeenth-century\nEnglishman called them.\n\nthe power of the\n\ncharlatan,\n\nGrete de Francesco,\n\nTHE OWI. WHO WAS GOD\n\nOnce upon a starless midnight there was an owl who sat on the\nbranch of an oak tree. Two ground moles tried to slip quietly by,\nunnoticed. \u201cYou!\u201dsaid the owl. \u201cWho\u201d they quavered, in fear and\nastonishment, for they could not believe it was possible for anyone to\nsee them in that thick darkness. \u201cYou two!\u201d said the owl. The moles\n\n\nhurried away and told the other creatures of the field and forest that the\nowl was the greatest and wisest of all animals because he could see in\nthe dark\n\nand because he could answer any question. \u201cI'll see about that,\u201d\nsaid a secretary bird, and he called on the owl one night when it was\nagain very dark. \u201cHow many claws am 1 holding up \u201d said the\nsecretary bird. \u201cTwo,\u201d said the owl, and that was right. \u201cCan you give\nme another expression for 'that is to say' or 'namely\u201d asked the\nsecretary bird. \u201cTo wit,\u201dsaid the owl. \u201cWhy does a lover call on his\nlove\u201d asked the secretary bird. \u201cTo woo,\u201d said the owl. The secretary\nbird hastened back to the other creatures and reported that the owl was\nindeed the greatest and wisest animal in the world because he could\nsee in the dark and because he could answer any question. \u201cCan he see\nin the daytime, too\u201d asked a red fox. \u201c Yes,\u201d echoed a dormouse and a\nFrench poodle. \u201cCan he see in the daytime, too\u201d All the other creatures\nlaughed loudly at this silly question, and they set upon the red fox and\nhis friends and drove them out of the region. Then they sent a\nmessenger to the owl and asked him to be their leader. When the owl\nappeared among the animals it was high noon and the sun was shining\nbrightly. He walked very slowly, which gave him an appearance of\ngreat dignity, and he peered about him with large, staring eyes, which\ngave him an air\n\nThe best way to do this is through theater, or other devices of its\nkind. Surround yourself widi luxury, dazzle your followers with visual\nsplendor, fill their eyes with spectacle. Not only will this keep them\nfrom seeing the ridiculousness of your ideas, the holes in your belief\nsystem, it will also attract more attention, more followers. Appeal to\nall the senses: Use incense for scent, soothing music for hearing,\ncolorful charts and graphs for die eye. You might even tickle the mind,\nperhaps by using new technological gadgets to give your cult a\npseudo-scientific veneeras long as you do not make anyone really\nthink. Use die exoticdistant cultures, strange customsto create\ndieatrical effects, and to make the most banal and ordinary affairs seem\nsigns of somediing extraordinary.\n\nStep 3: Borrow the Forms of Organized Religion to Structure the\nGroup. Your cultlike following is growing; it is time to organize it.\nFind a way both elevating and comforting. Organized religions have\n\n\nlong held unquestioned authority for large numbers of people, and\ncontinue to do so in our supposedly secular age. And even if the\nreligion itself has faded some, its forms still resonate with power. The\nlofty and holy associations of organized religion can be endlessly\nexploited. Create rituals for your followers; organize diem into a\nhierarchy, ranking them in grades of sanctity, and giving diem names\nand tides mat resound with religious overtones; ask diem for sacrifices\nmat will fill your coffers and increase your power. To emphasize your\ngadiering's quasi-religious nature, talk and act like a prophet. You are\nnot a dictator, after all; you are a priest, a guru, a sage, a shaman, or\nany odier word diat hides your real power in the mist of religion.\n\nStep 4: Disguise Your Source of Income. Your group has grown,\nand you have structured it in a churchlike form. Your coffers are\nbeginning to fill wim your followers' money. Yet you must never be\nseen as hungry for money and the power it brings. It is at diis moment\nthat you must disguise die source of your income.\n\nYour followers want to believe diat if they follow you all sorts of\ngood things will fall into dieir lap. By surrounding yourself widi\nluxury you become living proof of the soundness of your belief\nsystem. Never reveal that your wealth actually comes from your\nfollowers' pockets; instead, make it seem to come from die trum of\nyour mediods. Followers will copy your each and every move in die\nbelief mat it will bring diem the same results, and dieir imitative\nenthusiasm will blind diem to the charlatan nature of your wealdi.\n\nStep 5: Set Up an Us-Versus-Them Dynamic. The group is now\nlarge and diriving, a magnet attracting more and more particles. If you\nare not careful, though, inertia will set in, and time and boredom will\ndemagnetize die group. To keep your followers united, you must now\ndo what all religions and belief systems have done: create an us-\nversus-diem dynamic. First, make sure your followers believe they are\npart of an exclusive\n\nclub, unified by a bond of common goals. Then, to strengdien this\nbond, manufacture the notion of a devious enemy out to ruin you.\nThere is a force of nonbelievers that will do anything to stop you. Any\noutsider who tries to reveal the charlatan nature of your belief system\ncan now be described as a member of this devious force.\n\nIf you have no enemies, invent one. Given a straw man to react\nagainst, your followers will tighten and cohere. They have your cause\nto believe in and infidels to destroy.\n\nOBSERVANCES OF THE LAW\n\nObservance I\n\nIn the year 1653, a twenty-seven-year-old Milan man named\nFrancesco Giuseppe Borri claimed to have had a vision. He went\naround town telling one and all mat the archangel Michael had\nappeared to him and announced that he had been chosen to be the\ncapitano generate of the Army of the New Pope, an army that would\nseize and revitalize the world. The archangel had further revealed that\nBorri now had the power to see people's souls, and that he would soon\ndiscover the philosopher's stonea long-sought-after substance that\ncould change base metals into gold. Friends and acquaintances who\nheard Borri explain the vision, and who witnessed the change that had\ncome over him, were impressed, for Borri had previously devoted\nhimself to a life of wine, women, and gambling. Now he gave all that\nup, plunging himself into the study of alchemy and talking only of\nmysticism and the occult.\n\nThe transformation was so sudden and miraculous, and Borri's\nwords were so filled with enthusiasm, that he began to create a\nfollowing. Unfortunately the Italian Inquisition began to notice him as\nwellthey prosecuted anyone who delved into the occultso he left Italy\nand began to wander Europe, from Austria to Holland, telling one and\nall that \u201cto those who follow me all joy shall be granted.\u201d Wherever\nBorri stayed he attracted followers. His method was simple: He spoke\nof his vision, which had grown more and more elaborate, and offered\nto \u201clook into\u201d the soul of anyone who believed him (and they were\nmany). Seemingly in a trance, he would stare at this new follower for\nseveral minutes, then claim to have seen the person's soul, degree of\nenlightenment, and potential for spiritual greatness. If what he saw\nshowed promise, he would add the person to his growing order o\ndisciples, an honor indeed.\n\nThe cult had six degrees, into which the disciples were assigned\naccording to what Borri had glimpsed in their souls. With work and\ntotal devotion to the cult they could graduate to a higher degree.\nBorriwhom they called \u201cHis Excellency,\u201d and \u201cUniversal\n\n\nDoctor\u2019demanded from them die strictest vows of poverty. All the\ngoods and moneys they possessed had to be turned over to him. But\ndiey did not mind handing over their property, for Borri had told them,\n\"I shall soon bring my chemical\n\nof tremendous importance. \u201cHe's God!\u201d screamed a Plymouth\nRock hen. And the others took up the cry \u201cHe's God!\u201dSo they followed\nhim wherever he went and when he began to bump into things they\nbegan to bump into things, too. Finally he came to a concrete highway\nand he started up the middle of it and all the other creatures followed\nhim. Presently a hawk, who was acting as outrider, observed a truck\ncoming toward them at fifty miles an hour, and he reported to the\nsecretary bird and the secretary bird reported to the owl. \u201c There's\ndanger ahead,\u201d said the secretary bird. \u201c To wit \u201d said the owl. The\nsecretary bird told him. \u201cA ren 't you afraid \u201d He asked. \u201cWho\u201d said the\nowl calmly, for he could not see the truck. \u201cHe's God!\u201d cried all the\ncreatures again, and they were still crying \u201cHe's God!\u201d when the truck\nhit them and ran them down. Some of the animals were merely injured,\nbut most of them, including the owl, were killed.

[Graham]\nmaintained a show of great scientific technique. In 1772 ... he had\n\nvisited Philadelphia, where he met Benjamin Franklin and became\ninterested in the latter's experiments with electricity. These appear to\nhave inspired the apparatus in the \u201cTemple of Health,\u201d\n\nstudies to a happy conclusion by the discovery of the\nphilosopher's stone, and by this means we shall all have as much gold\nas we desire.\"\n\nGiven his growing wealtii, Borri began to change his style of\nliving. Renting the most splendid apartment in the city into which he\nhad temporarily setded, he would furnish it with fabulous furniture and\naccessories, which he had begun to collect. He would drive through the\ncity in a coach studded with jewels, with six magnificent black horses\nat its head. He never stayed too long in one place, and when he\ndisappeared, saying he had more souls to gather into his flock, his\nreputation only grew in his absence. He became famous, although in\nact he had never done a single concrete thing.\n\nFrom all over Europe, the blind, the crippled, and the desperate\ncame to visit Borri, for word had spread that he had healing powers.\nHe asked no fee for his services, which only made him seem more\nmarvelous, and indeed some claimed tfiat in this or mat city he had\n\nperformed a miracle cure.

The Church continued to pursue him, denouncing\nhim for heresy and witchcraft, and Borri's response to these charges\nwas a dignified silence; this only enhanced his reputation and made his\nollowers more passionate. Only die great are persecuted, after all;\nhow many understood Jesus Christ in his own time Borri did not have\nto say a wordhis followers now called the Pope the Antichrist.\n\nAnd so Borri's power grew and grew, until one day he left the city\nof Amsterdam (where he had setded for a while), absconding with\nhuge sums of borrowed money and diamonds that had been entrusted\nto him. (He claimed to be able to remove the flaws from diamonds\nthrough the power of his gifted mind.) Now he was on the run. The\nInquisition eventually caught up with him, and for the last twenty\nyears of his life he was imprisoned in Rome. But so great was the\n\n\nbelief in his occult powers that to his dying day he was visited by\nwealthy believers, including Queen Christina of Sweden. Supplying\nhim with money and materials, diese visitors allowed him to continue\nhis search for die elusive philosopher's stone. Interpretation\n\nBefore he formed his cult, Borri seems to have stumbled on a\ncritical discovery. Tiring of his life of debauchery, he had decided to\ngive it up and to devote himself to the occult, a genuine interest of his.\nHe must have noticed, however, mat when he alluded to a mystical\nexperience (rather than physical exhaustion) as die source of his\nconversion, people of all classes wanted to hear more. Realizing the\npower he could gain by ascribing the change to sometiiing external and\nmysterious, he went further widi his manufactured visions. The\ngrander the vision, and the more sacrifices he asked for, die more\nappealing and believable his story seemed to become.\n\nRemember: People are not interested in die trutii about change.\nThey\n\ndo not want to hear that it has come from hard work, or from\nanything as banal as exhaustion, boredom, or depression; they are\ndying to believe in something romantic, otherworldly. They want to\nhear of angels and out-of-body experiences. Indulge them. Hint at the\nmystical source of some personal change, wrap it in ethereal colors,\nand a cuklike following will form around you. Adapt to people's needs:\nThe messiah must mirror the desires of his followers. And always aim\nhigh. The bigger and bolder your illusion, the better.\n\nObservance II\n\nIn the mid-1700s, word spread in Europe's fashionable society of\na Swiss country doctor named Michael Schiippach who practiced a\ndifferent kind of medicine: He used the healing powers of nature to\nperform miraculous cures. Soon well-to-do people from all over the\nContinent, their ailments both serious and mild, were making the trek\nto the alpine village of Lang-nau, where Schiippach lived and worked.\nTrudging tiirough the mountains, these visitors witnessed the most\ndramatic natural landscapes that Europe has to offer. By the time they\nreached Langnau, they were already feeling transformed and on their\nway to health.\n\nSchiippach, who had become known as simply the \u201cMountain\nDoctor,\u201d had a small pharmacy in town. This place became quite a\n\n\nscene: Crowds of people from many different countries would cram\nthe small room, its walls lined with colorful bottles filled with herbal\ncures. Where most doctors of the time prescribed foul-tasting\nconcoctions that bore incomprehensible Latin titles (as medicines often\ndo still), Schiippach's cures had names such as \u201cThe Oil of Joy,\u201d\n\u201cLittle Flower's Heart,\u201d or \u201cAgainst the Monster,\u201d and they tasted\nsweet and pleasing.\n\nVisitors to Langnau would have to wait patiently for a visit with\nthe Mountain Doctor, because every day some eighty messengers\nwould arrive at the pharmacy bearing flasks of urine from all over\nEurope. Schiippach claimed he could diagnose what ailed you simply\nby looking at a sample of your urine and reading a written description\nof your ailment. (Naturally he read the description very carefully\nbefore prescribing a cure.) When he finally had a spare minute (the\nurine samples took up much of his time), he would call the visitor into\nhis office in the pharmacy. He would then examine this person's urine\nsample, explaining that its appearance would tell him everything he\nneeded to know. Country people had a sense for these things, he would\nsaytheir wisdom came from living a simple, godly life with none of the\ncomplications of urban living. This personal consultation would also\ninclude a discussion as to how one might bring one's soul more into\nharmony with nature.\n\nSchiippach had devised many forms of treatment, each\nprofoundly unlike the usual medical practices of the time. He was a\nbeliever, for instance, in electric shock tiierapy. To those who\nwondered whether this was in keeping with his belief in the healing\npower of nature, he would explain that electricity is a natural\nphenomenon; he was merely imitating the\n\nthe fabulous establishment he opened in London for the sale of\nhis elixirs... In the chief room, where he received patients, stood \u201cthe\nlargest air pump in the world \u201d to assist him in his \u201cphilosophical\ninvestigations\u201d into disease, and also a \u201cstupendous metallic\nconductor,\u201d a richly gilded pedestal surrounded with retorts and vials\nof \u201cetherial and other essences. \u201d .. .According to J. Ennemoser, who\npublished a history of magic in 1844 at Leipzig, Graham's \u201chouse ...\nunited the useful with the pleasurable. Everywhere the utmost\nmagnificence was displayed. Even in the outer court, averred an eye-\n\n\nwitness, it seemed as though art, invention, and riches had been\nexhausted. On the side walls in the chambers an arc-shaped glow was\nprovided by artificial electric light; star rays darted forth; transparent\nglasses of all colors were placed with clever selection and much taste.\nAll this, the same eyewitness assures us, was ravishing and exalted the\nimagination to the highest degree.\u201d Visitors were given a printed sheet\nof rules for healthy living. In the Great Apollo Apartment they might\njoin in mysterious rituals, accompanied by chants: \u201cHail, Vital Air,\naethereal! Magnetic Magic, hail!\u201d And while they hailed the\n\nmagic of magnetism, the windows were darkened, revealing a\nceiling studded with electric stars and a young and lovely \u201cRosy\nGoddess of Health \u201d in a niche.... Every evening this Temple of Health\nwas crowded with guests; it had become the fashion to visit it and try\nthe great twelve-foot bed of state, the \u201cGrand Celestial Bed, \u201d said to\ncure any disease. . . . This bed, according to Ennemoser, \u201cstood in a\nsplendid room, into which a cylinder led from an adjoining chamber to\nconduct the healing currents ... at the same time all sorts of pleasing\nscents of strengthening herbs and Oriental incense were also brought\nin through glass tubes. The heavenly bed itself rested upon six solid\ntransparent pillars; the bedclothes were of purple and sky-blue Atlas\nsilk, spread over a mattress saturated with Arabian perfumed waters to\nsuit the tastes of the Persian court. The chamber in which it was placed\nhe called the Sanctum Sanctorum. ... To add to all this, there were the\nmelodious notes of the harmonica, soft flutes, agreeable voices, and a\ngreat organ.\u201d\n\nthe power of the\n\ncharlatan,\n\nCrete de Francesco,\n\npower of lightning. One of his patients claimed to be inhabited by\nseven devils. The doctor cured him with electrical shocks, and as he\nadministered these he exclaimed that he could see the devils flying out\nof the man's body, one by one. Another man claimed to have\nswallowed a hay wagon and its driver, which were causing him\nmassive pains in the chest. The Mountain Doctor listened patientiy,\nclaimed to be able to hear the crack of a whip in the man's belly,\npromised to cure him, and gave him a sedative and a purgative. The\nman fell asleep on a chair outside the pharmacy. As soon as he awoke\n\nhe vomited, and as he vomited a hay wagon sped past him (the\nMountain Doctor had hired it for die occasion), the crack of its whip\nmaking him feel that somehow he had indeed expelled it under die\ndoctor's care.\n\nOver die years, the Mountain Doctor's fame grew. He was\nconsulted by the powerfuleven the writer Goethe made die trek to his\nvillageand he became the center of a cult of nature in which everything\nnatural was considered worthy of worship. Schiippach was careful to\ncreate effects mat would entertain and inspire his patients. A professor\nwho visited him once wrote, \u201cOne stands or sits in company, one plays\ncards, sometimes with a young woman; now a concert is given, now a\nlunch or supper, and now a litde ballet is presented. Widi a very happy\neffect, die freedom of nature is everywhere united widi die pleasures of\ndie beau monde, and if the doctor is not able to heal any diseases, he\ncan at least cure hypochondria and die vapors.\u201d Interpretation\n\nSchiippach had begun his career as an ordinary village doctor. He\nwould sometimes use in his practice some of the village remedies he\nhad grown up with, and apparendy he noticed some results, for soon\ndiese herbal tinctures and natural forms of healing became his\nspecialty. And in fact his natural form of healing did have profound\npsychological effects on his patients. Where die normal drugs of the\ntime created fear and pain, Schiip-pach's treatments were comfortable\nand soothing. The resulting improvement in die patient's mood was a\ncritical element in the cures he brought about. His patients believed so\ndeeply in his skills that they willed diem-selves into health. Instead of\nscoffing at their irrational explanations for their ailments, Schiippach\nused their hypochondria to make it seem that he had effected a great\ncure.\n\nThe case of die Mountain Doctor teaches us valuable lessons in\ndie creation of a cultiike following. First, you must find a way to\nengage people's will, to make dieir belief in your powers strong\nenough that they imagine all sorts of benefits. Their belief will have a\nself-fulfilling quality, but you must make sure that it is you, rather than\ndieir own will, who is seen as the agent of transformation. Find die\nbelief, cause, or fantasy that will make diem believe widi a passion and\ntiiey will imagine die rest, worshipping you as healer, prophet, genius,\nwhatever you like.\n\nSecond, Schiippach teaches us the everlasting power of belief in\nnature, and in simplicity. Nature, in reality, is full of much tiiat is\nterrifying poisonous plants, fierce animals, sudden disasters, plagues.\nBelief in die\n\nhealing, comforting quality of nature is really a constructed myth,\na romanticism. But the appeal to nature can bring you great power,\nespecially in complicated and stressful times.\n\nThis appeal, however, must be handled right. Devise a kind of\ntheater of nature in which you, as the director, pick and choose the\nqualities that fit the romanticism of the times. The Mountain Doctor\nplayed the part to perfection, playing up his homespun wisdom and\nwit, and staging his cures as dramatic pieces. He did not make himself\none with nature; instead he molded nature into a cult, an artificial\nconstruction. To create a \u201cnatural\u201d effect you actually have to work\nhard, making nature theatrical and delightfully pagan. Otherwise no\none will notice. Nature too must follow trends and be progressive.\n\nObservance III\n\nIn 1788, at the age of fifty-five, the doctor and scientist Franz\nMesmer was at a crossroads. He was a pioneer in the study of animal\nmagnetismthe belief that animals contain magnetic matter, and that a\ndoctor or specialist can effect miraculous cures by working on this\ncharged substancebut in Vienna, where he lived, his theories had met\nwith scorn and ridicule from the medical establishment. In treating\nwomen for convulsions, Mesmer claimed to have worked a number of\ncures, his proudest achievement being the restoration of sight to a\nblind girl. But another doctor who examined the young girl said she\nwas as blind as ever, an assessment with which she herself agreed.\nMesmer countered that his enemies were out to slander him by\nwinning her over to their side. This claim only elicited more ridicule.\nClearly the sober-minded Viennese were the wrong audience for his\ntheories, and so he decided to move to Paris and start again.\n\nRenting a splendid apartment in his new city, Mesmer decorated it\nappropriately. Stained glass in most of the windows created a religious\nfeeling, and mirrors on all the walls produced an hypnotic effect. The\ndoctor advertised that in his apartment he would give demonstrations\nof the powers of animal magnetism, inviting the diseased and\nmelancholic to feel its powers. Soon Parisians of all classes (but\n\nmostiy women, who seemed more attracted to the idea than men did)\nwere paying for entry to witness the miracles that Mesmer promised.\n\nInside the apartment, the scents of orange blossom and exotic\nincense wafted through special vents. As the initiates filtered into the\nsalon where the demonstrations took place, they heard harp music and\nthe lulling sounds of a female vocalist coming from another room. In\nthe center of the salon was a long oval container filled with water that\nMesmer claimed had been magnetized. From holes in the container's\nmetal lid protruded long movable iron rods. The visitors were\ninstructed to sit around the container, place these magnetized rods on\nthe body part that gave them pains or problems, and then hold hands\nwith their neighbors, sitting as close as possible to one another to help\nthe magnetic force pass between their bodies. Sometimes, too, they\nwere attached to each other by cords.\n\nMesmer would leave the room, and \u201cassistant magnetizers\u201dall\nhand-\n\nIn the town of Tarnopol lived a man by the name of Reb Feivel.\nOne day, as he sat in his house deeply absorbed in his Talmud, he\nheard a loud noise outside. When he went to the window he saw a lot\nof little pranksters. \u201cUp to some new piece of mischief, no doubt,\u201d he\nthought.\n\n\u201cChildren, run quickly to the synagogue,\u201d he cried, leaning out\nand improvising the first story that occurred to him. \u201c You 'II see there\na sea monster, and what a monster! It's a creature with five feet, three\neyes, and a beard like that of a goat, only it's green!\u201d\n\nAnd sure enough the children scampered off and Reb Feivel\nreturned to his studies. He smiled into his beard as he thought of the\ntrick he had played on those little rascals. It wasn 't long before his\nstudies were interrupted again, this time by running footsteps. When\nhe went to the window he saw several Jews running. \u201cWhere are you\nrunning\u201d he called out.\n\n\u201cTo the synagogue!\u201d answered the Jews. \u201cHaven'tyou heard\nThere's a sea monster, there's a creature with five legs, three eyes, and\na beard like that of a goat, only it's green!\u201d Reb Feivel laughed with\nglee, thinking of the trick he had played,\n\nand sat down again to his Talmud. But no sooner had he begun to\nconcentrate when suddenly he heard a dinning tumult outside. And\n\nwhat did he see A great crowd of men, women and children, all\nrunning toward the synagogue. \u201cWhat's up\u201d he cried, sticking his head\nout of the window. \u201c What a question! Why, don't you know\u201d they\nanswered. \u201cRight in front of the synagogue there 's a sea monster. It's a\ncreature with five legs, three eyes, and a beard like that of a goat, only\nit's green!\u201d And as the crowd hurried by, Reb Feivel suddenly noticed\nthat the rabbi himself was among them. \u201cLord of the world!\u201d he\nexclaimed. \u201cIf the rabbi himself is running with them surely there must\nbe something happening. Where there's smoke there's fire!\u201d Without\nfurther thought Reb Feivel grabbed his hat, left his house, and also\nbegan running. \u201cWho can tell\u201d he muttered to himself as he ran, all out\nof breath, toward the synagogue.\n\na treasury of\n\njewish folklore,\n\nsome and strapping young menwould enter with jars of\nmagnetized water that they would sprinkle on the patients, rubbing the\nhealing fluid on their bodies, massaging it into their skin, moving them\ntoward a trancelike state. And after a few minutes a kind of delirium\nwould overcome the women. Some would sob, some would shriek and\ntear their hair, others would laugh hysterically. At the height of the\ndelirium Mesmer would reenter the salon, dressed in a flowing silk\nrobe embroidered with golden flowers and carrying a white magnetic\nrod. Moving around the container, he would stroke and soothe the\npatients until calm was restored. Many women would later attribute the\nstrange power he had on them to his piercing look, which, they\nthought, was exciting or quieting the magnetic fluids in their bodies.\n\nWithin months of his arrival in Paris, Mesmer became the rage.\nHis supporters included Marie-Antoinette herself, the queen of France,\nwife of Louis XVI. As in Vienna, he was condemned by the official\nfaculty of medicine, but it did not matter. His growing following of\npupils and patients paid him handsomely.\n\nMesmer expanded his theories to proclaim that all humanity could\nbe brought into harmony through the power of magnetism, a concept\nwith much appeal during the French Revolution. A cult of Mesmerism\nspread across the country; in many towns, \u201cSocieties of Harmony\u201d\nsprang up to experiment with magnetism. These societies eventually\n\nbecame notorious: They tended to be led by libertines who would turn\ntheir sessions into a kind of group orgy.\n\nAt the height of Mesmer's popularity, a French commission\npublished a report based on years of testing the theory of animal\nmagnetism. The conclusion: Magnetism's effects on the body actually\ncame from a kind of group hysteria and autosuggestion. The report\nwas well documented, and ruined Mesmer's reputation in France. He\nleft the country and went into retirement. Only a few years later,\nhowever, imitators sprang up all over Europe and the cult of\nMesmerism spread once again, its believers more numerous than ever.\nInterpretation\n\nMesmer's career can be broken into two parts. When still in\nVienna, he clearly believed in the validity of his theory, and did all he\ncould to prove it. But his growing frustration and the disapproval of his\ncolleagues made him adopt another strategy. First he moved to Paris,\nwhere no one knew him, and where his extravagant theories found a\nmore fruitful soil. Then he appealed to the French love of theater and\nspectacle, making his apartment into a kind of magical world in which\na sensory overload of smells, sights, and sounds entranced his\ncustomers. Most important, from now on he practiced his magnetism\nonly on a group. The group provided the setting in which the\nmagnetism would have its proper effect, one believer infecting the\nother, overwhelming any individual doubter.\n\nMesmer thus passed from being a confirmed advocate of\nmagnetism to the role of a charlatan using every trick in the book to\ncaptivate the pub-\n\nlie. The biggest trick of all was to play on the repressed sexuality\nthat bubbles under the surface of any group setting. In a group, a\nlonging for social unity, a longing older than civilization, cries out to\nbe awakened. This desire may be subsumed under a unifying cause,\nbut beneath it is a repressed sexuality that the charlatan knows how to\nexploit and manipulate for his own purposes.\n\nThis is the lesson that Mesmer teaches us: Our tendency to doubt,\nthe distance that allows us to reason, is broken down when we join a\ngroup. The warmth and infectiousness of the group overwhelm the\nskeptical individual. This is the power you gain by creating a cult.\nAlso, by playing on people's repressed sexuality, you lead them into\n\nmistaking their excited feelings for signs of your mystical strength.\nYou gain untold power by working on people's unrealized desire for a\nkind of promiscuous and pagan unity.\n\nRemember too that the most effective cults mix religion with\nscience. Take the latest technological trend or fad and blend it with a\nnoble cause, a mystical faith, a new form of healing. People's\ninterpretations of your hybrid cult will run rampant, and they will\nattribute powers to you that you had never even thought to claim.\n\nImage: The Magnet. An unseen force draws objects to it, which in\nturn become magnetized themselves, drawing other pieces to them, the\nmagnetic power of toe whole constantly increasing. But take away the\noriginal magnet and it all falls apart. Become the magnet, the invisible\nforce that attracts people's imaginations and holds them together. Once\nthey have clustered around you, no power can wrest them away.\n\nAuthority: The charlatan achieves his great power by simply\nopening a possibility for men to believe what they already want to\nbelieve. . . . The credulous cannot keep at a distance; they crowd\naround the wonder worker, entering his personal aura, surrendering\nthemselves to illusion with a heavy solemnity, like cattle. (Grete de\nFrancesco)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nOne reason to create a following is that a group is often easier to\ndeceive than an individual, and turns over to you that much more\npower. This comes, however, with a danger: If at any moment the\ngroup sees through you, you will find yourself facing not one deceived\nsoul but an angry crowd that will tear you to pieces as avidly as it once\n\u2018ollowed you. The charlatans constantly faced this danger, and were\nalways ready to move out of town as it inevitably became clear that\ntheir elixirs did not work and their ideas were sham. Too slow and they\npaid with their lives. In playing with the crowd, you are playing with\n\u2018ire, and must constantly keep an eye out for any sparks of doubt, any\nenemies who will turn the crowd against you. When you play with the\nemotions of a crowd, you have to know how to adapt, attuning\nyourself instantaneously to all of the moods and desires that a group\nwill produce. Use spies, be on top of everything, and keep your bags\npacked.\n\n\nFor this reason you may often prefer to deal with people one by\none. Isolating them from their normal milieu can have the same effect\nas putting them in a groupit makes them more prone to suggestion and\nintimidation. Choose the right sucker and if he eventually sees through\nyou he may prove easier to escape than a crowd.\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Below is an excerpt from my book titled '48 Laws of Power', specifically from Chapter '48 Laws of Power', Section 'LAW 28'. The original text is: 'ENTER ACTION WITH BOLDNESS\n\nJUDGMENT\n\nIf you are unsure of a course of action, do not attempt it. Your\ndoubts and hesitations will infect your execution. Timidity is\ndangerous: Better to enter with boldness. Any mistakes you commit\nthrough audacity are easily corrected with more audacity. Everyone\nadmires the bold; no one honors the timid.\n\nThe path of pleasure never leads to glory! The prodigious\nachievements of Hercules were the result of high adventure, and\nthough there is little, either in fable or history, to show that he had any\nrivals, still it is recorded that a knight errant, in company with a fellow\nadventurer, sought his fortune in a romantic country. He had not\ntraveled far when his companion observed a post, on which was\nwritten the following inscription: \u201cBrave adventurer, if you have a\ndesire to discover that which has never been seen by any knight errant,\nyou have only to pass this torrent, and then take in your arms an\nelephant of stone and carry it in one breath to the summit of this\nmountain, whose noble head seems blended with the sky.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201dsaid\nthe knight's companion, \u201cthe water may be deep as well as rapid, and\nthough, notwithstanding, we should pass it, why should we be\nencumbered with the elephant What a ridiculous undertaking!\u201d And\nphilosophically and with nice calculation, he observed that the\nelephant might be carried four steps; but for conveying it to the top of\nthe mountain in one breath, that was not in the power of a mortal,\nunless it should\n\nBOLDNESS AND HESITATION: A Brief Psychological\nComparison Boldness and hesitation elicit very different psychological\nresponses in their targets: Hesitation puts obstacles in your path,\nboldness eliminates them. Once you understand this, you will find it\nessential to overcome your natural timidity and practice the art of\n\n\naudacity. The following are among the most pronounced psychological\neffects of boldness and timidity.\n\nThe Bolder the Lie the Better. We all have weaknesses, and our\nefforts are never perfect. But entering action with boldness has the\nmagical effect of hiding our deficiencies. Con artists know that the\nbolder the lie, the more convincing it becomes. The sheer audacity of\nthe story makes it more credible, distracting attention from its\ninconsistencies. When putting together a con or entering any kind of\nnegotiation, go further than you planned. Ask for the moon and you\nwill be surprised how often you get it.\n\nLions Circle the Hesitant Prey. People have a sixth sense for the\nweaknesses of others. If, in a first encounter, you demonstrate your\nwillingness to compromise, back down, and retreat, you bring out the\nlion even in people who are not necessarily bloodthirsty. Everything\ndepends on perception, and once you are seen as the kind of person\nwho quickly goes on die defensive, who is willing to negotiate and be\namenable, you will be pushed around without mercy.\n\nBoldness Strikes Fear; Fear Creates Authority. The bold move\nmakes you seem larger and more powerful than you are. If it comes\nsuddenly, with die stealth and swiftness of a snake, it inspires diat\nmuch more fear. By intimidating with a bold move, you establish a\nprecedent: in every subsequent encounter, people will be on the\ndefensive, in terror of your next strike.\n\nGoing Halfway with Half a Heart Digs the Deeper Grave. If you\n\nenter an action with less than total confidence, you set up\nobstacles in your own path. When a problem arises you will grow\nconfused, seeing options where there are none and inadvertendy\ncreating more problems still. Retreating from the hunter, the timid hare\nscurries more easily into his snares.\n\nHesitation Creates Gaps, Boldness Obliterates Them. When you\ntake time to diink, to hem and haw, you create a gap that allows others\ntime to think as well. Your timidity infects people with awkward\nenergy, elicits embarrassment. Doubt springs up on all sides.\n\nBoldness destroys such gaps. The swiftness of die move and die\nenergy of the action leave others no space to doubt and worry. In\nseduction, hesitation is fatalit makes your victim conscious of your\n\n\nintentions. The bold move crowns seduction with triumph: It leaves no\ntime for reflection.\n\nAudacity Separates You from the Herd. Boldness gives you\npresence and makes you seem larger than life. The timid fade into the\nwallpaper, the\n\nbold draw attention, and what draws attention draws power. We\ncannot keep our eyes off the audaciouswe cannot wait to see their next\nbold move.\n\nOBSERVANCES OF THE LAW\n\nObservance I\n\nIn May of 1925, five of the most successful dealers in the French\nscrap-metal business found themselves invited to an \u201cofficial\u201d but\n\u201chighly confidential\u201d meeting with the deputy director general of the\nMinistry of Post and Telegraphs at the Hotel Crillon, then the most\nluxurious hotel in Paris. When the businessmen arrived, it was the\ndirector general himself, a Monsieur Lustig, who met diem in a swank\nsuite on the top floor.\n\nThe businessmen had no idea why they had been summoned to\nthis meeting, and they were bursting with curiosity. After drinks, the\ndirector explained. \u201cGendemen,\u201d he said, \u201cfhis is an urgent matter that\nrequires complete secrecy. The government is going to have to tear\ndown the Eiffel Tower.\u201d The dealers listened in stunned silence as the\ndirector explained that the tower, as recendy reported in the news,\ndesperately needed repairs. It had originally been meant as a temporary\nstructure (for the Exposition of 1889), its maintenance costs had soared\nover the years, and now, in a time of a fiscal crisis, the government\nwould have to spend millions to fix it. Many Parisians considered the\nEiffel Tower an eyesore and would be delighted to see it go. Over\ntime, even the tourists would forget about itit would live on in\nphotographs and postcards. \u201cGendemen,\u201d Lustig said, \u201cyou are all\ninvited to make the government an offer for the Eiffel Tower.\u201d\n\nHe gave the businessmen sheets of government stationery filled\nwith figures, such as the tonnage of the tower's metal. Their eyes\npopped as they calculated how much tiiey could make from the scrap.\nThen Lustig led them to a waiting limo, which brought them to the\nEiffel Tower. Flashing an official badge, he guided mem through the\narea, spicing his tour witii amusing anecdotes. At the end of the visit\n\n\nhe thanked them and asked them to have fheir offers delivered to his\nsuite within four days.\n\nSeveral days after the offers were submitted, one of the five, a\nMonsieur P., received notice that his bid was the winner, and diat to\nsecure fhe sale he should come to the suite at the hotel within two\ndays, bearing a certified check for more than 250,000 francs (the\nequivalent today of about $1,000,000)a quarter of the toted price. On\ndelivery of the check, he would receive the documents confirming his\nownership of the Eiffel Tower. Monsieur P. was excitedhe would go\ndown in history as the man who had bought and torn down the\ninfamous landmark. But by the time he arrived at the suite, check in\nhand, he was beginning to have doubts about the whole affair. Why\nmeet in a hotel instead of a government building Why hadn't he heard\nfrom other officials Was diis a hoax, a scam As he listened to Lustig\ndiscuss die arrangements for the scrapping of the tower, he hesitated,\nand contemplated backing out.\n\nbe the dwarf figure of an elephant, fit only to be placed on the top\nof a stick; and then what honor would there be in such an adventure\n\u201cThere is,\u201dsaid he, \u201csome deception in this writing. It is an enigma\nonly fit to amuse a child. I shall therefore leave you and your\nelephant.\u201d The reasoner then departed; but the adventurous man rushed\nwith his eyes closed across the water; neither depth nor violence\nprevented him, and according to the inscription he saw the elephant\nlying on the opposite bank. He took it and carried it to the top of the\nhill, where he saw a town. A shriek from the elephant alarmed the\npeople of the city, who rose in arms; but the adventurer, nothing\ndaunted, was determined to die a hero. The people, however, were\nawed by his presence, and he was astonished to hear them proclaim\nhim successor to their king, who had recently died. Great enterprises\nare only achieved by adventurous spirits. They who calculate with too\ngreat nicety every difficulty and obstacle which is likely to lie in their\nway, lose that time in hesitation, which the more daring seize and\nrender available to the loftiest purposes.\n\nFABLES,\n\nJean de La Fontaine, 1621-1695\n\nAlways set to work without misgivings on the score of\nimprudence. Fear of failure in the mind of a performer is, for an\n\nonlooker, already evidence of failure... Actions are dangerous when\nthere is doubt as to their wisdom; it would be safer to do nothing.\n\nBaltasar Gracian, 1601-1658\n\nIn a lowly thatched cottage in the Namsan Valley there lived a\npoor couple, Mr. and Mrs. Huh Saeng. The husband confined himself\nfor seven years and only read books in his cold room.... One day his\nwife, all in tears, said to him: \u201cLook here, my good man! What is the\nuse of all your book reading I have spent my youth in washing and\nsewing for other people and yet I have no spare jacket or skirt to wear\nand I have had no food to eat during the past three days. I am hungry\nand cold. I can stand it no more!\u201d ... Hearing these words, the middle-\naged scholar closed his book ... rose to his feet and ... without saying\nanother word, he went out of doors. . . Arriving in the heart of the\n\nSuddenly, however, he realized that the director had changed his\ntone. Instead of talking about the tower, he was complaining about his\nlow salary, about his wife's desire for a fur coat, about how galling it\nwas to work hard and be unappreciated. It dawned on Monsieur P. that\nthis high government official was asking for a bribe. The effect on\nhim, though, was not outrage but relief. Now he was sure that Lustig\nwas for real, since in all of his previous encounters with French\nbureaucrats, they had inevitably asked for a little greasing of the palm.\nHis confidence restored, Monsieur P. slipped the director several\nthousand francs in bills, then handed him the certified check. In return\nhe received the documentation, including an impressive-looking bill of\nsale. He left the hotel, dreaming of the profits and fame to come.\n\nOver the next few days, however, as Monsieur P. waited for\ncorrespondence from the government, he began to realize that\nsomething was amiss. A few telephone calls made it clear that there\nwas no deputy director general Lustig, and there were no plans to\ndestroy the Eiffel Tower: He had been bilked of over 250,000 francs!\n\nMonsieur P. never went to the police. He knew what kind of\nreputation he would get if word got out that he had fallen for one of the\nmost absurdly audacious cons in history. Besides the public\nhumiliation, it would have been business suicide. Interpretation\n\nHad Count Victor Lustig, con artist extraordinaire, tried to sell the\nArc de Triomphe, a bridge over the Seine, a statue of Balzac, no one\nwould have believed him. But the Eiffel Tower was just too large, too\n\nimprobable to be part of a con job. In fact it was so improbable that\nLustig was able to return to Paris six months later and \u201cresell\u201d the\nEiffel Tower to a different scrap-iron dealer, and for a higher pricea\nsum in francs equivalent today to over $1,500,000!\n\nLargeness of scale deceives the human eye. It distracts and awes\nus, and is so self-evident that we cannot imagine there is any illusion\nor deception afoot. Arm yourself with bigness and boldnessstretch\nyour deceptions as far as they will go and then go further. If you sense\nthat the sucker has suspicions, do as the intrepid Lustig did: Instead of\nbacking down, or lowering his price, he simply raised his price higher,\nby asking for and getting a bribe. Asking for more puts the other\nperson on the defensive, cuts out the nibbling effect of compromise\nand doubt, and overwhelms with its boldness.\n\nObservance II\n\nOn his deathbed in 1533, Vasily III, the Grand Duke of Moscow\nand ruler of a semi-united Russia, proclaimed his three-year-old son,\nIvan IV, as his successor. He appointed his young wife, Helena, as\nregent until Ivan reached his majority and could rule on his own. The\naristocracythe bo-yarssecretly rejoiced: For years the dukes of\nMoscow had been trying to extend their authority over the boyars' turf.\nWith Vasily dead, his heir a mere three years old, and a young woman\nin charge of the dukedom, die\n\nboyars would be able to roll back the dukes' gains, wrest control\nof the state, and humiliate the royal family.\n\nAware of these dangers, young Helena turned to her trusted friend\nPrince Ivan Obolensky to help her rule. But after five years as regent\nshe suddenly diedpoisoned by a member of the Shuisky family, the\nmost fearsome boyar clan. The Shuisky princes seized control of the\ngovernment and threw Obolensky in prison, where he starved to death.\nAt the age of eight, Ivan was now a despised orphan, and any boyar or\nfamily member who took an interest in him was immediately banished\nor killed.\n\nAnd so Ivan roamed the palace, hungry, ill clothed, and often in\nhiding from the Shuiskys, who treated him roughly when they saw\nhim. On some days they would search him out, clothe him in royal\nrobes, hand him a scepter, and set him on the thronea kind of mock\nritual in which they lampooned his royal pretensions. Then they would\n\n\nshoo him away. One evening several of them chased the\nMetropolitanthe head of the Russian churchthrough the palace, and he\nsought refuge in Ivan's room; the boy watched in horror as the\nShuiskys entered, hurled insults, and beat the Metropolitan mercilessly.\n\nIvan had one friend in the palace, a boyar named Vorontsov who\nconsoled and advised him. One day, however, as he, Vorontsov, and the\nnewest Metropolitan conferred in the palace refectory, several\nShuiskys burst in, beat up Vorontsov, and insulted the Metropolitan by\ntearing and treading on his robes. Then they banished Vorontsov from\nMoscow.\n\nThroughout all this Ivan maintained a strict silence. To the boyars\nit seemed that their plan had worked: The young man had turned into a\nterrified and obedient idiot. They could ignore him now, even leave\nhim alone. But on the evening of December 29, 1543, Ivan, now\nthirteen, asked Prince Andrei Shuisky to come to his room. When the\nprince arrived, the room was filled with palace guards. Young Ivan\nthen pointed his finger at Andrei and ordered the guards to arrest him,\nhave him killed, and throw his body to the bloodhounds in the royal\nkennel. Over the next few days Ivan had all of Andrei's close\nassociates arrested and banished. Caught off-guard by his sudden\nboldness, the boyars now stood in mortal terror of this youth, the\nfuture Ivan the Terrible, who had planned and waited for five years to\nexecute this one swift and bold act that would secure his power for\ndecades to come. Interpretation\n\nThe world is full of boyarsmen who despise you, fear your\nambition, and jealously guard their shrinking realms of power. You\nneed to establish your authority and gain respect, but the moment the\nboyars sense your growing boldness, they will act to thwart you. This\nis how Ivan met such a situation: He lay low, showing neither ambition\nnor discontent. He waited, and when the time came he brought the\npalace guards over to his side. The guards had come to hate the cruel\nShuiskys. Once they agreed to Ivan's plan, he struck with the swiftness\nof a snake, pointing his finger at Shuisky and giving him no time to\nreact.\n\nNegotiate with a boyar and you create opportunities for him. A\nsmall\n\ncity, he stopped a passing gentleman. \u201cHello, my friend! Who is\nthe richest man in town\u201d \u201cPoor countryman! Don't you know Bydn-ssi,\nthe millionaire His glittering tile-roofed house pierced by twelve gates\nis just over there.\u201d Huh Saeng bent his steps to the rich man's house.\nHaving entered the big gate, he flung the guest-room door open and\naddressed the host: \u201cI need 10,000 yang for capital for my commercial\nbusiness and I want you to lend me the money.\u201d \u201cAlright, sir. Where\nshall I send the money\u201d\n\u201cTo the Ansdng Market in care of a commission merchant.\u201d \u201c\nVery well, sir. I will draw on Kim, who does the biggest commission\nbusiness in the Ansdng Market. You 'II get the money there.\u201d\n\u201cGood-bye, sir.\u201d When Huh Saeng was gone, all the other guests\nin the room asked Bydn-ssi why he gave so much money to a\nbeggarlike stranger whose family name was unknown to him. But the\nrich man replied with a triumphant face: \"Even though he was in\nragged clothes, he spoke clearly to the point without betraying shame\nor inferiority, unlike common people who want to borrow money for a\nbad debt. Such a man as he is either mad or self-confident in doing\nbusiness. But judging from his dauntless eyes and booming voice he\n\nis an uncommon man\n\nwith a superhuman\n\nbrain, worthy of my\n\ntrust, I know money\n\nand I know men.\n\nMoney often makes a\n\nman small, but a man\n\nlike him makes big\n\nmoney. I am only glad\n\nto have helped a big\n\nman do big business.\"\n\nBEHIND THE SCENES\n\nOF ROYAI. PALACES\n\nIN KOREA,\n\nHa Tae-hung, 1983\n\nFear, which always magnifies objects, gives a body to all their\nfancies, which takes for its form whatever they conceive to exist in\ntheir enemies\u2019 thoughts; so that fearful persons seldom fail to fall into\n\n\nreal inconveniences, occasioned by imaginary dangers.... And the\nduke, whose predominant character was to be always full of fear and\nof distrust, was, of all men I have ever seen, the most capable of falling\ninto false steps, by the dread he had of falling into them; being in that\nlike unto hares.\n\nCardinal de Retz, 1613-1679\n\ncompromise becomes the toehold he needs to tear you apart. The\nsudden bold move, without discussion or warning, obliterates these\ntoeholds, and builds your authority. You terrify doubters and despisers\nand gain the confidence of the many who admire and glorify those\nwho act boldly.\n\nObservance III\n\nIn 1514 the twenty-two-year-old Pietro Aretino was working as a\nlowly assistant scullion to a wealthy Roman family. He had ambitions\nof greatness as a writer, to enflame the world with his name, but how\ncould a mere lackey hope to realize such dreams\n\nThat year Pope Leo X received from the king of Portugal an\nembassy that included many gifts, most prominent among them a great\nelephant, the first in Rome since imperial times. The pontiff adored\nthis elephant and showered it with attention and gifts. But despite his\nlove and care, the elephant, which was called Hanno, became deathly\nill. The pope summoned doctors, who administered a five-hundred-\npound purgative to the elephant, but all to no avail. The animal died\nand the pope went into mourning. To console himself he summoned\nthe great painter Raphael and ordered him to create a life-sized\npainting of Hanno above the animal's tomb, bearing the inscription,\n\u201cWhat nature took away, Raphael has with his art restored.\u201d\n\nOver the next few days, a pamphlet circulated throughout Rome\nthat caused great merriment and laughter. Entitled \u201cThe Last Will and\nTestament of the Elephant Hanno,\u201d it read, in part, \u201cTo my heir the\nCardinal Santa Croce, I give my knees, so that he can imitate my\ngenuflections. ... To my heir Cardinal Sand Quattro, I give my jaws, so\nthat he can more readily devour all of Christ's revenues. ... To my heir\nCardinal Medici, I give my ears, so that he can hear everyone's doings.\n...\u201d To Cardinal Grassi, who had a reputation for lechery, the elephant\nbequeathed the appropriate, oversized part of his own anatomy.\n\n\nOn and on the anonymous pamphlet went, sparing none of the\ngreat in Rome, not even the pope. With each one it took aim at their\nbest-known weakness. The pamphlet ended with verse, \u201cSee to it that\nAretino is your friend / For he is a bad enemy to have. / His words\nalone could ruin the high pope / So God guard everyone from his\ntongue.\u201d Interpretation\n\nWith one short pamphlet, Aretino, son of a poor shoemaker and a\nservant himself, hurled himself to fame. Everyone in Rome rushed to\nfind out who this daring young man was. Even the pope, amused by\nhis audacity, sought him out and ended up giving him a job in the\npapal service. Over the years he came to be known as the \u201cScourge of\nPrinces,\u201d and his biting tongue earned him the respect and fear of the\ngreat, from the king of France to the Hapsburg emperor.\n\nThe Aretino strategy is simple: When you are as small and\nobscure as David was, you must find a Goliath to attack. The larger the\ntarget, the more attention you gain. The bolder the attack, the more you\nstand out\n\nfrom the crowd, and the more admiration you eam. Society is full\nof those who think daring thoughts but lack the guts to print and\npublicize them. Voice what the public feelsthe expression of shared\nfeelings is always powerful. Search out the most prominent target\npossible and sling your boldest shot. The world will enjoy the\nspectacle, and will honor the underdogyou, that iswith glory and\npower.\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nMost of us are timid. We want to avoid tension and conflict and\nwe want to be liked by all. We may contemplate a bold action but we\nrarely bring it to life. We are terrified of the consequences, of what\nothers might think of us, of the hostility we will stir up if we dare go\nbeyond our usual place.\n\nAlthough we may disguise our timidity as a concern for others, a\ndesire not to hurt or offend them, in fact it is the oppositewe are really\nself-absorbed, worried about ourselves and how others perceive us.\nBoldness, on the other hand, is outer-directed, and often makes people\nfeel more at ease, since it is less self-conscious and less repressed.\n\nThis can be seen most clearly in seduction. All great seducers\nsucceed through effrontery. Casanova's boldness was not revealed in a\n\ndaring approach to the woman he desired, or in intrepid words to\nflatter her; it consisted in his ability to surrender himself to her\ncompletely and to make her believe he would do anything for her, even\nrisk his life, which in fact he sometimes did. The woman on whom he\nlavished this attention understood that he held nothing back from her.\nThis was infinitely more flattering than compliments. At no point\nduring the seduction would he show hesitation or doubt, simply\nbecause he never felt it.\n\nPart of the charm of being seduced is that it makes us feel\n\nengulfed, temporarily outside of ourselves and the usual doubts that\npermeate our lives. The moment the seducer hesitates, the charm is\nbroken, because we become aware of the process, of their deliberate\neffort to seduce us, of their self-consciousness. Boldness directs\nattention outward and keeps the illusion alive. It never induces\nawkwardness or embarrassment. And so we admire the bold, and\nprefer to be around them, because their self-confidence infects us and\ndraws us outside our own realm of inwardness and reflection.\nFew are born bold. Even Napoleon had to cultivate the habit on\nthe battlefield, where he knew it was a matter of life and death. In\nsocial settings he was awkward and timid, but he overcame this and\npracticed boldness in every part of his life because he saw its\ntremendous power, how it could literally enlarge a man (even one who,\nlike Napoleon, was in fact conspicuously small). We also see this\nchange in Ivan the Terrible: A harmless boy suddenly transforms\nhimself into a powerful young man who commands authority, simply\nby pointing a finger and taking bold action.\n\nYou must practice and develop your boldness. You will often find\nuses for it. The best place to begin is often the delicate world of\nnegotiation, par-\n\nTHE BOY AND THE NETTLE\n\nA boy playing in the fields got stung by a nettle. He ran home to\nhis mother, telling her that he had but touched that nasty weed, and it\nhad stung him. \u201cIt was just your touching it, my boy,\u201d said the mother,\n\u201cthat caused it to sting you; the next time you meddle with a nettle,\ngrasp it tightly, and it will do you no hurt.\u201d\n\nDo boldly what you do at all.\n\nFABLES,\n\n\nAesop,\n\nsixth century b.c.\n\nHOW TO BE VICTORIOUS IN LOVE\n\nBut with those who have made an impression upon your heart, I\nhave noticed that you are timid. This quality might affect a bour-\ngeoise, but you must attack the heart of a woman of the world with\nother weapons.... I tell you on behalf of women: there is not one of us\nwho does not prefer a little rough handling to too much consideration.\nMen lose through blundering more hearts than virtue saves. The more\ntimidity a lover shows with us the more it concerns our pride to goad\nhim on; the more respect he has for our\n\nresistance, the more respect we demand of him. We would\nwillingly say to you men: \u201cAh, in pity's name do not suppose us to be\nso very virtuous; you are forcing us to have too much of it. ...\u201d We are\ncontinually struggling to hide the fact that we have permitted ourselves\nto be loved. Put a woman in a position to say that she has yielded only\nto a species of violence, or to surprise: persuade her that you do not\nundervalue her, and I will answer for her heart. ...A little more\nboldness on your part would put you both at your ease. Do you\nremember what M. de la Rochefoucauld told you lately: \u201cA reasonable\nman in love may act like a madman, but he should not and cannot act\nlike an idiot. \u201d\n\nlife, letters, and\n\nepicurean philosophy\n\nok ninon de i.enclos,\n\nNinon de Lenclos,\n\n1620-1705\n\nticularly those discussions in which you are asked to set your own\nprice. How often we put ourselves down by asking for too litde. When\nChristopher Columbus proposed that the Spanish court finance his\nvoyage to the Americas, he also made the insanely bold demand that\nhe be called \u201cGrand Admiral of the Ocean.\u201d The court agreed. The\nprice he set was the price he receivedhe demanded to be treated with\nrespect, and so he was. Henry Kissinger too knew that in negotiation,\nbold demands work better than starting off with piecemeal concessions\nand trying to meet the other person halfway. Set your value high, and\nthen, as Count Lustig did, set it higher.\n\nUnderstand: If boldness is not natural, neither is timidity. It is an\nacquired habit, picked up out of a desire to avoid conflict. If timidity\nhas taken hold of you, then, root it out. Your fears of the consequences\nof a bold action are way out of proportion to reality, and in fact the\nconsequences of timidity are worse. Your value is lowered and you\ncreate a self-fulfilling cycle of doubt and disaster. Remember: The\nproblems created by an audacious move can be disguised, even\nremedied, by more and greater audacity.\n\nImage: The Lion and the Hare. The lion creates no gaps in his\nwayhis movements are too swift, his jaws too quick and powerful. The\ntimid hare will do anything to escape danger, but in its haste to retreat\nand flee, it backs into traps, hops smack into its enemies' jaws.\n\nAuthority: I certainly think that it is better to be impetuous than\ncautious, for fortune is a woman, and it is necessary, if you wish to\nmaster her, to conquer her by force; and it can be seen that she lets\nherself be overcome by the bold rather than by those who proceed\ncoldly. And therefore, like a woman, she is always a friend to the\nyoung, because they are less cautious, fiercer, and master her with\ngreater audacity. (Niccolo Machiavelli, 1469-1527)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nBoldness should never be the strategy behind all of your actions.\nIt is a tactical instrument, to be used at the right moment. Plan and\nthink ahead, and make the final element the bold move that will bring\nyou success. In other words, since boldness is a learned response, it is\nalso one that you learn to control and utilize at will. To go through life\narmed only with audacity would be tiring and also fatal. You would\noffend too many people, as is proven by those who cannot control their\nboldness. One such person was Lola Montez; her audacity brought her\ntriumphs and led to her seduction of die king of Bavaria. But since she\ncould never rein in her boldness, it also led to her downfallin Bavaria,\nin England, wherever she turned. It crossed die border between\nboldness and the appearance of cruelty, even insanity. Ivan the Terrible\nsuffered the same fate: When the power of boldness brought him\nsuccess, he stuck to it, to the point where it became a lifelong pattern\nof violence and sadism. He lost the ability to tell when boldness was\nappropriate and when it was not.\n\nTimidity has no place in the realm of power; you will often\nbenefit, however, by being able to feign it. At that point, of course, it is\nno longer timidity but an offensive weapon: You are luring people in\nwith your show of shyness, all the better to pounce on mem boldly\nlater.\n'.

Your\ndoubts and hesitations will infect your execution. Timidity is\ndangerous: Better to enter with boldness. Any mistakes you commit\nthrough audacity are easily corrected with more audacity. Everyone\nadmires the bold; no one honors the timid.\n\nThe path of pleasure never leads to glory! The prodigious\nachievements of Hercules were the result of high adventure, and\nthough there is little, either in fable or history, to show that he had any\nrivals, still it is recorded that a knight errant, in company with a fellow\nadventurer, sought his fortune in a romantic country. He had not\ntraveled far when his companion observed a post, on which was\nwritten the following inscription: \u201cBrave adventurer, if you have a\ndesire to discover that which has never been seen by any knight errant,\nyou have only to pass this torrent, and then take in your arms an\nelephant of stone and carry it in one breath to the summit of this\nmountain, whose noble head seems blended with the sky.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201dsaid\nthe knight's companion, \u201cthe water may be deep as well as rapid, and\nthough, notwithstanding, we should pass it, why should we be\nencumbered with the elephant What a ridiculous undertaking!\u201d And\nphilosophically and with nice calculation, he observed that the\nelephant might be carried four steps; but for conveying it to the top of\nthe mountain in one breath, that was not in the power of a mortal,\nunless it should\n\nBOLDNESS AND HESITATION: A Brief Psychological\nComparison Boldness and hesitation elicit very different psychological\nresponses in their targets: Hesitation puts obstacles in your path,\nboldness eliminates them. Once you understand this, you will find it\nessential to overcome your natural timidity and practice the art of\n\n\naudacity. The following are among the most pronounced psychological\neffects of boldness and timidity.\n\nThe Bolder the Lie the Better. We all have weaknesses, and our\nefforts are never perfect. But entering action with boldness has the\nmagical effect of hiding our deficiencies. Con artists know that the\nbolder the lie, the more convincing it becomes. The sheer audacity of\nthe story makes it more credible, distracting attention from its\ninconsistencies. When putting together a con or entering any kind of\nnegotiation, go further than you planned. Ask for the moon and you\nwill be surprised how often you get it.\n\nLions Circle the Hesitant Prey. People have a sixth sense for the\nweaknesses of others. If, in a first encounter, you demonstrate your\nwillingness to compromise, back down, and retreat, you bring out the\nlion even in people who are not necessarily bloodthirsty. Everything\ndepends on perception, and once you are seen as the kind of person\nwho quickly goes on die defensive, who is willing to negotiate and be\namenable, you will be pushed around without mercy.\n\nBoldness Strikes Fear; Fear Creates Authority. The bold move\nmakes you seem larger and more powerful than you are. If it comes\nsuddenly, with die stealth and swiftness of a snake, it inspires diat\nmuch more fear. By intimidating with a bold move, you establish a\nprecedent: in every subsequent encounter, people will be on the\ndefensive, in terror of your next strike.\n\nGoing Halfway with Half a Heart Digs the Deeper Grave. If you\n\nenter an action with less than total confidence, you set up\nobstacles in your own path. When a problem arises you will grow\nconfused, seeing options where there are none and inadvertendy\ncreating more problems still. Retreating from the hunter, the timid hare\nscurries more easily into his snares.\n\nHesitation Creates Gaps, Boldness Obliterates Them. When you\ntake time to diink, to hem and haw, you create a gap that allows others\ntime to think as well. Your timidity infects people with awkward\nenergy, elicits embarrassment. Doubt springs up on all sides.\n\nBoldness destroys such gaps. The swiftness of die move and die\nenergy of the action leave others no space to doubt and worry. In\nseduction, hesitation is fatalit makes your victim conscious of your\n\n\nintentions. The bold move crowns seduction with triumph: It leaves no\ntime for reflection.\n\nAudacity Separates You from the Herd. Boldness gives you\npresence and makes you seem larger than life. The timid fade into the\nwallpaper, the\n\nbold draw attention, and what draws attention draws power. We\ncannot keep our eyes off the audaciouswe cannot wait to see their next\nbold move.\n\nOBSERVANCES OF THE LAW\n\nObservance I\n\nIn May of 1925, five of the most successful dealers in the French\nscrap-metal business found themselves invited to an \u201cofficial\u201d but\n\u201chighly confidential\u201d meeting with the deputy director general of the\nMinistry of Post and Telegraphs at the Hotel Crillon, then the most\nluxurious hotel in Paris. When the businessmen arrived, it was the\ndirector general himself, a Monsieur Lustig, who met diem in a swank\nsuite on the top floor.\n\nThe businessmen had no idea why they had been summoned to\nthis meeting, and they were bursting with curiosity. After drinks, the\ndirector explained. \u201cGendemen,\u201d he said, \u201cfhis is an urgent matter that\nrequires complete secrecy. The government is going to have to tear\ndown the Eiffel Tower.\u201d The dealers listened in stunned silence as the\ndirector explained that the tower, as recendy reported in the news,\ndesperately needed repairs. It had originally been meant as a temporary\nstructure (for the Exposition of 1889), its maintenance costs had soared\nover the years, and now, in a time of a fiscal crisis, the government\nwould have to spend millions to fix it. Many Parisians considered the\nEiffel Tower an eyesore and would be delighted to see it go. Over\ntime, even the tourists would forget about itit would live on in\nphotographs and postcards. \u201cGendemen,\u201d Lustig said, \u201cyou are all\ninvited to make the government an offer for the Eiffel Tower.\u201d\n\nHe gave the businessmen sheets of government stationery filled\nwith figures, such as the tonnage of the tower's metal. Their eyes\npopped as they calculated how much tiiey could make from the scrap.\nThen Lustig led them to a waiting limo, which brought them to the\nEiffel Tower. Flashing an official badge, he guided mem through the\narea, spicing his tour witii amusing anecdotes. At the end of the visit\n\n\nhe thanked them and asked them to have fheir offers delivered to his\nsuite within four days.\n\nSeveral days after the offers were submitted, one of the five, a\nMonsieur P., received notice that his bid was the winner, and diat to\nsecure fhe sale he should come to the suite at the hotel within two\ndays, bearing a certified check for more than 250,000 francs (the\nequivalent today of about $1,000,000)a quarter of the toted price. On\ndelivery of the check, he would receive the documents confirming his\nownership of the Eiffel Tower. Monsieur P. was excitedhe would go\ndown in history as the man who had bought and torn down the\ninfamous landmark. But by the time he arrived at the suite, check in\nhand, he was beginning to have doubts about the whole affair. Why\nmeet in a hotel instead of a government building Why hadn't he heard\nfrom other officials Was diis a hoax, a scam As he listened to Lustig\ndiscuss die arrangements for the scrapping of the tower, he hesitated,\nand contemplated backing out.\n\nbe the dwarf figure of an elephant, fit only to be placed on the top\nof a stick; and then what honor would there be in such an adventure\n\u201cThere is,\u201dsaid he, \u201csome deception in this writing. It is an enigma\nonly fit to amuse a child. I shall therefore leave you and your\nelephant.\u201d The reasoner then departed; but the adventurous man rushed\nwith his eyes closed across the water; neither depth nor violence\nprevented him, and according to the inscription he saw the elephant\nlying on the opposite bank. He took it and carried it to the top of the\nhill, where he saw a town. A shriek from the elephant alarmed the\npeople of the city, who rose in arms; but the adventurer, nothing\ndaunted, was determined to die a hero. The people, however, were\nawed by his presence, and he was astonished to hear them proclaim\nhim successor to their king, who had recently died. Great enterprises\nare only achieved by adventurous spirits. They who calculate with too\ngreat nicety every difficulty and obstacle which is likely to lie in their\nway, lose that time in hesitation, which the more daring seize and\nrender available to the loftiest purposes.\n\nFABLES,\n\nJean de La Fontaine, 1621-1695\n\nAlways set to work without misgivings on the score of\nimprudence. Fear of failure in the mind of a performer is, for an\n\nonlooker, already evidence of failure... Actions are dangerous when\nthere is doubt as to their wisdom; it would be safer to do nothing.\n\nBaltasar Gracian, 1601-1658\n\nIn a lowly thatched cottage in the Namsan Valley there lived a\npoor couple, Mr. and Mrs. Huh Saeng. The husband confined himself\nfor seven years and only read books in his cold room.... One day his\nwife, all in tears, said to him: \u201cLook here, my good man! What is the\nuse of all your book reading I have spent my youth in washing and\nsewing for other people and yet I have no spare jacket or skirt to wear\nand I have had no food to eat during the past three days. I am hungry\nand cold. I can stand it no more!\u201d ... Hearing these words, the middle-\naged scholar closed his book ... rose to his feet and ... without saying\nanother word, he went out of doors. . . Arriving in the heart of the\n\nSuddenly, however, he realized that the director had changed his\ntone. Instead of talking about the tower, he was complaining about his\nlow salary, about his wife's desire for a fur coat, about how galling it\nwas to work hard and be unappreciated. It dawned on Monsieur P. that\nthis high government official was asking for a bribe. The effect on\nhim, though, was not outrage but relief. Now he was sure that Lustig\nwas for real, since in all of his previous encounters with French\nbureaucrats, they had inevitably asked for a little greasing of the palm.\nHis confidence restored, Monsieur P. slipped the director several\nthousand francs in bills, then handed him the certified check. In return\nhe received the documentation, including an impressive-looking bill of\nsale. He left the hotel, dreaming of the profits and fame to come.\n\nOver the next few days, however, as Monsieur P. waited for\ncorrespondence from the government, he began to realize that\nsomething was amiss. A few telephone calls made it clear that there\nwas no deputy director general Lustig, and there were no plans to\ndestroy the Eiffel Tower: He had been bilked of over 250,000 francs!\n\nMonsieur P. never went to the police. He knew what kind of\nreputation he would get if word got out that he had fallen for one of the\nmost absurdly audacious cons in history. Besides the public\nhumiliation, it would have been business suicide. Interpretation\n\nHad Count Victor Lustig, con artist extraordinaire, tried to sell the\nArc de Triomphe, a bridge over the Seine, a statue of Balzac, no one\nwould have believed him. But the Eiffel Tower was just too large, too\n\nimprobable to be part of a con job. In fact it was so improbable that\nLustig was able to return to Paris six months later and \u201cresell\u201d the\nEiffel Tower to a different scrap-iron dealer, and for a higher pricea\nsum in francs equivalent today to over $1,500,000!\n\nLargeness of scale deceives the human eye. It distracts and awes\nus, and is so self-evident that we cannot imagine there is any illusion\nor deception afoot. Arm yourself with bigness and boldnessstretch\nyour deceptions as far as they will go and then go further. If you sense\nthat the sucker has suspicions, do as the intrepid Lustig did: Instead of\nbacking down, or lowering his price, he simply raised his price higher,\nby asking for and getting a bribe. Asking for more puts the other\nperson on the defensive, cuts out the nibbling effect of compromise\nand doubt, and overwhelms with its boldness.\n\nObservance II\n\nOn his deathbed in 1533, Vasily III, the Grand Duke of Moscow\nand ruler of a semi-united Russia, proclaimed his three-year-old son,\nIvan IV, as his successor. He appointed his young wife, Helena, as\nregent until Ivan reached his majority and could rule on his own. The\naristocracythe bo-yarssecretly rejoiced: For years the dukes of\nMoscow had been trying to extend their authority over the boyars' turf.\nWith Vasily dead, his heir a mere three years old, and a young woman\nin charge of the dukedom, die\n\nboyars would be able to roll back the dukes' gains, wrest control\nof the state, and humiliate the royal family.\n\nAware of these dangers, young Helena turned to her trusted friend\nPrince Ivan Obolensky to help her rule. But after five years as regent\nshe suddenly diedpoisoned by a member of the Shuisky family, the\nmost fearsome boyar clan. The Shuisky princes seized control of the\ngovernment and threw Obolensky in prison, where he starved to death.\nAt the age of eight, Ivan was now a despised orphan, and any boyar or\nfamily member who took an interest in him was immediately banished\nor killed.\n\nAnd so Ivan roamed the palace, hungry, ill clothed, and often in\nhiding from the Shuiskys, who treated him roughly when they saw\nhim. On some days they would search him out, clothe him in royal\nrobes, hand him a scepter, and set him on the thronea kind of mock\nritual in which they lampooned his royal pretensions. Then they would\n\n\nshoo him away. One evening several of them chased the\nMetropolitanthe head of the Russian churchthrough the palace, and he\nsought refuge in Ivan's room; the boy watched in horror as the\nShuiskys entered, hurled insults, and beat the Metropolitan mercilessly.\n\nIvan had one friend in the palace, a boyar named Vorontsov who\nconsoled and advised him. One day, however, as he, Vorontsov, and the\nnewest Metropolitan conferred in the palace refectory, several\nShuiskys burst in, beat up Vorontsov, and insulted the Metropolitan by\ntearing and treading on his robes. Then they banished Vorontsov from\nMoscow.\n\nThroughout all this Ivan maintained a strict silence. To the boyars\nit seemed that their plan had worked: The young man had turned into a\nterrified and obedient idiot. They could ignore him now, even leave\nhim alone. But on the evening of December 29, 1543, Ivan, now\nthirteen, asked Prince Andrei Shuisky to come to his room. When the\nprince arrived, the room was filled with palace guards. Young Ivan\nthen pointed his finger at Andrei and ordered the guards to arrest him,\nhave him killed, and throw his body to the bloodhounds in the royal\nkennel. Over the next few days Ivan had all of Andrei's close\nassociates arrested and banished. Caught off-guard by his sudden\nboldness, the boyars now stood in mortal terror of this youth, the\nfuture Ivan the Terrible, who had planned and waited for five years to\nexecute this one swift and bold act that would secure his power for\ndecades to come. Interpretation\n\nThe world is full of boyarsmen who despise you, fear your\nambition, and jealously guard their shrinking realms of power. You\nneed to establish your authority and gain respect, but the moment the\nboyars sense your growing boldness, they will act to thwart you. This\nis how Ivan met such a situation: He lay low, showing neither ambition\nnor discontent. He waited, and when the time came he brought the\npalace guards over to his side. The guards had come to hate the cruel\nShuiskys. Once they agreed to Ivan's plan, he struck with the swiftness\nof a snake, pointing his finger at Shuisky and giving him no time to\nreact.\n\nNegotiate with a boyar and you create opportunities for him. A\nsmall\n\ncity, he stopped a passing gentleman. \u201cHello, my friend! Who is\nthe richest man in town\u201d \u201cPoor countryman! Don't you know Bydn-ssi,\nthe millionaire His glittering tile-roofed house pierced by twelve gates\nis just over there.\u201d Huh Saeng bent his steps to the rich man's house.\nHaving entered the big gate, he flung the guest-room door open and\naddressed the host: \u201cI need 10,000 yang for capital for my commercial\nbusiness and I want you to lend me the money.\u201d \u201cAlright, sir. Where\nshall I send the money\u201d\n\u201cTo the Ansdng Market in care of a commission merchant.\u201d \u201c\nVery well, sir. I will draw on Kim, who does the biggest commission\nbusiness in the Ansdng Market. You 'II get the money there.\u201d\n\u201cGood-bye, sir.\u201d When Huh Saeng was gone, all the other guests\nin the room asked Bydn-ssi why he gave so much money to a\nbeggarlike stranger whose family name was unknown to him. But the\nrich man replied with a triumphant face: \"Even though he was in\nragged clothes, he spoke clearly to the point without betraying shame\nor inferiority, unlike common people who want to borrow money for a\nbad debt. Such a man as he is either mad or self-confident in doing\nbusiness. But judging from his dauntless eyes and booming voice he\n\nis an uncommon man\n\nwith a superhuman\n\nbrain, worthy of my\n\ntrust, I know money\n\nand I know men.\n\nMoney often makes a\n\nman small, but a man\n\nlike him makes big\n\nmoney. I am only glad\n\nto have helped a big\n\nman do big business.\"\n\nBEHIND THE SCENES\n\nOF ROYAI.

And the\nduke, whose predominant character was to be always full of fear and\nof distrust, was, of all men I have ever seen, the most capable of falling\ninto false steps, by the dread he had of falling into them; being in that\nlike unto hares.\n\nCardinal de Retz, 1613-1679\n\ncompromise becomes the toehold he needs to tear you apart. The\nsudden bold move, without discussion or warning, obliterates these\ntoeholds, and builds your authority. You terrify doubters and despisers\nand gain the confidence of the many who admire and glorify those\nwho act boldly.\n\nObservance III\n\nIn 1514 the twenty-two-year-old Pietro Aretino was working as a\nlowly assistant scullion to a wealthy Roman family. He had ambitions\nof greatness as a writer, to enflame the world with his name, but how\ncould a mere lackey hope to realize such dreams\n\nThat year Pope Leo X received from the king of Portugal an\nembassy that included many gifts, most prominent among them a great\nelephant, the first in Rome since imperial times. The pontiff adored\nthis elephant and showered it with attention and gifts. But despite his\nlove and care, the elephant, which was called Hanno, became deathly\nill. The pope summoned doctors, who administered a five-hundred-\npound purgative to the elephant, but all to no avail. The animal died\nand the pope went into mourning. To console himself he summoned\nthe great painter Raphael and ordered him to create a life-sized\npainting of Hanno above the animal's tomb, bearing the inscription,\n\u201cWhat nature took away, Raphael has with his art restored.\u201d\n\nOver the next few days, a pamphlet circulated throughout Rome\nthat caused great merriment and laughter. Entitled \u201cThe Last Will and\nTestament of the Elephant Hanno,\u201d it read, in part, \u201cTo my heir the\nCardinal Santa Croce, I give my knees, so that he can imitate my\ngenuflections. ... To my heir Cardinal Sand Quattro, I give my jaws, so\nthat he can more readily devour all of Christ's revenues. ... To my heir\nCardinal Medici, I give my ears, so that he can hear everyone's doings.\n...\u201d To Cardinal Grassi, who had a reputation for lechery, the elephant\nbequeathed the appropriate, oversized part of his own anatomy.\n\n\nOn and on the anonymous pamphlet went, sparing none of the\ngreat in Rome, not even the pope. With each one it took aim at their\nbest-known weakness. The pamphlet ended with verse, \u201cSee to it that\nAretino is your friend / For he is a bad enemy to have. / His words\nalone could ruin the high pope / So God guard everyone from his\ntongue.\u201d Interpretation\n\nWith one short pamphlet, Aretino, son of a poor shoemaker and a\nservant himself, hurled himself to fame. Everyone in Rome rushed to\nfind out who this daring young man was. Even the pope, amused by\nhis audacity, sought him out and ended up giving him a job in the\npapal service. Over the years he came to be known as the \u201cScourge of\nPrinces,\u201d and his biting tongue earned him the respect and fear of the\ngreat, from the king of France to the Hapsburg emperor.\n\nThe Aretino strategy is simple: When you are as small and\nobscure as David was, you must find a Goliath to attack. The larger the\ntarget, the more attention you gain. The bolder the attack, the more you\nstand out\n\nfrom the crowd, and the more admiration you eam. Society is full\nof those who think daring thoughts but lack the guts to print and\npublicize them. Voice what the public feelsthe expression of shared\nfeelings is always powerful. Search out the most prominent target\npossible and sling your boldest shot. The world will enjoy the\nspectacle, and will honor the underdogyou, that iswith glory and\npower.\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nMost of us are timid. We want to avoid tension and conflict and\nwe want to be liked by all. We may contemplate a bold action but we\nrarely bring it to life. We are terrified of the consequences, of what\nothers might think of us, of the hostility we will stir up if we dare go\nbeyond our usual place.\n\nAlthough we may disguise our timidity as a concern for others, a\ndesire not to hurt or offend them, in fact it is the oppositewe are really\nself-absorbed, worried about ourselves and how others perceive us.\nBoldness, on the other hand, is outer-directed, and often makes people\nfeel more at ease, since it is less self-conscious and less repressed.\n\nThis can be seen most clearly in seduction. All great seducers\nsucceed through effrontery. Casanova's boldness was not revealed in a\n\ndaring approach to the woman he desired, or in intrepid words to\nflatter her; it consisted in his ability to surrender himself to her\ncompletely and to make her believe he would do anything for her, even\nrisk his life, which in fact he sometimes did. The woman on whom he\nlavished this attention understood that he held nothing back from her.\nThis was infinitely more flattering than compliments. At no point\nduring the seduction would he show hesitation or doubt, simply\nbecause he never felt it.\n\nPart of the charm of being seduced is that it makes us feel\n\nengulfed, temporarily outside of ourselves and the usual doubts that\npermeate our lives. The moment the seducer hesitates, the charm is\nbroken, because we become aware of the process, of their deliberate\neffort to seduce us, of their self-consciousness. Boldness directs\nattention outward and keeps the illusion alive. It never induces\nawkwardness or embarrassment. And so we admire the bold, and\nprefer to be around them, because their self-confidence infects us and\ndraws us outside our own realm of inwardness and reflection.\nFew are born bold. Even Napoleon had to cultivate the habit on\nthe battlefield, where he knew it was a matter of life and death. In\nsocial settings he was awkward and timid, but he overcame this and\npracticed boldness in every part of his life because he saw its\ntremendous power, how it could literally enlarge a man (even one who,\nlike Napoleon, was in fact conspicuously small). We also see this\nchange in Ivan the Terrible: A harmless boy suddenly transforms\nhimself into a powerful young man who commands authority, simply\nby pointing a finger and taking bold action.\n\nYou must practice and develop your boldness. You will often find\nuses for it. The best place to begin is often the delicate world of\nnegotiation, par-\n\nTHE BOY AND THE NETTLE\n\nA boy playing in the fields got stung by a nettle. He ran home to\nhis mother, telling her that he had but touched that nasty weed, and it\nhad stung him. \u201cIt was just your touching it, my boy,\u201d said the mother,\n\u201cthat caused it to sting you; the next time you meddle with a nettle,\ngrasp it tightly, and it will do you no hurt.\u201d\n\nDo boldly what you do at all.\n\nFABLES,\n\n\nAesop,\n\nsixth century b.c.\n\nHOW TO BE VICTORIOUS IN LOVE\n\nBut with those who have made an impression upon your heart, I\nhave noticed that you are timid. This quality might affect a bour-\ngeoise, but you must attack the heart of a woman of the world with\nother weapons.... I tell you on behalf of women: there is not one of us\nwho does not prefer a little rough handling to too much consideration.\nMen lose through blundering more hearts than virtue saves. The more\ntimidity a lover shows with us the more it concerns our pride to goad\nhim on; the more respect he has for our\n\nresistance, the more respect we demand of him. We would\nwillingly say to you men: \u201cAh, in pity's name do not suppose us to be\nso very virtuous; you are forcing us to have too much of it. ...\u201d We are\ncontinually struggling to hide the fact that we have permitted ourselves\nto be loved. Put a woman in a position to say that she has yielded only\nto a species of violence, or to surprise: persuade her that you do not\nundervalue her, and I will answer for her heart. ...A little more\nboldness on your part would put you both at your ease. Do you\nremember what M. de la Rochefoucauld told you lately: \u201cA reasonable\nman in love may act like a madman, but he should not and cannot act\nlike an idiot. \u201d\n\nlife, letters, and\n\nepicurean philosophy\n\nok ninon de i.enclos,\n\nNinon de Lenclos,\n\n1620-1705\n\nticularly those discussions in which you are asked to set your own\nprice. How often we put ourselves down by asking for too litde. When\nChristopher Columbus proposed that the Spanish court finance his\nvoyage to the Americas, he also made the insanely bold demand that\nhe be called \u201cGrand Admiral of the Ocean.\u201d The court agreed. The\nprice he set was the price he receivedhe demanded to be treated with\nrespect, and so he was. Henry Kissinger too knew that in negotiation,\nbold demands work better than starting off with piecemeal concessions\nand trying to meet the other person halfway. Set your value high, and\nthen, as Count Lustig did, set it higher.\n\nUnderstand: If boldness is not natural, neither is timidity. It is an\nacquired habit, picked up out of a desire to avoid conflict. If timidity\nhas taken hold of you, then, root it out. Your fears of the consequences\nof a bold action are way out of proportion to reality, and in fact the\nconsequences of timidity are worse. Your value is lowered and you\ncreate a self-fulfilling cycle of doubt and disaster. Remember: The\nproblems created by an audacious move can be disguised, even\nremedied, by more and greater audacity.\n\nImage: The Lion and the Hare. The lion creates no gaps in his\nwayhis movements are too swift, his jaws too quick and powerful. The\ntimid hare will do anything to escape danger, but in its haste to retreat\nand flee, it backs into traps, hops smack into its enemies' jaws.\n\nAuthority: I certainly think that it is better to be impetuous than\ncautious, for fortune is a woman, and it is necessary, if you wish to\nmaster her, to conquer her by force; and it can be seen that she lets\nherself be overcome by the bold rather than by those who proceed\ncoldly. And therefore, like a woman, she is always a friend to the\nyoung, because they are less cautious, fiercer, and master her with\ngreater audacity. (Niccolo Machiavelli, 1469-1527)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nBoldness should never be the strategy behind all of your actions.\nIt is a tactical instrument, to be used at the right moment. Plan and\nthink ahead, and make the final element the bold move that will bring\nyou success. In other words, since boldness is a learned response, it is\nalso one that you learn to control and utilize at will. To go through life\narmed only with audacity would be tiring and also fatal. You would\noffend too many people, as is proven by those who cannot control their\nboldness. One such person was Lola Montez; her audacity brought her\ntriumphs and led to her seduction of die king of Bavaria. But since she\ncould never rein in her boldness, it also led to her downfallin Bavaria,\nin England, wherever she turned. It crossed die border between\nboldness and the appearance of cruelty, even insanity. Ivan the Terrible\nsuffered the same fate: When the power of boldness brought him\nsuccess, he stuck to it, to the point where it became a lifelong pattern\nof violence and sadism. He lost the ability to tell when boldness was\nappropriate and when it was not.\n\nTimidity has no place in the realm of power; you will often\nbenefit, however, by being able to feign it. At that point, of course, it is\nno longer timidity but an offensive weapon: You are luring people in\nwith your show of shyness, all the better to pounce on mem boldly\nlater.\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The original text is: 'PLAN ALL THE WAY TO THE END\n\nJUDGMENT\n\nThe ending is everything.

By\nplanning to the end you will not be overwhelmed by circumstances and\nyou will know when to stop. Gently guide fortune and help determine\nthe future by thinking far ahead.\n\nTRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW,\n\nIn 1510 a ship set out from the island of Hispaniola (now Haiti\nand the Dominican Republic) for Venezuela, where it was to rescue a\nbesieged Spanish colony. Several miles out of port, a stowaway\nclimbed out of a provision chest: Vasco Nunez de Balboa, a noble\nSpaniard who had come to the New World in search of gold but had\nfallen into debt and had escaped his creditors by hiding in the chest.\n\nBalboa had been obsessed with gold ever since Columbus had\nreturned to Spain from his voyages with tales of a fabulous but as yet\nundiscovered kingdom called El Dorado. Balboa was one of the first\nadventurers to come in search of Columbus's land of gold, and he had\ndecided from the beginning that he would be the one to find it, through\nsheer audacity and single-mindedness. Now diat he was free of his\ncreditors, nothing would stop him.\n\nUnfortunately the ship's owner, a wealthy jurist named Francisco\nFernandez de Enciso, was furious when told of the stowaway, and he\nordered that Balboa be left on the first island they came across. Before\nthey found any island, however, Enciso received news that the colony\nhe was to rescue had been abandoned. This was Balboa's chance. He\ntold the sailors of his previous voyages to Panama, and of the rumors\nhe had heard of gold in the area. The excited sailors convinced Enciso\nto spare Balboa's life, and to establish a colony in Panama. Weeks later\nthey named their new setdement \u201cDarien.\u201d\n\nDarien's first governor was Enciso, but Balboa was not a man to\nlet others steal the initiative. He campaigned against Enciso among the\nsailors, who eventually made it clear that diey preferred him as\ngovernor. Enciso fled to Spain, fearing for his life. Months later, when\na representative of the Spanish crown arrived to establish himself as\nthe new, official governor of Darien, he was turned away. On his return\nvoyage to Spain, this man drowned; the drowning was accidental, but\nunder Spanish law, Balboa had murdered the governor and usurped his\nposition.\n\nBalboa's bravado had got him out of scrapes before, but now his\nhopes of wealth and glory seemed doomed. To lay claim to El Dorado,\nshould he discover it, he would need the approval of the Spanish king\nwhich, as an outlaw, he would never receive. There was only one\nsolution. Panamanian Indians had told Balboa of a vast ocean on the\nother side of the Central American isthmus, and had said that by\ntraveling south upon this western coast, he would reach a fabulous\nland of gold, called by a name that to his ears sounded like \u201cBiru.\u201d\nBalboa decided he would cross the treacherous jungles of Panama and\nbecome the first European to bathe his feet in this new ocean. From\nthere he would march on El Dorado. If he did this on Spain's behalf, he\nwould obtain the eternal gratitude of the king, and would secure his\nown reprieveonly he had to act before Spanish authorities came to\narrest him.\n\nIn 1513, then, Balboa set out, widi 190 soldiers.

At the roadside was an abdal (a wandering Sufi), who\ncried out: \u201cWhoever will give me a hundred dinars, I will give him\nsome good advice.\u201d The king stopped, and said: \u201cAbdal, what is this\ngood advice for a hundred dinars'7 \u201dSir,\u201c answered the abdal, \u201dorder\nthe sum to be given to me, and I will tell it you immediately. \u201c The\nking did so, expecting to hear something extraordinary. The dervish\nsaid to him: \u201dMy advice is this: Never begin anything until you have\nreflected what will be the end of it.\u201cAt this the nobles and everyone\nelse present laughed, saying that the abdal had been wise to ask for his\nmoney in advance. But the king said: \u201d You . have no reason to laugh\nat the good advice this abdal has given me. No one is\n\nmained, many having succumbed to the harsh conditionsthe\nbloodsucking insects, the torrential rainfall, fever. Finally, from a\nmountaintop, Balboa became the first European to lay eyes on the\nPacific Ocean. Days later he marched in his armor into its waters,\nbearing the banner of Castile and claiming all its seas, lands, and\nislands in the name of the Spanish throne.\n\nIndians from the area greeted Balboa with gold, jewels, and\nprecious pearls, the like of which he had never seen. When he asked\nwhere these had come from, die Indians pointed south, to the land of\n\nULE Litds, DU Dalla Halt ULLY d LEW SUIUIETS Teil. PUL Ue MUIMET, He\ndecided, he should return to Darien, send the jewels and gold to Spain\nas a token of good will, and ask for a large army to aid him in the\nconquest of El Dorado.\n\nWhen news reached Spain of Balboa's bold crossing of die\nisthmus, his discovery of the western ocean, and his planned conquest\nof El Dorado, the former criminal became a hero. He was instandy\nproclaimed governor of the new land. But before the king and queen\nreceived word of his discovery, they had already sent a dozen ships,\nunder the command of a man named Pedro Arias Davila, \u201cPedrarias,\u201d\nwith orders to arrest Balboa for murder and to take command of the\ncolony. By the time Pedrarias arrived in Panama, he had learned that\nBalboa had been pardoned, and that he was to share die governorship\nwith the former oudaw.\n\nAll the same, Balboa felt uneasy. Gold was his dream, E] Dorado\nhis only desire. In pursuit of this goal he had nearly died many times\nover, and to share the wealth and glory with a newcomer would be\nintolerable. He also soon discovered that Pedrarias was a jealous, bitter\nman, and equally unhappy with the situation. Once again, the only\nsolution for Balboa was to seize the initiative by proposing to cross the\njungle with a larger army, carrying ship-building materials and tools.\nOnce on the Pacific coast, he would create an armada with which to\nconquer the Incas. Surprisingly enough, Pedrarias agreed to the\nplanperhaps sensing it would never work. Hundreds died in this second\nmarch through the jungle, and the timber they carried rotted in die\ntorrential rains. Balboa, as usual, was undauntedno power in the world\ncould thwart his planand on arriving at the Pacific he began to cut\ndown trees for new lumber. But the men remaining to him were too\new and too weak to mount an invasion, and once again Balboa had to\nreturn to Darien.\n\nPedrarias had in any case invited Balboa back to discuss a new\nplan, and on the outskirts of the settlement, the explorer was met by\nFrancisco Pizarro, an old friend who had accompanied him on his first\ncrossing of the isthmus. But this was a trap: Leading one hundred\nsoldiers, Pizarro surrounded his former friend, arrested him, and\nreturned him to Pedrarias, who tried him on charges of rebellion.

The main players were\nEngland, France, and Austria. Prussia itself was one of several states in\nthe loosely allied German Federation. Austria, dominant member of\nthe Federation, made sure mat die other German states remained weak,\ndivided and submissive. Bismarck believed that Prussia was destined\nfor something far greater than servant boy to Austria.\n\nThis is how Bismarck played the game. His first move was to\nstart a war with lowly Denmark, in order to recover the former\nPrussian lands of Schleswig-Holstein. He knew that tiiese rumblings of\nPrussian independence might worry France and England, so he\nenlisted Austria in the war, claiming that he was recovering Schleswig-\n\nHolstein for tiieir benefit. In a few months, after the war was decided,\nBismarck demanded that the newly conquered lands be made part of\nPrussia. The Austrians of course were furious, but tiiey compromised:\nFirst they agreed to give the Prussians Schleswig, and a year later tiiey\nsold them Holstein. The world began to see that Austria was\nweakening and that Prussia was on the rise.\n\nBismarck's next move was his boldest: In 1866 he convinced\nKing William of Prussia to withdraw from die German Federation, and\nin doing so to go to war with Austria itself. King William's wife, his\nson die crown prince, and die princes of the otiier German kingdoms\nvehemently opposed such a war. But Bismarck, undaunted, succeeded\nin forcing the conflict, and Prussia's superior army defeated die\nAustrians in die brutally\n\nunaware of the fact that we should think well before doing\nanything. But we are daily guilty of not remembering, and the\nconsequences are evil. I very much value this dervish's advice.\"\n\nThe king decided to bear the advice always in his mind, and\ncommanded it to be written in gold on the walls and even engraved on\nhis silver plate. Not long afterward a plotter desired to kill the king. He\nbribed the royal surgeon with a promise of the prime ministership if he\nthrust a poisoned lancet into the king 's arm. When the time came to let\nsome of the king's blood, a silver basin was placed to catch the blood.\nSuddenly the surgeon became aware of the words engraved upon it:\n\u201cNever begin anything until you have reflected what will be the end of\nit.\u201d It was only then that he realized that if the plotter became king he\ncould have the surgeon killed instantly, and would not need to fulfill\nhis bargain.\n\nThe king, seeing that the surgeon was now trembling, asked him\nwhat was wrong with him. And so he confessed the truth, at that very\nmoment. The plotter was seized; and the king sent for all the people\nwho had been present when the abdal gave his advice, and said to\nthem: \u201cDo you still laugh at the dervish\u201d\n\ncaravan of dreams, Idriks Shah, 1968\n\nHe who asks fortunetellers the future unwittingly forfeits an inner\nintimation of coming events that is a thousand times more exact than\nanything they may say.\n\nWalter Benjamin, 1892-1940\n\nshort Seven Weeks War. The king and the Prussian generals then\nwanted to march on Vienna, taking as much land from Austria as\npossible. But Bismarck stopped diemnow he presented himself as on\nthe side of peace. The result was that he was able to conclude a treaty\nwith Austria that granted Prussia and the other German states total\nautonomy. Bismarck could now position Prussia as die dominant\npower in Germany and the head of a newly formed North German\nConfederation.\n\nThe French and the English began to compare Bismarck to Attila\nthe Hun, and to fear that he had designs on all of Europe. Once he had\nstarted on the path to conquest, there was no telling where he would\nstop. And, indeed, three years later Bismarck provoked a war with\nFrance. First he appeared to give his permission to France's annexation\nof Belgium, then at die last moment he changed his mind. Playing a\ncat-and-mouse game, he infuriated die French emperor, Napoleon III,\nand stirred up his own king against the French. To no one's surprise,\nwar broke out in 1870. The newly formed German federation\nenthusiastically joined in the war on France, and once again the\nPrussian military machine and its allies destroyed the enemy army ina\nmatter of months. Aldiough Bismarck opposed taking any French land,\nthe generals convinced him that Alsace-Lorraine would become part of\nthe federation.\n\nNow all of Europe feared the next move of the Prussian monster,\nled by Bismarck, the \u201cIron Chancellor.\u201d And in fact a year later\nBismarck founded the German Empire, with die Prussian king as the\nnewly crowned emperor and Bismarck himself a prince. But then\nsomediing strange happened: Bismarck instigated no more wars. And\nwhile the other European powers grabbed up land for colonies in other\ncontinents, he severely limited Germany's colonial acquisitions. He did\nnot want more land for Germany, but more security. For the rest of his\nlife he struggled to maintain peace in Europe and to prevent further\nwars. Everybody assumed he had changed, mellowing with the years.\nThey had failed to understand: This was the final move of his original\nplan.\n\nInterpretation\n\nThere is a simple reason why most men never know when to\ncome off the attack: They form no concrete idea of their goal. Once\n\nthey achieve victory they only hunger for more. To stopto aim for a\ngoal and then keep to itseems almost inhuman, in fact; yet nothing is\nmore critical to the maintenance of power. The person who goes too\nfar in his triumphs creates a reaction that inevitably leads to a decline.\nThe only solution is to plan for the long run. Foresee the future with as\nmuch clarity as the gods on Mount Olympus, who look through the\nclouds and see the ends of all tilings.\n\nFrom the beginning of his career in politics, Bismarck had one\ngoal: to form an independent German state led by Prussia. He\ninstigated the war with Denmark not to conquer territory but to stir up\nPrussian nationalism and unite the country. He incited the war with\nAustria only to gain\n\nPrussian independence. (This was why he refused to grab\nAustrian territory.) And he fomented the war with France to unite the\nGerman kingdoms against a common enemy, and thus to prepare for\nthe formation of a united Germany.\n\nOnce this was achieved, Bismarck stopped. He never let triumph\ngo to his head, was never tempted by the siren call of more. He held\nthe reins tightly, and whenever the generals, or the king, or the\nPrussian people demanded new conquests, he held them back. Nothing\nwould spoil the beauty of his creation, certainly not a false euphoria\nthat pushed those around him to attempt to go past the end that he had\nso carefully planned.\n\nExperience shows that, if one foresees from far away the designs\nto be\n\nundertaken, one can act with speed when the moment comes to\nexecute them.\n\nCardinal Richelieu, 1585-1642\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nAccording to the cosmology of the ancient Greeks, the gods were\nthought to have complete vision into die future. They saw everything\nto come, right down to the intricate details. Men, on the other hand,\nwere seen as victims of fate, trapped in the moment and tfieir\nemotions, unable to see beyond immediate dangers. Those heroes,\nsuch as Odysseus, who were able to look beyond the present and plan\nseveral steps ahead, seemed to defy fate, to approximate the gods in\ntheir ability to determine the future. The comparison is still validthose\n\namong us who think further ahead and patiently bring their plans to\nTuition seem to have a godlike power.\n\nBecause most people are too imprisoned in the moment to plan\nwith this kind of foresight, the ability to ignore immediate dangers and\npleasures translates into power. It is the power of being able to\novercome the natural human tendency to react to things as they\nhappen, and instead to train oneself to step back, imagining the larger\nthings taking shape beyond one's immediate vision. Most people\nbelieve that tiiey are in fact aware of the future, that they are planning\nand thinking ahead. They are usually deluded: What they are really\ndoing is succumbing to their desires, to what they want the future to\nbe. Their plans are vague, based on their imaginations rather than their\nreality. They may believe they are thinking all the way to the end, but\nthey are really only focusing on the happy ending, and deluding\nthemselves by the strength of their desire.\n\nIn 415 B.C., the ancient Athenians attacked Sicily, believing their\nexpedition would bring them riches, power, and a glorious ending to\nthe sixteen-year Peloponnesian War. They did not consider the dangers\nof an invasion so far from home; they did not foresee that the Sicilians\nwould fight all the harder since the batdes were in their own homeland,\nor that all of Athens's enemies would band together against them, or\nthat war would break out on several fronts, stretching their forces way\ntoo thin. The Sicilian expedition was a complete disaster, leading to\nthe destruction\n\nof one of the greatest civilizations of all time. The Athenians were\nled into this disaster by their hearts, not their minds. They saw only the\nchance of glory, not the dangers that loomed in the distance.\n\nCardinal de Retz, the seventeenth-century Frenchman who prided\nhimself on his insights into human schemes and why they mostly fail,\nanalyzed this phenomenon. In the course of a rebellion he spearheaded\nagainst the French monarchy in 1651, the young king, Louis XIV, and\nhis court had suddenly left Paris and established themselves in a palace\noutside the capital. The presence of the king so close to the heart of the\nrevolution had been a tremendous burden on the revolutionaries, and\nthey breathed a sigh of relief. This later proved their downfall,\nhowever, since the court's absence from Paris gave it much more room\nto maneuver. \u201cThe most ordinary cause of people's mistakes,\u201d Cardinal\n\n\nde Retz later wrote, \u201cis their being too much frightened at the present\ndanger, and not enough so at that which is remote.\u201d\n\nThe dangers that are remote, that loom in the distanceif we can\nsee them as they take shape, how many mistakes we avoid. How many\nplans we would instandy abort if we realized we were avoiding a small\ndanger only to step into a larger one. So much of power is not what\nyou do but what you do not dodie rash and foolish actions that you\nrefrain from before they get you into trouble. Plan in detail before you\nactdo not let vague plans lead you into trouble. Will this have\nunintended consequences Will I stir up new enemies Will someone\nelse take advantage of my labors Unhappy endings are much more\ncommon than happy onesdo not be swayed by the happy ending in\nyour mind.\n\nThe French elections of 1848 came down to a struggle between\nLouis-Adolphe Thiers, the man of order, and General Louis Eugene\nCavaignac, the rabble-rouser of the right. When Thiers realized he was\nhopelessly behind in this high-stakes race, he searched desperately for\na solution. His eye fell on Louis Bonaparte, grand-nephew of the great\ngeneral Napoleon, and a lowly deputy in the parliament. This\nBonaparte seemed a bit of an imbecile, but his name alone could get\nhim elected in a country yearning for a strong ruler. He would be\nThiers's puppet and eventually would be pushed offstage. The first part\nof the plan worked to perfection, and Napoleon was elected by a large\nmargin. The problem was that Thiers had not foreseen one simple fact:\nThis \u201cimbecile\u201d was in fact a man of enormous ambition. Three years\nlater he dissolved parliament, declared himself emperor, and ruled\nFrance for another eighteen years, much to the horror of Thiers and his\nparty.\n\nThe ending is everything. It is the end of the action that\ndetermines who gets the glory, the money, die prize. Your conclusion\nmust be crystal clear, and you must keep it constantly in mind. You\nmust also figure out how to ward off the vultures circling overhead,\ntrying to live off the carcass of your creation. And you must anticipate\nthe many possible crises that will tempt you to improvise. Bismarck\novercame these dangers because he planned to the end, kept on course\nthrough every crisis, and\n\nnever let others steal the glory. Once he had reached his stated\ngoal, he withdrew into his shell like a turtle. This kind of self-control is\ngodlike.\n\nWhen you see several steps ahead, and plan your moves all the\nway to the end, you will no longer be tempted by emotion or by die\ndesire to improvise. Your clarity will rid you of the anxiety and\nvagueness that are the primary reasons why so many fail to conclude\ntiieir actions successfully. You see the ending and you tolerate no\ndeviation.\n\nImage:\n\nThe Gods on\n\nMount Olympus.\n\nLooking down on\n\nhuman actions from the\n\nclouds, they see in advance the\n\nendings of all the great dreams that\n\nlead to disaster and tragedy. And\n\nthey laugh at our inability to see beyond\n\nthe moment, and at how we delude ourselves.\n\nAuthority: How much easier it is never to get in than to get\nyourself out! We should act contrary to the reed which, when it first\nappears, throws up a long straight stem but afterwards, as though it\nwere exhausted . . . makes several dense knots, indicating that it no\nlonger has its original vigor and drive. We must rather begin gendy and\ncoolly, saving our breath for the encounter and our vigorous thrusts for\nfinishing off the job. In their beginnings it is we who guide affairs and\nhold them in our power; but so often once they are set in motion, it is\nthey which guide us and sweep us along. (Montaigne, 1533-1592)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nIt is a cliche among strategists that your plan must include\nalternatives and have a degree of flexibility. That is certainly true. If\nyou are locked into a plan too rigidly, you will be unable to deal with\nsudden shifts of fortune. Once you have examined the future\npossibilities and decided on your target, you must build in alternatives\nand be open to new routes toward your goal.\n\nMost people, however, lose less from overplanning and rigidity\nthan from vagueness and a tendency to improvise constantly in the\n\nface of circumstance. There is no real purpose in contemplating a\nreversal to this Law, then, for no good can come from refusing to think\nfar into the future and planning to the end. If you are clear- and far-\nthinking enough, you will understand that the future is uncertain, and\nthat you must be open to adaptation. Only having a clear objective and\na far-reaching plan allows you that freedom.\n'.

Several miles out of port, a stowaway\nclimbed out of a provision chest: Vasco Nunez de Balboa, a noble\nSpaniard who had come to the New World in search of gold but had\nfallen into debt and had escaped his creditors by hiding in the chest.\n\nBalboa had been obsessed with gold ever since Columbus had\nreturned to Spain from his voyages with tales of a fabulous but as yet\nundiscovered kingdom called El Dorado. Balboa was one of the first\nadventurers to come in search of Columbus's land of gold, and he had\ndecided from the beginning that he would be the one to find it, through\nsheer audacity and single-mindedness. Now diat he was free of his\ncreditors, nothing would stop him.\n\nUnfortunately the ship's owner, a wealthy jurist named Francisco\nFernandez de Enciso, was furious when told of the stowaway, and he\nordered that Balboa be left on the first island they came across. Before\nthey found any island, however, Enciso received news that the colony\nhe was to rescue had been abandoned. This was Balboa's chance. He\ntold the sailors of his previous voyages to Panama, and of the rumors\nhe had heard of gold in the area. The excited sailors convinced Enciso\nto spare Balboa's life, and to establish a colony in Panama. Weeks later\nthey named their new setdement \u201cDarien.\u201d\n\nDarien's first governor was Enciso, but Balboa was not a man to\nlet others steal the initiative. He campaigned against Enciso among the\nsailors, who eventually made it clear that diey preferred him as\ngovernor. Enciso fled to Spain, fearing for his life. Months later, when\na representative of the Spanish crown arrived to establish himself as\nthe new, official governor of Darien, he was turned away. On his return\nvoyage to Spain, this man drowned; the drowning was accidental, but\nunder Spanish law, Balboa had murdered the governor and usurped his\nposition.\n\nBalboa's bravado had got him out of scrapes before, but now his\nhopes of wealth and glory seemed doomed. To lay claim to El Dorado,\nshould he discover it, he would need the approval of the Spanish king\nwhich, as an outlaw, he would never receive. There was only one\nsolution. Panamanian Indians had told Balboa of a vast ocean on the\nother side of the Central American isthmus, and had said that by\ntraveling south upon this western coast, he would reach a fabulous\nland of gold, called by a name that to his ears sounded like \u201cBiru.\u201d\nBalboa decided he would cross the treacherous jungles of Panama and\nbecome the first European to bathe his feet in this new ocean. From\nthere he would march on El Dorado. If he did this on Spain's behalf, he\nwould obtain the eternal gratitude of the king, and would secure his\nown reprieveonly he had to act before Spanish authorities came to\narrest him.\n\nIn 1513, then, Balboa set out, widi 190 soldiers. Halfway across\nthe isthmus (some ninety miles wide at that point), only sixty soldiers\nre-\n\nThere are very few menand they are the exceptionswho are able\nto think and feel beyond the present moment.\n\nCarl von Clausewitz, 1780-1831\n\nTHK TWO THOCS\n\nTwo frogs dwelt in the same pool The pool being dried up under\nthe summer's heat, they left it, and set out together to seek another\nhome.

At the roadside was an abdal (a wandering Sufi), who\ncried out: \u201cWhoever will give me a hundred dinars, I will give him\nsome good advice.\u201d The king stopped, and said: \u201cAbdal, what is this\ngood advice for a hundred dinars'7 \u201dSir,\u201c answered the abdal, \u201dorder\nthe sum to be given to me, and I will tell it you immediately. \u201c The\nking did so, expecting to hear something extraordinary. The dervish\nsaid to him: \u201dMy advice is this: Never begin anything until you have\nreflected what will be the end of it.\u201cAt this the nobles and everyone\nelse present laughed, saying that the abdal had been wise to ask for his\nmoney in advance. But the king said: \u201d You . have no reason to laugh\nat the good advice this abdal has given me. No one is\n\nmained, many having succumbed to the harsh conditionsthe\nbloodsucking insects, the torrential rainfall, fever. Finally, from a\nmountaintop, Balboa became the first European to lay eyes on the\nPacific Ocean. Days later he marched in his armor into its waters,\nbearing the banner of Castile and claiming all its seas, lands, and\nislands in the name of the Spanish throne.\n\nIndians from the area greeted Balboa with gold, jewels, and\nprecious pearls, the like of which he had never seen. When he asked\nwhere these had come from, die Indians pointed south, to the land of\n\nULE Litds, DU Dalla Halt ULLY d LEW SUIUIETS Teil. PUL Ue MUIMET, He\ndecided, he should return to Darien, send the jewels and gold to Spain\nas a token of good will, and ask for a large army to aid him in the\nconquest of El Dorado.\n\nWhen news reached Spain of Balboa's bold crossing of die\nisthmus, his discovery of the western ocean, and his planned conquest\nof El Dorado, the former criminal became a hero. He was instandy\nproclaimed governor of the new land. But before the king and queen\nreceived word of his discovery, they had already sent a dozen ships,\nunder the command of a man named Pedro Arias Davila, \u201cPedrarias,\u201d\nwith orders to arrest Balboa for murder and to take command of the\ncolony. By the time Pedrarias arrived in Panama, he had learned that\nBalboa had been pardoned, and that he was to share die governorship\nwith the former oudaw.\n\nAll the same, Balboa felt uneasy. Gold was his dream, E] Dorado\nhis only desire. In pursuit of this goal he had nearly died many times\nover, and to share the wealth and glory with a newcomer would be\nintolerable. He also soon discovered that Pedrarias was a jealous, bitter\nman, and equally unhappy with the situation. Once again, the only\nsolution for Balboa was to seize the initiative by proposing to cross the\njungle with a larger army, carrying ship-building materials and tools.\nOnce on the Pacific coast, he would create an armada with which to\nconquer the Incas. Surprisingly enough, Pedrarias agreed to the\nplanperhaps sensing it would never work. Hundreds died in this second\nmarch through the jungle, and the timber they carried rotted in die\ntorrential rains. Balboa, as usual, was undauntedno power in the world\ncould thwart his planand on arriving at the Pacific he began to cut\ndown trees for new lumber. But the men remaining to him were too\new and too weak to mount an invasion, and once again Balboa had to\nreturn to Darien.\n\nPedrarias had in any case invited Balboa back to discuss a new\nplan, and on the outskirts of the settlement, the explorer was met by\nFrancisco Pizarro, an old friend who had accompanied him on his first\ncrossing of the isthmus. But this was a trap: Leading one hundred\nsoldiers, Pizarro surrounded his former friend, arrested him, and\nreturned him to Pedrarias, who tried him on charges of rebellion. A\n\u2018ew days later Balboa's head fell into a basket, along with those of his\n\n\nmost trusted followers. Years later Pizarro himself reached Peru, and\nBalboa's deeds were forgotten.\n\nInterpretation\n\nMost men are ruled by the heart, not die head.

Aldiough Bismarck opposed taking any French land,\nthe generals convinced him that Alsace-Lorraine would become part of\nthe federation.\n\nNow all of Europe feared the next move of the Prussian monster,\nled by Bismarck, the \u201cIron Chancellor.\u201d And in fact a year later\nBismarck founded the German Empire, with die Prussian king as the\nnewly crowned emperor and Bismarck himself a prince. But then\nsomediing strange happened: Bismarck instigated no more wars. And\nwhile the other European powers grabbed up land for colonies in other\ncontinents, he severely limited Germany's colonial acquisitions. He did\nnot want more land for Germany, but more security. For the rest of his\nlife he struggled to maintain peace in Europe and to prevent further\nwars. Everybody assumed he had changed, mellowing with the years.\nThey had failed to understand: This was the final move of his original\nplan.\n\nInterpretation\n\nThere is a simple reason why most men never know when to\ncome off the attack: They form no concrete idea of their goal. Once\n\nthey achieve victory they only hunger for more. To stopto aim for a\ngoal and then keep to itseems almost inhuman, in fact; yet nothing is\nmore critical to the maintenance of power. The person who goes too\nfar in his triumphs creates a reaction that inevitably leads to a decline.\nThe only solution is to plan for the long run. Foresee the future with as\nmuch clarity as the gods on Mount Olympus, who look through the\nclouds and see the ends of all tilings.\n\nFrom the beginning of his career in politics, Bismarck had one\ngoal: to form an independent German state led by Prussia. He\ninstigated the war with Denmark not to conquer territory but to stir up\nPrussian nationalism and unite the country. He incited the war with\nAustria only to gain\n\nPrussian independence. (This was why he refused to grab\nAustrian territory.) And he fomented the war with France to unite the\nGerman kingdoms against a common enemy, and thus to prepare for\nthe formation of a united Germany.\n\nOnce this was achieved, Bismarck stopped. He never let triumph\ngo to his head, was never tempted by the siren call of more. He held\nthe reins tightly, and whenever the generals, or the king, or the\nPrussian people demanded new conquests, he held them back. Nothing\nwould spoil the beauty of his creation, certainly not a false euphoria\nthat pushed those around him to attempt to go past the end that he had\nso carefully planned.\n\nExperience shows that, if one foresees from far away the designs\nto be\n\nundertaken, one can act with speed when the moment comes to\nexecute them.\n\nCardinal Richelieu, 1585-1642\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nAccording to the cosmology of the ancient Greeks, the gods were\nthought to have complete vision into die future. They saw everything\nto come, right down to the intricate details. Men, on the other hand,\nwere seen as victims of fate, trapped in the moment and tfieir\nemotions, unable to see beyond immediate dangers. Those heroes,\nsuch as Odysseus, who were able to look beyond the present and plan\nseveral steps ahead, seemed to defy fate, to approximate the gods in\ntheir ability to determine the future. The comparison is still validthose\n\namong us who think further ahead and patiently bring their plans to\nTuition seem to have a godlike power.\n\nBecause most people are too imprisoned in the moment to plan\nwith this kind of foresight, the ability to ignore immediate dangers and\npleasures translates into power. It is the power of being able to\novercome the natural human tendency to react to things as they\nhappen, and instead to train oneself to step back, imagining the larger\nthings taking shape beyond one's immediate vision. Most people\nbelieve that tiiey are in fact aware of the future, that they are planning\nand thinking ahead. They are usually deluded: What they are really\ndoing is succumbing to their desires, to what they want the future to\nbe. Their plans are vague, based on their imaginations rather than their\nreality. They may believe they are thinking all the way to the end, but\nthey are really only focusing on the happy ending, and deluding\nthemselves by the strength of their desire.\n\nIn 415 B.C., the ancient Athenians attacked Sicily, believing their\nexpedition would bring them riches, power, and a glorious ending to\nthe sixteen-year Peloponnesian War. They did not consider the dangers\nof an invasion so far from home; they did not foresee that the Sicilians\nwould fight all the harder since the batdes were in their own homeland,\nor that all of Athens's enemies would band together against them, or\nthat war would break out on several fronts, stretching their forces way\ntoo thin. The Sicilian expedition was a complete disaster, leading to\nthe destruction\n\nof one of the greatest civilizations of all time. The Athenians were\nled into this disaster by their hearts, not their minds. They saw only the\nchance of glory, not the dangers that loomed in the distance.\n\nCardinal de Retz, the seventeenth-century Frenchman who prided\nhimself on his insights into human schemes and why they mostly fail,\nanalyzed this phenomenon. In the course of a rebellion he spearheaded\nagainst the French monarchy in 1651, the young king, Louis XIV, and\nhis court had suddenly left Paris and established themselves in a palace\noutside the capital. The presence of the king so close to the heart of the\nrevolution had been a tremendous burden on the revolutionaries, and\nthey breathed a sigh of relief. This later proved their downfall,\nhowever, since the court's absence from Paris gave it much more room\nto maneuver. \u201cThe most ordinary cause of people's mistakes,\u201d Cardinal\n\n\nde Retz later wrote, \u201cis their being too much frightened at the present\ndanger, and not enough so at that which is remote.\u201d\n\nThe dangers that are remote, that loom in the distanceif we can\nsee them as they take shape, how many mistakes we avoid. How many\nplans we would instandy abort if we realized we were avoiding a small\ndanger only to step into a larger one. So much of power is not what\nyou do but what you do not dodie rash and foolish actions that you\nrefrain from before they get you into trouble. Plan in detail before you\nactdo not let vague plans lead you into trouble. Will this have\nunintended consequences Will I stir up new enemies Will someone\nelse take advantage of my labors Unhappy endings are much more\ncommon than happy onesdo not be swayed by the happy ending in\nyour mind.\n\nThe French elections of 1848 came down to a struggle between\nLouis-Adolphe Thiers, the man of order, and General Louis Eugene\nCavaignac, the rabble-rouser of the right. When Thiers realized he was\nhopelessly behind in this high-stakes race, he searched desperately for\na solution. His eye fell on Louis Bonaparte, grand-nephew of the great\ngeneral Napoleon, and a lowly deputy in the parliament. This\nBonaparte seemed a bit of an imbecile, but his name alone could get\nhim elected in a country yearning for a strong ruler. He would be\nThiers's puppet and eventually would be pushed offstage. The first part\nof the plan worked to perfection, and Napoleon was elected by a large\nmargin. The problem was that Thiers had not foreseen one simple fact:\nThis \u201cimbecile\u201d was in fact a man of enormous ambition. Three years\nlater he dissolved parliament, declared himself emperor, and ruled\nFrance for another eighteen years, much to the horror of Thiers and his\nparty.\n\nThe ending is everything. It is the end of the action that\ndetermines who gets the glory, the money, die prize. Your conclusion\nmust be crystal clear, and you must keep it constantly in mind. You\nmust also figure out how to ward off the vultures circling overhead,\ntrying to live off the carcass of your creation. And you must anticipate\nthe many possible crises that will tempt you to improvise. Bismarck\novercame these dangers because he planned to the end, kept on course\nthrough every crisis, and\n\nnever let others steal the glory. Once he had reached his stated\ngoal, he withdrew into his shell like a turtle. This kind of self-control is\ngodlike.\n\nWhen you see several steps ahead, and plan your moves all the\nway to the end, you will no longer be tempted by emotion or by die\ndesire to improvise. Your clarity will rid you of the anxiety and\nvagueness that are the primary reasons why so many fail to conclude\ntiieir actions successfully. You see the ending and you tolerate no\ndeviation.\n\nImage:\n\nThe Gods on\n\nMount Olympus.\n\nLooking down on\n\nhuman actions from the\n\nclouds, they see in advance the\n\nendings of all the great dreams that\n\nlead to disaster and tragedy. And\n\nthey laugh at our inability to see beyond\n\nthe moment, and at how we delude ourselves.\n\nAuthority: How much easier it is never to get in than to get\nyourself out! We should act contrary to the reed which, when it first\nappears, throws up a long straight stem but afterwards, as though it\nwere exhausted . . . makes several dense knots, indicating that it no\nlonger has its original vigor and drive. We must rather begin gendy and\ncoolly, saving our breath for the encounter and our vigorous thrusts for\nfinishing off the job. In their beginnings it is we who guide affairs and\nhold them in our power; but so often once they are set in motion, it is\nthey which guide us and sweep us along. (Montaigne, 1533-1592)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nIt is a cliche among strategists that your plan must include\nalternatives and have a degree of flexibility. That is certainly true. If\nyou are locked into a plan too rigidly, you will be unable to deal with\nsudden shifts of fortune. Once you have examined the future\npossibilities and decided on your target, you must build in alternatives\nand be open to new routes toward your goal.\n\nMost people, however, lose less from overplanning and rigidity\nthan from vagueness and a tendency to improvise constantly in the\n\nface of circumstance. There is no real purpose in contemplating a\nreversal to this Law, then, for no good can come from refusing to think\nfar into the future and planning to the end. If you are clear- and far-\nthinking enough, you will understand that the future is uncertain, and\nthat you must be open to adaptation. Only having a clear objective and\na far-reaching plan allows you that freedom.\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The artist said he thought black-and-white\nsketches would suit them, and went home again after considering them\ncarefully. The next morning he came early and made a large quantity\nof ink into which he dipped a horseshoe he had brought with him, and\nthen proceeded to make impressions of this all over one of the screens.\nThen, with a large brush, he drew a number of lines across them.\nMeanwhile Masamune had come in to watch his work, and at this he\ncould contain his irritation no longer, and muttering, \u201cWhat a beastly\nmess!\u201d he strode away to his own apartments. The retainers told\nTannyu he was in a very bad temper indeed. \u201cHe shouldn't look on\nwhile I am at work, then, \u201d replied the painter, \u201che should wait till it is\nfinished. \u201d Then he took up a smaller brush and dashed in touches here\nand there, and as he did so the prints of the horse-shoe turned into\ncrabs, while the big broad strokes became rushes. He then turned to the\nother screen and splashed drops of ink all over it, and when he had\nadded a few brushstrokes here and there they became a flight of\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW I\n\nThe Japanese tea ceremony called Cha-no-yu (\u201cHot Water for\nTea\u201d) has origins in ancient times, but it reached its peak of refinement\nin the sixteenth century under its most renowned practitioner, Sen no\n\n\nRikyu. Although not from a noble family, Rikyu rose to great power,\nbecoming die preferred tea master of the Emperor Hideyoshi, and an\nimportant adviser on aesthetic and even political matters. For Rikyu,\nthe secret of success consisted in appearing natural, concealing the\neffort behind one's work.\n\nOne day Rikyu and his son went to an acquaintance's house for a\ntea ceremony. On the way in, the son remarked that die lovely antique-\nlooking gate at their host's house gave it an evocatively lonely\nappearance. \u201cI don't think so,\u201d replied his father, \u201cit looks as though it\nhad been brought from some mountain temple a long way off, and as if\ndie labor required to import it must have cost a lot of money.\u201d If the\nowner of the house had put mis much effort into one gate, it would\nshow in his tea ceremonyand indeed Sen no Rikyu had to leave die\nceremony early, unable to endure the affectation and effort it\ninadvertently revealed.\n\nOn another evening, while having tea at a friend's house, Rikyu\nsaw his host go outside, hold up a lantern in the darkness, cut a lemon\noff a tree, and bring it in. This charmed Rikyuthe host needed a relish\nfor die dish he was serving, and had spontaneously gone outside to get\none. But when the man offered die lemon with some Osaka rice cake,\nRikyu realized that he had planned the cutting of the lemon all along,\nto go with this expensive delicacy. The gesture no longer seemed\nspontaneousit was a way for die host to prove his cleverness. He had\naccidentally revealed how hard he was trying. Having seen enough,\nRikyu politely declined the cake, excused himself, and left.\n\nEmperor Hideyoshi once planned to visit Rikyu for a tea\nceremony. On the night before he was to come, snow began to fall.\nThinking quickly, Rikyu laid round cushions that fit exacdy on each of\ndie stepping-stones that led through the garden to his house. Just\nbefore dawn, he rose, saw that it had stopped snowing, and carefully\nremoved the cushions. When Hideyoshi arrived, he marveled at the\nsimple beauty of die sightthe per-fecdy round stepping stones,\nunencumbered by snowand noticed how it called no attention to die\nmanner in which Rikyu had accomplished it, but only to die polite\ngesture itself.\n\nAfter Sen no Rikyu died, his ideas had a profound influence on\nthe practice of the tea ceremony. The Tokugawa shogun Yorinobu, son\n\nof die great Emperor Ieyasu, was a student of Rikyu's teachings. In his\ngarden he had a stone lantern made by a famous master, and Lord\nSakai Tadakatsu asked if he could come by one day to see it. Yorinobu\nreplied diat he would be honored, and commanded his gardeners to put\neverything in order for the visit. These gardeners, unfamiliar with the\nprecepts of Cha-no-yu, thought die stone lantern misshapen, its\nwindows being too small for die present taste. They had a local\nworkman enlarge the windows. A few days before Lord Sakai's visit,\nYorinobu toured the garden. When he saw die al-\n\ntered windows he exploded with rage, ready to impale on his\nsword the fool who had ruined the lantern, upsetting its natural grace\nand destroying the whole purpose of Lord Sakai's visit.\n\nWhen Yorinobu calmed down, however, he remembered that he\nhad originally bought two of the lanterns, and that the second was in\nhis garden on the island of Kishu. At great expense, he hired a whale\nboat and the finest rowers he could find, ordering them to bring the\nlantern to him within two daysa difficult feat at best. But the sailors\nrowed day and night, and with the luck of a good wind they arrived\njust in time. To Yori-nobu's delight, this stone lantern was more\nmagnificent than the first, for it had stood untouched for twenty years\nin a bamboo thicket, acquiring a brilliant antique appearance and a\ndelicate covering of moss. When Lord Sakai arrived, later that same\nday, he was awed by the lantern, which was more magnificent than he\nhad imaginedso graceful and at one with the elements. Fortunately he\nhad no idea what time and effort it had cost Yorinobu to create this\nsublime effect.\n\nInterpretation\n\nTo Sen no Rikyu, the sudden appearance of something naturally,\nalmost accidentally graceful was the height of beauty. This beauty\ncame without warning and seemed effortless. Nature created such\nthings by its own laws and processes, but men had to create their\neffects through labor and contrivance. And when they showed the\neffort of producing the effect, the effect was spoiled. The gate came\nfrom too far away, the cutting of the lemon looked contrived.\n\nYou will often have to use tricks and ingenuity to create your\neffects the cushions in the snow, the men rowing all nightbut your\naudience must never suspect the work or the thinking that has gone\n\n\ninto them. Nature does not reveal its tricks, and what imitates nature\nby appearing effortless approximates nature's power.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II\n\nThe great escape artist Harry Houdini once advertised his act as\n\u201cThe Impossible Possible.\u201d And indeed those who witnessed his\ndramatic escapes felt that what he did onstage contradicted\ncommonsense ideas of human capacity.\n\nOne evening in 1904, an audience of 4,000 Londoners filled a\ntheater to watch Houdini accept a challenge: to escape from a pair of\nmanacles billed as the strongest ever invented. They contained six sets\nof locks and nine tumblers in each cuff; a Birmingham maker had\nspent five years constructing them. Experts who examined them said\nthey had never seen anything so intricate, and this intricacy was\nthought to make them impossible to escape.\n\nThe crowd watched the experts secure the manacles on Houdini's\nwrists. Then the escape artist entered a black cabinet on stage. The\nminutes\n\nswallows over willow trees. When Masamune saw the finished\nwork he was as overjoyed at the artist's skill as he had previously been\nannoyed at the apparent mess he was making of the screens.\n\nCHA-NO-YU!\n\nTHE JAPANESE TEA\n\nCEREMONY\n\nA. L. Sadler, 1962\n\nThere was once a wrestling master who was versed in 360 feints\nand holds. He took a special liking to one of his pupils, to whom he\ntaught 359 of them over a period of time. Somehow he never got\naround to the last trick. As months went by the young man became so\nproficient in the art that he bested everyone who dared to face him in\nthe ring. He was so proud of his prowess that one day he boasted\nbefore the sultan that he could readily whip his master, were it not out\nof respect for his age and gratitude for his tutelage.\n\nThe sultan became incensed at this irreverence and ordered an\nimmediate match with the royal court in attendance. At the gong the\nyouth barged forward with a lusty yell, only to be confronted with the\nunfamiliar 360th feint.\n\nThe master seized his former pupil, lifted him high above his\nhead, and flung him crashing to the ground. The sultan and the\nassembly let out a loud cheer. When the sultan asked the master how\nhe was able to overcome such a strong opponent, the master confessed\nthat he had reserved a secret technique for himself for just such a\ncontingency. Then he related the lamentation of a master of archery,\nwho taught everything he knew. \u201cNo one has learned archery from\nme,\u201d the poor fellow complained, \u201cwho has not tried to use me as a\nbutt in the end.\u201d\n\nA STORY OF SAADI,\n\nAS TOLD IN\n\nTHE CRAFT OF POWER,\n\nR.G. H. Siu, 1979\n\nwent by; the more time passed, the more certain it seemed that\nthese manacles would be die first to defeat him. At one point he\nemerged from the cabinet, and asked diat die cuffs be temporarily\nremoved so diat he could take off his coatit was hot inside. The\nchallengers refused, suspecting his request was a trick to find out how\nthe locks worked. Undeterred, and without using his hands, Houdini\nmanaged to lift die coat over his shoulders, turn it inside out, remove a\npenknife from his vest pocket widi his teeth, and, by moving his head,\ncut the coat off his arms. Freed from die coat, he stepped back into the\ncabinet, the audience roaring with approval at his grace and dexterity.\n\nFinally, having kept the audience waiting long enough, Houdini\nemerged from the cabinet a second time, now widi his hands free, die\nmanacles raised high in triumph. To diis day no one knows how he\nmanaged me escape. Altfiough he had taken close to an hour to free\nhimself, he had never looked concerned, had shown no sign of doubt.\nIndeed it seemed by die end diat he had drawn out die escape as a way\nto heighten die drama, to make the audience worryfor tiiere was no\nother sign diat die performance had been anydiing but easy. The\ncomplaint about die heat was equally part of die act. The spectators of\ndiis and odier Houdini performances must have felt he was toying widi\nthem: These manacles are nothing, he seemed to say, I could have\nfreed myself a lot sooner, and from a lot worse.\n\nOver the years, Houdini escaped from die chained carcass of an\nembalmed \u201csea monster\u201d (a half octopus, half whalelike beast diat had\n\n\nbeached near Boston); he had himself sealed inside an enormous\nenvelope from which he emerged widiout breaking die paper; he\npassed tiirough brick walls; he wriggled free from straitjackets while\ndangling high in die air; he leaped from bridges into icy waters, his\nhands manacled and his legs in chains; he had himself submerged in\nglass cases full of water, hands padlocked, while the audience watched\nin amazement as he worked himself free, struggling for close to an\nhour apparentiy without breadiing. Each time he seemed to court\ncertain deadi yet survived with superhuman aplomb. Meanwhile, he\nsaid nothing about his mediods, gave no clues as to how he\naccomplished any of his trickshe left his audiences and critics\nspeculating, his power and reputation enhanced by tiieir struggles with\ndie inexplicable. Perhaps the most baffling trick of all was making a\nten-tiiou-sand-pound elephant disappear before an audience's eyes, a\nfeat he repeated on stage for over nineteen weeks. No one has ever\nreally explained how he did diis, for in die auditorium where he\nperformed the trick, there was simply nowhere for an elephant to hide.\n\nThe effortlessness of Houdini's escapes led some to drink he used\noccult forces, his superior psychic abilities giving him special control\nover his body. But a German escape artist named Kleppini claimed to\nknow Houdini's secret: He simply used elaborate gadgets. Kleppini\nalso claimed to have defeated Houdini in a handcuff challenge in\nHolland.\n\nHoudini did not mind all kinds of speculation floating around\nabout\n\nhis methods, but he would not tolerate an outright lie, and in 1902\nhe challenged Kleppini to a handcuff duel. Kleppini accepted. Through\na spy, he found out the secret word to unlock a pair of French\ncombination-lock cuffs that Houdini liked to use. His plan was to\nchoose these cuffs to escape from onstage. This would definitively\ndebunk Houdinihis \u201cgenius\u201d simply lay in his use of mechanical\ngadgets.\n\nOn the night of the challenge, just as Kleppini had planned,\nHoudini offered him a choice of cuffs and he selected the ones with the\ncombination lock. He was even able to disappear with them behind a\nscreen to make a quick test, and reemerged seconds later, confident of\nvictory.\n\n\nActing as if he sensed fraud, Houdini refused to lock Kleppini in\n\nthe cuffs. The two men argued and began to fight, even wrestling with\neach other onstage. After a few minutes of this, an apparently angry,\ntustrated Houdini gave up and locked Kleppini in the cuffs. For the\nnext few minutes Kleppini strained to get free. Something was\nwrongminutes earlier he had opened the cuffs behind the screen; now\nthe same code no longer worked. He sweated, racking his brains.\nHours went by, the audience left, and finally an exhausted and\nhumiliated Kleppini gave up and asked to be released.\nThe cuffs that Kleppini himself had opened behind the screen\nwith die word \u201cC-L-E-F-S\u201d (French for \u201ckeys\u201d) now clicked open only\nwith the word \u201cF-R-A-U-D. \u201dKleppini never figured out how Houdini\nhad accomplished this uncanny feat.\n\nKeep the extent of your abilities unknown. The wise man does\nnot allow his knowledge and abilities to be sounded to the bottom, if\nhe desires to be honored by all. He allows you to know them but not to\ncomprehend them. No one must know the extent of his abilities, lest he\nbe disappointed. No one ever has an opportunity of fathoming him\nentirely. For guesses and doubts about the extent of his talents arouse\nmore veneration than accurate knowledge of them, be they ever so\ngreat.\n\nBaltasar Gracian, 1601-1658\n\nInterpretation\n\nAlthough we do not know for certain how Houdini accomplished\nmany of his most ingenious escapes, one thing is clear: It was not the\noccult, or any kind of magic, mat gave him his powers, but hard work\nand endless practice, all of which he carefully concealed from the\nworld. Houdini never left anything to chanceday and night he studied\nthe workings of locks, researched centuries-old sleight-of-hand tricks,\npored over books on mechanics, whatever he could use. Every moment\nnot spent researching he spent working his body, keeping himself\nexceptionally limber, and learning how to control his muscles and his\nbreathing.\n\nEarly on in Houdini's career, an old Japanese performer whom he\ntoured with taught him an ancient trick: how to swallow an ivory ball,\nfhen bring it back up. He practiced this endlessly with a small peeled\npotato tied to a stringup and down he would manipulate the potato\n\n\nwim his throat muscles, until they were strong enough to move it\nwithout the string. The organizers of the London handcuff challenge\nhad searched Houdini's body thoroughly beforehand, but no one could\ncheck the inside of his throat, where he could have concealed small\ntools to help him escape. Even so, Kleppini was fundamentally wrong:\nIt was not Houdini's tools but his practice, work, and research that\nmade his escapes possible.\n\nKleppini, in fact, was completely outwitted by Houdini, who set\nthe whole thing up. He let his opponent learn the code to the French\ncuffs,\n\nLAW 30\n\nthen baited him into choosing those cuffs onstage. Then, during\nthe two men's tussle, the dexterous Houdini was able to change the\ncode to \u201cF-R-A-U-D.\u201d He had spent weeks practicing this trick, but the\naudience saw none of the sweat and toil behind the scenes. Nor was\nHoudini ever nervous; he induced nervousness in others. (He\ndeliberately dragged out the time it would take to escape, as a way of\nheightening the drama, and making the audience squirm.) His escapes\nfrom death, always graceful and easy, made him look like a superman.\n\nAs a person of power, you must research and practice endlessly\nbefore appearing in public, onstage or anywhere else. Never expose\nthe sweat and labor behind your poise. Some think such exposure will\ndemonstrate their diligence and honesty, but it actually just makes\nthem look weakeras if anyone who practiced and worked at it could do\nwhat they had done, or as if they weren't really up to the job. Keep\nyour effort and your tricks to yourself and you seem to have the grace\nand ease of a god. One never sees the source of a god's power\nrevealed; one only sees its effects.\n\nA line [of poetry] will take us hours maybe;\n\nYet if it does not seem a moment's thought,\n\nOur stitching and unstitching has been naught.\n\nAdam's Curse, William Butler Yeats, 1865-1939\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nHumanity's first notions of power came from primitive encounters\nwith na-turethe flash of lightning in the sky, a sudden flood, the speed\nand ferocity of a wild animal. These forces required no thinking, no\nplanningthey awed us by their sudden appearance, their gracefulness,\n\nand their power over life and death. And this remains the kind of\npower we have always wanted to imitate. Through science and\ntechnology we have re-created the speed and sublime power of nature,\nbut something is missing: Our machines are noisy and jerky, they\nreveal their effort. Even the very best creations of technology cannot\nroot out our admiration for things that move easily and effortlessly.\nThe power of children to bend us to their will comes from a kind of\nseductive charm that we feel in the presence of a creature less\nreflective and more graceful than we are. We cannot return to such a\nstate, but if we can create the appearance of this kind of ease, we elicit\nin others the kind of primitive awe that nature has always evoked in\nhumankind.\n\nOne of the first European writers to expound on this principle\ncame from that most unnatural of environments, the Renaissance court.\nIn The Book of the Courtier, published in 1528, Baldassare Castiglione\ndescribes the highly elaborate and codified manners of the perfect\ncourt citizen. And yet, Castiglione explains, the courtier must execute\nthese gestures with what he calls sprezzfltura, the capacity to make the\ndifficult seem easy.

All\nthe great Renaissance artists carefully kept their works under wraps.\nOnly the finished masterpiece could be shown to the public.\nMichelangelo forbade even popes to view his work in process. A\nRenaissance artist was always careful to keep his studios shut to\npatrons and public alike, not out of fear of imitation, but because to see\nthe making of the works would mar the magic of dieir effect, and their\nstudied atmosphere of ease and natural beauty.\n\nThe Renaissance painter Vasari, also the first great art critic,\nridiculed the work of Paolo Uccello, who was obsessed with the laws\nof perspective. The effort Uccello spent on improving the appearance\n\nof perspective was too obvious in his workit made his paintings ugly\nand labored, overwhelmed by the effort of their effects. We have the\nsame response when we watch performers who put too much effort\ninto dieir act: Seeing them trying so hard breaks the illusion. It also\nmakes us uncomfortable. Calm, graceful performers, on the odier\nhand, set us at ease, creating the illusion that they are not acting but\nbeing natural and themselves, even when everything they are doing\ninvolves labor and practice.\n\nThe idea of sprezzfltura is relevant to all forms of power, for\npower depends vitally on appearances and the illusions you create.\nYour public actions are like artworks: They must have visual appeal,\nmust create anticipation, even entertain. When you reveal the inner\nworkings of your creation, you become just one more mortal among\nothers. What is understandable is not awe-inspiringwe tell ourselves\nwe could do as well if we had the money and time. Avoid the\ntemptation of showing how clever you areit is far more clever to\nconceal the mechanisms of your cleverness.\n\nTalleyrand's application of this concept to his daily life greatly\nenhanced the aura of power that surrounded him. He never liked to\nwork too hard, so he made others do the work for himdie spying, the\nresearch, the detailed analyses. With all this labor at his disposal, he\nhimself never seemed to strain. When his spies revealed that a certain\nevent was about to take place, he would talk in social conversation as\nif he sensed its imminence. The result was that people thought he was\nclairvoyant. His short pithy statements and witticisms always seemed\nto summarize a situation perfectly, but diey were based on much\nresearch and thought. To those in government, including Napoleon\nhimself, Talleyrand gave the impression of immense poweran effect\nentirely dependent on the apparent ease with which he accomplished\nhis feats.\n\nThere is another reason for concealing your shortcuts and tricks:\n\nWhen you let this information out, you give people ideas they can\nuse against you.

A zeal to conceal your work creates an\nunpleasant, almost paranoiac impression: you are taking the game too\nseriously. Houdini was careful to make the concealment of his tricks\nseem a game, all part of the show. Never show your work until it is\n\u2018inished, but if you put too much effort into keeping it under wraps you\nwill be like the painter Pontormo, who spent the last years of his life\nhiding his frescoes from the public eye and only succeeded in driving\nhimself mad. Always keep your sense of humor about yourself.\n\nThere are also times when revealing die inner workings of your\nprojects can prove worthwhile. It all depends on your audience's taste,\nand on\n\nthe times in which you operate. P. T. Barnum recognized that his\npublic wanted to feel involved in his shows, and that understanding his\ntricks delighted them, pardy, perhaps, because implicitly debunking\npeople who kept their sources of power hidden from the masses\nappealed to America's democratic spirit. The public also appreciated\n\n\nthe showman's humor and honesty. Barnum took this to the extreme of\npublicizing his own humbug-gery in his popular autobiography,\nwritten when his career was at its height.\n\nAs long as die partial disclosure of tricks and techniques is\ncarefully planned, rather than the result of an uncontrollable need to\nblab, it is the ultimate in cleverness.

The artist said he thought black-and-white\nsketches would suit them, and went home again after considering them\ncarefully. The next morning he came early and made a large quantity\nof ink into which he dipped a horseshoe he had brought with him, and\nthen proceeded to make impressions of this all over one of the screens.\nThen, with a large brush, he drew a number of lines across them.\nMeanwhile Masamune had come in to watch his work, and at this he\ncould contain his irritation no longer, and muttering, \u201cWhat a beastly\nmess!\u201d he strode away to his own apartments. The retainers told\nTannyu he was in a very bad temper indeed. \u201cHe shouldn't look on\nwhile I am at work, then, \u201d replied the painter, \u201che should wait till it is\nfinished. \u201d Then he took up a smaller brush and dashed in touches here\nand there, and as he did so the prints of the horse-shoe turned into\ncrabs, while the big broad strokes became rushes. He then turned to the\nother screen and splashed drops of ink all over it, and when he had\nadded a few brushstrokes here and there they became a flight of\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW I\n\nThe Japanese tea ceremony called Cha-no-yu (\u201cHot Water for\nTea\u201d) has origins in ancient times, but it reached its peak of refinement\nin the sixteenth century under its most renowned practitioner, Sen no\n\n\nRikyu. Although not from a noble family, Rikyu rose to great power,\nbecoming die preferred tea master of the Emperor Hideyoshi, and an\nimportant adviser on aesthetic and even political matters. For Rikyu,\nthe secret of success consisted in appearing natural, concealing the\neffort behind one's work.\n\nOne day Rikyu and his son went to an acquaintance's house for a\ntea ceremony. On the way in, the son remarked that die lovely antique-\nlooking gate at their host's house gave it an evocatively lonely\nappearance. \u201cI don't think so,\u201d replied his father, \u201cit looks as though it\nhad been brought from some mountain temple a long way off, and as if\ndie labor required to import it must have cost a lot of money.\u201d If the\nowner of the house had put mis much effort into one gate, it would\nshow in his tea ceremonyand indeed Sen no Rikyu had to leave die\nceremony early, unable to endure the affectation and effort it\ninadvertently revealed.\n\nOn another evening, while having tea at a friend's house, Rikyu\nsaw his host go outside, hold up a lantern in the darkness, cut a lemon\noff a tree, and bring it in. This charmed Rikyuthe host needed a relish\nfor die dish he was serving, and had spontaneously gone outside to get\none. But when the man offered die lemon with some Osaka rice cake,\nRikyu realized that he had planned the cutting of the lemon all along,\nto go with this expensive delicacy. The gesture no longer seemed\nspontaneousit was a way for die host to prove his cleverness. He had\naccidentally revealed how hard he was trying. Having seen enough,\nRikyu politely declined the cake, excused himself, and left.\n\nEmperor Hideyoshi once planned to visit Rikyu for a tea\nceremony. On the night before he was to come, snow began to fall.\nThinking quickly, Rikyu laid round cushions that fit exacdy on each of\ndie stepping-stones that led through the garden to his house. Just\nbefore dawn, he rose, saw that it had stopped snowing, and carefully\nremoved the cushions. When Hideyoshi arrived, he marveled at the\nsimple beauty of die sightthe per-fecdy round stepping stones,\nunencumbered by snowand noticed how it called no attention to die\nmanner in which Rikyu had accomplished it, but only to die polite\ngesture itself.\n\nAfter Sen no Rikyu died, his ideas had a profound influence on\nthe practice of the tea ceremony. The Tokugawa shogun Yorinobu, son\n\nof die great Emperor Ieyasu, was a student of Rikyu's teachings. In his\ngarden he had a stone lantern made by a famous master, and Lord\nSakai Tadakatsu asked if he could come by one day to see it. Yorinobu\nreplied diat he would be honored, and commanded his gardeners to put\neverything in order for the visit. These gardeners, unfamiliar with the\nprecepts of Cha-no-yu, thought die stone lantern misshapen, its\nwindows being too small for die present taste. They had a local\nworkman enlarge the windows. A few days before Lord Sakai's visit,\nYorinobu toured the garden. When he saw die al-\n\ntered windows he exploded with rage, ready to impale on his\nsword the fool who had ruined the lantern, upsetting its natural grace\nand destroying the whole purpose of Lord Sakai's visit.\n\nWhen Yorinobu calmed down, however, he remembered that he\nhad originally bought two of the lanterns, and that the second was in\nhis garden on the island of Kishu. At great expense, he hired a whale\nboat and the finest rowers he could find, ordering them to bring the\nlantern to him within two daysa difficult feat at best. But the sailors\nrowed day and night, and with the luck of a good wind they arrived\njust in time. To Yori-nobu's delight, this stone lantern was more\nmagnificent than the first, for it had stood untouched for twenty years\nin a bamboo thicket, acquiring a brilliant antique appearance and a\ndelicate covering of moss. When Lord Sakai arrived, later that same\nday, he was awed by the lantern, which was more magnificent than he\nhad imaginedso graceful and at one with the elements. Fortunately he\nhad no idea what time and effort it had cost Yorinobu to create this\nsublime effect.\n\nInterpretation\n\nTo Sen no Rikyu, the sudden appearance of something naturally,\nalmost accidentally graceful was the height of beauty. This beauty\ncame without warning and seemed effortless. Nature created such\nthings by its own laws and processes, but men had to create their\neffects through labor and contrivance. And when they showed the\neffort of producing the effect, the effect was spoiled. The gate came\nfrom too far away, the cutting of the lemon looked contrived.\n\nYou will often have to use tricks and ingenuity to create your\neffects the cushions in the snow, the men rowing all nightbut your\naudience must never suspect the work or the thinking that has gone\n\n\ninto them. Nature does not reveal its tricks, and what imitates nature\nby appearing effortless approximates nature's power.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II\n\nThe great escape artist Harry Houdini once advertised his act as\n\u201cThe Impossible Possible.\u201d And indeed those who witnessed his\ndramatic escapes felt that what he did onstage contradicted\ncommonsense ideas of human capacity.\n\nOne evening in 1904, an audience of 4,000 Londoners filled a\ntheater to watch Houdini accept a challenge: to escape from a pair of\nmanacles billed as the strongest ever invented. They contained six sets\nof locks and nine tumblers in each cuff; a Birmingham maker had\nspent five years constructing them. Experts who examined them said\nthey had never seen anything so intricate, and this intricacy was\nthought to make them impossible to escape.\n\nThe crowd watched the experts secure the manacles on Houdini's\nwrists. Then the escape artist entered a black cabinet on stage. The\nminutes\n\nswallows over willow trees. When Masamune saw the finished\nwork he was as overjoyed at the artist's skill as he had previously been\nannoyed at the apparent mess he was making of the screens.\n\nCHA-NO-YU!\n\nTHE JAPANESE TEA\n\nCEREMONY\n\nA. L. Sadler, 1962\n\nThere was once a wrestling master who was versed in 360 feints\nand holds. He took a special liking to one of his pupils, to whom he\ntaught 359 of them over a period of time. Somehow he never got\naround to the last trick. As months went by the young man became so\nproficient in the art that he bested everyone who dared to face him in\nthe ring. He was so proud of his prowess that one day he boasted\nbefore the sultan that he could readily whip his master, were it not out\nof respect for his age and gratitude for his tutelage.\n\nThe sultan became incensed at this irreverence and ordered an\nimmediate match with the royal court in attendance. At the gong the\nyouth barged forward with a lusty yell, only to be confronted with the\nunfamiliar 360th feint.\n\nThe master seized his former pupil, lifted him high above his\nhead, and flung him crashing to the ground. The sultan and the\nassembly let out a loud cheer. When the sultan asked the master how\nhe was able to overcome such a strong opponent, the master confessed\nthat he had reserved a secret technique for himself for just such a\ncontingency. Then he related the lamentation of a master of archery,\nwho taught everything he knew. \u201cNo one has learned archery from\nme,\u201d the poor fellow complained, \u201cwho has not tried to use me as a\nbutt in the end.\u201d\n\nA STORY OF SAADI,\n\nAS TOLD IN\n\nTHE CRAFT OF POWER,\n\nR.G. H. Siu, 1979\n\nwent by; the more time passed, the more certain it seemed that\nthese manacles would be die first to defeat him. At one point he\nemerged from the cabinet, and asked diat die cuffs be temporarily\nremoved so diat he could take off his coatit was hot inside. The\nchallengers refused, suspecting his request was a trick to find out how\nthe locks worked. Undeterred, and without using his hands, Houdini\nmanaged to lift die coat over his shoulders, turn it inside out, remove a\npenknife from his vest pocket widi his teeth, and, by moving his head,\ncut the coat off his arms. Freed from die coat, he stepped back into the\ncabinet, the audience roaring with approval at his grace and dexterity.\n\nFinally, having kept the audience waiting long enough, Houdini\nemerged from the cabinet a second time, now widi his hands free, die\nmanacles raised high in triumph. To diis day no one knows how he\nmanaged me escape. Altfiough he had taken close to an hour to free\nhimself, he had never looked concerned, had shown no sign of doubt.\nIndeed it seemed by die end diat he had drawn out die escape as a way\nto heighten die drama, to make the audience worryfor tiiere was no\nother sign diat die performance had been anydiing but easy. The\ncomplaint about die heat was equally part of die act. The spectators of\ndiis and odier Houdini performances must have felt he was toying widi\nthem: These manacles are nothing, he seemed to say, I could have\nfreed myself a lot sooner, and from a lot worse.\n\nOver the years, Houdini escaped from die chained carcass of an\nembalmed \u201csea monster\u201d (a half octopus, half whalelike beast diat had\n\n\nbeached near Boston); he had himself sealed inside an enormous\nenvelope from which he emerged widiout breaking die paper; he\npassed tiirough brick walls; he wriggled free from straitjackets while\ndangling high in die air; he leaped from bridges into icy waters, his\nhands manacled and his legs in chains; he had himself submerged in\nglass cases full of water, hands padlocked, while the audience watched\nin amazement as he worked himself free, struggling for close to an\nhour apparentiy without breadiing. Each time he seemed to court\ncertain deadi yet survived with superhuman aplomb. Meanwhile, he\nsaid nothing about his mediods, gave no clues as to how he\naccomplished any of his trickshe left his audiences and critics\nspeculating, his power and reputation enhanced by tiieir struggles with\ndie inexplicable. Perhaps the most baffling trick of all was making a\nten-tiiou-sand-pound elephant disappear before an audience's eyes, a\nfeat he repeated on stage for over nineteen weeks. No one has ever\nreally explained how he did diis, for in die auditorium where he\nperformed the trick, there was simply nowhere for an elephant to hide.\n\nThe effortlessness of Houdini's escapes led some to drink he used\noccult forces, his superior psychic abilities giving him special control\nover his body. But a German escape artist named Kleppini claimed to\nknow Houdini's secret: He simply used elaborate gadgets. Kleppini\nalso claimed to have defeated Houdini in a handcuff challenge in\nHolland.\n\nHoudini did not mind all kinds of speculation floating around\nabout\n\nhis methods, but he would not tolerate an outright lie, and in 1902\nhe challenged Kleppini to a handcuff duel. Kleppini accepted. Through\na spy, he found out the secret word to unlock a pair of French\ncombination-lock cuffs that Houdini liked to use. His plan was to\nchoose these cuffs to escape from onstage. This would definitively\ndebunk Houdinihis \u201cgenius\u201d simply lay in his use of mechanical\ngadgets.\n\nOn the night of the challenge, just as Kleppini had planned,\nHoudini offered him a choice of cuffs and he selected the ones with the\ncombination lock. He was even able to disappear with them behind a\nscreen to make a quick test, and reemerged seconds later, confident of\nvictory.\n\n\nActing as if he sensed fraud, Houdini refused to lock Kleppini in\n\nthe cuffs. The two men argued and began to fight, even wrestling with\neach other onstage. After a few minutes of this, an apparently angry,\ntustrated Houdini gave up and locked Kleppini in the cuffs. For the\nnext few minutes Kleppini strained to get free. Something was\nwrongminutes earlier he had opened the cuffs behind the screen; now\nthe same code no longer worked. He sweated, racking his brains.\nHours went by, the audience left, and finally an exhausted and\nhumiliated Kleppini gave up and asked to be released.\nThe cuffs that Kleppini himself had opened behind the screen\nwith die word \u201cC-L-E-F-S\u201d (French for \u201ckeys\u201d) now clicked open only\nwith the word \u201cF-R-A-U-D. \u201dKleppini never figured out how Houdini\nhad accomplished this uncanny feat.\n\nKeep the extent of your abilities unknown. The wise man does\nnot allow his knowledge and abilities to be sounded to the bottom, if\nhe desires to be honored by all. He allows you to know them but not to\ncomprehend them. No one must know the extent of his abilities, lest he\nbe disappointed. No one ever has an opportunity of fathoming him\nentirely. For guesses and doubts about the extent of his talents arouse\nmore veneration than accurate knowledge of them, be they ever so\ngreat.\n\nBaltasar Gracian, 1601-1658\n\nInterpretation\n\nAlthough we do not know for certain how Houdini accomplished\nmany of his most ingenious escapes, one thing is clear: It was not the\noccult, or any kind of magic, mat gave him his powers, but hard work\nand endless practice, all of which he carefully concealed from the\nworld. Houdini never left anything to chanceday and night he studied\nthe workings of locks, researched centuries-old sleight-of-hand tricks,\npored over books on mechanics, whatever he could use. Every moment\nnot spent researching he spent working his body, keeping himself\nexceptionally limber, and learning how to control his muscles and his\nbreathing.\n\nEarly on in Houdini's career, an old Japanese performer whom he\ntoured with taught him an ancient trick: how to swallow an ivory ball,\nfhen bring it back up. He practiced this endlessly with a small peeled\npotato tied to a stringup and down he would manipulate the potato\n\n\nwim his throat muscles, until they were strong enough to move it\nwithout the string. The organizers of the London handcuff challenge\nhad searched Houdini's body thoroughly beforehand, but no one could\ncheck the inside of his throat, where he could have concealed small\ntools to help him escape. Even so, Kleppini was fundamentally wrong:\nIt was not Houdini's tools but his practice, work, and research that\nmade his escapes possible.\n\nKleppini, in fact, was completely outwitted by Houdini, who set\nthe whole thing up. He let his opponent learn the code to the French\ncuffs,\n\nLAW 30\n\nthen baited him into choosing those cuffs onstage. Then, during\nthe two men's tussle, the dexterous Houdini was able to change the\ncode to \u201cF-R-A-U-D.\u201d He had spent weeks practicing this trick, but the\naudience saw none of the sweat and toil behind the scenes. Nor was\nHoudini ever nervous; he induced nervousness in others. (He\ndeliberately dragged out the time it would take to escape, as a way of\nheightening the drama, and making the audience squirm.) His escapes\nfrom death, always graceful and easy, made him look like a superman.\n\nAs a person of power, you must research and practice endlessly\nbefore appearing in public, onstage or anywhere else. Never expose\nthe sweat and labor behind your poise. Some think such exposure will\ndemonstrate their diligence and honesty, but it actually just makes\nthem look weakeras if anyone who practiced and worked at it could do\nwhat they had done, or as if they weren't really up to the job. Keep\nyour effort and your tricks to yourself and you seem to have the grace\nand ease of a god. One never sees the source of a god's power\nrevealed; one only sees its effects.\n\nA line [of poetry] will take us hours maybe;\n\nYet if it does not seem a moment's thought,\n\nOur stitching and unstitching has been naught.\n\nAdam's Curse, William Butler Yeats, 1865-1939\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nHumanity's first notions of power came from primitive encounters\nwith na-turethe flash of lightning in the sky, a sudden flood, the speed\nand ferocity of a wild animal. These forces required no thinking, no\nplanningthey awed us by their sudden appearance, their gracefulness,\n\nand their power over life and death. And this remains the kind of\npower we have always wanted to imitate. Through science and\ntechnology we have re-created the speed and sublime power of nature,\nbut something is missing: Our machines are noisy and jerky, they\nreveal their effort. Even the very best creations of technology cannot\nroot out our admiration for things that move easily and effortlessly.\nThe power of children to bend us to their will comes from a kind of\nseductive charm that we feel in the presence of a creature less\nreflective and more graceful than we are. We cannot return to such a\nstate, but if we can create the appearance of this kind of ease, we elicit\nin others the kind of primitive awe that nature has always evoked in\nhumankind.\n\nOne of the first European writers to expound on this principle\ncame from that most unnatural of environments, the Renaissance court.\nIn The Book of the Courtier, published in 1528, Baldassare Castiglione\ndescribes the highly elaborate and codified manners of the perfect\ncourt citizen. And yet, Castiglione explains, the courtier must execute\nthese gestures with what he calls sprezzfltura, the capacity to make the\ndifficult seem easy. He urges the courtier to \"practice in all tilings a\ncertain nonchalance which conceals all\n\nartistry and makes whatever one says or does seem uncontrived\nand effortless.\u201c We all admire the achievement of some unusual feat,\nbut if it is accomplished naturally and gracefully, our admiration\nincreases tenfold \u201dwhereas ... to labor at what one is doing and ... to\nmake bones over it, shows an extreme lack of grace and causes\neverything, whatever its worth, to be discounted.\"\n\nMuch of the idea of sprezzatura came from the world of art.

Below is an excerpt from my book titled '48 Laws of Power', specifically from Chapter '48 Laws of Power', Section 'LAW 31'. The original text is: 'CONTROL THE OPTIONS:\n\nGET OTHERS TO PLAY WITH\n\nTHE CARDS YOU DEAL\n\nJUDGMENT\n\nThe best deceptions are the ones that seem to give the other\nperson a choice: Your victims feel they are in control, but are actually\nyour puppets. Give people options that come out in your favor\nwhichever one they choose. Force them to make choices between the\nlesser of two evils, both of which serve your purpose. Put them on the\nhorns of a dilemma: They are gored wherever they turn.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW I\n\nFrom early in his reign, Ivan IV, later known as Ivan the Terrible,\nhad to confront an unpleasant reality: The country desperately needed\nreform, but he lacked the power to push it through. The greatest limit\nto his authority came from the boyars, the Russian princely class that\ndominated the country and terrorized the peasantry.\n\nIn 1553, at the age of twenty-three, Ivan fell ill. Lying in bed,\nnearing death, he asked the boyars to swear allegiance to his son as the\nnew czar. Some hesitated, some even refused. Then and there Ivan saw\nhe had no power over the boyars. He recovered from his illness, but he\nnever forgot the lesson: The boyars were out to destroy him. And\nindeed in the years to come, many of the most powerful of them\ndefected to Russia's main enemies, Poland and Lithuania, where they\nplotted their return and the overthrow of the czar. Even one of Ivan's\nclosest friends, Prince Andrey Kurbski, suddenly turned against him,\ndefecting to Lithuania in 1564, and becoming the strongest of Ivan's\nenemies.\n\nWhen Kurbski began raising troops for an invasion, the royal\ndynasty seemed suddenly more precarious than ever. With emigre\nnobles fomenting invasion from the west, Tartars bearing down from\nthe east, and the boyars stirring up trouble within the country, Russia's\n\nvast size made it a nightmare to defend. In whatever direction Ivan\nstruck, he would leave himself vulnerable on the other side. Only if he\nhad absolute power could he deal with this many-headed Hydra. And\nhe had no such power.\n\nIvan brooded until the morning of December 3, 1564, when the\ncitizens of Moscow awoke to a strange sight. Hundreds of sleds filled\nthe square before the Kremlin, loaded with the czar's treasures and\nwith provisions for the entire court. They watched in disbelief as the\nczar and his court boarded the sleds and left town. Without explaining\nwhy, he established himself in a village south of Moscow. For an entire\nmonth a kind of terror gripped the capital, for the Muscovites feared\nthat Ivan had abandoned them to the bloodthirsty boyars. Shops closed\nup and riotous mobs gathered daily. Finally, on January 3 of 1565, a\nletter arrived from the czar, explaining that he could no longer bear the\nboyars' betrayals and had decided to abdicate once and for all.\n\nRead aloud in public, the letter had a startling effect: Merchants\nand commoners blamed the boyars for Ivan's decision, and took to the\nstreets, terrifying the nobility with their fury. Soon a group of delegates\nrepresenting the church, the princes, and the people made the journey\nto Ivan's village, and begged the czar, in the name of the holy land of\nRussia, to return to the throne. Ivan listened but would not change his\nmind. After days of hearing their pleas, however, he offered his\nsubjects a choice: Either they grant him absolute powers to govern as\nhe pleased, with no interference from the boyars, or they find a new\nleader.\n\nFaced with a choice between civil war and the acceptance of\ndespotic power, almost every sector of Russian society \u201copted\u201d for a\nstrong czar, calling for Ivan's return to Moscow and the restoration of\nlaw and order. In\n\nThe German Chancellor Bismarck, enraged at the constant\ncriticisms from Rudolf Virchow (the German pathologist and liberal\npolitician), had his seconds call upon the scientist to challenge him to a\nduel. \u201cAs the challenged party, I have the choice of weapons, \u201d said\nVirchow, \u201cand I choose these. \u201d He held aloft two large and apparently\nidentical sausages. \u201cOne of these,\u201d he went on, \u201cis infected with\ndeadly germs; the other is perfectly sound. Let His Excellency decide\nwhich one he wishes to eat, and I will eat the other.\u201d A Imost\n\nimmediately the message came back that the chancellor had decided to\ncancel the duel.\n\nthe little, brown book of anecdotes, Clifton Fadiman, hd., 1985\n\nOnce upon a time there was a king of Armenia, who, being of a\ncurious turn of mind and in need of some new diversion, sent his\nheralds throughout the land to make the following proclamation: \u201cHear\nthis! Whatever man among you can prove himself the most outrageous\nliar in Armenia shall receive an apple made of pure gold from the\nhands of His Majesty the King!\u201d People began to swarm to the palace\nfrom every town and hamlet in the country, people of all ranks and\nconditions, princes, merchants, farmers, priests, rich and poor, tall and\nshort, fat and thin. There was no lack of liars in the land, and each one\ntold his tale to the king. A ruler, however, has heard practically every\nsort of lie, and none of those now told him convinced the king that he\nhad listened to the best of them. The king was beginning to grow tired\nof his new sport and was thinking of calling the whole contest off\nwithout declaring a winner, when there appeared before him a poor,\nragged man, carrying a large earthenware pitcher under his arm. \u201cWhat\ncan I do for you\u201d asked His Majesty. \u201cSire!\u201d said the poor man,\nslightly bewil-\n\nFebruary, with much celebration, Ivan returned to Moscow. The\nRussians could no longer complain if he behaved dictatoriallythey had\ngiven him this power themselves.\n\nInterpretation\n\nIvan the Terrible faced a terrible dilemma: To give in to die\nboyars would lead to certain destruction, but civil war would bring a\ndifferent kind of ruin. Even if Ivan came out of such a war on top, die\ncountry would be devastated and its divisions would be stronger dian\never. His weapon of choice in the past had been to make a bold,\noffensive move. Now, however, that kind of move would turn against\nhimthe more boldly he confronted his enemies, die worse die reactions\nhe would spark.\n\nThe main weakness of a show of force is that it stirs up\nresentment and eventually leads to a response that eats at your\naudiority Ivan, immensely creative in the use of power, saw clearly\nthat die only padi to die kind of victory he wanted was a false\nwididrawal. He would not force the country over to his position, he\n\nwould give it \u201coptions\u201d: eidier his abdication, and certain anarchy, or\nhis accession to absolute power. To back up his move, he made it clear\ndiat he preferred to abdicate: \u201cCall my bluff,\u201d he said, \u201cand watch what\nhappens.\u201d No one called his bluff. By withdrawing for just a month, he\nshowed the country a glimpse of die nightmares that would follow his\nabdicationTartar invasions, civil war, ruin. (All of these did eventually\ncome to pass after Ivan's deadi, in the infamous \u201cTime of die\nTroubles.\u201d)\n\nWithdrawal and disappearance are classic ways of controlling the\noptions. You give people a sense of how things will fall apart without\nyou, and you offer diem a \u201cchoice\u201d: I stay away and you suffer die\nconsequences, or I return under circumstances that I dictate. In this\nmediod of controlling people's options, they choose the option that\ngives you power because die alternative is just too unpleasant. You\norce their hand, but indirecdy: They seem to have a choice. Whenever\npeople feel tiiey have a choice, they walk into your trap diat much\nmore easily.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II\n\nAs a seventeenth-century French courtesan, Ninon de Lenclos\nound diat her life had certain pleasures. Her lovers came from royalty\nand aristocracy, and diey paid her well, entertained her witii tiieir wit\nand intellect, satisfied her radier demanding sensual needs, and treated\nher almost as an equal. Such a life was infinitely preferable to\nmarriage. In 1643, however, Ninon's motiier died suddenly, leaving\nher, at the age of twenty-three, totally alone in the worldno family, no\ndowry, notiiing to fall back upon. A kind of panic overtook her and she\nentered a convent, turning her back on her illustrious lovers. A year\nlater she left the convent and moved to Lyons. When she finally\nreappeared in Paris, in 1648, lovers and suitors flocked to her door in\ngreater numbers tiian ever before, for she was die wittiest and\n\nmost spirited courtesan of the time and her presence had been\ngreatly missed.\n\nNinon's followers quickly discovered, however, that she had\nchanged her old way of doing things, and had set up a new system of\noptions. The dukes, seigneurs, and princes who wanted to pay for her\nservices could continue to do so, but they were no longer in controlshe\nwould sleep with them when she wanted, according to her whim. All\n\n\ntheir money bought them was a possibility. If it was her pleasure to\nsleep with them only once a month, so be it.\n\nThose who did not want to be what Ninon called a payeur could\njoin the large and growing group of men she called her martyrs men\nwho visited her apartment principally for her friendship, her biting wit,\nher lute-playing, and the company of the most vibrant minds of the\nperiod, including Moliere, La Rochefoucauld, and Saint-Evremond.\nThe martyrs, too, however, entertained a possibility: She would\nregularly select from them a favori, a man who would become her\nlover without having to pay, and to whom she would abandon herself\ncompletely for as long as she so desireda week, a few months, rarely\nlonger. A payeur could not become a favori, but a martyr had no\nguarantee of becoming one, and indeed could remain disappointed for\nan entire lifetime. The poet Charleval, for example, never enjoyed\nNinon's favors, but never stopped coming to visithe did not want to do\nwithout her company.\n\nAs word of this system reached polite French society, Ninon\nbecame the object of intense hostility. Her reversal of the position of\nthe courtesan scandalized the queen mother and her court. Much to\ntheir horror, however, it did not discourage her male suitorsindeed it\nonly increased their numbers and intensified their desire. It became an\nhonor to be a payeur, helping Ninon to maintain her lifestyle and her\nglittering salon, accompanying her sometimes to die theater, and\nsleeping with her when she chose. Even more distinguished were the\nmartyrs, enjoying her company without paying for it and maintaining\nthe hope, however remote, of some day becoming her favori. That\npossibility spurred on many a young nobleman, as word spread that\nnone among the courtesans could surpass Ninon in the art of love. And\nso the married and the single, the old and the young, entered her web\nand chose one of the two options presented to them, both of which\namply satisfied her.\n\ndered. \"Surely you\n\nremember You owe\n\nme a pot of gold, and I\n\nhave come to\n\ncollect it.\"\n\n\"You are a perfect liar,\n\n\nsir!\" exclaimed the\n\nking. \"I owe you no\n\nmoney!\"\n\n\u201cA perfect liar, am I\u201d\n\nsaid the poor man.\n\n\" Then give me the\n\ngolden apple!\"\n\nThe king, realizing that\n\nthe man was trying to\n\ntrick him, started to\n\nhedge.\n\n\"No, no! You are not a\n\nliar!\"\n\n\"Then give me the pot\n\nof gold you owe me,\n\nsire,\" said the man.\n\nThe king saw the\n\ndilemma. He handed\n\nover the golden apple.\n\narmenian folk-tales and fables, retold by Charles Downing, 1993\nInterpretation\n\nThe life of the courtesan entailed the possibility of a power that\nwas denied a married woman, but it also had obvious perils. The man\nwho paid for the courtesan's services in essence owned her,\ndetermining when he could possess her and when, later on, he would\nabandon her. As she grew older, her options narrowed, as fewer men\nchose her. To avoid a life of poverty she had to amass her fortune\nwhile she was young. The courtesan's legendary greed, then, reflected\na practical necessity, yet also lessened her allure, since the illusion of\nbeing desired is important to men, who are often alien-\n\n./, P. Morgan Sr. once told a jeweler of his acquaintance that he\nwas interested in buying a pearl scarf-pin. Just a few weeks later, the\njeweler happened upon a magnificent pearl. He had it mounted in an\nappropriate setting and sent it to Morgan, together with a bill for\n$5,000. The following day the package was returned. Morgan's\naccompanying note read: \u201c/ like the pin, but I don't like the price. If\nyou will accept the enclosed check for $4,000, please send back the\n\n\nbox with the seal unbroken. \u201d The enraged jeweler refused the check\nand dismissed the messenger in disgust. He opened up the box to\nreclaim the unwanted pin, only to find that it had been removed. In its\nplace was a check for $5,000.\n\nthe little, brown\n\nbook of anhcdoths,\n\nClifton Fadiman, h,d.,\n\nated if their partner is too interested in their money. As the\ncourtesan aged, then, she faced a most difficult fate.\n\nNinon de Lenclos had a horror of any kind of dependence. She\nearly on tasted a kind of equality with her lovers, and she would not\nsettle into a system that left her such distasteful options. Strangely\nenough, the system she devised in its place seemed to satisfy her\nsuitors as much as it did her. The payeurs may have had to pay, but the\nfact that Ninon would only sleep with them when she wanted to gave\nthem a thrill unavailable with every other courtesan: She was yielding\nout of her own desire. The martyrs\u2019 avoidance of the taint of having to\npay gave them a sense of superiority; as members of Ninon's fraternity\nof admirers, they also might some day experience the ultimate pleasure\nof being her favori. Finally, Ninon did not force her suitors into either\ncategory. They could \u201cchoose\u201d which side they preferreda freedom that\nleft them a vestige of masculine pride.\n\nSuch is the power of giving people a choice, or rather the illusion\nof one, for they are playing with cards you have dealt them. Where the\nalternatives set up by Ivan the Terrible involved a certain riskone\noption would have led to his losing his powerNinon created a situation\nin which every option redounded to her favor. From the payeurs she\nreceived the money she needed to run her salon. And from the martyrs\nshe gained the ultimate in power: She could surround herself with a\nbevy of admirers, a harem from which to choose her lovers.\n\nThe system, though, depended on one critical factor: the\npossibility, however remote, that a martyr could become a favori. The\nillusion that riches, glory, or sensual satisfaction may someday fall into\nyour victim's lap is an irresistible carrot to include in your list of\nchoices. That hope, however slim, will make men accept die most\nridiculous situations, because it leaves them the all-important option of\na dream. The illusion of choice, married to the possibility of future\n\ngood fortune, will lure the most stubborn sucker into your glittering\nweb.\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nWords like \u201cfreedom,\u201d \u201coptions,\u201d and \u201cchoice\u201d evoke a power of\npossibility far beyond the reality of the benefits they entail. When\nexamined closely, the choices we havein the marketplace, in elections,\nin our jobstend to have noticeable limitations: They are often a matter\nof a choice simply between A and B, with the rest of the alphabet out\nof the picture. Yet as long as the faintest mirage of choice flickers on,\nwe rarely focus on the missing options. We \u201cchoose\u201d to believe that\nthe game is fair, and that we have our freedom. We prefer not to think\ntoo much about the depth of our liberty to choose.\n\nThis unwillingness to probe the smallness of our choices stems\nfrom the fact that too much freedom creates a kind of anxiety. The\nphrase \u201cunlimited options\u201d sounds infinitely promising, but unlimited\noptions would actually paralyze us and cloud our ability to choose.\nOur limited range of choices comforts us.\n\nThis supplies the clever and cunning with enormous opportunities\nfor deception. For people who are choosing between alternatives find it\nhard to believe they are being manipulated or deceived; they cannot\nsee that you are allowing them a small amount of free will in exchange\nfor a much more powerful imposition of your own will. Setting up a\nnarrow range of choices, then, should always be a part of your\ndeceptions. There is a saying: If you can get the bird to walk into the\ncage on its own, it will sing that much more prettily.\n\nThe following are among the most common forms of \u201ccontrolling\nthe options\u201d:\n\nColor the Choices. This was a favored technique of Henry\nKissinger. As President Richard Nixon's secretary of state, Kissinger\nconsidered himself better informed than his boss, and believed that in\nmost situations he could make the best decision on his own. But if he\ntried to determine policy, he would offend or perhaps enrage a\nnotoriously insecure man. So Kissinger would propose three or four\nchoices of action for each situation, and would present them in such a\nway that the one he preferred always seemed the best solution\ncompared to the others. Time after time, Nixon fell for the bait, never\n\nsuspecting that he was moving where Kissinger pushed him. This is an\nexcellent device to use on the insecure master.\n\nForce the Resister. One of the main problems faced by Dr. Milton\nH. Er-ickson, a pioneer of hypnosis therapy in the 1950s, was the\nrelapse. His patients might seem to be recovering rapidly, but their\napparent susceptibility to the therapy masked a deep resistance: They\nwould soon relapse into old habits, blame the doctor, and stop coming\nto see him. To avoid this, Erick-son began ordering some patients to\nhave a relapse, to make themselves feel as bad as when they first came\ninto go back to square one. Faced with this option, the patients would\nusually \u201cchoose\u201d to avoid the relapse which, of course, was what\nErickson really wanted.\n\nThis is a good technique to use on children and other willful\npeople who enjoy doing the opposite of what you ask them to: Push\nthem to \u201cchoose\u201d what you want them to do by appearing to advocate\nthe opposite.\n\nAlter the Playing Field. In the 1860s, John D. Rockefeller set out\nto create an oil monopoly. If he tried to buy up the smaller oil\ncompanies they would figure out what he was doing and fight back.\nInstead, he began se-credy buying up the railway companies that\ntransported the oil. When he then attempted to take over a particular\ncompany, and met with resistance, he reminded diem of their\ndependence on the rails. Refusing them shipping, or simply raising\ntheir fees, could ruin their business. Rockefeller altered the playing\nfield so that die only options the small oil producers had were die ones\nhe gave diem.\n\nIn this tactic your opponents know their hand is being forced, but\nit doesn't matter. The technique is effective against those who resist at\nall costs.\n\nThe Shrinking Options. The late-nineteenth-century art dealer\nAm-broise VoUard perfected this technique.\n\nCustomers would come to Vollard's shop to see some Cezannes.\nHe would show three paintings, neglect to mention a price, and pretend\nto doze off. The visitors would have to leave without deciding. They\nwould usually come back the next day to see the paintings again, but\nthis time Vollard would pull out less interesting works, pretending he\nthought they were the same ones. The baffled customers would look at\n\nthe new offerings, leave to think them over, and return yet again. Once\nagain the same thing would happen: Vollard would show paintings of\nlesser quality still. Finally the buyers would realize they had better\ngrab what he was showing them, because tomorrow they would have\nto settle for something worse, perhaps at even higher prices.\n\nA variation on this technique is to raise the price every time the\nbuyer hesitates and another day goes by. This is an excellent\nnegotiating ploy to use on the chronically indecisive, who will fall for\nthe idea that they are getting a better deal today than if they wait till\ntomorrow.\n\nThe Weak Man on the Precipice. The weak are the easiest to\nmaneuver by controlling their options. Cardinal de Retz, die great\nseventeenth-century provocateur, served as an unofficial assistant to\nthe Duke of Orleans, who was notoriously indecisive. It was a constant\nstruggle to convince the duke to take actionhe would hem and haw,\nweigh the options, and wait till the last moment, giving everyone\naround him an ulcer. But Retz discovered a way to handle him: He\nwould describe all sorts of dangers, exaggerating them as much as\npossible, until the duke saw a yawning abyss in every direction except\none: the one Retz was pushing him to take.\n\nThis tactic is similar to \u201cColor the Choices,\u201d but widi the weak\nyou have to be more aggressive. Work on their emotionsuse fear and\nterror to propel them into action. Try reason and they will always find\na way to procrastinate.\n\nBrothers in Crime. This is a classic con-artist technique: You\nattract your victims to some criminal scheme, creating a bond of blood\nand guilt between you. They participate in your deception, commit a\ncrime (or think they dosee the story of Sam Geezil in Law 3), and are\neasily manipulated. Serge Stavisky, the great French con artist of the\n1920s, so entangled the government in his scams and swindles that die\nstate did not dare to prosecute him, and \u201cchose\u201d to leave him alone. It\nis often wise to implicate in your deceptions the very person who can\ndo you the most harm if you fail. Their involvement can be subtieeven\na hint of their involvement will narrow their options and buy their\nsilence.\n\nThe Horns of a Dilemma. This idea was demonstrated by General\nWilliam Sherman's infamous march through Georgia during the\n\n\nAmerican Civil War. Although the Confederates knew what direction\nSherman was\n\nheading in, they never knew if he would attack from the left or\nthe right, for he divided his army into two wingsand if the rebels\nretreated from one wing they found themselves facing the other. This\nis a classic trial lawyer's technique: The lawyer leads the witnesses to\ndecide between two possible explanations of an event, both of which\npoke a hole in their story. They have to answer the lawyer's questions,\nbut whatever they say they hurt themselves. The key to this move is to\nstrike quickly: Deny the victim the time to think of an escape. As they\nwriggle between the horns of the dilemma, they dig their own grave.\n\nUnderstand: In your struggles with your rivals, it will often be\nnecessary for you to hurt mem. And if you are clearly the agent of their\npunishment, expect a counterattackexpect revenge. If, however, they\nseem to themselves to be the agents of their own misfortune, they will\nsubmit quietly. When Ivan left Moscow for his rural village, the\ncitizens asking him to return agreed to his demand for absolute power.\nOver the years to come, they resented him less for the terror he\nunleashed on the country, because, after all, they had granted him his\npower themselves. This is why it is always good to allow your victims\ntheir choice of poison, and to cloak your involvement in providing it to\nthem as far as possible.\n\nImage: The Horns ofthe Bull. The bullbacks you into the corner\nwith its hornsnota single horn, which youmight be able to escape, but a\npair of hornsthat trap you within theirhold. Run right or runlefteither\nway youmove into their piercingends and are gored.\n\nAuthority: For the wounds and every other evil that men inflict\nupon themselves spontaneously, and of their own choice, are in the\nlong run less painful than those inflicted by others. (Niccolo\nMachiavelli, 1469-1527)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nControlling the options has one main purpose: to disguise\nyourself as the agent of power and punishment. The tactic works best,\nthen, for tiiose whose power is fragile, and who cannot operate too\nopenly without incurring suspicion, resentment, and anger. Even as a\ngeneral rule, however, it is rarely wise to be seen as exerting power\ndirectly and forcefully, no matter how secure or strong you are. It is\n\nusually more elegant and more effective to give people the illusion of\nchoice.\n\nOn the other hand, by limiting other people's options you\nsometimes limit your own. There are situations in which it is to your\nadvantage to allow your rivals a large degree of freedom: As you\nwatch them operate, you give yourself rich opportunities to spy, gather\ninformation, and plan your deceptions. The nineteentii-century banker\nJames Rothschild liked this method: He felt that if he tried to control\nhis opponents' movements, he lost the chance to observe their strategy\nand plan a more effective course. The more freedom he allowed them\nin the short term, the more forcefully he could act against them in the\nlong run.\n'.

In\n\nThe German Chancellor Bismarck, enraged at the constant\ncriticisms from Rudolf Virchow (the German pathologist and liberal\npolitician), had his seconds call upon the scientist to challenge him to a\nduel. \u201cAs the challenged party, I have the choice of weapons, \u201d said\nVirchow, \u201cand I choose these. \u201d He held aloft two large and apparently\nidentical sausages. \u201cOne of these,\u201d he went on, \u201cis infected with\ndeadly germs; the other is perfectly sound.

A ruler, however, has heard practically every\nsort of lie, and none of those now told him convinced the king that he\nhad listened to the best of them. The king was beginning to grow tired\nof his new sport and was thinking of calling the whole contest off\nwithout declaring a winner, when there appeared before him a poor,\nragged man, carrying a large earthenware pitcher under his arm. \u201cWhat\ncan I do for you\u201d asked His Majesty. \u201cSire!\u201d said the poor man,\nslightly bewil-\n\nFebruary, with much celebration, Ivan returned to Moscow. The\nRussians could no longer complain if he behaved dictatoriallythey had\ngiven him this power themselves.\n\nInterpretation\n\nIvan the Terrible faced a terrible dilemma: To give in to die\nboyars would lead to certain destruction, but civil war would bring a\ndifferent kind of ruin. Even if Ivan came out of such a war on top, die\ncountry would be devastated and its divisions would be stronger dian\never. His weapon of choice in the past had been to make a bold,\noffensive move. Now, however, that kind of move would turn against\nhimthe more boldly he confronted his enemies, die worse die reactions\nhe would spark.\n\nThe main weakness of a show of force is that it stirs up\nresentment and eventually leads to a response that eats at your\naudiority Ivan, immensely creative in the use of power, saw clearly\nthat die only padi to die kind of victory he wanted was a false\nwididrawal. He would not force the country over to his position, he\n\nwould give it \u201coptions\u201d: eidier his abdication, and certain anarchy, or\nhis accession to absolute power. To back up his move, he made it clear\ndiat he preferred to abdicate: \u201cCall my bluff,\u201d he said, \u201cand watch what\nhappens.\u201d No one called his bluff. By withdrawing for just a month, he\nshowed the country a glimpse of die nightmares that would follow his\nabdicationTartar invasions, civil war, ruin. (All of these did eventually\ncome to pass after Ivan's deadi, in the infamous \u201cTime of die\nTroubles.\u201d)\n\nWithdrawal and disappearance are classic ways of controlling the\noptions. You give people a sense of how things will fall apart without\nyou, and you offer diem a \u201cchoice\u201d: I stay away and you suffer die\nconsequences, or I return under circumstances that I dictate. In this\nmediod of controlling people's options, they choose the option that\ngives you power because die alternative is just too unpleasant. You\norce their hand, but indirecdy: They seem to have a choice. Whenever\npeople feel tiiey have a choice, they walk into your trap diat much\nmore easily.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II\n\nAs a seventeenth-century French courtesan, Ninon de Lenclos\nound diat her life had certain pleasures. Her lovers came from royalty\nand aristocracy, and diey paid her well, entertained her witii tiieir wit\nand intellect, satisfied her radier demanding sensual needs, and treated\nher almost as an equal. Such a life was infinitely preferable to\nmarriage. In 1643, however, Ninon's motiier died suddenly, leaving\nher, at the age of twenty-three, totally alone in the worldno family, no\ndowry, notiiing to fall back upon. A kind of panic overtook her and she\nentered a convent, turning her back on her illustrious lovers. A year\nlater she left the convent and moved to Lyons. When she finally\nreappeared in Paris, in 1648, lovers and suitors flocked to her door in\ngreater numbers tiian ever before, for she was die wittiest and\n\nmost spirited courtesan of the time and her presence had been\ngreatly missed.\n\nNinon's followers quickly discovered, however, that she had\nchanged her old way of doing things, and had set up a new system of\noptions. The dukes, seigneurs, and princes who wanted to pay for her\nservices could continue to do so, but they were no longer in controlshe\nwould sleep with them when she wanted, according to her whim. All\n\n\ntheir money bought them was a possibility. If it was her pleasure to\nsleep with them only once a month, so be it.\n\nThose who did not want to be what Ninon called a payeur could\njoin the large and growing group of men she called her martyrs men\nwho visited her apartment principally for her friendship, her biting wit,\nher lute-playing, and the company of the most vibrant minds of the\nperiod, including Moliere, La Rochefoucauld, and Saint-Evremond.\nThe martyrs, too, however, entertained a possibility: She would\nregularly select from them a favori, a man who would become her\nlover without having to pay, and to whom she would abandon herself\ncompletely for as long as she so desireda week, a few months, rarely\nlonger. A payeur could not become a favori, but a martyr had no\nguarantee of becoming one, and indeed could remain disappointed for\nan entire lifetime. The poet Charleval, for example, never enjoyed\nNinon's favors, but never stopped coming to visithe did not want to do\nwithout her company.\n\nAs word of this system reached polite French society, Ninon\nbecame the object of intense hostility. Her reversal of the position of\nthe courtesan scandalized the queen mother and her court. Much to\ntheir horror, however, it did not discourage her male suitorsindeed it\nonly increased their numbers and intensified their desire. It became an\nhonor to be a payeur, helping Ninon to maintain her lifestyle and her\nglittering salon, accompanying her sometimes to die theater, and\nsleeping with her when she chose. Even more distinguished were the\nmartyrs, enjoying her company without paying for it and maintaining\nthe hope, however remote, of some day becoming her favori. That\npossibility spurred on many a young nobleman, as word spread that\nnone among the courtesans could surpass Ninon in the art of love. And\nso the married and the single, the old and the young, entered her web\nand chose one of the two options presented to them, both of which\namply satisfied her.\n\ndered. \"Surely you\n\nremember You owe\n\nme a pot of gold, and I\n\nhave come to\n\ncollect it.\"\n\n\"You are a perfect liar,\n\n\nsir!\" exclaimed the\n\nking. \"I owe you no\n\nmoney!\"\n\n\u201cA perfect liar, am I\u201d\n\nsaid the poor man.\n\n\" Then give me the\n\ngolden apple!\"\n\nThe king, realizing that\n\nthe man was trying to\n\ntrick him, started to\n\nhedge.\n\n\"No, no! You are not a\n\nliar!\"\n\n\"Then give me the pot\n\nof gold you owe me,\n\nsire,\" said the man.\n\nThe king saw the\n\ndilemma. He handed\n\nover the golden apple.\n\narmenian folk-tales and fables, retold by Charles Downing, 1993\nInterpretation\n\nThe life of the courtesan entailed the possibility of a power that\nwas denied a married woman, but it also had obvious perils. The man\nwho paid for the courtesan's services in essence owned her,\ndetermining when he could possess her and when, later on, he would\nabandon her. As she grew older, her options narrowed, as fewer men\nchose her. To avoid a life of poverty she had to amass her fortune\nwhile she was young. The courtesan's legendary greed, then, reflected\na practical necessity, yet also lessened her allure, since the illusion of\nbeing desired is important to men, who are often alien-\n\n./, P. Morgan Sr. once told a jeweler of his acquaintance that he\nwas interested in buying a pearl scarf-pin. Just a few weeks later, the\njeweler happened upon a magnificent pearl. He had it mounted in an\nappropriate setting and sent it to Morgan, together with a bill for\n$5,000. The following day the package was returned. Morgan's\naccompanying note read: \u201c/ like the pin, but I don't like the price. If\nyou will accept the enclosed check for $4,000, please send back the\n\n\nbox with the seal unbroken. \u201d The enraged jeweler refused the check\nand dismissed the messenger in disgust. He opened up the box to\nreclaim the unwanted pin, only to find that it had been removed. In its\nplace was a check for $5,000.\n\nthe little, brown\n\nbook of anhcdoths,\n\nClifton Fadiman, h,d.,\n\nated if their partner is too interested in their money. As the\ncourtesan aged, then, she faced a most difficult fate.\n\nNinon de Lenclos had a horror of any kind of dependence. She\nearly on tasted a kind of equality with her lovers, and she would not\nsettle into a system that left her such distasteful options. Strangely\nenough, the system she devised in its place seemed to satisfy her\nsuitors as much as it did her. The payeurs may have had to pay, but the\nfact that Ninon would only sleep with them when she wanted to gave\nthem a thrill unavailable with every other courtesan: She was yielding\nout of her own desire. The martyrs\u2019 avoidance of the taint of having to\npay gave them a sense of superiority; as members of Ninon's fraternity\nof admirers, they also might some day experience the ultimate pleasure\nof being her favori. Finally, Ninon did not force her suitors into either\ncategory. They could \u201cchoose\u201d which side they preferreda freedom that\nleft them a vestige of masculine pride.\n\nSuch is the power of giving people a choice, or rather the illusion\nof one, for they are playing with cards you have dealt them. Where the\nalternatives set up by Ivan the Terrible involved a certain riskone\noption would have led to his losing his powerNinon created a situation\nin which every option redounded to her favor. From the payeurs she\nreceived the money she needed to run her salon. And from the martyrs\nshe gained the ultimate in power: She could surround herself with a\nbevy of admirers, a harem from which to choose her lovers.\n\nThe system, though, depended on one critical factor: the\npossibility, however remote, that a martyr could become a favori. The\nillusion that riches, glory, or sensual satisfaction may someday fall into\nyour victim's lap is an irresistible carrot to include in your list of\nchoices. That hope, however slim, will make men accept die most\nridiculous situations, because it leaves them the all-important option of\na dream. The illusion of choice, married to the possibility of future\n\ngood fortune, will lure the most stubborn sucker into your glittering\nweb.\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nWords like \u201cfreedom,\u201d \u201coptions,\u201d and \u201cchoice\u201d evoke a power of\npossibility far beyond the reality of the benefits they entail. When\nexamined closely, the choices we havein the marketplace, in elections,\nin our jobstend to have noticeable limitations: They are often a matter\nof a choice simply between A and B, with the rest of the alphabet out\nof the picture. Yet as long as the faintest mirage of choice flickers on,\nwe rarely focus on the missing options. We \u201cchoose\u201d to believe that\nthe game is fair, and that we have our freedom. We prefer not to think\ntoo much about the depth of our liberty to choose.\n\nThis unwillingness to probe the smallness of our choices stems\nfrom the fact that too much freedom creates a kind of anxiety. The\nphrase \u201cunlimited options\u201d sounds infinitely promising, but unlimited\noptions would actually paralyze us and cloud our ability to choose.\nOur limited range of choices comforts us.\n\nThis supplies the clever and cunning with enormous opportunities\nfor deception. For people who are choosing between alternatives find it\nhard to believe they are being manipulated or deceived; they cannot\nsee that you are allowing them a small amount of free will in exchange\nfor a much more powerful imposition of your own will. Setting up a\nnarrow range of choices, then, should always be a part of your\ndeceptions. There is a saying: If you can get the bird to walk into the\ncage on its own, it will sing that much more prettily.\n\nThe following are among the most common forms of \u201ccontrolling\nthe options\u201d:\n\nColor the Choices. This was a favored technique of Henry\nKissinger. As President Richard Nixon's secretary of state, Kissinger\nconsidered himself better informed than his boss, and believed that in\nmost situations he could make the best decision on his own. But if he\ntried to determine policy, he would offend or perhaps enrage a\nnotoriously insecure man. So Kissinger would propose three or four\nchoices of action for each situation, and would present them in such a\nway that the one he preferred always seemed the best solution\ncompared to the others. Time after time, Nixon fell for the bait, never\n\nsuspecting that he was moving where Kissinger pushed him. This is an\nexcellent device to use on the insecure master.\n\nForce the Resister. One of the main problems faced by Dr. Milton\nH. Er-ickson, a pioneer of hypnosis therapy in the 1950s, was the\nrelapse. His patients might seem to be recovering rapidly, but their\napparent susceptibility to the therapy masked a deep resistance: They\nwould soon relapse into old habits, blame the doctor, and stop coming\nto see him. To avoid this, Erick-son began ordering some patients to\nhave a relapse, to make themselves feel as bad as when they first came\ninto go back to square one. Faced with this option, the patients would\nusually \u201cchoose\u201d to avoid the relapse which, of course, was what\nErickson really wanted.\n\nThis is a good technique to use on children and other willful\npeople who enjoy doing the opposite of what you ask them to: Push\nthem to \u201cchoose\u201d what you want them to do by appearing to advocate\nthe opposite.\n\nAlter the Playing Field. In the 1860s, John D. Rockefeller set out\nto create an oil monopoly. If he tried to buy up the smaller oil\ncompanies they would figure out what he was doing and fight back.\nInstead, he began se-credy buying up the railway companies that\ntransported the oil. When he then attempted to take over a particular\ncompany, and met with resistance, he reminded diem of their\ndependence on the rails. Refusing them shipping, or simply raising\ntheir fees, could ruin their business. Rockefeller altered the playing\nfield so that die only options the small oil producers had were die ones\nhe gave diem.\n\nIn this tactic your opponents know their hand is being forced, but\nit doesn't matter. The technique is effective against those who resist at\nall costs.\n\nThe Shrinking Options. The late-nineteenth-century art dealer\nAm-broise VoUard perfected this technique.\n\nCustomers would come to Vollard's shop to see some Cezannes.\nHe would show three paintings, neglect to mention a price, and pretend\nto doze off. The visitors would have to leave without deciding. They\nwould usually come back the next day to see the paintings again, but\nthis time Vollard would pull out less interesting works, pretending he\nthought they were the same ones. The baffled customers would look at\n\nthe new offerings, leave to think them over, and return yet again. Once\nagain the same thing would happen: Vollard would show paintings of\nlesser quality still. Finally the buyers would realize they had better\ngrab what he was showing them, because tomorrow they would have\nto settle for something worse, perhaps at even higher prices.\n\nA variation on this technique is to raise the price every time the\nbuyer hesitates and another day goes by. This is an excellent\nnegotiating ploy to use on the chronically indecisive, who will fall for\nthe idea that they are getting a better deal today than if they wait till\ntomorrow.\n\nThe Weak Man on the Precipice. The weak are the easiest to\nmaneuver by controlling their options. Cardinal de Retz, die great\nseventeenth-century provocateur, served as an unofficial assistant to\nthe Duke of Orleans, who was notoriously indecisive. It was a constant\nstruggle to convince the duke to take actionhe would hem and haw,\nweigh the options, and wait till the last moment, giving everyone\naround him an ulcer. But Retz discovered a way to handle him: He\nwould describe all sorts of dangers, exaggerating them as much as\npossible, until the duke saw a yawning abyss in every direction except\none: the one Retz was pushing him to take.\n\nThis tactic is similar to \u201cColor the Choices,\u201d but widi the weak\nyou have to be more aggressive. Work on their emotionsuse fear and\nterror to propel them into action. Try reason and they will always find\na way to procrastinate.\n\nBrothers in Crime. This is a classic con-artist technique: You\nattract your victims to some criminal scheme, creating a bond of blood\nand guilt between you. They participate in your deception, commit a\ncrime (or think they dosee the story of Sam Geezil in Law 3), and are\neasily manipulated. Serge Stavisky, the great French con artist of the\n1920s, so entangled the government in his scams and swindles that die\nstate did not dare to prosecute him, and \u201cchose\u201d to leave him alone. It\nis often wise to implicate in your deceptions the very person who can\ndo you the most harm if you fail. Their involvement can be subtieeven\na hint of their involvement will narrow their options and buy their\nsilence.\n\nThe Horns of a Dilemma. This idea was demonstrated by General\nWilliam Sherman's infamous march through Georgia during the\n\n\nAmerican Civil War. Although the Confederates knew what direction\nSherman was\n\nheading in, they never knew if he would attack from the left or\nthe right, for he divided his army into two wingsand if the rebels\nretreated from one wing they found themselves facing the other. This\nis a classic trial lawyer's technique: The lawyer leads the witnesses to\ndecide between two possible explanations of an event, both of which\npoke a hole in their story. They have to answer the lawyer's questions,\nbut whatever they say they hurt themselves. The key to this move is to\nstrike quickly: Deny the victim the time to think of an escape. As they\nwriggle between the horns of the dilemma, they dig their own grave.\n\nUnderstand: In your struggles with your rivals, it will often be\nnecessary for you to hurt mem. And if you are clearly the agent of their\npunishment, expect a counterattackexpect revenge. If, however, they\nseem to themselves to be the agents of their own misfortune, they will\nsubmit quietly. When Ivan left Moscow for his rural village, the\ncitizens asking him to return agreed to his demand for absolute power.\nOver the years to come, they resented him less for the terror he\nunleashed on the country, because, after all, they had granted him his\npower themselves. This is why it is always good to allow your victims\ntheir choice of poison, and to cloak your involvement in providing it to\nthem as far as possible.\n\nImage: The Horns ofthe Bull. The bullbacks you into the corner\nwith its hornsnota single horn, which youmight be able to escape, but a\npair of hornsthat trap you within theirhold. Run right or runlefteither\nway youmove into their piercingends and are gored.\n\nAuthority: For the wounds and every other evil that men inflict\nupon themselves spontaneously, and of their own choice, are in the\nlong run less painful than those inflicted by others. (Niccolo\nMachiavelli, 1469-1527)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nControlling the options has one main purpose: to disguise\nyourself as the agent of power and punishment. The tactic works best,\nthen, for tiiose whose power is fragile, and who cannot operate too\nopenly without incurring suspicion, resentment, and anger. Even as a\ngeneral rule, however, it is rarely wise to be seen as exerting power\ndirectly and forcefully, no matter how secure or strong you are. It is\n\nusually more elegant and more effective to give people the illusion of\nchoice.\n\nOn the other hand, by limiting other people's options you\nsometimes limit your own. There are situations in which it is to your\nadvantage to allow your rivals a large degree of freedom: As you\nwatch them operate, you give yourself rich opportunities to spy, gather\ninformation, and plan your deceptions. The nineteentii-century banker\nJames Rothschild liked this method: He felt that if he tried to control\nhis opponents' movements, he lost the chance to observe their strategy\nand plan a more effective course. The more freedom he allowed them\nin the short term, the more forcefully he could act against them in the\nlong run.\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

These\ncompliments, alas, served but to increase the widower's affliction.

In the Middle\nAges and High Renaissance, its virtual monopoly on trade to the east\nmade it die wealthiest city in Europe. Under a beneficent republican\n\ngovernment, Venetians enjoyed liberties that few other Italians had\never known. Yet in the sixteenth century dieir fortunes suddenly\nchanged. The opening of the New World transferred power to die\nAtiantic side of Europeto die Spanish and Portuguese, and later the\nDutch and English. Venice could not compete economically and its\nempire gradually dwindled. The final blow was the devastating loss of\na prized Mediterranean possession, the island of Cyprus, captured from\nVenice by die Turks in 1570.\n\nNow noble families went broke in Venice, and banks began to\nfold. A kind of gloom and depression setded over die citizens. They\nhad known a glittering pasthad eidier lived through it or heard stories\nabout it from their elders. The closeness of the glory years was\nhumiliating. The Venetians half believed diat die goddess Fortune was\nonly playing a joke on them, and that die old days would soon return.\nFor the time being, tiiough, what could they do\n\nIn 1589 rumors began to swirl around Venice of the arrival not far\naway of a mysterious man called \u201cII Bragadino,\u201d a master of alchemy,\na man who had won incredible wealtii through his ability, it was said,\nto multiply gold through die use of a secret substance. The rumor\nspread quickly because a few years earlier, a Venetian nobleman\npassing through Poland had heard a learned man prophesy that Venice\nwould recover her past glory and power if she could find a man who\nunderstood die alchemic art of manufacturing gold. And so, as word\nreached Venice of die gold this Bragadino possessedhe clinked gold\ncoins continuously in his hands, and golden objects filled his\npalacesome began to dream: Through him, their city would prosper\nagain.\n\nMembers of Venice's most important noble families accordingly\nwent togetiier to Brescia, where Bragadino lived. They toured his\npalace and watched in awe as he demonstrated his gold-making\nabilities, taking a pinch of seemingly worthless minerals and\ntransforming it into several ounces of gold dust. The Venetian senate\nprepared to debate the idea of extending an official invitation to\nBragadino to stay in Venice at the city's expense, when word suddenly\nreached them that they were competing with the Duke of Mantua for\nhis services. They heard of a magnificent party in Bragadino's palace\nor the duke, featuring garments with golden buttons, gold watches,\n\n\ngold plates, and on and on. Worried they might lose Bragadino to\nMantua, die senate voted almost unanimously to invite him to Venice,\npromising him the mountain of money he would need to continue\nliving in his luxurious stylebut only if he came right away.\n\nLate that year die mysterious Bragadino arrived in Venice. With\nhis piercing dark eyes under thick brows, and the two enormous black\nmastiffs diat accompanied him everywhere, he was forbidding and\nimpressive. He took up residence in a sumptuous palace on the island\nof the Giudecca,\n\nwith the republic funding his banquets, his expensive clothes, and\nall his other whims. A kind of alchemy fever spread through Venice.\nOn street corners, hawkers would sell coal, distilling apparatus,\nbellows, how-to books on the subject. Everyone began to practice\nalchemyeveryone except Bragadino.\n\nThe alchemist seemed to be in no hurry to begin manufacturing\nthe gold that would save Venice from ruin. Strangely enough this only\nincreased his popularity and following; people thronged from all over\nEurope, even Asia, to meet this remarkable man. Months went by, with\ngifts pouring in to Bragadino from all sides. Still he gave no sign of the\nmiracle that the Venetians confidently expected him to produce.\nEventually the citizens began to grow impatient, wondering if he\nwould wait forever. At first the senators warned them not to hurry\nhimhe was a capricious devil, who needed to be cajoled. Finally,\nthough, the nobility began to wonder too, and the senate came under\npressure to show a return on the city's ballooning investment.\n\nBragadino had only scorn for die doubters, but he responded to\nthem. He had, he said, already deposited in the city's mint the\nmysterious substance with which he multiplied gold. He could use this\nsubstance up all at once, and produce double the gold, but the more\nslowly the process took place, the more it would yield. If left alone for\nseven years, sealed in a casket, the substance would multiply the gold\nin the mint thirty times over. Most of the senators agreed to wait to\nreap the gold mine Bragadino promised. Others, however, were angry:\nseven more years of this man living royally at the public trough! And\nmany of the common citizens of Venice echoed these sentiments.\nFinally the alchemist's enemies demanded he produce a proof of his\nskills: a substantial amount of gold, and soon.\n\nLofty, apparently devoted to his art, Bragadino responded that\nVenice, in its impatience, had betrayed him, and would therefore lose\nhis services. He left town, going first to nearby Padua, then, in 1590, to\nMunich, at the invitation of the Duke of Bavaria, who, like the entire\ncity of Venice, had known great wealth but had fallen into bankruptcy\nthrough his own profligacy, and hoped to regain his fortune through\nthe famous alchemist's services. And so Bragadino resumed the\ncomfortable arrangement he had known in Venice, and the same\npattern repeated itself.\n\nInterpretation\nThe young Cypriot Mamugna had lived in Venice for several\nyears before reincarnating himself as the alchemist Bragadino. He saw\nhow gloom had settled on the city, how everyone was hoping for a\nredemption from some indefinite source. While other charlatans\nmastered everyday cons based on sleight of hand, Mamugna mastered\nhuman nature. With Venice as his target from the start, he traveled\nabroad, made some money through his alchemy scams, and then\nreturned to Italy, setting up shop in Brescia. There he created a\nreputation that he knew would spread to Venice. From a distance, in\nact, his aura of power would be all the more impressive. At first\nMamugna did not use vulgar demonstrations to convince peo-\nformerly strangled his wife and son. A courtier thought fit to\ninform the bereaved monarch, and even affirmed that he had seen the\nstag laugh.

Once you find that, you have the magical key that will put great\npower in your hands.\nAldiough times and people change, let us examine a few of die\noppressive realities tiiat endure, and the opportunities for power they\nprovide:\nThe Reality: Change is slow and gradual. It requires hard work, a\nbit of luck, a fair amount of self-sacrifice, and a lot ofpatience.\nThe Fantasy: A sudden transformation will bring a total change in\none's fortunes, bypassing work, luck, self-sacrifice, and time in one\nantastic stroke.\n\nThis is of course die fantasy par excellence of the charlatans who\nprowl among us to this day, and was die key to Bragadino's success.\n\n\nPromise a great and total changefrom poor to rich, sickness to healdi,\nmisery to ecstasyand you will have followers.\n\nHow did the great sixteenth-century German quack Leonhard\nThumeisser become the court physician for the Elector of Brandenburg\nwitiiout ever studying medicine Instead of offering amputations,\nleeches, and foul-tasting purgatives (the medicaments of the time),\nThumeisser offered sweet-tasting elixirs and promised instant\nrecovery. Fashionable courtiers especially wanted his solution of\n\u201cdrinkable gold,\u201d which cost a fortune. If some inexplicable illness\nassailed you, Thumeisser would consult a horoscope and prescribe a\ntalisman. Who could resist such a fantasyhealth and well-being\nwithout sacrifice and pain!\n\nThe Reality: The social realm has hard-set codes and boundaries.\nWe understand these limits and know that we have to move within the\nsame familiar circles, day in and day out.\n\nThe Fantasy: We can enter a totally new world with different\ncodes and the promise of adventure.\n\nIn the early 1700s, all London was abuzz with talk of a\nmysterious stranger, a young man named George Psalmanazar. He had\narrived from what was to most Englishmen a fantastical land: the\nisland of Formosa (now Taiwan), off the coast of China. Oxford\nUniversity engaged Psalmanazar to teach die island's language; a few\nyears later he translated the Bible into Formosan, then wrote a bookan\nimmediate best-selleron Formosa's history and geography. English\nroyalty wined and dined die young man, and everywhere he went he\nentertained his hosts widi wondrous stories of his homeland, and its\nbizarre customs.\n\nAfter Psalmanazar died, however, his will revealed diat he was in\nfact merely a Frenchman widi a rich imagination. Everything he had\nsaid about Formosaits alphabet, its language, its literature, its entire\nculturehe had invented. He had built on die English public's ignorance\nof die place to concoct an elaborate story that fulfilled their desire for\nthe exotic and\n\nstrange. British culture's rigid control of people's dangerous\ndreams gave him the perfect opportunity to exploit their fantasy.\n\nThe fantasy of die exotic, of course, can also skirt die sexual. It\nmust not come too close, diough, for the physical hinders die power of\n\nfantasy; it can be seen, grasped, and then tired ofthe fate of most\ncourtesans. The bodily charms of die mistress only whet the master's\nappetite for more and different pleasures, a new beauty to adore. To\nbring power, fantasy must remain to some degree unrealized, literally\nunreal. The dancer Mata Hari, for instance, who rose to public\nprominence in Paris before World War I, had quite ordinary looks. Her\npower came from the fantasy she created of being strange'and exotic,\nunknowable and indecipherable. The taboo she worked with was less\nsex itself than the breaking of social codes.\n\nAnodier form of die fantasy of the exotic is simply die hope for\nrelief from boredom. Con artists love to play on die oppressiveness of\nthe working world, its lack of adventure. Their cons might involve,\nsay, die recovery of lost Spanish treasure, with the possible\nparticipation of an alluring Mexican senorita and a connection to the\npresident of a South American countryanydiing offering release from\nthe humdrum.\n\nThe Reality: Society is fragmented and full of conflict.\n\nThe Fantasy: People can come together in a mystical union of\nsouls.\n\nIn the 1920s the con man Oscar Hartzell made a quick fortune out\nof the age-old Sir Francis Drake swindlebasically promising any\nsucker who happened to be surnamed \u201cDrake\u201d a substantial share of\nthe long-lost \u201cDrake treasure,\u201d to which Hartzell had access.\nThousands across the Midwest fell for the scam, which Hartzell\ncleverly turned into a crusade against the government and everyone\nelse who was trying to keep the Drake fortune out of the rightful hands\nof its heirs. There developed a mystical union of the oppressed Drakes,\nwith emotional rallies and meetings. Promise such a union and you can\ngain much power, but it is a dangerous power diat can easily turn\nagainst you. This is a fantasy for demagogues to play on.\n\nThe Reality: Death. The dead cannot be brought back, the past\ncannot be changed. The Fantasy: A sudden reversal of this intolerable\nfact.\n\nThis con has many variations, but requires great skill and subdety.\n\nThe beauty and importance of die art of Vermeer have long been\nrecognized, but his paintings are small in number, and are extremely\nrare. In die 1930s, though, Vermeers began to appear on the art market.\n\nExperts were called on to verify diem, and pronounced diem real.\nPossession of these new Vermeers would crown a collector's career. It\nwas like die resurrection of Lazarus: In a strange way, Vermeer had\nbeen brought back to life. The past had been changed.\n\nOnly later did it come out that die new Vermeers were the work of\na middle-aged Dutch forger named Han van Meegeren. And he had\nchosen\n\nVermeer for his scam because he understood fantasy: The\npaintings would seem real precisely because the public, and the experts\nas well, so desperately wanted to believe they were.\n\nRemember: The key to fantasy is distance. The distant has allure\nand promise, seems simple and problem free. What you are offering,\nthen, should be ungraspable. Never let it become oppressively familiar;\nit is the mirage in the distance, withdrawing as die sucker approaches.\nNever be too direct in describing the fantasykeep it vague. As a forger\nof fantasies, let your victim come close enough to see and be tempted,\nbut keep him far away enough that he stays dreaming and desiring.\n\nImage: The Moon. Unattainable, always changing shape,\ndisappearing and reappearing. We look at it, imagine, wonder, and\npinenever familiar, continuous provoker of dreams. Do not offer the\nobvious. Promise the moon.\n\nAuthority: A lie is an allurement, a fabrication, that can be\nembellished into a fantasy. It can be clothed in the raiments of a mystic\nconception. Truth is cold, sober fact, not so comfortable to absorb. A\nlie is more palatable. The most detested person in the world is the one\nwho always tells the truth, who never romances. . . . I found it far more\ninteresting and profitable to romance than to tell the truth. (Joseph\nWeil, a.k.a. \u201cThe Yellow Kid,\u201d 1875-1976)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nIf there is power in tapping into the fantasies of the masses, there\nis also danger. Fantasy usually contains an element of playdie public\nhalf realizes it is being duped, but it keeps die dream alive anyway,\nrelishing the entertainment and the temporary diversion from the\neveryday mat you are providing. So keep it lightnever come too close\nto the place where you are actually expected to produce results. That\nplace may prove extremely hazardous.\n\nAfter Bragadino established himself in Munich, he found that the\nsober-minded Bavarians had far less faith in alchemy than the\ntemperamental Venetians. Only the duke really believed in it, for he\nneeded it desperately to rescue him from die hopeless mess he was in.\nAs Bragadino played his familiar waiting game, accepting gifts and\nexpecting patience, the public grew angry. Money was being spent and\nwas yielding no results. In 1592 the Bavarians demanded justice, and\neventually Bragadino found himself swinging from the gallows. As\nbefore, he had promised and had not delivered, but this time he had\nmisjudged the forbearance of his hosts, and his inability to fulfill tiieir\nfantasy proved fatal.\n\nOne last tiling: Never make the mistake of imagining that fantasy\nis always fantastical. It certainly contrasts with reality, but reality itsel:\nis sometimes so theatrical and stylized that fantasy becomes a desire\nfor simple things. The image Abraham Lincoln created of himself, for\nexample, as a homespun country lawyer with a beard, made him the\ncommon man's president.\n\nP. T. Barnum created a successful act with Tom Thumb, a dwar!\nwho dressed up as famous leaders of the past, such as Napoleon, and\nlampooned them wickedly. The show delighted everyone, right up to\nQueen Victoria, by appealing to the fantasy of the time: Enough of the\nvainglorious rulers of history, the common man knows best. Tom\nThumb reversed the familiar pattern of fantasy in which the strange\nand unknown becomes the ideal. But the act still obeyed the Law, for\nunderlying it was the fantasy that the simple man is without problems,\nand is happier than the powerful and the rich.\n\nBoth Lincoln and Tom Thumb played the commoner but carefully\nmaintained their distance. Should you play with such a fantasy, you too\nmust carefully cultivate distance and not allow your \u201ccommon\u201d\npersona to become too familiar or it will not project as fantasy.\n\n'.

OF TIIK I.IONKSS\n\nThe lion having suddenly lost his queen, every one hastened to\nshow allegiance to the monarch, by offering consolation. These\ncompliments, alas, served but to increase the widower's affliction. Due\nnotice was given throughout the kingdom that the funeral would be\nperformed at a certain time and place; the lion's officers were ordered\nto be in attendance, to regulate the ceremony, and place the company\naccording to their respective rank. One may well judge no one\nabsented himself. The monarch gave way to his grief, and the whole\ncave, lions having no other temples, resounded with his cries. After his\nexample, all the courtiers roared in their different tones. A court is the\nsort of place where everyone is either sorrowful, gay, or indifferent to\neverything, just as the reigning prince may think fit; or if any one is\nnot actually, he at least tries to appear so; each endeavors to mimic the\nmaster. It is truly said that one mind animates a thousand bodies,\nclearly showing that human beings are mere machines. But let us\nreturn to our subject. The stag alone shed no tears.

In the Middle\nAges and High Renaissance, its virtual monopoly on trade to the east\nmade it die wealthiest city in Europe. Under a beneficent republican\n\ngovernment, Venetians enjoyed liberties that few other Italians had\never known. Yet in the sixteenth century dieir fortunes suddenly\nchanged. The opening of the New World transferred power to die\nAtiantic side of Europeto die Spanish and Portuguese, and later the\nDutch and English. Venice could not compete economically and its\nempire gradually dwindled. The final blow was the devastating loss of\na prized Mediterranean possession, the island of Cyprus, captured from\nVenice by die Turks in 1570.\n\nNow noble families went broke in Venice, and banks began to\nfold. A kind of gloom and depression setded over die citizens. They\nhad known a glittering pasthad eidier lived through it or heard stories\nabout it from their elders. The closeness of the glory years was\nhumiliating. The Venetians half believed diat die goddess Fortune was\nonly playing a joke on them, and that die old days would soon return.\nFor the time being, tiiough, what could they do\n\nIn 1589 rumors began to swirl around Venice of the arrival not far\naway of a mysterious man called \u201cII Bragadino,\u201d a master of alchemy,\na man who had won incredible wealtii through his ability, it was said,\nto multiply gold through die use of a secret substance. The rumor\nspread quickly because a few years earlier, a Venetian nobleman\npassing through Poland had heard a learned man prophesy that Venice\nwould recover her past glory and power if she could find a man who\nunderstood die alchemic art of manufacturing gold. And so, as word\nreached Venice of die gold this Bragadino possessedhe clinked gold\ncoins continuously in his hands, and golden objects filled his\npalacesome began to dream: Through him, their city would prosper\nagain.\n\nMembers of Venice's most important noble families accordingly\nwent togetiier to Brescia, where Bragadino lived. They toured his\npalace and watched in awe as he demonstrated his gold-making\nabilities, taking a pinch of seemingly worthless minerals and\ntransforming it into several ounces of gold dust. The Venetian senate\nprepared to debate the idea of extending an official invitation to\nBragadino to stay in Venice at the city's expense, when word suddenly\nreached them that they were competing with the Duke of Mantua for\nhis services. They heard of a magnificent party in Bragadino's palace\nor the duke, featuring garments with golden buttons, gold watches,\n\n\ngold plates, and on and on. Worried they might lose Bragadino to\nMantua, die senate voted almost unanimously to invite him to Venice,\npromising him the mountain of money he would need to continue\nliving in his luxurious stylebut only if he came right away.\n\nLate that year die mysterious Bragadino arrived in Venice. With\nhis piercing dark eyes under thick brows, and the two enormous black\nmastiffs diat accompanied him everywhere, he was forbidding and\nimpressive. He took up residence in a sumptuous palace on the island\nof the Giudecca,\n\nwith the republic funding his banquets, his expensive clothes, and\nall his other whims. A kind of alchemy fever spread through Venice.\nOn street corners, hawkers would sell coal, distilling apparatus,\nbellows, how-to books on the subject. Everyone began to practice\nalchemyeveryone except Bragadino.\n\nThe alchemist seemed to be in no hurry to begin manufacturing\nthe gold that would save Venice from ruin. Strangely enough this only\nincreased his popularity and following; people thronged from all over\nEurope, even Asia, to meet this remarkable man. Months went by, with\ngifts pouring in to Bragadino from all sides. Still he gave no sign of the\nmiracle that the Venetians confidently expected him to produce.\nEventually the citizens began to grow impatient, wondering if he\nwould wait forever. At first the senators warned them not to hurry\nhimhe was a capricious devil, who needed to be cajoled. Finally,\nthough, the nobility began to wonder too, and the senate came under\npressure to show a return on the city's ballooning investment.\n\nBragadino had only scorn for die doubters, but he responded to\nthem. He had, he said, already deposited in the city's mint the\nmysterious substance with which he multiplied gold. He could use this\nsubstance up all at once, and produce double the gold, but the more\nslowly the process took place, the more it would yield. If left alone for\nseven years, sealed in a casket, the substance would multiply the gold\nin the mint thirty times over. Most of the senators agreed to wait to\nreap the gold mine Bragadino promised. Others, however, were angry:\nseven more years of this man living royally at the public trough! And\nmany of the common citizens of Venice echoed these sentiments.\nFinally the alchemist's enemies demanded he produce a proof of his\nskills: a substantial amount of gold, and soon.\n\nLofty, apparently devoted to his art, Bragadino responded that\nVenice, in its impatience, had betrayed him, and would therefore lose\nhis services. He left town, going first to nearby Padua, then, in 1590, to\nMunich, at the invitation of the Duke of Bavaria, who, like the entire\ncity of Venice, had known great wealth but had fallen into bankruptcy\nthrough his own profligacy, and hoped to regain his fortune through\nthe famous alchemist's services. And so Bragadino resumed the\ncomfortable arrangement he had known in Venice, and the same\npattern repeated itself.\n\nInterpretation\nThe young Cypriot Mamugna had lived in Venice for several\nyears before reincarnating himself as the alchemist Bragadino. He saw\nhow gloom had settled on the city, how everyone was hoping for a\nredemption from some indefinite source. While other charlatans\nmastered everyday cons based on sleight of hand, Mamugna mastered\nhuman nature. With Venice as his target from the start, he traveled\nabroad, made some money through his alchemy scams, and then\nreturned to Italy, setting up shop in Brescia. There he created a\nreputation that he knew would spread to Venice. From a distance, in\nact, his aura of power would be all the more impressive. At first\nMamugna did not use vulgar demonstrations to convince peo-\nformerly strangled his wife and son. A courtier thought fit to\ninform the bereaved monarch, and even affirmed that he had seen the\nstag laugh. The rage of a king, says Solomon, is terrible, and especially\nthat of a lion-king. \u201cPitiful forester!\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cdarest thou laugh\nwhen all around are dissolved in tears We will not soil our royal claws\nwith thy profane blood!

The dead cannot be brought back, the past\ncannot be changed. The Fantasy: A sudden reversal of this intolerable\nfact.\n\nThis con has many variations, but requires great skill and subdety.\n\nThe beauty and importance of die art of Vermeer have long been\nrecognized, but his paintings are small in number, and are extremely\nrare. In die 1930s, though, Vermeers began to appear on the art market.\n\nExperts were called on to verify diem, and pronounced diem real.\nPossession of these new Vermeers would crown a collector's career. It\nwas like die resurrection of Lazarus: In a strange way, Vermeer had\nbeen brought back to life. The past had been changed.\n\nOnly later did it come out that die new Vermeers were the work of\na middle-aged Dutch forger named Han van Meegeren. And he had\nchosen\n\nVermeer for his scam because he understood fantasy: The\npaintings would seem real precisely because the public, and the experts\nas well, so desperately wanted to believe they were.\n\nRemember: The key to fantasy is distance. The distant has allure\nand promise, seems simple and problem free. What you are offering,\nthen, should be ungraspable. Never let it become oppressively familiar;\nit is the mirage in the distance, withdrawing as die sucker approaches.\nNever be too direct in describing the fantasykeep it vague. As a forger\nof fantasies, let your victim come close enough to see and be tempted,\nbut keep him far away enough that he stays dreaming and desiring.\n\nImage: The Moon. Unattainable, always changing shape,\ndisappearing and reappearing. We look at it, imagine, wonder, and\npinenever familiar, continuous provoker of dreams. Do not offer the\nobvious. Promise the moon.\n\nAuthority: A lie is an allurement, a fabrication, that can be\nembellished into a fantasy. It can be clothed in the raiments of a mystic\nconception. Truth is cold, sober fact, not so comfortable to absorb. A\nlie is more palatable. The most detested person in the world is the one\nwho always tells the truth, who never romances. . . . I found it far more\ninteresting and profitable to romance than to tell the truth. (Joseph\nWeil, a.k.a. \u201cThe Yellow Kid,\u201d 1875-1976)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nIf there is power in tapping into the fantasies of the masses, there\nis also danger. Fantasy usually contains an element of playdie public\nhalf realizes it is being duped, but it keeps die dream alive anyway,\nrelishing the entertainment and the temporary diversion from the\neveryday mat you are providing. So keep it lightnever come too close\nto the place where you are actually expected to produce results. That\nplace may prove extremely hazardous.\n\nAfter Bragadino established himself in Munich, he found that the\nsober-minded Bavarians had far less faith in alchemy than the\ntemperamental Venetians. Only the duke really believed in it, for he\nneeded it desperately to rescue him from die hopeless mess he was in.\nAs Bragadino played his familiar waiting game, accepting gifts and\nexpecting patience, the public grew angry. Money was being spent and\nwas yielding no results. In 1592 the Bavarians demanded justice, and\neventually Bragadino found himself swinging from the gallows. As\nbefore, he had promised and had not delivered, but this time he had\nmisjudged the forbearance of his hosts, and his inability to fulfill tiieir\nfantasy proved fatal.\n\nOne last tiling: Never make the mistake of imagining that fantasy\nis always fantastical. It certainly contrasts with reality, but reality itsel:\nis sometimes so theatrical and stylized that fantasy becomes a desire\nfor simple things. The image Abraham Lincoln created of himself, for\nexample, as a homespun country lawyer with a beard, made him the\ncommon man's president.\n\nP. T. Barnum created a successful act with Tom Thumb, a dwar!\nwho dressed up as famous leaders of the past, such as Napoleon, and\nlampooned them wickedly. The show delighted everyone, right up to\nQueen Victoria, by appealing to the fantasy of the time: Enough of the\nvainglorious rulers of history, the common man knows best. Tom\nThumb reversed the familiar pattern of fantasy in which the strange\nand unknown becomes the ideal. But the act still obeyed the Law, for\nunderlying it was the fantasy that the simple man is without problems,\nand is happier than the powerful and the rich.\n\nBoth Lincoln and Tom Thumb played the commoner but carefully\nmaintained their distance. Should you play with such a fantasy, you too\nmust carefully cultivate distance and not allow your \u201ccommon\u201d\npersona to become too familiar or it will not project as fantasy.\n\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Below is an excerpt from my book titled '48 Laws of Power', specifically from Chapter '48 Laws of Power', Section 'LAW 33'. The original text is: 'DISCOVER EACH MAN'S THUMBSCREW\n\nJUDGMENT\n\nEveryone has a weakness, a gap in the castle wall. That weakness\nis usually an insecurity, an uncontrollable emotion or need; it can also\nbe a small secret pleasure. Either way, once found, it is a thumbscrew\nyou can turn to your advantage.\n\nTill\u2019, LION. IIK CHAMOIS. AND IT IK FOX\n\nA lion was chasing a chamois along a valley. He had all but\ncaught it, and with longing eyes was anticipating a certain and a\nsatisfying repast. It seemed as if it were utterly impossible for the\nvictim to escape; for a deep ravine appeared to bar the way for both the\nhunter and the hunted. But the nimble chamois, gathering together all\nits strength, shot like an arrow from a bow across the chasm, and stood\nstill on the rocky cliff on the other side. Our lion pulled up short. But\nat that moment a friend of his happened to be near at hand. That friend\nwas the fox. \u201cWhat!\u201d said he, \u201cwith your strength and agility, is it\npossible that you will yield to a feeble chamois You have only to will,\nand you will be able to work wonders. Though the abyss be deep, yet,\nif you are only in earnest, I am certain you will clear it. Surely you can\nconfide in my disinterested friendship. I would not expose your life to\ndanger if I were not so well aware of your strength and dexterity. \u201d The\nlion's blood waxed hot, and began to boil in his veins. He flung\nhimself with all his might into space. But he could not clear the chasm;\nso down he tumbled headlong, and was killed by the fall.\n\nFINDING THE THUMBSCREW: A Strategic Plan of Action We\nall have resistances. We live with a perpetual armor around ourselves\nto defend against change and the intrusive actions of friends and rivals.\nWe would like nothing more than to be left to do tilings our own way.\nConstantly butting up against these resistances will cost you a lot of\nenergy. One of die most important things to realize about people,\nthough, is that diey all have a weakness, some part of their\n\npsychological armor that will not resist, that will bend to your will if\nyou find it and push on it. Some people wear their weaknesses openly,\notiiers disguise diem. Those who disguise them are often die ones most\neffectively undone through that one chink in their armor.\n\nIn planning your assault, keep these principles in mind:\n\nPay Attention to Gestures and Unconscious Signals. As Sigmund\nFreud remarked, \u201cNo mortal can keep a secret. If his lips are silent, he\nchatters with his fingertips; betrayal oozes out of him at every pore.\u201d\nThis is a critical concept in the search for a person's weaknessit is\nrevealed by seemingly unimportant gestures and passing words.\n\nThe key is not only what you look for but where and how you\nlook. Everyday conversation supplies the richest mine of weaknesses,\nso train yourself to listen. Start by always seeming interestedthe\nappearance of a sympathetic ear will spur anyone to talk. A clever\ntrick, often used by the nineteenth-century French statesman\nTalleyrand, is to appear to open up to the other person, to share a secret\nwith diem. It can be completely made up, or it can be real but of no\ngreat importance to youthe important thing is that it should seem to\ncome from the heart. This will usually elicit a response that is not only\nas frank as yours but more genuinea response that reveals a weakness.\n\nIf you suspect that someone has a particular soft spot, probe for it\nindirectly. If, for instance, you sense diat a man has a need to be loved,\nopenly flatter him. If he laps up your compliments, no matter how\nobvious, you are on die right track. Train your eye for detailshow\nsomeone tips a waiter, what delights a person, die hidden messages in\nclothes. Find people's idols, die things they worship and will do\nanything to getperhaps you can be die supplier of tiieir fantasies.\nRemember: Since we all try to hide our weaknesses, there is little to be\nlearned from our conscious behavior. What oozes out in the littie\nthings outside our conscious control is what you want to know.\n\nFind the Helpless Child. Most weaknesses begin in childhood,\nbefore die self builds up compensatory defenses. Perhaps the child was\npampered or indulged in a particular area, or perhaps a certain\nemotional need went unfulfilled; as he or she grows older, the\nindulgence or the deficiency may be buried but never disappears.\nKnowing about a childhood need gives you a powerful key to a\nperson's weakness.\n\n\nOne sign of this weakness is that when you touch on it the person\nwill often act like a child. Be on the lookout, then, for any behavior\ntiiat should\n\nhave been outgrown. If your victims or rivals went without\nsomething important, such as parental support, when they were\nchildren, supply it, or its facsimile. If they reveal a secret taste, a\nhidden indulgence, indulge it. In either case they will be unable to\nresist you.\n\nLook for Contrasts. An overt trait often conceals its opposite.\nPeople who thump their chests are often big cowards; a prudish\nexterior may hide a lascivious soul; the uptight are often screaming for\nadventure; the shy are dying for attention. By probing beyond\nappearances, you will often find people's weaknesses in the opposite of\nthe qualities they reveal to you.\n\nFind the Weak Link. Sometimes in your search for weaknesses it\nis not what but who that matters. In today's versions of the court, there\nis often someone behind the scenes who has a great deal of power, a\ntremendous influence over the person superficially on top. These\nbehind-the-scenes powerbrokers are die group's weak link: Win their\nfavor and you indirectly influence the king. Alternatively, even in a\ngroup of people acting with the appearance of one willas when a group\nunder attack closes ranks to resist an outsiderthere is always a weak\nlink in the chain. Find die one person who will bend under pressure.\n\nFill the Void. The two main emotional voids to fill are insecurity\nand un-happiness. The insecure are suckers for any kind of social\nvalidation; as for the chronically unhappy, look for die roots of their\nunhappiness. The insecure and the unhappy are the people least able to\ndisguise dieir weaknesses. The ability to fill dieir emotional voids is a\ngreat source of power, and an indefinitely prolongable one.\n\nFeed on Uncontrollable Emotions. The uncontrollable emotion\ncan be a paranoid feara fear disproportionate to the situationor any\nbase motive such as lust, greed, vanity, or hatred. People in the grip of\nthese emotions often cannot control diemselves, and you can do the\ncontrolling for them.\n\nOBSERVANCES OF THE LAW\n\nObservance I\n\nIn 1615 the thirty-year-old bishop of Lucon, later known as\nCardinal Richelieu, gave a speech before representatives of die three\nestates of France clergy, nobility, and commoners. Richelieu had been\nchosen to serve as the moudipiece for the clergyan immense\nresponsibility for a man still young and not particularly well known.\nOn all of the important issues of the day, the speech followed the\nChurch line. But near the end of it Richelieu did something that had\nnodiing to do with the Church and everything to do with his career. He\nturned to die throne of the fifteen-year-old King Louis XIII, and to die\nQueen Modier Marie de' Medicis, who sat beside\n\nThen what did his dear friend do He cautiously made his way\ndown to the bottom of the ravine, and there, out in the open space and\nthe free air, seeing that the lion wanted neither flattery nor obedience\nnow, he set to work to pay the last sad rites to his dead friend, and in a\nmonth picked his bones clean.\n\nFABLES,\n\nIvan Kriloff, 1768-1844\n\nIRVING 1.AZAK\n\n[Hollywood super-agent] Irving Paul Lazar was once anxious to\nsell [studio mogul] Jack L. Warmer a play. \u201cI had a long meeting with\nhim today,\u201d Lazar explained [to screenwriter Garson Kanin], \u201cbut I\ndidn 't mention it, I didn't even bring it up.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not \u201d I asked. \u201cBecause I'm going to wait until the weekend\nafter next, when I go to Palm Springs.\u201d \u201cI don't understand.\u201d \u201cYou\ndon't I go to Palm Springs every weekend, but Warner isn 't going this\nweekend. He's got a preview or something. So he's not coming down\ntill the next weekend, so that's when I'm going to bring it up.\u201d \"Irving,\nI'm more and\n\nLAW 33 273\n\nmore confused.\u201c \u201dLook,1' said Irving impatiently, \u201cI know what\nI'm doing. I know how to sell Warner. This is a type of material that\nhe's uneasy with, so I have to hit him with it hard and suddenly to get\nan okay.\u201d \u201cBut why Palm Springs\u201d \u201cBecause in Palm Springs, every\nday he goes to the baths at The Spa. And that's where I'm going to be\nwhen he's there. Now there's a thing about Jack: He's eighty and he's\nvery vain, and he doesn't like people to see him naked. So when I walk\nup to him naked at The Spa / mean he's nakedwell, I'm naked too, but I\n\ndon't care who sees me. He does. And I walk up to him naked, and I\nstart to talk to him about this thing, he \u2018II be very embarrassed. And\nhe'll want to get away from me, and the easiest way is to say ' Yes,'\nbecause he knows if he says 'No,' then I'm going to stick with him, and\nstay right on it, and not give up. So to get rid of me, he'll probably say,\n\"Yes.\u201d\u201d Two weeks later, I read of the acquisition of this particular\nproperty by Warner Brothers. I phoned Lazarand asked how it had\nbeen accomplished. \u201cHow do you think\u201d he asked. \u201cIn the buff, that's\nhow ... just the way I told you it was going to work.\u201d\n\nhollywood,\n\nGarson Kanin,\n\nLouis, as the regent ruling France until her son reached his\nmajority. Everyone expected Richelieu to say the usual kind words to\nthe young king. Instead, however, he looked directly at and only at the\nqueen mother. Indeed his speech ended in long and fulsome praise of\nher, praise so glowing that it actually offended some in the Church.\nBut the smile on the queen's face as she lapped up Richelieu's\ncompliments was unforgettable.\n\nA year later the queen mother appointed Richelieu secretary of\nstate for foreign affairs, an incredible coup for the young bishop. He\nhad now entered the inner circle of power, and he studied the workings\nof the court as if it were the machinery of a watch. An Italian, Concino\nConcini, was the queen mother's favorite, or rather her lover, a role\nthat made him perhaps the most powerful man in France. Concini was\nvain and foppish, and Richelieu played him perfectlyattending to him\nas if he were the king. Within months Richelieu had become one of\nConcini's favorites. But something happened in 1617 that turned\neverything upside down: the young king, who up until then had shown\nevery sign of being an idiot, had Concini murdered and his most\nimportant associates imprisoned. In so doing Louis took command of\nthe country with one blow, sweeping the queen mother aside.\n\nHad Richelieu played it wrong He had been close to both Concini\nand Marie de Medicis, whose advisers and ministers were now all out\nof favor, some even arrested. The queen mother herself was shut up in\nthe Louvre, a virtual prisoner. Richelieu wasted no time. If everyone\nwas deserting Marie de Medicis, he would stand by her. He knew\nLouis could not get rid of her, for the king was still very young, and\n\n\nhad in any case always been inordinately attached to her. As Marie's\nonly remaining powerful friend, Richelieu filled the valuable function\nof liaison between the king and his mother. In return he received her\nprotection, and was able to survive the palace coup, even to thrive.\nOver the next few years the queen mother grew still more dependent\non him, and in 1622 she repaid him for his loyalty: Through the\nintercession of her allies in Rome, Richelieu was elevated to the\npowerful rank of cardinal.\nBy 1623 King Louis was in trouble. He had no one he could trust\nto advise him, and although he was now a young man instead of a boy,\nhe remained childish in spirit, and affairs of state came hard to him.\nNow that he had taken the throne, Marie was no longer the regent and\ntheoretically had no power, but she still had her son's ear, and she kept\ntelling him that Richelieu was his only possible savior. At first Louis\nwould have none of ithe hated the cardinal with a passion, only\ntolerating him out of love for Marie. In the end, however, isolated in\nthe court and crippled by his own indecisiveness, he yielded to his\nmother and made Richelieu first his chief councilor and later prime\nminister.\n\nNow Richelieu no longer needed Marie de Medicis. He stopped\nvisiting and courting her, stopped listening to her opinions, even\nargued with her and opposed her wishes. Instead he concentrated on\nthe king, making himself indispensable to his new master. All the\nprevious premiers, understanding the king's childishness, had tried to\nkeep him out of trouble; the\n\nshrewd Richelieu played him differendy, deliberately pushing him\ninto one ambitious project after another, such as a crusade against the\nHuguenots and finally an extended war with Spain. The immensity of\nthese projects only made the king more dependent on his powerful\npremier, the only man able to keep order in the realm. And so, for the\nnext eighteen years, Richelieu, exploiting the king's weaknesses,\ngoverned and molded France according to his own vision, unifying the\ncountry and making it a strong European power for centuries to come.\nInterpretation\n\nRichelieu saw everything as a military campaign, and no strategic\nmove was more important to him than discovering his enemy's\nweaknesses and applying pressure to them. As early as his speech in\n\n\n1615, he was looking for the weak link in die chain of power, and he\nsaw that it was die queen mother. Not that Marie was obviously\nweakshe governed both France and her son; but Richelieu saw that she\nwas really an insecure woman who needed constant masculine\nattention. He showered her with affection and respect, even toadying\nup to her favorite, Concini. He knew the day would come when the\nking would take over, but he also recognized that Louis loved his\nmother dearly and would always remain a child in relation to her. The\nway to control Louis, then, was not by gaining his favor, which could\nchange overnight, but by gaining sway over his motiier, for whom his\naffection would never change.\n\nOnce Richelieu had the position he desiredprime ministerhe\ndiscarded die queen mother, moving on to die next weak link in the\nchain: the king's own character. There was a part of him diat would\nalways be a helpless child in need of higher authority. It was on the\nfoundation of the king's weakness that Richelieu established his own\npower and fame.\n\nRemember: When entering the court, find the weak link. The\nperson in control is often not the king or queen; it is someone behind\nthe scenes the favorite, the husband or wife, even flie court fool. This\nperson may have more weaknesses than the king himself, because his\npower depends on all kinds of capricious factors outside his control.\n\nFinally, when dealing with helpless children who cannot make\ndecisions, play on their weakness and push them into bold ventures.\nThey will have to depend on you even more, for you will become the\nadult figure whom they rely on to get them out of scrapes and to safety.\n\nObservance II\n\nIn December of 1925, guests at the swankiest hotel in Palm\nBeach, Florida, watched with interest as a mysterious man arrived ina\nRolls-Royce driven by a Japanese chauffeur. Over the next few days\nthey studied this handsome man, who walked widi an elegant cane,\nreceived telegrams at all hours, and only engaged in the briefest of\nconversations. He was a count, they heard, Count Victor Lustig, and he\ncame from one of the wealthiest families in Europebut this was all they\ncould find out.\n\nImagine their amazement, dien, when Lustig one day walked up\nto one of the least distinguished guests in the hotel, a Mr. Herman\n\nLoller,\n\nAs time went on I came to look for the little weaknesses... It's the\nlittle things that count. On one occasion, I worked on the president of a\nlarge bank in Omaha. The [phony] deal involved the purchase of the\nstreet railway system of Omaha, including a bridge across the\nMississippi River My principals were supposedly German and I had to\nnegotiate with Berlin. While awaiting word from them I introduced my\nfake mining-stock proposition. Since this man was rich, I decided to\nplay for high stakes.... Meanwhile, I played golf with the banker,\nvisited his home, and went to the theater with him and his wife.\nThough he showed some interest in my stock deal, he still wasn 't\nconvinced. I had built it up to the point that an investment of\n$1,250,000 was required. Of this I was to put up $900,000, the banker\n$350,000. But still he hesitated. One evening when 1 was at his home\nor dinner I wore some perfumeCoty's \u201cApril Violets.\u201d It was not then\nconsidered effeminate for a man to use a dash of perfume. The\nbanker's wife thought it very lovely. \u201cWhere did you get it \u201d \u201cIt is a\nrare blend,\u201d I told her, \"especially made for me by a\n\nFrench perfumer. Do you like it* \u201dI love it,\u201c she replied. The\nollowing day I went through my effects and found two empty bottles.\nBoth had come from France, but were empty. I went to a downtown\ndepartment store and purchased ten ounces of Coty's \u2019April Violets.\u201c I\npoured this into the two French bottles, carefully sealed them, wrapped\nthem in tissue paper. That evening 1 dropped by the banker's home and\npresented the two bottles to his wife. \u201d\u2019They were especially put up for\nme in Cologne, \u201c / told her. The next day the banker called at my hotel.\nHis wife was enraptured by the perfume. She considered it the most\nwonderful, the most exotic fragrance she had ever used. I did not tell\nthe banker he could get all he wanted right in Omaha. \u201dShe said,\u201c the\nbanker added, \u201dthat I was fortunate to be associated with a man like\nyou.\" From then on his attitude was changed, for he had complete faith\nin his wife's judgment. ... He parted with $350,000. This, incidentally\nwas my biggest [con] score.\n\n\u201cYELLOW KID\u201d WEIL,\n\n1875-1976\n\nhead of an engineering company, and entered into conversation\nwith him. Loller had made his fortune only recendy, and forging social\n\n\nconnections was very important to him. He felt honored and somewhat\nmtimidated by this sophisticated man, who spoke perfect English with\na hint of a foreign accent. Over die days to come, the two became\nfriends.\n\nLoller of course did most of the talking, and one night he\nconfessed that his business was doing poorly, with more troubles\nahead. In return, Lustig confided in his new friend that he too had\nserious money problemsCommunists had seized his family estate and\nall its assets. He was too old to learn a trade and go to work. Luckily\nhe had found an answer\u201ca money-making machine.\u201d \u201cYou counterfeit\u201d\nLoller whispered in half-shock. No, Lustig replied, explaining that\nthrough a secret chemical process, his machine could duplicate any\npaper currency with complete accuracy. Put in a dollar bill and six\nhours later you had two, both perfect. He proceeded to explain how the\nmachine had been smuggled out of Europe, how die Germans had\ndeveloped it to undermine the British, how it had supported the count\nor several years, and on and on. When Loller insisted on a\ndemonstration, the two men went to Lustig's room, where the count\nproduced a magnificent mahogany box fitted witii slots, cranks, and\ndials. Loller watched as Lustig inserted a dollar bill in die box. Sure\nenough, early die following morning Lustig pulled out two bills, still\nwet from die chemicals.\n\nLustig gave the notes to Loller, who immediately took the bills to\na local bankwhich accepted them as genuine. Now the businessman\nfeverishly begged Lustig to sell him a machine. The count explained\ndiat there was only one in existence, so Loller made him a high offer:\n$25,000, then a considerable amount (more than $400,000 in today's\nterms). Even so, Lustig seemed reluctant: He did not feel right about\nmaking his friend pay so much. Yet finally he agreed to the sale. After\nall, he said, \u201cI suppose it matters little what you pay me. You are, after\nall, going to recover the amount within a few days by duplicating your\nown bills.\u201d Making Loller swear never to reveal the machine's\nexistence to odier people, Lustig accepted the money. Later the same\nday he checked out of the hotel. A year later, after many futile attempts\nat duplicating bills, Loller finally went to the police with the story of\nhow Count Lustig had conned him with a pair of dollar bills, some\nchemicals, and a worthless mahogany box. Interpretation\n\n\nCount Lustig had an eagle eye for other people's weaknesses. He\nsaw them in die smallest gesture. Loller, for instance, overtipped\nwaiters, seemed nervous in conversation with the concierge, talked\nloudly about his business. His weakness, Lustig knew, was his need for\nsocial validation and for die respect that he thought his wealth had\nearned him. He was also chronically insecure. Lustig had come to the\nhotel to hunt for prey. In Loller he homed in on the perfect suckera\nman hungering for someone to fill his psychic voids.\n\nIn offering Loller his friendship, then, Lustig knew he was\noffering him the immediate respect of the other guests. As a count,\nLustig was also offer-\n\ning the newly rich businessman access to the glittering world of\nold wealth. And for the coup de grace, he apparendy owned a machine\nmat would rescue Loller from his worries. It would even put him on a\npar with Lustig himself, who had also used the machine to maintain his\nstatus. No wonder Loller took the bait.\n\nRemember: When searching for suckers, always look for the\ndissatisfied, me unhappy, the insecure. Such people are riddled with\nweaknesses and have needs mat you can fill. Their neediness is the\ngroove in which you place your thumbnail and turn diem at will.\n\nObservance III\n\nIn the year 1559, the French king Henri II died in a jousting\nexhibition. His son assumed the throne, becoming Francis II, but in the\nbackground stood Henri's wife and queen, Catherine de\u2019 Medicis, a\nwoman who had long ago proven her skill in affairs of state. When\nFrancis died the next year, Catherine took control of the country as\nregent to her next son in line of succession, the future Charles IX, a\nmere ten years old at the time.\n\nThe main threats to the queen's power were Antoine de Bourbon,\nking of Navarre, and his brother, Louis, die powerful prince of Conde,\nbom of whom could claim the right to serve as regent instead of\nCatherine, who, after all, was Italiana foreigner. Catherine quickly\nappointed Antoine lieutenant general of the kingdom, a title that\nseemed to satisfy his ambition. It also meant that he had to remain in\ncourt, where Catherine could keep an eye on him. Her next move\nproved smarter still: Antoine had a notorious weakness for young\nwomen, so she assigned one of her most attractive maids of honor,\n\n\nLouise de Rouet, to seduce him. Now Antoine's intimate, Louise\nreported all of his actions to Catherine. The move worked so brilliantly\nthat Catiierine assigned another of her maids to Prince Conde, and thus\nwas formed her escadron volant \u201cflying squadron\u201d\u2019of young girls\nwhom she used to keep the unsuspecting males in the court under her\ncontrol.\n\nIn 1572 Catherine married off her daughter, Marguerite de Valois,\nto Henri, the son of Antoine and the new king of Navarre. To put a\nfamily that had always struggled against her so close to power was a\ndangerous move, so to make sure of Henri's loyalty she unleashed on\nhim the loveliest member of her \u201cflying squadron,\u201d Charlotte de\nBeaune Semblancay, baroness of Sauves. Catherine did this even\ndiough Henri was married to her daughter. Within weeks, Marguerite\nde Valois wrote in her memoirs, \u201cMme. de Sauves so completely\nensnared my husband that we no longer slept together, nor even\nconversed.\u201d\n\nThe baroness was an excellent spy and helped to keep Henri\nunder Catherine's thumb. When the queen's youngest son, the Duke of\nAlencon, grew so close to Henri that she feared the two might plot\nagainst her, she assigned the baroness to him as well. This most\ninfamous member of the flying squadron quickly seduced Alencon,\nand soon the two young men fought over her and tiieir friendship\nquickly ended, along with any danger of a conspiracy.\n\nAnd while I am on the subject, there is another fact that deserves\nmention. It is this. A man shows his character just in the way in which\nhe deals with triflesfor then he is off his guard. This will often afford a\ngood opportunity of observing the boundless egoism of a man's nature,\nand his total lack of consideration for others; and if these defects show\nthemselves in small things, or merely in his general demeanour, you\nwill find that they also underlie his action in matters of importance,\nalthough he may disguise the fact. This is an opportunity which should\nnot be missed. If in the little affairs of every daythe trifles of life ...a\nman is inconsiderate and seeks only what is advantageous or\nconvenient to himself, to the prejudice of others' rights; if he\nappropriates to himself that which belongs to all alike, you may be\nsure there is no justice in his heart, and that he would be a scoundrel\non a wholesale scale, only that law and compulsion bind his hands.\n\nArthur\n\nSchopenhauer,\n\n1788-1860\n\nWhen the two armies [Julius Caesar's and Pompey's] were come\ninto Pharsalia, and both encamped there, Pompey's thoughts ran the\nsame way as they had done before, against fighting.... But those who\nwere about him were greatly confident of success ... as if they had\nalready conquered.... The cavalry especially were obstinate for\nfighting, being splendidly armed and bravely mounted, and valuing\nthemselves upon the fine horses they kept, and upon their own\nhandsome persons; as also upon the advantage of their numbers, for\nthey were five thousand against one thousand of Caesar's. Nor were\nthe numbers of the infantry less disproportionate, there being forty-five\nthousand of Pompey's against twenty-two thousand of the enemy. [The\nnext day! whilst the infantry was thus sharply engaged in the main\nbattle, on the flank Pompey 's horse rode up confidently, and opened\n[his cavalry's] ranks very wide, that they might surround the right wing\nof Caesar. But before they engaged, Caesar's cohorts rushed out and\nattacked them, and did not dart their javelins at a distance, nor strike at\nthe thighs and legs, as they usually did in close battle, but aimed at\ntheir faces. For thus\n\nInterpretation\n\nCatherine had seen very early on the sway mat a mistress has over\na man of power: Her own husband, Henri II, had kept one of the most\ninfamous mistresses of them all, Diane de Poitiers. What Catherine\nlearned from the experience was that a man like her husband wanted to\nfeel he could win a woman over widiout having to rely on his status,\nwhich he had inherited rather dian earned. And such a need contained\na huge blind spot: As long as die woman began die affair by acting as\nif she had been conquered, die man would fail to notice that as time\npassed the mistress had come to hold power over him, as Diane de\nPoitiers did over Henri. It was Cadierine's strategy to tum this\nweakness to her advantage, using it as a way to conquer and control\nmen. All she had to do was unleash the loveliest women in the court,\nher \u201cflying squadron,\u201d on men whom she knew shared her husband's\nvulnerability.\n\nRemember: Always look for passions and obsessions that cannot\nbe controlled. The stronger the passion, the more vulnerable die\nperson. This may seem surprising, for passionate people look strong.\nIn fact, however, they are simply filling die stage with dieir\ntheatricality, distracting people from how weak and helpless they\nreally are. A man's need to conquer women actually reveals a\ntremendous helplessness that has made suckers out of them for\nthousands of years. Look at the part of a person that is most\nvisibletheir greed, dieir lust, tiieir intense fear. These are the emotions\nthey cannot conceal, and over which diey have the least control. And\nwhat people cannot control, you can control for diem.\n\nObservance IV\n\nArabella Huntington, wife of die great late-nineteentii-century\nrailroad magnate Collis P. Huntington, came from humble origins and\nalways struggled for social recognition among her wealdiy peers.\nWhen she gave a party in her San Francisco mansion, few of die social\nelite would show up; most of diem took her for a gold digger, not their\nkind. Because of her husband's fabulous wealdi, art dealers courted\nher, but widi such condescension they obviously saw her as an upstart.\nOnly one man of consequence treated her differentiy: the dealer Joseph\nDuveen.\n\nFor die first few years of Duveen's relationship witii Arabella, he\nmade no effort to sell expensive art to her. Instead he accompanied her\nto fine stores, chatted endlessly about queens and princesses he knew,\non and on. At last, she diought, a man who treated her as an equal,\neven a superior, in high society. Meanwhile, if Duveen did not try to\nsell art to her, he did sub-tiy educate her in his aesdietic ideasnamely,\nthat die best art was the most expensive art. And after Arabella had\nsoaked up his way of seeing things, Duveen would act as if she always\nhad exquisite taste, even tiiough before she met him her aesdietics had\nbeen abysmal.\n\nWhen Collis Huntington died, in 1900, Arabella came into a\nfortune. She suddenly started to buy expensive paintings, by\nRembrandt and Velazquez, for exampleand only from Duveen. Years\nlater Duveen sold her Gainsborough's Blue Boy for the highest price\never paid for a work of\n\nart at the time, an astounding purchase for a family that\npreviously had shown litde interest in collecting. Interpretation\n\nJoseph Duveen instantly understood Arabella Huntington and\nwhat made her tick: She wanted to feel important, at home in society.\nIntensely insecure about her lower-class background, she needed\nconfirmation of her new social status. Duveen waited. Instead of\nrushing into trying to persuade her to collect art, he subtly went to\nwork on her weaknesses. He made her feel that she deserved his\nattention not because she was the wife of one of the wealthiest men in\nthe world but because of her own special characterand this completely\nmelted her. Duveen never condescended to Arabella; rather than\nlecturing to her, he instilled his ideas in her indirectly. The result was\none of his best and most devoted clients, and also the sale of The Blue\nBoy.\n\nPeople's need for validation and recognition, tiieir need to feel\nimportant, is the best kind of weakness to exploit. First, it is almost\nuniversal; second, exploiting it is so very easy. All you have to do is\nfind ways to make people feel better about their taste, their social\nstanding, meir intelligence. Once the fish are hooked, you can reel\nthem in again and again, for yearsyou are filling a positive role, giving\nthem what they cannot get on their own. They may never suspect that\nyou are turning them like a thumbscrew, and if they do they may not\ncare, because you are making them feel better about themselves, and\nthat is worth any price.\n\nObservance V\n\nIn 1862 King William of Prussia named Otto von Bismarck\npremier and minister for foreign affairs. Bismarck was known for his\nboldness, his ambitionand his interest in strengthening die military.\nSince William was surrounded by liberals in his government and\ncabinet, politicians who already wanted to limit his powers, it was\nquite dangerous for him to put Bismarck in this sensitive position. His\nwife, Queen Augusta, had tried to dissuade him, but aKhough she\nusually got her way with him, this time William stuck to his guns.\n\nOnly a week after becoming prime minister, Bismarck made an\nimpromptu speech to a few dozen ministers to convince them of the\nneed to enlarge the army. He ended by saying, \u201cThe great questions of\nthe time will be decided, not by speeches and resolutions of majorities,\n\nbut by iron and blood.\u201d His speech was immediately disseminated\nthroughout Germany. The queen screamed at her husband that\nBismarck was a barbaric militarist who was out to usurp control of\nPrussia, and that William had to fire him. The liberals in the\ngovernment agreed with her. The outcry was so vehement that William\nbegan to be afraid he would end up on a scaffold, like Louis XVI of\nFrance, if he kept Bismarck on as prime minister.\nBismarck knew he had to get to the king before it was too late. He\nalso knew he had blundered, and should have tempered his fiery\nwords. Yet as he contemplated his strategy, he decided not to apologize\nbut to do the exact opposite. Bismarck knew the king well.\nCaesar had instructed them, in hopes that young gentlemen, who\nhad not known much of battles and wounds, hut came wearing their\nhair long, in the flower of their age and height of their beauty, would\nbe more apprehensive of such blows, and not care for hazarding both a\ndanger at present and a blemish for the future.\nAnd so it proved, for they were so far from bearing the stroke of\nthe javelins, that they could not stand the sight of them, but turned\nabout, and covered their faces to secure them. Once in disorder,\npresently they turned about to fly; and so most shamefully ruined all.\nFor those who had beat them back at once outflanked the infantry, and\nalling on their rear, cut them to pieces. Pompey, who commanded the\nother wing of the army, when he saw his cavalry thus broken and\nflying, was no longer himself nor did he now remember that he was\nPompey the Great, but, like one whom some god had deprived of his\nsenses, retired to his tent without speaking a word, and there sat to\nexpect the event, till the whole army was routed.\n\nTHE LIFE OF JULIUS CAESAR.\n\nPlutarch, c. a.d. 46-120\n\nWhen the two men met, William, predictably, had been worked\ninto a tizzy by the queen. He reiterated his fear of being guillotined.\nBut Bismarck only replied, \u201cYes, then we shall be dead! We must die\nsooner or later, and could there be a more respectable way of dying I\nshould die fighting for the cause of my king and master. Your Majesty\nwould die sealing with your own blood your royal rights granted by\nGod's grace. Whether upon the scaffold or upon the battlefield makes\nno difference to the glorious staking of body and life on behalf of\n\n\nrights granted by God's grace!\u201d On he went, appealing to William's\nsense of honor and the majesty of his position as head of the army.\nHow could the king allow people to push him around Wasn't the honor\nof Germany more important than quibbling over words Not only did\nthe prime minister convince die king to stand up to both his wife and\nhis parliament, he persuaded him to build up the armyBismarck's goal\nall along. Interpretation\n\nBismarck knew the king felt bullied by those around him. He\nknew that William had a military background and a deep sense of\nhonor, and that he felt ashamed at his cravenness before his wife and\nhis government. William secredy yearned to be a great and mighty\nking, but he dared not express this ambition because he was afraid of\nending up like Louis XVI. Where a show of courage often conceals a\nman's timidity, William's timidity concealed his need to show courage\nand thump his chest.\n\nBismarck sensed the longing for glory beneatii William's pacifist\nfront, so he played to the king's insecurity about his manhood, finally\npushing him into diree wars and the creation of a German empire.\nTimidity is a potent weakness to exploit. Timid souls often yearn to be\ntheir oppositeto be Napoleons. Yet they lack the inner strength. You, in\nessence, can become their Napoleon, pushing them into bold actions\nthat serve your needs while also making them dependent on you.\nRemember: Look to the opposites and never take appearances at face\nvalue.\n\nImage: The Thumbscrew. Your enemy has secrets that he guards,\nthinks thoughts he will not reveal. But they come out in ways he\ncannot help. It is there somewhere, a groove of weakness on his head,\nat his heart, over his belly. Once you find the groove, put your thumb\nin it and turn him at will.\n\nAuthority: Find out each man's thumbscrew. Tis the art of setting\ntheir wills in action. It needs more skill than resolution. You must\nknow where to get at anyone. Every volition has a special motive\nwhich varies according to taste. All men are idolaters, some of fame,\nodiers of self-interest, most of pleasure. Skill consists in knowing these\nidols in order to bring them into play. Knowing any man's mainspring\nof motive you have as it were the key to his will. (Baltasar Gracian,\n1601-1658)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nPlaying on people's weakness has one significant danger: You\nmay stir up\n\nan action you cannot control.\n\nIn your games of power you always look several steps ahead and\nplan accordingly. And you exploit the fact that other people are more\nemotional and incapable of such foresight. But when you play on their\nvulnerabilities, the areas over which they have least control, you can\nunleash emotions that will upset your plans. Push timid people into\nbold action and they may go too far; answer their need for attention or\nrecognition and they may need more than you want to give them. The\nhelpless, childish element you are playing on can turn against you.\n\nThe more emotional the weakness, die greater the potential\ndanger. Know the limits to this game, then, and never get carried away\nby your control over your victims. You are after power, not die dirill of\ncontrol.\n'.

That weakness\nis usually an insecurity, an uncontrollable emotion or need; it can also\nbe a small secret pleasure. Either way, once found, it is a thumbscrew\nyou can turn to your advantage.\n\nTill\u2019, LION. IIK CHAMOIS. AND IT IK FOX\n\nA lion was chasing a chamois along a valley. He had all but\ncaught it, and with longing eyes was anticipating a certain and a\nsatisfying repast. It seemed as if it were utterly impossible for the\nvictim to escape; for a deep ravine appeared to bar the way for both the\nhunter and the hunted. But the nimble chamois, gathering together all\nits strength, shot like an arrow from a bow across the chasm, and stood\nstill on the rocky cliff on the other side. Our lion pulled up short. But\nat that moment a friend of his happened to be near at hand. That friend\nwas the fox. \u201cWhat!\u201d said he, \u201cwith your strength and agility, is it\npossible that you will yield to a feeble chamois You have only to will,\nand you will be able to work wonders. Though the abyss be deep, yet,\nif you are only in earnest, I am certain you will clear it. Surely you can\nconfide in my disinterested friendship. I would not expose your life to\ndanger if I were not so well aware of your strength and dexterity. \u201d The\nlion's blood waxed hot, and began to boil in his veins. He flung\nhimself with all his might into space. But he could not clear the chasm;\nso down he tumbled headlong, and was killed by the fall.\n\nFINDING THE THUMBSCREW: A Strategic Plan of Action We\nall have resistances. We live with a perpetual armor around ourselves\nto defend against change and the intrusive actions of friends and rivals.\nWe would like nothing more than to be left to do tilings our own way.\nConstantly butting up against these resistances will cost you a lot of\nenergy. One of die most important things to realize about people,\nthough, is that diey all have a weakness, some part of their\n\npsychological armor that will not resist, that will bend to your will if\nyou find it and push on it. Some people wear their weaknesses openly,\notiiers disguise diem. Those who disguise them are often die ones most\neffectively undone through that one chink in their armor.\n\nIn planning your assault, keep these principles in mind:\n\nPay Attention to Gestures and Unconscious Signals. As Sigmund\nFreud remarked, \u201cNo mortal can keep a secret. If his lips are silent, he\nchatters with his fingertips; betrayal oozes out of him at every pore.\u201d\nThis is a critical concept in the search for a person's weaknessit is\nrevealed by seemingly unimportant gestures and passing words.\n\nThe key is not only what you look for but where and how you\nlook. Everyday conversation supplies the richest mine of weaknesses,\nso train yourself to listen. Start by always seeming interestedthe\nappearance of a sympathetic ear will spur anyone to talk. A clever\ntrick, often used by the nineteenth-century French statesman\nTalleyrand, is to appear to open up to the other person, to share a secret\nwith diem. It can be completely made up, or it can be real but of no\ngreat importance to youthe important thing is that it should seem to\ncome from the heart. This will usually elicit a response that is not only\nas frank as yours but more genuinea response that reveals a weakness.\n\nIf you suspect that someone has a particular soft spot, probe for it\nindirectly. If, for instance, you sense diat a man has a need to be loved,\nopenly flatter him. If he laps up your compliments, no matter how\nobvious, you are on die right track. Train your eye for detailshow\nsomeone tips a waiter, what delights a person, die hidden messages in\nclothes. Find people's idols, die things they worship and will do\nanything to getperhaps you can be die supplier of tiieir fantasies.\nRemember: Since we all try to hide our weaknesses, there is little to be\nlearned from our conscious behavior. What oozes out in the littie\nthings outside our conscious control is what you want to know.\n\nFind the Helpless Child. Most weaknesses begin in childhood,\nbefore die self builds up compensatory defenses. Perhaps the child was\npampered or indulged in a particular area, or perhaps a certain\nemotional need went unfulfilled; as he or she grows older, the\nindulgence or the deficiency may be buried but never disappears.\nKnowing about a childhood need gives you a powerful key to a\nperson's weakness.\n\n\nOne sign of this weakness is that when you touch on it the person\nwill often act like a child. Be on the lookout, then, for any behavior\ntiiat should\n\nhave been outgrown. If your victims or rivals went without\nsomething important, such as parental support, when they were\nchildren, supply it, or its facsimile. If they reveal a secret taste, a\nhidden indulgence, indulge it. In either case they will be unable to\nresist you.\n\nLook for Contrasts. An overt trait often conceals its opposite.\nPeople who thump their chests are often big cowards; a prudish\nexterior may hide a lascivious soul; the uptight are often screaming for\nadventure; the shy are dying for attention. By probing beyond\nappearances, you will often find people's weaknesses in the opposite of\nthe qualities they reveal to you.\n\nFind the Weak Link. Sometimes in your search for weaknesses it\nis not what but who that matters. In today's versions of the court, there\nis often someone behind the scenes who has a great deal of power, a\ntremendous influence over the person superficially on top. These\nbehind-the-scenes powerbrokers are die group's weak link: Win their\nfavor and you indirectly influence the king. Alternatively, even in a\ngroup of people acting with the appearance of one willas when a group\nunder attack closes ranks to resist an outsiderthere is always a weak\nlink in the chain. Find die one person who will bend under pressure.\n\nFill the Void. The two main emotional voids to fill are insecurity\nand un-happiness. The insecure are suckers for any kind of social\nvalidation; as for the chronically unhappy, look for die roots of their\nunhappiness. The insecure and the unhappy are the people least able to\ndisguise dieir weaknesses. The ability to fill dieir emotional voids is a\ngreat source of power, and an indefinitely prolongable one.\n\nFeed on Uncontrollable Emotions. The uncontrollable emotion\ncan be a paranoid feara fear disproportionate to the situationor any\nbase motive such as lust, greed, vanity, or hatred. People in the grip of\nthese emotions often cannot control diemselves, and you can do the\ncontrolling for them.\n\nOBSERVANCES OF THE LAW\n\nObservance I\n\nIn 1615 the thirty-year-old bishop of Lucon, later known as\nCardinal Richelieu, gave a speech before representatives of die three\nestates of France clergy, nobility, and commoners. Richelieu had been\nchosen to serve as the moudipiece for the clergyan immense\nresponsibility for a man still young and not particularly well known.\nOn all of the important issues of the day, the speech followed the\nChurch line. But near the end of it Richelieu did something that had\nnodiing to do with the Church and everything to do with his career. He\nturned to die throne of the fifteen-year-old King Louis XIII, and to die\nQueen Modier Marie de' Medicis, who sat beside\n\nThen what did his dear friend do He cautiously made his way\ndown to the bottom of the ravine, and there, out in the open space and\nthe free air, seeing that the lion wanted neither flattery nor obedience\nnow, he set to work to pay the last sad rites to his dead friend, and in a\nmonth picked his bones clean.\n\nFABLES,\n\nIvan Kriloff, 1768-1844\n\nIRVING 1.AZAK\n\n[Hollywood super-agent] Irving Paul Lazar was once anxious to\nsell [studio mogul] Jack L. Warmer a play. \u201cI had a long meeting with\nhim today,\u201d Lazar explained [to screenwriter Garson Kanin], \u201cbut I\ndidn 't mention it, I didn't even bring it up.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not \u201d I asked. \u201cBecause I'm going to wait until the weekend\nafter next, when I go to Palm Springs.\u201d \u201cI don't understand.\u201d \u201cYou\ndon't I go to Palm Springs every weekend, but Warner isn 't going this\nweekend. He's got a preview or something. So he's not coming down\ntill the next weekend, so that's when I'm going to bring it up.\u201d \"Irving,\nI'm more and\n\nLAW 33 273\n\nmore confused.\u201c \u201dLook,1' said Irving impatiently, \u201cI know what\nI'm doing. I know how to sell Warner. This is a type of material that\nhe's uneasy with, so I have to hit him with it hard and suddenly to get\nan okay.\u201d \u201cBut why Palm Springs\u201d \u201cBecause in Palm Springs, every\nday he goes to the baths at The Spa. And that's where I'm going to be\nwhen he's there. Now there's a thing about Jack: He's eighty and he's\nvery vain, and he doesn't like people to see him naked. So when I walk\nup to him naked at The Spa / mean he's nakedwell, I'm naked too, but I\n\ndon't care who sees me. He does. And I walk up to him naked, and I\nstart to talk to him about this thing, he \u2018II be very embarrassed. And\nhe'll want to get away from me, and the easiest way is to say ' Yes,'\nbecause he knows if he says 'No,' then I'm going to stick with him, and\nstay right on it, and not give up. So to get rid of me, he'll probably say,\n\"Yes.\u201d\u201d Two weeks later, I read of the acquisition of this particular\nproperty by Warner Brothers. I phoned Lazarand asked how it had\nbeen accomplished. \u201cHow do you think\u201d he asked. \u201cIn the buff, that's\nhow ... just the way I told you it was going to work.\u201d\n\nhollywood,\n\nGarson Kanin,\n\nLouis, as the regent ruling France until her son reached his\nmajority. Everyone expected Richelieu to say the usual kind words to\nthe young king. Instead, however, he looked directly at and only at the\nqueen mother. Indeed his speech ended in long and fulsome praise of\nher, praise so glowing that it actually offended some in the Church.\nBut the smile on the queen's face as she lapped up Richelieu's\ncompliments was unforgettable.\n\nA year later the queen mother appointed Richelieu secretary of\nstate for foreign affairs, an incredible coup for the young bishop. He\nhad now entered the inner circle of power, and he studied the workings\nof the court as if it were the machinery of a watch. An Italian, Concino\nConcini, was the queen mother's favorite, or rather her lover, a role\nthat made him perhaps the most powerful man in France. Concini was\nvain and foppish, and Richelieu played him perfectlyattending to him\nas if he were the king. Within months Richelieu had become one of\nConcini's favorites. But something happened in 1617 that turned\neverything upside down: the young king, who up until then had shown\nevery sign of being an idiot, had Concini murdered and his most\nimportant associates imprisoned. In so doing Louis took command of\nthe country with one blow, sweeping the queen mother aside.\n\nHad Richelieu played it wrong He had been close to both Concini\nand Marie de Medicis, whose advisers and ministers were now all out\nof favor, some even arrested. The queen mother herself was shut up in\nthe Louvre, a virtual prisoner. Richelieu wasted no time. If everyone\nwas deserting Marie de Medicis, he would stand by her. He knew\nLouis could not get rid of her, for the king was still very young, and\n\n\nhad in any case always been inordinately attached to her. As Marie's\nonly remaining powerful friend, Richelieu filled the valuable function\nof liaison between the king and his mother. In return he received her\nprotection, and was able to survive the palace coup, even to thrive.\nOver the next few years the queen mother grew still more dependent\non him, and in 1622 she repaid him for his loyalty: Through the\nintercession of her allies in Rome, Richelieu was elevated to the\npowerful rank of cardinal.\nBy 1623 King Louis was in trouble. He had no one he could trust\nto advise him, and although he was now a young man instead of a boy,\nhe remained childish in spirit, and affairs of state came hard to him.\nNow that he had taken the throne, Marie was no longer the regent and\ntheoretically had no power, but she still had her son's ear, and she kept\ntelling him that Richelieu was his only possible savior. At first Louis\nwould have none of ithe hated the cardinal with a passion, only\ntolerating him out of love for Marie. In the end, however, isolated in\nthe court and crippled by his own indecisiveness, he yielded to his\nmother and made Richelieu first his chief councilor and later prime\nminister.\n\nNow Richelieu no longer needed Marie de Medicis. He stopped\nvisiting and courting her, stopped listening to her opinions, even\nargued with her and opposed her wishes. Instead he concentrated on\nthe king, making himself indispensable to his new master. All the\nprevious premiers, understanding the king's childishness, had tried to\nkeep him out of trouble; the\n\nshrewd Richelieu played him differendy, deliberately pushing him\ninto one ambitious project after another, such as a crusade against the\nHuguenots and finally an extended war with Spain. The immensity of\nthese projects only made the king more dependent on his powerful\npremier, the only man able to keep order in the realm. And so, for the\nnext eighteen years, Richelieu, exploiting the king's weaknesses,\ngoverned and molded France according to his own vision, unifying the\ncountry and making it a strong European power for centuries to come.\nInterpretation\n\nRichelieu saw everything as a military campaign, and no strategic\nmove was more important to him than discovering his enemy's\nweaknesses and applying pressure to them. As early as his speech in\n\n\n1615, he was looking for the weak link in die chain of power, and he\nsaw that it was die queen mother. Not that Marie was obviously\nweakshe governed both France and her son; but Richelieu saw that she\nwas really an insecure woman who needed constant masculine\nattention. He showered her with affection and respect, even toadying\nup to her favorite, Concini. He knew the day would come when the\nking would take over, but he also recognized that Louis loved his\nmother dearly and would always remain a child in relation to her. The\nway to control Louis, then, was not by gaining his favor, which could\nchange overnight, but by gaining sway over his motiier, for whom his\naffection would never change.\n\nOnce Richelieu had the position he desiredprime ministerhe\ndiscarded die queen mother, moving on to die next weak link in the\nchain: the king's own character. There was a part of him diat would\nalways be a helpless child in need of higher authority. It was on the\nfoundation of the king's weakness that Richelieu established his own\npower and fame.\n\nRemember: When entering the court, find the weak link. The\nperson in control is often not the king or queen; it is someone behind\nthe scenes the favorite, the husband or wife, even flie court fool. This\nperson may have more weaknesses than the king himself, because his\npower depends on all kinds of capricious factors outside his control.\n\nFinally, when dealing with helpless children who cannot make\ndecisions, play on their weakness and push them into bold ventures.\nThey will have to depend on you even more, for you will become the\nadult figure whom they rely on to get them out of scrapes and to safety.\n\nObservance II\n\nIn December of 1925, guests at the swankiest hotel in Palm\nBeach, Florida, watched with interest as a mysterious man arrived ina\nRolls-Royce driven by a Japanese chauffeur. Over the next few days\nthey studied this handsome man, who walked widi an elegant cane,\nreceived telegrams at all hours, and only engaged in the briefest of\nconversations. He was a count, they heard, Count Victor Lustig, and he\ncame from one of the wealthiest families in Europebut this was all they\ncould find out.\n\nImagine their amazement, dien, when Lustig one day walked up\nto one of the least distinguished guests in the hotel, a Mr. Herman\n\nLoller,\n\nAs time went on I came to look for the little weaknesses... It's the\nlittle things that count. On one occasion, I worked on the president of a\nlarge bank in Omaha. The [phony] deal involved the purchase of the\nstreet railway system of Omaha, including a bridge across the\nMississippi River My principals were supposedly German and I had to\nnegotiate with Berlin. While awaiting word from them I introduced my\nfake mining-stock proposition. Since this man was rich, I decided to\nplay for high stakes.... Meanwhile, I played golf with the banker,\nvisited his home, and went to the theater with him and his wife.\nThough he showed some interest in my stock deal, he still wasn 't\nconvinced. I had built it up to the point that an investment of\n$1,250,000 was required. Of this I was to put up $900,000, the banker\n$350,000. But still he hesitated. One evening when 1 was at his home\nor dinner I wore some perfumeCoty's \u201cApril Violets.\u201d It was not then\nconsidered effeminate for a man to use a dash of perfume. The\nbanker's wife thought it very lovely. \u201cWhere did you get it \u201d \u201cIt is a\nrare blend,\u201d I told her, \"especially made for me by a\n\nFrench perfumer. Do you like it* \u201dI love it,\u201c she replied. The\nollowing day I went through my effects and found two empty bottles.\nBoth had come from France, but were empty. I went to a downtown\ndepartment store and purchased ten ounces of Coty's \u2019April Violets.\u201c I\npoured this into the two French bottles, carefully sealed them, wrapped\nthem in tissue paper. That evening 1 dropped by the banker's home and\npresented the two bottles to his wife. \u201d\u2019They were especially put up for\nme in Cologne, \u201c / told her. The next day the banker called at my hotel.\nHis wife was enraptured by the perfume. She considered it the most\nwonderful, the most exotic fragrance she had ever used. I did not tell\nthe banker he could get all he wanted right in Omaha. \u201dShe said,\u201c the\nbanker added, \u201dthat I was fortunate to be associated with a man like\nyou.\" From then on his attitude was changed, for he had complete faith\nin his wife's judgment. ... He parted with $350,000. This, incidentally\nwas my biggest [con] score.\n\n\u201cYELLOW KID\u201d WEIL,\n\n1875-1976\n\nhead of an engineering company, and entered into conversation\nwith him. Loller had made his fortune only recendy, and forging social\n\n\nconnections was very important to him. He felt honored and somewhat\nmtimidated by this sophisticated man, who spoke perfect English with\na hint of a foreign accent. Over die days to come, the two became\nfriends.\n\nLoller of course did most of the talking, and one night he\nconfessed that his business was doing poorly, with more troubles\nahead. In return, Lustig confided in his new friend that he too had\nserious money problemsCommunists had seized his family estate and\nall its assets. He was too old to learn a trade and go to work. Luckily\nhe had found an answer\u201ca money-making machine.\u201d \u201cYou counterfeit\u201d\nLoller whispered in half-shock. No, Lustig replied, explaining that\nthrough a secret chemical process, his machine could duplicate any\npaper currency with complete accuracy. Put in a dollar bill and six\nhours later you had two, both perfect. He proceeded to explain how the\nmachine had been smuggled out of Europe, how die Germans had\ndeveloped it to undermine the British, how it had supported the count\nor several years, and on and on. When Loller insisted on a\ndemonstration, the two men went to Lustig's room, where the count\nproduced a magnificent mahogany box fitted witii slots, cranks, and\ndials. Loller watched as Lustig inserted a dollar bill in die box. Sure\nenough, early die following morning Lustig pulled out two bills, still\nwet from die chemicals.\n\nLustig gave the notes to Loller, who immediately took the bills to\na local bankwhich accepted them as genuine. Now the businessman\nfeverishly begged Lustig to sell him a machine. The count explained\ndiat there was only one in existence, so Loller made him a high offer:\n$25,000, then a considerable amount (more than $400,000 in today's\nterms). Even so, Lustig seemed reluctant: He did not feel right about\nmaking his friend pay so much. Yet finally he agreed to the sale. After\nall, he said, \u201cI suppose it matters little what you pay me. You are, after\nall, going to recover the amount within a few days by duplicating your\nown bills.\u201d Making Loller swear never to reveal the machine's\nexistence to odier people, Lustig accepted the money. Later the same\nday he checked out of the hotel. A year later, after many futile attempts\nat duplicating bills, Loller finally went to the police with the story of\nhow Count Lustig had conned him with a pair of dollar bills, some\nchemicals, and a worthless mahogany box. Interpretation\n\n\nCount Lustig had an eagle eye for other people's weaknesses. He\nsaw them in die smallest gesture. Loller, for instance, overtipped\nwaiters, seemed nervous in conversation with the concierge, talked\nloudly about his business. His weakness, Lustig knew, was his need for\nsocial validation and for die respect that he thought his wealth had\nearned him. He was also chronically insecure. Lustig had come to the\nhotel to hunt for prey. In Loller he homed in on the perfect suckera\nman hungering for someone to fill his psychic voids.\n\nIn offering Loller his friendship, then, Lustig knew he was\noffering him the immediate respect of the other guests. As a count,\nLustig was also offer-\n\ning the newly rich businessman access to the glittering world of\nold wealth. And for the coup de grace, he apparendy owned a machine\nmat would rescue Loller from his worries. It would even put him on a\npar with Lustig himself, who had also used the machine to maintain his\nstatus. No wonder Loller took the bait.\n\nRemember: When searching for suckers, always look for the\ndissatisfied, me unhappy, the insecure. Such people are riddled with\nweaknesses and have needs mat you can fill. Their neediness is the\ngroove in which you place your thumbnail and turn diem at will.\n\nObservance III\n\nIn the year 1559, the French king Henri II died in a jousting\nexhibition. His son assumed the throne, becoming Francis II, but in the\nbackground stood Henri's wife and queen, Catherine de\u2019 Medicis, a\nwoman who had long ago proven her skill in affairs of state. When\nFrancis died the next year, Catherine took control of the country as\nregent to her next son in line of succession, the future Charles IX, a\nmere ten years old at the time.\n\nThe main threats to the queen's power were Antoine de Bourbon,\nking of Navarre, and his brother, Louis, die powerful prince of Conde,\nbom of whom could claim the right to serve as regent instead of\nCatherine, who, after all, was Italiana foreigner. Catherine quickly\nappointed Antoine lieutenant general of the kingdom, a title that\nseemed to satisfy his ambition. It also meant that he had to remain in\ncourt, where Catherine could keep an eye on him. Her next move\nproved smarter still: Antoine had a notorious weakness for young\nwomen, so she assigned one of her most attractive maids of honor,\n\n\nLouise de Rouet, to seduce him. Now Antoine's intimate, Louise\nreported all of his actions to Catherine. The move worked so brilliantly\nthat Catiierine assigned another of her maids to Prince Conde, and thus\nwas formed her escadron volant \u201cflying squadron\u201d\u2019of young girls\nwhom she used to keep the unsuspecting males in the court under her\ncontrol.\n\nIn 1572 Catherine married off her daughter, Marguerite de Valois,\nto Henri, the son of Antoine and the new king of Navarre. To put a\nfamily that had always struggled against her so close to power was a\ndangerous move, so to make sure of Henri's loyalty she unleashed on\nhim the loveliest member of her \u201cflying squadron,\u201d Charlotte de\nBeaune Semblancay, baroness of Sauves. Catherine did this even\ndiough Henri was married to her daughter. Within weeks, Marguerite\nde Valois wrote in her memoirs, \u201cMme. de Sauves so completely\nensnared my husband that we no longer slept together, nor even\nconversed.\u201d\n\nThe baroness was an excellent spy and helped to keep Henri\nunder Catherine's thumb. When the queen's youngest son, the Duke of\nAlencon, grew so close to Henri that she feared the two might plot\nagainst her, she assigned the baroness to him as well. This most\ninfamous member of the flying squadron quickly seduced Alencon,\nand soon the two young men fought over her and tiieir friendship\nquickly ended, along with any danger of a conspiracy.\n\nAnd while I am on the subject, there is another fact that deserves\nmention. It is this. A man shows his character just in the way in which\nhe deals with triflesfor then he is off his guard. This will often afford a\ngood opportunity of observing the boundless egoism of a man's nature,\nand his total lack of consideration for others; and if these defects show\nthemselves in small things, or merely in his general demeanour, you\nwill find that they also underlie his action in matters of importance,\nalthough he may disguise the fact. This is an opportunity which should\nnot be missed. If in the little affairs of every daythe trifles of life ...a\nman is inconsiderate and seeks only what is advantageous or\nconvenient to himself, to the prejudice of others' rights; if he\nappropriates to himself that which belongs to all alike, you may be\nsure there is no justice in his heart, and that he would be a scoundrel\non a wholesale scale, only that law and compulsion bind his hands.\n\nArthur\n\nSchopenhauer,\n\n1788-1860\n\nWhen the two armies [Julius Caesar's and Pompey's] were come\ninto Pharsalia, and both encamped there, Pompey's thoughts ran the\nsame way as they had done before, against fighting.... But those who\nwere about him were greatly confident of success ... as if they had\nalready conquered.... The cavalry especially were obstinate for\nfighting, being splendidly armed and bravely mounted, and valuing\nthemselves upon the fine horses they kept, and upon their own\nhandsome persons; as also upon the advantage of their numbers, for\nthey were five thousand against one thousand of Caesar's. Nor were\nthe numbers of the infantry less disproportionate, there being forty-five\nthousand of Pompey's against twenty-two thousand of the enemy. [The\nnext day! whilst the infantry was thus sharply engaged in the main\nbattle, on the flank Pompey 's horse rode up confidently, and opened\n[his cavalry's] ranks very wide, that they might surround the right wing\nof Caesar. But before they engaged, Caesar's cohorts rushed out and\nattacked them, and did not dart their javelins at a distance, nor strike at\nthe thighs and legs, as they usually did in close battle, but aimed at\ntheir faces. For thus\n\nInterpretation\n\nCatherine had seen very early on the sway mat a mistress has over\na man of power: Her own husband, Henri II, had kept one of the most\ninfamous mistresses of them all, Diane de Poitiers. What Catherine\nlearned from the experience was that a man like her husband wanted to\nfeel he could win a woman over widiout having to rely on his status,\nwhich he had inherited rather dian earned. And such a need contained\na huge blind spot: As long as die woman began die affair by acting as\nif she had been conquered, die man would fail to notice that as time\npassed the mistress had come to hold power over him, as Diane de\nPoitiers did over Henri. It was Cadierine's strategy to tum this\nweakness to her advantage, using it as a way to conquer and control\nmen. All she had to do was unleash the loveliest women in the court,\nher \u201cflying squadron,\u201d on men whom she knew shared her husband's\nvulnerability.\n\nRemember: Always look for passions and obsessions that cannot\nbe controlled. The stronger the passion, the more vulnerable die\nperson. This may seem surprising, for passionate people look strong.\nIn fact, however, they are simply filling die stage with dieir\ntheatricality, distracting people from how weak and helpless they\nreally are. A man's need to conquer women actually reveals a\ntremendous helplessness that has made suckers out of them for\nthousands of years. Look at the part of a person that is most\nvisibletheir greed, dieir lust, tiieir intense fear. These are the emotions\nthey cannot conceal, and over which diey have the least control. And\nwhat people cannot control, you can control for diem.\n\nObservance IV\n\nArabella Huntington, wife of die great late-nineteentii-century\nrailroad magnate Collis P. Huntington, came from humble origins and\nalways struggled for social recognition among her wealdiy peers.\nWhen she gave a party in her San Francisco mansion, few of die social\nelite would show up; most of diem took her for a gold digger, not their\nkind. Because of her husband's fabulous wealdi, art dealers courted\nher, but widi such condescension they obviously saw her as an upstart.\nOnly one man of consequence treated her differentiy: the dealer Joseph\nDuveen.\n\nFor die first few years of Duveen's relationship witii Arabella, he\nmade no effort to sell expensive art to her. Instead he accompanied her\nto fine stores, chatted endlessly about queens and princesses he knew,\non and on. At last, she diought, a man who treated her as an equal,\neven a superior, in high society. Meanwhile, if Duveen did not try to\nsell art to her, he did sub-tiy educate her in his aesdietic ideasnamely,\nthat die best art was the most expensive art. And after Arabella had\nsoaked up his way of seeing things, Duveen would act as if she always\nhad exquisite taste, even tiiough before she met him her aesdietics had\nbeen abysmal.\n\nWhen Collis Huntington died, in 1900, Arabella came into a\nfortune. She suddenly started to buy expensive paintings, by\nRembrandt and Velazquez, for exampleand only from Duveen. Years\nlater Duveen sold her Gainsborough's Blue Boy for the highest price\never paid for a work of\n\nart at the time, an astounding purchase for a family that\npreviously had shown litde interest in collecting. Interpretation\n\nJoseph Duveen instantly understood Arabella Huntington and\nwhat made her tick: She wanted to feel important, at home in society.\nIntensely insecure about her lower-class background, she needed\nconfirmation of her new social status. Duveen waited. Instead of\nrushing into trying to persuade her to collect art, he subtly went to\nwork on her weaknesses. He made her feel that she deserved his\nattention not because she was the wife of one of the wealthiest men in\nthe world but because of her own special characterand this completely\nmelted her. Duveen never condescended to Arabella; rather than\nlecturing to her, he instilled his ideas in her indirectly. The result was\none of his best and most devoted clients, and also the sale of The Blue\nBoy.\n\nPeople's need for validation and recognition, tiieir need to feel\nimportant, is the best kind of weakness to exploit. First, it is almost\nuniversal; second, exploiting it is so very easy. All you have to do is\nfind ways to make people feel better about their taste, their social\nstanding, meir intelligence. Once the fish are hooked, you can reel\nthem in again and again, for yearsyou are filling a positive role, giving\nthem what they cannot get on their own. They may never suspect that\nyou are turning them like a thumbscrew, and if they do they may not\ncare, because you are making them feel better about themselves, and\nthat is worth any price.\n\nObservance V\n\nIn 1862 King William of Prussia named Otto von Bismarck\npremier and minister for foreign affairs. Bismarck was known for his\nboldness, his ambitionand his interest in strengthening die military.\nSince William was surrounded by liberals in his government and\ncabinet, politicians who already wanted to limit his powers, it was\nquite dangerous for him to put Bismarck in this sensitive position. His\nwife, Queen Augusta, had tried to dissuade him, but aKhough she\nusually got her way with him, this time William stuck to his guns.\n\nOnly a week after becoming prime minister, Bismarck made an\nimpromptu speech to a few dozen ministers to convince them of the\nneed to enlarge the army. He ended by saying, \u201cThe great questions of\nthe time will be decided, not by speeches and resolutions of majorities,\n\nbut by iron and blood.\u201d His speech was immediately disseminated\nthroughout Germany. The queen screamed at her husband that\nBismarck was a barbaric militarist who was out to usurp control of\nPrussia, and that William had to fire him. The liberals in the\ngovernment agreed with her. The outcry was so vehement that William\nbegan to be afraid he would end up on a scaffold, like Louis XVI of\nFrance, if he kept Bismarck on as prime minister.\nBismarck knew he had to get to the king before it was too late. He\nalso knew he had blundered, and should have tempered his fiery\nwords. Yet as he contemplated his strategy, he decided not to apologize\nbut to do the exact opposite. Bismarck knew the king well.\nCaesar had instructed them, in hopes that young gentlemen, who\nhad not known much of battles and wounds, hut came wearing their\nhair long, in the flower of their age and height of their beauty, would\nbe more apprehensive of such blows, and not care for hazarding both a\ndanger at present and a blemish for the future.\nAnd so it proved, for they were so far from bearing the stroke of\nthe javelins, that they could not stand the sight of them, but turned\nabout, and covered their faces to secure them. Once in disorder,\npresently they turned about to fly; and so most shamefully ruined all.\nFor those who had beat them back at once outflanked the infantry, and\nalling on their rear, cut them to pieces. Pompey, who commanded the\nother wing of the army, when he saw his cavalry thus broken and\nflying, was no longer himself nor did he now remember that he was\nPompey the Great, but, like one whom some god had deprived of his\nsenses, retired to his tent without speaking a word, and there sat to\nexpect the event, till the whole army was routed.\n\nTHE LIFE OF JULIUS CAESAR.\n\nPlutarch, c. a.d. 46-120\n\nWhen the two men met, William, predictably, had been worked\ninto a tizzy by the queen. He reiterated his fear of being guillotined.\nBut Bismarck only replied, \u201cYes, then we shall be dead! We must die\nsooner or later, and could there be a more respectable way of dying I\nshould die fighting for the cause of my king and master. Your Majesty\nwould die sealing with your own blood your royal rights granted by\nGod's grace. Whether upon the scaffold or upon the battlefield makes\nno difference to the glorious staking of body and life on behalf of\n\n\nrights granted by God's grace!\u201d On he went, appealing to William's\nsense of honor and the majesty of his position as head of the army.\nHow could the king allow people to push him around Wasn't the honor\nof Germany more important than quibbling over words Not only did\nthe prime minister convince die king to stand up to both his wife and\nhis parliament, he persuaded him to build up the armyBismarck's goal\nall along. Interpretation\n\nBismarck knew the king felt bullied by those around him. He\nknew that William had a military background and a deep sense of\nhonor, and that he felt ashamed at his cravenness before his wife and\nhis government. William secredy yearned to be a great and mighty\nking, but he dared not express this ambition because he was afraid of\nending up like Louis XVI. Where a show of courage often conceals a\nman's timidity, William's timidity concealed his need to show courage\nand thump his chest.\n\nBismarck sensed the longing for glory beneatii William's pacifist\nfront, so he played to the king's insecurity about his manhood, finally\npushing him into diree wars and the creation of a German empire.\nTimidity is a potent weakness to exploit. Timid souls often yearn to be\ntheir oppositeto be Napoleons. Yet they lack the inner strength. You, in\nessence, can become their Napoleon, pushing them into bold actions\nthat serve your needs while also making them dependent on you.\nRemember: Look to the opposites and never take appearances at face\nvalue.\n\nImage: The Thumbscrew. Your enemy has secrets that he guards,\nthinks thoughts he will not reveal. But they come out in ways he\ncannot help. It is there somewhere, a groove of weakness on his head,\nat his heart, over his belly. Once you find the groove, put your thumb\nin it and turn him at will.\n\nAuthority: Find out each man's thumbscrew. Tis the art of setting\ntheir wills in action. It needs more skill than resolution. You must\nknow where to get at anyone. Every volition has a special motive\nwhich varies according to taste. All men are idolaters, some of fame,\nodiers of self-interest, most of pleasure. Skill consists in knowing these\nidols in order to bring them into play. Knowing any man's mainspring\nof motive you have as it were the key to his will. (Baltasar Gracian,\n1601-1658)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nPlaying on people's weakness has one significant danger: You\nmay stir up\n\nan action you cannot control.\n\nIn your games of power you always look several steps ahead and\nplan accordingly. And you exploit the fact that other people are more\nemotional and incapable of such foresight. But when you play on their\nvulnerabilities, the areas over which they have least control, you can\nunleash emotions that will upset your plans. Push timid people into\nbold action and they may go too far; answer their need for attention or\nrecognition and they may need more than you want to give them. The\nhelpless, childish element you are playing on can turn against you.\n\nThe more emotional the weakness, die greater the potential\ndanger. Know the limits to this game, then, and never get carried away\nby your control over your victims. You are after power, not die dirill of\ncontrol.\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Below is an excerpt from my book titled '48 Laws of Power', specifically from Chapter '48 Laws of Power', Section 'LAW 34'. The original text is: 'BE ROYAL IN YOUR OWN\n\nFASHION: ACT LIKE A\n\nKING TO BE TREATED\n\nLIKE ONE\n\nJUDGMENT\n\nThe way you carry yourself will often determine how you are\ntreated: In the long run, appearing vulgar or common will make people\ndisrespect you. For a king respects himself and inspires the same\nsentiment in others. By acting regally and confident of your powers,\nyou make yourself seem destined to wear a crown.\n\nTRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW,\n\nIn July of 1830, a revolution broke out in Paris that forced the\nking, Charles X, to abdicate. A commission of the highest audiorities\nin the land gathered to choose a successor, and the man they picked\nwas Louis-Philippe, the Duke of Orleans.\n\nFrom the beginning it was clear that Louis-Philippe would be a\ndifferent kind of king, and not just because he came from a different\nbranch of the royal family, or because he had not inherited the crown\nbut had been given it, by a commission, putting his legitimacy in\nquestion. Rather it was that he disliked ceremony and the trappings of\nroyalty; he had more friends among the bankers than among the\nnobility; and his style was not to create a new kind of royal rule, as\nNapoleon had done, but to downplay his status, the better to mix widi\nthe businessmen and middle-class folk who had called him to lead.\nThus the symbols that came to be associated with Louis-Philippe were\nneither the scepter nor the crown, but the gray hat and umbrella with\nwhich he would proudly walk the streets of Paris, as if he were a\nbourgeois out for a stroll. When Louis-Philippe invited James\nRothschild, the most important banker in France, to his palace, he\ntreated him as an equal. And unlike any king before him, not only did\n\nhe talk business with Monsieur Rothschild but that was literally all he\ntalked, for he loved money and had amassed a huge fortune.\n\nAs the reign of the \u201cbourgeois king\u201d plodded on, people came to\ndespise him. The aristocracy could not endure the sight of an unkingly\nking, and within a few years they turned on him. Meanwhile the\ngrowing class of the poor, including the radicals who had chased out\nCharles X, found no satisfaction in a ruler who neither acted as a king\nnor governed as a man of the people. The bankers to whom Louis-\nPhilippe was die most beholden soon realized that it was they who\ncontrolled the country, not he, and they treated him with growing\ncontempt. One day, at the start of a train trip organized for die royal\nfamily, James Rothschild actually berated himand in publicfor being\nlate. Once die king had made news by treating the banker as an equal;\nnow the banker treated the king as an inferior.\n\nEventually the workers' insurrections that had brought down\nLouis-Philippe's predecessor began to reemerge, and die king put them\ndown with force. But what was he defending so brutally Not the\ninstitution of me monarchy, which he disdained, nor a democratic\nrepublic, which his rule prevented. What he was really defending, it\nseemed, was his own fortune, and die fortunes of the bankersnot a way\nto inspire loyalty among die citizenry.\n\nIn early 1848, Frenchmen of all classes began to demonstrate for\nelectoral reforms that would make die country truly democratic. By\nFebruary the demonstrations had turned violent. To assuage the\npopulace, Louis-Philippe fired his prime minister and appointed a\nliberal as a replacement. But this created the opposite of the desired\neffect: The people sensed they could push the king around. The\ndemonstrations turned into a full-fledged revolution, with gunfire and\nbarricades in the streets.\n\nNever lose your self-respect, nor be too familiar with yourself\nwhen you are alone. Let your integrity itself be your own standard of\nrectitude, and be more indebted to the severity of your own judgment\nof yourself than to all external precepts. Desist from unseemly\nconduct, rather out of respect for your own virtue than for the strictures\nof external authority. Come to hold yourself in awe, and you will have\nno need of Seneca's imaginary tutor.\n\nBaltasar Gracian, 1601-1658\n\nOn the night of February 23, a crowd of Parisians surrounded the\npalace. With a suddenness that caught everyone by surprise, Louis-\nPhilippe abdicated that very evening and fled to England. He left no\nsuccessor, nor even die suggestion of onehis whole government folded\nup and dissolved like a traveling circus leaving town.\n\nInterpretation\n\nLouis-Philippe consciously dissolved the aura that naturally\npertains to kings and leaders. Scoffing at the symbolism of grandeur,\nhe believed a new world was dawning, where rulers should act and be\nlike ordinary citizens. He was right: A new world, without kings and\nqueens, was certainly on its way. He was profoundly wrong, however,\nin predicting a change in the dynamics of power.\n\nThe bourgeois king's hat and umbrella amused the French at first,\nbut soon grew irritating. People knew that Louis-Philippe was not\nreally like them at allthat the hat and umbrella were essentially a kind\nof trick to encourage them in the fantasy that the country had suddenly\ngrown more equal. Actually, though, the divisions of wealth had never\nbeen greater. The French expected their ruler to be a bit of a showman,\nto have some presence. Even a radical like Robespierre, who had\nbriefly come to power during the French Revolution fifty years earlier,\nhad understood this, and certainly Napoleon, who had turned die\nrevolutionary republic into an imperial regime, had known it in his\nbones. Indeed as soon as Louis-Philippe fled the stage, the French\nrevealed their true desire: They elected Napoleon's grand-nephew\npresident. He was a virtual unknown, but they hoped he would re-\ncreate die great general's powerful aura, erasing die awkward memory\nof die \u201cbourgeois king.\u201d\n\nPowerful people may be tempted to affect a common-man aura,\ntrying to create the illusion that they and dieir subjects or underlings\nare basically die same. But the people whom diis false gesture is\nintended to impress will quickly see through it. They understand that\nthey are not being given more powerthat it only appears as if diey\nshared in the powerful person's fate. The only kind of common touch\nthat works is die kind affected by Franklin Roosevelt, a style that said\nthe president shared values and goals with the common people even\nwhile he remained a patrician at heart. He never pretended to erase his\ndistance from the crowd.\n\n\nLeaders who try to dissolve that distance through a false\nchumminess gradually lose the ability to inspire loyalty, fear, or love.\nInstead they elicit contempt. Like Louis-Philippe, they are too\nuninspiring even to be worth the guillotinedie best diey can do is\nsimply vanish in the night, as if diey were never there.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nWhen Christopher Columbus was trying to find funding for his\nlegendary voyages, many around him believed he came from the\nItalian aristocracy. This view was passed into history through a\nbiography written after the explorer's death by his son, which describes\nhim as a descendant of a Count\n\nColombo of die Casde of Cuccaro in Montferrat. Colombo in turn\nwas Said to be descended from the legendary Roman general Colonius,\nand two of his first cousins were supposedly direct descendants of an\nemperor of Constantinople. An illustrious background indeed. But it\nwas nodiing more than illustrious fantasy, for Columbus was actually\nthe son of Domenico Colombo, a humble weaver who had opened a\nwine shop when Christopher was a young man, and who then made his\nliving by selling cheese.\n\nColumbus himself had created the myth of his noble background,\nbecause from early on he felt that destiny had singled him out for great\nthings, and that he had a kind of royalty in his blood. Accordingly he\nacted as if he were indeed descended from noble stock. After an\nuneventful career as a merchant on a commercial vessel, Columbus,\noriginally from Genoa, settled in Lisbon. Using die fabricated story of\nhis noble background, he married into an established Lisbon family\nthat had excellent connections with Portuguese royalty.\n\nThrough his in-laws, Columbus finagled a meeting with the king\nof Portugal, Joao II, whom he petitioned to finance a westward voyage\naimed at discovering a shorter route to Asia. In return for announcing\nthat any discoveries he achieved would be made in the king's name,\nColumbus wanted a series of rights: the tide Grand Admiral of die\nOceanic Sea; die office of viceroy over any lands he found; and 10\npercent of die future commerce with such lands. All of these rights\nwere to be hereditary and for all time. Columbus made these demands\neven diough he had previously been a mere merchant, he knew almost\nnothing about navigation, he could not work a quadrant, and he had\n\nnever led a group of men. In short he had absolutely no qualifications\nfor die journey he proposed. Furthermore, his petition included no\ndetails as to how he would accomplish his plans, just vague promises.\n\nWhen Columbus finished his pitch, Joao II smiled: He politely\ndeclined the offer, but left the door open for the future. Here Columbus\nmust have noticed somediing he would never forget: Even as the king\nturned down die sailor's demands, he treated them as legitimate. He\nneither laughed at Columbus nor questioned his background and\ncredentials. In fact die king was impressed by die boldness of\nColumbus's requests, and clearly felt comfortable in the company of a\nman who acted so confidently. The meeting must have convinced\nColumbus tiiat his instincts were correct: By asking for the moon, he\nhad instandy raised his own status, for the king assumed that unless a\nman who set such a high price on himself were mad, which Columbus\ndid not appear to be, he must somehow be worth it.\n\nA few years later Columbus moved to Spain. Using his\nPortuguese connections, he moved in elevated circles at the Spanish\ncourt, receiving subsidies from illustrious financiers and sharing tables\nwidi dukes and princes. To all these men he repeated his request for\nfinancing for a voyage to die westand also for the rights he had\ndemanded from Joao II. Some, such as die powerful duke of Medina,\nwanted to help, but could not, since they lacked die power to grant him\nthe tides and rights he wanted. But Columbus would not back down.\nHe soon realized that only one person\n\nHII'POCLKinkKS AT SICYON\n\nIn the next generation the family became much more famous than\nbefore through the distinction conferred upon it by Cleisthenes the\nmaster of Sicyon. Cleisthenes . .. had a daughter, Agarista, whom he\nwished to marry to the best man in all Greece. So during the Olympic\ngames, in which he had himself won the chariot race, he had a public\nannouncement made, to the effect that any Greek who thought himself\ngood enough to become Cleisthenes' son-in-law should present himself\nin Sicyon within sixty daysor sooner if he wishedbecause he intended,\nwithin the year following the sixtieth day, to betroth his daughter to her\nfuture husband. Cleisthenes had had a race-track and a wrestling-ring\nspecially made for his purpose, and presently the suitors began to\narrive every man of Greek nationality who had something to be proud\n\nof either in his country or in himself... Cleisthenes began by asking\neach [of the numerous suitors) in turn to name his country and\nparentage; then he kept them in his house for a year, to get to know\nthem well, entering into conversation with them sometimes singly,\nsometimes all together, and testing each of them for his\n\nmanly qualities and temper, education and manners. . .. But the\nmost important test of all was their behaviour at the dinner-table. All\nthis went on throughout their stay in Sieyon, and all the time he\nentertained them handsomely. For one reason or another it was the two\nAthenians who impressed Cleisthenes most favourably, and of the two\nTisander's son Hippocleides came to be preferred. . . At last the day\ncame which had been fixed for the betrothal, and Cleisthenes had to\ndeclare his choice. lie marked the day by the sacrifice of a hundred\noxen, and then gave a great banquet, to which not only the suitors but\neveryone of note in Sieyon was invited. When dinner was over, the\nsuitors began to compete with each other in music and in talking in\ncompany. In both these accomplishments it was Hippocleides who\nproved by far the doughtiest champion, until at last, as more and more\nwine was drunk, he asked the flute-player to play him a tune and began\nto dance to it. Now it may well be that he danced to his own\nsatisfaction; Cleisthenes, however, who was watching the\nperformance, began to have serious doubts about the whole business.\nPresently, after a brief pause, Hippocleides sent for a table; the table\nwas brought, and\n\ncould meet his demands: Queen Isabella. In 1487 he finally\nmanaged a meeting with the queen, and although he could not\nconvince her to finance me voyage, he completely charmed her, and\nbecame a frequent guest in the palace.\n\nIn 1492 the Spanish finally expelled the Moorish invaders who\ncenturies earlier had seized parts of the country. With the wartime\nburden on her treasury lifted, Isabella felt she could finally respond to\nthe demands of her explorer friend, and she decided to pay for three\nships, equipment, the salaries of the crews, and a modest stipend for\nColumbus. More important, she had a contract drawn up that granted\nColumbus the tides and rights on which he had insisted. The only one\nshe deniedand only in the contract's fine printwas the 10 percent of all\nrevenues from any lands discovered: an absurd demand, since he\n\nwanted no time limit on it. (Had the clause been left in, it would\neventually have made Columbus and his heirs the wealthiest family on\nthe planet. Columbus never read the fine print.)\n\nSatisfied that his demands had been met, Columbus set sail mat\nsame year in search of the passage to Asia. (Before he left he was\ncareful to hire the best navigator he could find to help him get there.)\nThe mission failed to find such a passage, yet when Columbus\npetitioned the queen to finance an even more ambitious voyage the\nfollowing year, she agreed. By then she had come to see Columbus as\ndestined for great things.\n\nInterpretation\n\nAs an explorer Columbus was mediocre at best. He knew less\nabout the sea man did the average sailor on his ships, could never\ndetermine the latitude and longitude of his discoveries, mistook islands\nfor vast continents, and treated his crew badly. But in one area he was\na genius: He knew how to sell himself. How else to explain how the\nson of a cheese vendor, a low-level sea merchant, managed to\ningratiate himself with the highest royal and aristocratic families\n\nColumbus had an amazing power to charm the nobility, and it all\ncame from the way he carried himself. He projected a sense of\nconfidence mat was completely out of proportion to his means. Nor\nwas his confidence the aggressive, ugly self-promotion of an upstartit\nwas a quiet and calm self-assurance. In fact it was the same confidence\nusually shown by the nobility themselves. The powerful in the old-\nstyle aristocracies felt no need to prove or assert tiiemselves; being\nnoble, tiley knew they always deserved more, and asked for it. With\nColumbus, then, diey felt an instant affinity, for he carried himself just\nthe way they didelevated above die crowd, destined for greatness.\n\nUnderstand: It is within your power to set your own price. How\nyou carry yourself reflects what you think of yourself. If you ask for\nlittle, shuffle your feet and lower your head, people will assume this\nreflects your character. But tiiis behavior is not youit is only how you\nhave chosen to present yourself to other people. You can just as easily\npresent the Columbus front: buoyancy, confidence, and the feeling that\nyou were born to wear a crown.\n\nWith all great deceivers there is a noteworthy occurrence to which\nthey owe their\n\npower. In the actual act of deception they are overcome by belief\nin themselves: it is\n\nthis which then speaks so miraculously and compellingly to those\naround them.\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche, 1844-1900\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nAs children, we start our lives with great exuberance, expecting\nand demanding everything from the world. This generally carries over\ninto our first forays into society, as we begin our careers. But as we\ngrow older the rebuffs and failures we experience set up boundaries\nthat only get firmer with time. Coming to expect less from the world,\nwe accept limitations that are really self-imposed. We start to bow and\nscrape and apologize for even the simplest of requests. The solution to\nsuch a shrinking of horizons is to deliberately force ourselves in the\nopposite directionto downplay the failures and ignore the limitations,\nto make ourselves demand and expect as much as the child. To\naccomplish this, we must use a particular strategy upon ourselves. Call\nit the Strategy of the Crown.\n\nThe Strategy of the Crown is based on a simple chain of cause\nand effect: If we believe we are destined for great things, our belief\nwill radiate outward, just as a crown creates an aura around a king.\nThis outward radiance will infect the people around us, who will think\nwe must have reasons to feel so confident. People who wear crowns\nseem to feel no inner sense of the limits to what they can ask for or\nwhat they can accomplish. This too radiates outward. Limits and\nboundaries disappear. Use the Strategy of the Crown and you will be\nsurprised how often it bears fruit. Take as an example those happy\nchildren who ask for whatever they want, and get it. Their high\nexpectations are their charm. Adults enjoy granting their wishesjust as\nIsabella enjoyed granting the wishes of Columbus.\n\nThroughout history, people of undistinguished birththe Theodoras\nof Byzantium, the Columbuses, the Beethovens, the Disraelishave\nmanaged to work the Strategy of the Crown, believing so firmly in\ntheir own greatness that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. The trick\nis simple: Be overcome by your self-belief. Even while you know you\nare practicing a kind of deception on yourself, act like a king. You are\nlikely to be treated as one.\n\nThe crown may separate you from other people, but it is up to you\nto make that separation real: You have to act differently, demonstrating\nyour distance from those around you. One way to emphasize your\ndifference is to always act with dignity, no matter the circumstance.\nLouis-Philippe gave no sense of being different from other peoplehe\nwas the banker king. And the moment his subjects threatened him, he\ncaved in. Everyone sensed this and pounced. Lacking regal dignity and\nfirmness of purpose, Louis-Philippe seemed an impostor, and the\ncrown was easily toppled from his head.\n\nRegal bearing should not be confused with arrogance. Arrogance\nmay seem the king's entitlement, but in fact it betrays insecurity. It is\nthe very opposite of a royal demeanor.\n\nHippocleides, climbing on to it, danced first some Laeonian\ndances, next some Attic ones, and ended by standing on his head and\nbeating time with his legs in the air. The Laeonian and Attic dances\nwere bad enough; but Cleisthenes, though he already loathed the\nthought of having a son-in-law like that, nevertheless restrained\nhimself and managed to avoid an outburst; but when he saw\nHippocleides beating time with his legs, he could bear it no longer.\n\u201cSon of Tisander, \u201d he cried, \u201cyou have danced away your marriage. \u201d\n\nthe histories, Herodotus, fifth century b.c.\n\nHaile Selassie, ruler of Ethiopia for forty or so years beginning in\n1930, was once a young man named Lij Tafari. He came from a noble\nfamily, but there was no real chance of him coming to power, for he\nwas far down the line of succession from die king then on the throne,\nMenelik II. Nevertheless, from an early age he exhibited a self-\nconfidence and a royal bearing that surprised everyone around him.\n\nAt the age of fourteen, Tafari went to live at the court, where he\nimmediately impressed Menelik and became his favorite. Tafari's grace\nunder fire, his patience, and his calm self-assurance fascinated the\nking. The other young nobles, arrogant, blustery, and envious, would\npush this slight, bookish teenager around. But he never got angrydiat\nwould have been a sign of insecurity, to which he would not stoop.\nThere were already people around him who felt he would someday rise\nto the top, for he acted as if he were already there.\n\nYears later, in 1936, when the Italian Fascists had taken over\nEthiopia and Tafari, now called Haile Selassie, was in exile, he\n\naddressed the League of Nations to plead his country's case. The\nItalians in the audience heckled him with vulgar abuse, but he\nmaintained his dignified pose, as if completely unaffected. This\nelevated him while making his opponents look even uglier. Dignity, in\nfact, is invariably the mask to assume under difficult circumstances: It\nis as if nothing can affect you, and you have all die time in the world to\nrespond. This is an extremely powerful pose.\n\nA royal demeanor has odier uses. Con artists have long known die\nvalue of an aristocratic front-, it either disarms people and makes them\nless suspicious, or else it intimidates them and puts them on the\ndefensiveand as Count Victor Lustig knew, once you put a sucker on\nthe defensive he is doomed. The con man Yellow Kid Weil, too, would\noften assume die trappings of a man of wealtii, along with die\nnonchalance diat goes with them. Alluding to some magical method of\nmaking money, he would stand aloof, like a king, exuding confidence\nas if he really were fabulously rich. The suckers would beg to be in on\ndie con, to have a chance at die wealth diat he so clearly displayed.\n\nFinally, to reinforce die inner psychological tricks involved in\nprojecting a royal demeanor, diere are outward strategies to help you\ncreate die effect. First, the Columbus Strategy: Always make a bold\ndemand. Set your price high and do not waver. Second, in a dignified\nway, go after the highest person in the building. This immediately puts\nyou on die same plane as the chief executive you are attacking. It is die\nDavid and Goliath Strategy: By choosing a great opponent, you create\nthe appearance of greatness.\n\nThird, give a gift of some sort to diose above you. This is the\nstrategy of those who have a patron: By giving your patron a gift, you\nare essentially saying diat die two of you are equal. It is the old con\ngame of giving so diat you can take. When die Renaissance writer\nRetro Aretino wanted die Duke of Mantua as his next patron, he knew\ndiat if he was slavish and sycophantic, die duke would diink him\nunworthy; so he approached die duke with gifts, in this case paintings\nby the writer's good friend Titian.\n\nAccepting the gifts created a kind of equality between duke and\nwriter: The duke was put at ease by the feeling that he was dealing\nwith a man of his own aristocratic stamp. He funded Aretino\ngenerously. The gift strategy is subde and brilliant because you do not\n\nbeg: You ask for help in a dignified way mat implies equality between\ntwo people, one of whom just happens to have more money.\n\nRemember: It is up to you to set your own price. Ask for less and\nthat is just what you will get. Ask for more, however, and you send a\nsignal diat you are worth a king's ransom. Even those who turn you\ndown respect you for your confidence, and mat respect will eventually\npay off in ways you cannot imagine.\n\nImage: The Crown. Place it upon your head and you assume a\ndifferent posetranquil yet radiating assurance. Never show doubt,\nnever lose your dignity beneath the crown, or it will not fit. It will\nseem to be destined for one more worthy. Do not wait for a coronation;\nthe greatest emperors crown themselves.\n\nAuthority: Everyone should be royal after his own fashion. Let all\nyour actions, even though they are not those of a king, be, in their own\nsphere, worthy of one. Be sublime in your deeds, lofty in your\nthoughts; and in all your doings show that you deserve to be a king\neven though you are not one in reality. (Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nThe idea behind the assumption of regal confidence is to set\nyourself apart from omer people, but if you take this too far it will be\nyour undoing. Never make die mistake of thinking diat you elevate\nyourself by humiliating people. Also, it is never a good idea to loom\ntoo high above the crowdyou make an easy target. And mere are times\nwhen an aristocratic pose is eminently dangerous.\n\nCharles I, king of England during the 1640s, faced a profound\npublic disenchantment with the institution of monarchy. Revolts\nerupted throughout the country, led by Oliver Cromwell. Had Charles\nreacted to the times with insight, supporting reforms and making a\nshow of sacrificing some of his power, history might have been\ndifferent. Instead he reverted to an even more regal pose, seeming\noutraged by the assault on his power and on the divine institution of\nmonarchy. His stiff kingliness offended people and spurred on their\nrevolts. And eventually Charles lost his head, literally. Understand:\nYou are radiating confidence, not arrogance or disdain.\n\nFinally, it is true that you can sometimes find some power\nthrough affecting a kind of earmy vulgarity, which will prove amusing\nby its extremeness. But to the extent that you win this game by going\n\nbeyond the limits, separating yourself from other people by appearing\neven more vulgar than diey are, the game is dangerous: There will\nalways be people more vulgar than you, and you will easily be\nreplaced the following season by someone younger and worse.\n'.

By acting regally and confident of your powers,\nyou make yourself seem destined to wear a crown.\n\nTRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW,\n\nIn July of 1830, a revolution broke out in Paris that forced the\nking, Charles X, to abdicate. A commission of the highest audiorities\nin the land gathered to choose a successor, and the man they picked\nwas Louis-Philippe, the Duke of Orleans.\n\nFrom the beginning it was clear that Louis-Philippe would be a\ndifferent kind of king, and not just because he came from a different\nbranch of the royal family, or because he had not inherited the crown\nbut had been given it, by a commission, putting his legitimacy in\nquestion. Rather it was that he disliked ceremony and the trappings of\nroyalty; he had more friends among the bankers than among the\nnobility; and his style was not to create a new kind of royal rule, as\nNapoleon had done, but to downplay his status, the better to mix widi\nthe businessmen and middle-class folk who had called him to lead.\nThus the symbols that came to be associated with Louis-Philippe were\nneither the scepter nor the crown, but the gray hat and umbrella with\nwhich he would proudly walk the streets of Paris, as if he were a\nbourgeois out for a stroll. When Louis-Philippe invited James\nRothschild, the most important banker in France, to his palace, he\ntreated him as an equal. And unlike any king before him, not only did\n\nhe talk business with Monsieur Rothschild but that was literally all he\ntalked, for he loved money and had amassed a huge fortune.\n\nAs the reign of the \u201cbourgeois king\u201d plodded on, people came to\ndespise him. The aristocracy could not endure the sight of an unkingly\nking, and within a few years they turned on him. Meanwhile the\ngrowing class of the poor, including the radicals who had chased out\nCharles X, found no satisfaction in a ruler who neither acted as a king\nnor governed as a man of the people. The bankers to whom Louis-\nPhilippe was die most beholden soon realized that it was they who\ncontrolled the country, not he, and they treated him with growing\ncontempt. One day, at the start of a train trip organized for die royal\nfamily, James Rothschild actually berated himand in publicfor being\nlate. Once die king had made news by treating the banker as an equal;\nnow the banker treated the king as an inferior.\n\nEventually the workers' insurrections that had brought down\nLouis-Philippe's predecessor began to reemerge, and die king put them\ndown with force. But what was he defending so brutally Not the\ninstitution of me monarchy, which he disdained, nor a democratic\nrepublic, which his rule prevented. What he was really defending, it\nseemed, was his own fortune, and die fortunes of the bankersnot a way\nto inspire loyalty among die citizenry.\n\nIn early 1848, Frenchmen of all classes began to demonstrate for\nelectoral reforms that would make die country truly democratic. By\nFebruary the demonstrations had turned violent. To assuage the\npopulace, Louis-Philippe fired his prime minister and appointed a\nliberal as a replacement. But this created the opposite of the desired\neffect: The people sensed they could push the king around. The\ndemonstrations turned into a full-fledged revolution, with gunfire and\nbarricades in the streets.\n\nNever lose your self-respect, nor be too familiar with yourself\nwhen you are alone. Let your integrity itself be your own standard of\nrectitude, and be more indebted to the severity of your own judgment\nof yourself than to all external precepts. Desist from unseemly\nconduct, rather out of respect for your own virtue than for the strictures\nof external authority. Come to hold yourself in awe, and you will have\nno need of Seneca's imaginary tutor.\n\nBaltasar Gracian, 1601-1658\n\nOn the night of February 23, a crowd of Parisians surrounded the\npalace. With a suddenness that caught everyone by surprise, Louis-\nPhilippe abdicated that very evening and fled to England. He left no\nsuccessor, nor even die suggestion of onehis whole government folded\nup and dissolved like a traveling circus leaving town.\n\nInterpretation\n\nLouis-Philippe consciously dissolved the aura that naturally\npertains to kings and leaders. Scoffing at the symbolism of grandeur,\nhe believed a new world was dawning, where rulers should act and be\nlike ordinary citizens. He was right: A new world, without kings and\nqueens, was certainly on its way. He was profoundly wrong, however,\nin predicting a change in the dynamics of power.\n\nThe bourgeois king's hat and umbrella amused the French at first,\nbut soon grew irritating. People knew that Louis-Philippe was not\nreally like them at allthat the hat and umbrella were essentially a kind\nof trick to encourage them in the fantasy that the country had suddenly\ngrown more equal. Actually, though, the divisions of wealth had never\nbeen greater. The French expected their ruler to be a bit of a showman,\nto have some presence. Even a radical like Robespierre, who had\nbriefly come to power during the French Revolution fifty years earlier,\nhad understood this, and certainly Napoleon, who had turned die\nrevolutionary republic into an imperial regime, had known it in his\nbones. Indeed as soon as Louis-Philippe fled the stage, the French\nrevealed their true desire: They elected Napoleon's grand-nephew\npresident. He was a virtual unknown, but they hoped he would re-\ncreate die great general's powerful aura, erasing die awkward memory\nof die \u201cbourgeois king.\u201d\n\nPowerful people may be tempted to affect a common-man aura,\ntrying to create the illusion that they and dieir subjects or underlings\nare basically die same. But the people whom diis false gesture is\nintended to impress will quickly see through it. They understand that\nthey are not being given more powerthat it only appears as if diey\nshared in the powerful person's fate. The only kind of common touch\nthat works is die kind affected by Franklin Roosevelt, a style that said\nthe president shared values and goals with the common people even\nwhile he remained a patrician at heart. He never pretended to erase his\ndistance from the crowd.\n\n\nLeaders who try to dissolve that distance through a false\nchumminess gradually lose the ability to inspire loyalty, fear, or love.\nInstead they elicit contempt. Like Louis-Philippe, they are too\nuninspiring even to be worth the guillotinedie best diey can do is\nsimply vanish in the night, as if diey were never there.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nWhen Christopher Columbus was trying to find funding for his\nlegendary voyages, many around him believed he came from the\nItalian aristocracy. This view was passed into history through a\nbiography written after the explorer's death by his son, which describes\nhim as a descendant of a Count\n\nColombo of die Casde of Cuccaro in Montferrat. Colombo in turn\nwas Said to be descended from the legendary Roman general Colonius,\nand two of his first cousins were supposedly direct descendants of an\nemperor of Constantinople. An illustrious background indeed. But it\nwas nodiing more than illustrious fantasy, for Columbus was actually\nthe son of Domenico Colombo, a humble weaver who had opened a\nwine shop when Christopher was a young man, and who then made his\nliving by selling cheese.\n\nColumbus himself had created the myth of his noble background,\nbecause from early on he felt that destiny had singled him out for great\nthings, and that he had a kind of royalty in his blood. Accordingly he\nacted as if he were indeed descended from noble stock. After an\nuneventful career as a merchant on a commercial vessel, Columbus,\noriginally from Genoa, settled in Lisbon. Using die fabricated story of\nhis noble background, he married into an established Lisbon family\nthat had excellent connections with Portuguese royalty.\n\nThrough his in-laws, Columbus finagled a meeting with the king\nof Portugal, Joao II, whom he petitioned to finance a westward voyage\naimed at discovering a shorter route to Asia. In return for announcing\nthat any discoveries he achieved would be made in the king's name,\nColumbus wanted a series of rights: the tide Grand Admiral of die\nOceanic Sea; die office of viceroy over any lands he found; and 10\npercent of die future commerce with such lands. All of these rights\nwere to be hereditary and for all time. Columbus made these demands\neven diough he had previously been a mere merchant, he knew almost\nnothing about navigation, he could not work a quadrant, and he had\n\nnever led a group of men. In short he had absolutely no qualifications\nfor die journey he proposed. Furthermore, his petition included no\ndetails as to how he would accomplish his plans, just vague promises.\n\nWhen Columbus finished his pitch, Joao II smiled: He politely\ndeclined the offer, but left the door open for the future. Here Columbus\nmust have noticed somediing he would never forget: Even as the king\nturned down die sailor's demands, he treated them as legitimate. He\nneither laughed at Columbus nor questioned his background and\ncredentials. In fact die king was impressed by die boldness of\nColumbus's requests, and clearly felt comfortable in the company of a\nman who acted so confidently. The meeting must have convinced\nColumbus tiiat his instincts were correct: By asking for the moon, he\nhad instandy raised his own status, for the king assumed that unless a\nman who set such a high price on himself were mad, which Columbus\ndid not appear to be, he must somehow be worth it.\n\nA few years later Columbus moved to Spain. Using his\nPortuguese connections, he moved in elevated circles at the Spanish\ncourt, receiving subsidies from illustrious financiers and sharing tables\nwidi dukes and princes. To all these men he repeated his request for\nfinancing for a voyage to die westand also for the rights he had\ndemanded from Joao II. Some, such as die powerful duke of Medina,\nwanted to help, but could not, since they lacked die power to grant him\nthe tides and rights he wanted.

In both these accomplishments it was Hippocleides who\nproved by far the doughtiest champion, until at last, as more and more\nwine was drunk, he asked the flute-player to play him a tune and began\nto dance to it. Now it may well be that he danced to his own\nsatisfaction; Cleisthenes, however, who was watching the\nperformance, began to have serious doubts about the whole business.\nPresently, after a brief pause, Hippocleides sent for a table; the table\nwas brought, and\n\ncould meet his demands: Queen Isabella.

Nor\nwas his confidence the aggressive, ugly self-promotion of an upstartit\nwas a quiet and calm self-assurance. In fact it was the same confidence\nusually shown by the nobility themselves. The powerful in the old-\nstyle aristocracies felt no need to prove or assert tiiemselves; being\nnoble, tiley knew they always deserved more, and asked for it. With\nColumbus, then, diey felt an instant affinity, for he carried himself just\nthe way they didelevated above die crowd, destined for greatness.\n\nUnderstand: It is within your power to set your own price. How\nyou carry yourself reflects what you think of yourself. If you ask for\nlittle, shuffle your feet and lower your head, people will assume this\nreflects your character. But tiiis behavior is not youit is only how you\nhave chosen to present yourself to other people. You can just as easily\npresent the Columbus front: buoyancy, confidence, and the feeling that\nyou were born to wear a crown.\n\nWith all great deceivers there is a noteworthy occurrence to which\nthey owe their\n\npower. In the actual act of deception they are overcome by belief\nin themselves: it is\n\nthis which then speaks so miraculously and compellingly to those\naround them.\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche, 1844-1900\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nAs children, we start our lives with great exuberance, expecting\nand demanding everything from the world. This generally carries over\ninto our first forays into society, as we begin our careers. But as we\ngrow older the rebuffs and failures we experience set up boundaries\nthat only get firmer with time. Coming to expect less from the world,\nwe accept limitations that are really self-imposed. We start to bow and\nscrape and apologize for even the simplest of requests. The solution to\nsuch a shrinking of horizons is to deliberately force ourselves in the\nopposite directionto downplay the failures and ignore the limitations,\nto make ourselves demand and expect as much as the child. To\naccomplish this, we must use a particular strategy upon ourselves. Call\nit the Strategy of the Crown.\n\nThe Strategy of the Crown is based on a simple chain of cause\nand effect: If we believe we are destined for great things, our belief\nwill radiate outward, just as a crown creates an aura around a king.\nThis outward radiance will infect the people around us, who will think\nwe must have reasons to feel so confident. People who wear crowns\nseem to feel no inner sense of the limits to what they can ask for or\nwhat they can accomplish. This too radiates outward. Limits and\nboundaries disappear. Use the Strategy of the Crown and you will be\nsurprised how often it bears fruit. Take as an example those happy\nchildren who ask for whatever they want, and get it. Their high\nexpectations are their charm. Adults enjoy granting their wishesjust as\nIsabella enjoyed granting the wishes of Columbus.\n\nThroughout history, people of undistinguished birththe Theodoras\nof Byzantium, the Columbuses, the Beethovens, the Disraelishave\nmanaged to work the Strategy of the Crown, believing so firmly in\ntheir own greatness that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. The trick\nis simple: Be overcome by your self-belief. Even while you know you\nare practicing a kind of deception on yourself, act like a king. You are\nlikely to be treated as one.\n\nThe crown may separate you from other people, but it is up to you\nto make that separation real: You have to act differently, demonstrating\nyour distance from those around you. One way to emphasize your\ndifference is to always act with dignity, no matter the circumstance.\nLouis-Philippe gave no sense of being different from other peoplehe\nwas the banker king. And the moment his subjects threatened him, he\ncaved in. Everyone sensed this and pounced. Lacking regal dignity and\nfirmness of purpose, Louis-Philippe seemed an impostor, and the\ncrown was easily toppled from his head.\n\nRegal bearing should not be confused with arrogance. Arrogance\nmay seem the king's entitlement, but in fact it betrays insecurity. It is\nthe very opposite of a royal demeanor.\n\nHippocleides, climbing on to it, danced first some Laeonian\ndances, next some Attic ones, and ended by standing on his head and\nbeating time with his legs in the air. The Laeonian and Attic dances\nwere bad enough; but Cleisthenes, though he already loathed the\nthought of having a son-in-law like that, nevertheless restrained\nhimself and managed to avoid an outburst; but when he saw\nHippocleides beating time with his legs, he could bear it no longer.\n\u201cSon of Tisander, \u201d he cried, \u201cyou have danced away your marriage. \u201d\n\nthe histories, Herodotus, fifth century b.c.\n\nHaile Selassie, ruler of Ethiopia for forty or so years beginning in\n1930, was once a young man named Lij Tafari. He came from a noble\nfamily, but there was no real chance of him coming to power, for he\nwas far down the line of succession from die king then on the throne,\nMenelik II. Nevertheless, from an early age he exhibited a self-\nconfidence and a royal bearing that surprised everyone around him.\n\nAt the age of fourteen, Tafari went to live at the court, where he\nimmediately impressed Menelik and became his favorite. Tafari's grace\nunder fire, his patience, and his calm self-assurance fascinated the\nking. The other young nobles, arrogant, blustery, and envious, would\npush this slight, bookish teenager around. But he never got angrydiat\nwould have been a sign of insecurity, to which he would not stoop.\nThere were already people around him who felt he would someday rise\nto the top, for he acted as if he were already there.\n\nYears later, in 1936, when the Italian Fascists had taken over\nEthiopia and Tafari, now called Haile Selassie, was in exile, he\n\naddressed the League of Nations to plead his country's case. The\nItalians in the audience heckled him with vulgar abuse, but he\nmaintained his dignified pose, as if completely unaffected. This\nelevated him while making his opponents look even uglier. Dignity, in\nfact, is invariably the mask to assume under difficult circumstances: It\nis as if nothing can affect you, and you have all die time in the world to\nrespond. This is an extremely powerful pose.\n\nA royal demeanor has odier uses. Con artists have long known die\nvalue of an aristocratic front-, it either disarms people and makes them\nless suspicious, or else it intimidates them and puts them on the\ndefensiveand as Count Victor Lustig knew, once you put a sucker on\nthe defensive he is doomed. The con man Yellow Kid Weil, too, would\noften assume die trappings of a man of wealtii, along with die\nnonchalance diat goes with them. Alluding to some magical method of\nmaking money, he would stand aloof, like a king, exuding confidence\nas if he really were fabulously rich. The suckers would beg to be in on\ndie con, to have a chance at die wealth diat he so clearly displayed.\n\nFinally, to reinforce die inner psychological tricks involved in\nprojecting a royal demeanor, diere are outward strategies to help you\ncreate die effect. First, the Columbus Strategy: Always make a bold\ndemand. Set your price high and do not waver. Second, in a dignified\nway, go after the highest person in the building. This immediately puts\nyou on die same plane as the chief executive you are attacking. It is die\nDavid and Goliath Strategy: By choosing a great opponent, you create\nthe appearance of greatness.\n\nThird, give a gift of some sort to diose above you. This is the\nstrategy of those who have a patron: By giving your patron a gift, you\nare essentially saying diat die two of you are equal. It is the old con\ngame of giving so diat you can take. When die Renaissance writer\nRetro Aretino wanted die Duke of Mantua as his next patron, he knew\ndiat if he was slavish and sycophantic, die duke would diink him\nunworthy; so he approached die duke with gifts, in this case paintings\nby the writer's good friend Titian.\n\nAccepting the gifts created a kind of equality between duke and\nwriter: The duke was put at ease by the feeling that he was dealing\nwith a man of his own aristocratic stamp. He funded Aretino\ngenerously. The gift strategy is subde and brilliant because you do not\n\nbeg: You ask for help in a dignified way mat implies equality between\ntwo people, one of whom just happens to have more money.\n\nRemember: It is up to you to set your own price. Ask for less and\nthat is just what you will get. Ask for more, however, and you send a\nsignal diat you are worth a king's ransom. Even those who turn you\ndown respect you for your confidence, and mat respect will eventually\npay off in ways you cannot imagine.\n\nImage: The Crown. Place it upon your head and you assume a\ndifferent posetranquil yet radiating assurance. Never show doubt,\nnever lose your dignity beneath the crown, or it will not fit. It will\nseem to be destined for one more worthy. Do not wait for a coronation;\nthe greatest emperors crown themselves.\n\nAuthority: Everyone should be royal after his own fashion. Let all\nyour actions, even though they are not those of a king, be, in their own\nsphere, worthy of one. Be sublime in your deeds, lofty in your\nthoughts; and in all your doings show that you deserve to be a king\neven though you are not one in reality. (Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nThe idea behind the assumption of regal confidence is to set\nyourself apart from omer people, but if you take this too far it will be\nyour undoing. Never make die mistake of thinking diat you elevate\nyourself by humiliating people. Also, it is never a good idea to loom\ntoo high above the crowdyou make an easy target. And mere are times\nwhen an aristocratic pose is eminently dangerous.\n\nCharles I, king of England during the 1640s, faced a profound\npublic disenchantment with the institution of monarchy. Revolts\nerupted throughout the country, led by Oliver Cromwell. Had Charles\nreacted to the times with insight, supporting reforms and making a\nshow of sacrificing some of his power, history might have been\ndifferent. Instead he reverted to an even more regal pose, seeming\noutraged by the assault on his power and on the divine institution of\nmonarchy. His stiff kingliness offended people and spurred on their\nrevolts. And eventually Charles lost his head, literally. Understand:\nYou are radiating confidence, not arrogance or disdain.\n\nFinally, it is true that you can sometimes find some power\nthrough affecting a kind of earmy vulgarity, which will prove amusing\nby its extremeness. But to the extent that you win this game by going\n\nbeyond the limits, separating yourself from other people by appearing\neven more vulgar than diey are, the game is dangerous: There will\nalways be people more vulgar than you, and you will easily be\nreplaced the following season by someone younger and worse.\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

At the same time\nhe was troubled by the lack of discipline and the overconfidenee of\nthese newly arrived barbarians, who would shout at him to attack the\nenemy and had no patience with his delaying tactics, and he therefore\ntried to win them over by argument. But when he saw that they were\ndiscontented and persisted in pressing their demands regardless of the\ncircumstances, he let them have their way and allowed them to engage\nthe enemy; he hoped that they would suffer a severe defeat without\nbeing completely crushed, and that this would make them better\ndisposed to obey his orders in future. The event tured out as he\nexpected and Serto-rius came to their rescue, provided a rallying point\nfor the fugitives, and led them safely back to his camp. His next step\nwas to revive their dejected spirits, and so a few days later he\nsummoned a general assembly. Before it he produced two horses, one\nof them old and enfeebled, the other large and lusty and\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nStarting out in life as a nondescript French seminary-school\nteacher, Joseph Fouche wandered from town to town for most of the\ndecade of the 1780s, teaching mathematics to young boys. Yet he\nnever completely committed himself to the church, never took his\n\nvows as a priesthe had bigger plans. Patiently waiting for his chance,\nhe kept his options open. And when the French Revolution broke out,\nin 1789, Fouche waited no longer: He got rid of his cassock, grew his\nhair long, and became a revolutionary. For this was the spirit of the\ntimes. To miss the boat at this critical moment could have spelt\ndisaster. Fouche did not miss the boat: Befriending the revolutionary\nleader Robespierre, he quickly rose in the rebel ranks. In 1792 the\ntown of Nantes elected Fouche to be its representative to the National\nConvention (created that year to frame a new constitution for a French\nrepublic).\n\nWhen Fouche arrived in Paris to take his seat at the convention, a\nviolent rift had broken out between die moderates and the radical\nJacobins. Fouche sensed that in the long run neitfier side would\nemerge victorious. Power rarely ends up in the hands of those who\nstart a revolution, or even of tiiose who further it; power sticks to those\nwho bring it to a conclusion. That was the side Fouche wanted to be\non.\n\nHis sense of timing was uncanny. He started as a moderate, for\nmoderates were in the majority. When the time came to decide on\nwhether or not to execute Louis XVI, however, he saw that the people\nwere clamoring for the king's head, so he cast the deciding votefor the\nguillotine. Now he had become a radical. Yet as tensions came to the\nboil in Paris, he foresaw the danger of being too closely associated\nwim any one faction, so he accepted a position in die provinces, where\nhe could lie low for a while. A few months later he was assigned to the\npost of proconsul in Lyons, where he oversaw the execution of dozens\nof aristocrats. At a certain moment, however, he called a halt to the\nkillings, sensing tiiat die mood of the country was turningand despite\nthe blood already on his hands, die citizens of Lyons hailed him as a\nsavior from what had become known as the Terror.\n\nSo far Fouche had played his cards brilliantly, but in 1794 his old\nfriend Robespierre recalled him to Paris to account for his actions in\nLyons. Robespierre had been the driving force behind the Terror. He\nhad sent heads on both the right and the left rolling, and Fouche, whom\nhe no longer trusted, seemed destined to provide the next head. Over\nthe next few weeks, a tense struggle ensued: While Robespierre railed\nopenly against Fouche, accusing of him dangerous ambitions and\n\ncalling for his arrest, the crafty Fouche worked more indirectiy, quietly\ngaining support among those who were beginning to tire of\nRobespierre's dictatorial control. Fouche was playing for time. He\nknew diat the longer he survived, the more disaffected citizens he\ncould rally against Robespierre. He had to have broad support before\nhe moved against the powerful leader. He rallied support among both\nthe moderates and the Jacobins, playing on the widespread fear of\nRobespierreeveryone was afraid of being die next to go to die\nguillotine. It all came to fruition on July 27: The convention\n\nturned against Robespierre, shouting down his usual lengthy\nspeech. He was quickly arrested, and a few days later it was\nRobespierre's head, not Fouche's, that fell into the basket.\n\nWhen Fouche returned to the convention after Robespierre's\ndeath, he played his most unexpected move: Having led the conspiracy\nagainst Robespierre, he was expected to sit with the moderates, but lo\nand behold, he once again changed sides, joining the radical Jacobins.\nFor perhaps the first time in his life he aligned himself with the\nminority. Clearly he sensed a reaction stirring: He knew mat the\nmoderate faction that had executed Robespierre, and was now about to\ntake power, would initiate a new round of the Terror, this time against\nthe radicals. In siding widi the Jacobins, then, Fouche was sitting with\nthe martyrs of the days to comethe people who would be considered\nblameless in the troubles that were on their way. Taking sides with\nwhat was about to become the losing team was a risky gambit, of\ncourse, but Fouche must have calculated he could keep his head long\nenough to quietly stir up the populace against the moderates and watch\nthem fall from power. And indeed, although the moderates did call for\nhis arrest in December of 1795, and would have sent him to the\nguillotine, too much time had passed. The executions had become\nunpopular with the people, and Fouche survived the swing of the\npendulum one more time.\n\nA new government took over, the Directoire. It was not, however,\na Jacobin government, but a moderate onemore moderate dian the\ngovernment that had reimposed the Terror. Fouche, the radical, had\nkept his head, but now he had to keep a low profile. He waited\npatiently on the sidelines for several years, allowing time to soften any\nbitter feelings against him, then he approached the Directoire and\n\n\nconvinced them he had a new passion: intelligence-gathering. He\nbecame a paid spy for the government, excelled at the job, and in 1799\nwas rewarded by being made minister of police. Now he was not just\nempowered but required to extend his spying to every corner of\nFrancea responsibility that would greatly reinforce his natural ability to\nsniff out where die wind was blowing. One of the first social trends he\ndetected, in fact, came in the person of Napoleon, a brash young\ngeneral whose destiny he right away saw was entwined with the future\nof France. When Napoleon unleashed a coup d'etat, on November 9,\n1799, Fouche pretended to be asleep. Indeed he slept the whole day.\nFor this indirect assistanceit might have been tiiought his job, after all,\nto prevent a military coupNapoleon kept him on as minister of police\nin the new regime.\n\nOver the next few years, Napoleon came to rely on Fouche more\nand more. He even gave this former revolutionary a tide, duke of\nOtranto, and rewarded him with great wealth. By 1808, however,\nFouche, always attuned to the times, sensed that Napoleon was on the\ndownswing. His futile war with Spain, a country mat posed no threat\nto France, was a sign that he was losing a sense of proportion. Never\none to be caught on a sinking ship, Fouche conspired with Talleyrand\nto bring about Napoleon's downfall. Al-\n\npossessing a flowing tail, which was remarkable for the thickness\nand beauty of its hair. By the side of the weak horse stood a tall strong\nman, and by the side of the powerful horse a short man of mean\nphysique. At a signal the strong man seized the tail of his horse and\ntried with all his strength to pull it towards him, as if to tear it off while\nthe weak man began to pull the hairs one by one from the tail of the\nstrong horse. The strong man, after tugging with all his might to no\npurpose and causing the spectators a great deal of amusement in the\nprocess, finally gave up the attempt, while the weak man quickly and\nwith very little trouble stripped his horse's tail completely bare. Then\nSertorius rose to his feet and said, \"Now you can see, my friends and\nallies, that perseverance is more effective than brute strength, and that\nthere are many difficulties that cannot be overcome if you try to do\neverything at once, but which will yield if you master them little by\nlittle. The truth is that a steady continuous effort is irresistible, for this\nis the way in which Time captures and subdues the greatest powers on\n\n\nearth. Now Time, you should remember, is a good friend and ally to\n\nthose who use their intelligence to choose the right moment, but a most\n\ndangerous enemy\nto those who rush into action at the wrong one.\"\nlife of sertorius,\nPlutarch,\nc. a.d. 46-120\nMr. Shih had two sons:\none loved learning; the\nother war. The first\nexpounded his moral\nteachings at the\nadmiring court of Ch 'i\nand was made a tutor,\nwhile the second talked\nstrategy at the bellicose\ncourt of Ch 'u and was\nmade a general.

By 1814 Napoleon's power\nhad crumbled and allied forces finally conquered him.\n\nThe next government was a restoration of the monarchy, in the\nform of King Louis XVIII, brother of Louis XVI. Fouche, his nose\nalways sniffing die air for the next social shift, knew Louis would not\nlast longhe had none of Napoleon's flair. Fouche once again played his\nwaiting game, lying low, staying away from the spodight. Sure\nenough, in February of 1815, Napoleon escaped from die island of\nElba, where he had been imprisoned. Louis XVIII panicked: His\npolicies had alienated die citizenry, who were clamoring for\nNapoleon's return. So Louis turned to the one man who could maybe\nhave saved his hide, Fouche, the former radical who had sent his\nbrother, Louis XVI, to die guillotine, but was now one of die most\npopular and widely admired politicians in France. Fouche, however,\nwould not side with a loser: He refused Louis's request for help by\npretending that his help was unnecessaryby swearing that Napoleon\nwould never return to power (although he knew otherwise). A short\ntime later, of course, Napoleon and his new citizen army were closing\nin on Paris.\n\nSeeing his reign about to collapse, feeling that Fouche had\nbetrayed him, and certain that he did not want this powerful and able\n\n\nman on Napoleon's team, King Louis ordered die minister's arrest and\nexecution. On March 16, 1815, policemen surrounded Fouche's coach\non a Paris boulevard. Was this finally his end Perhaps, but not\nimmediately: Fouche told the police that an ex-member of government\ncould not be arrested on the street. They fell for the story and allowed\nhim to return home. Later that day, though, they came to his house and\nonce again declared him under arrest. Fouche noddedbut would the\nofficers be so kind as allow a gentieman to wash and to change his\nclothes before leaving his house for the last time They gave tiieir\npermission, Fouche left the room, and the minutes went by. Fouche did\nnot return. Finally the policemen went into the next roomwhere they\nsaw a ladder against an open window, leading down to the garden\nbelow.\n\nThat day and the next the police combed Paris for Fouche, but by\nmen Napoleon's cannons were audible in the distance and die king and\nall the king's men had to flee the city. As soon as Napoleon entered\nParis, Fouche came out of hiding. He had cheated the executioner once\nagain. Napoleon greeted his former minister of police and gladly\nrestored him to his old post. During the 100 days diat Napoleon\nremained in power, until Waterloo, it was essentially Fouche who\ngoverned France. After Napoleon fell, Louis XVIII returned to the\nthrone, and like a cat with nine lives, Fouche stayed on to serve in yet\nanother governmentby tiien his power and influence had grown so\ngreat that not even the king dared challenge him.\n\nInterpretation\n\nIn a period of unprecedented turmoil, Joseph Fouche thrived\nthrough his\n\nmastery of the art of timing. He teaches us a number of key\nlessons.\n\nFirst, it is critical to recognize the spirit of the times. Fouche\nalways looked two steps ahead, found the wave mat would carry him\nto power, and rode it. You must always work with the times, anticipate\ntwists and turns, and never miss the boat. Sometimes the spirit of the\ntimes is obscure: Recognize it not by what is loudest and most obvious\nin it, but by what lies hidden and dormant. Look forward to the\nNapoleons of the future rather than holding on to the ruins of the past.\n\neee ERRNO a eres rrr ee ee\nmean running with them. Any potent social movement creates a\npowerful reaction, and it is wise to anticipate what that reaction will\nbe, as Fouche did after the execution of Robespierre. Rather than ride\nthe cresting wave of the moment, wait for the tide's ebb to carry you\nback to power. Upon occasion bet on the reaction that is brewing, and\nplace yourself in the vanguard of it.\nFinally, Fouche had remarkable patience. Without patience as\nyour sword and shield, your timing will fail and you will inevitably\n\u2018ind yourself a loser. When the times were against Fouche, he did not\nstruggle, get emotional, or strike out rashly. He kept his cool and\nmaintained a low profile, patiendy building support among the\ncitizenry, the bulwark in his next rise to power. Whenever he found\nhimself in the weaker position, he played for time, which he knew\nwould always be his ally if he was patient. Recognize the moment,\nthen, to hide in die grass or slither under a rock, as well as the moment\nto bare your fangs and attack.\n\nSpace we can recover, time never. Napoleon Bonaparte, 1769-\n1821\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nTime is an artificial concept diat we ourselves have created to\nmake the limidessness of eternity and die universe more bearable,\nmore human. Since we have constructed the concept of time, we are\nalso able to mold it to some degree, to play tricks with it. The time of a\nchild is long and slow, with vast expanses; the time of an adult whizzes\nby frighteningly fast. Time, then, depends on perception, which, we\nknow, can be willfully altered. This is die first thing to understand in\nmastering the art of timing. If the inner turmoil caused by our emotions\ntends to make time move faster, it follows that once we control our\nemotional responses to events, time will move much more slowly. This\naltered way of dealing witii tilings tends to lengdien our perception of\nfuture time, opens up possibilities that fear and anger close off, and\nallows us the patience tiiat is the principal requirement in the art of\ntiming.\n\nThere are three kinds of time for us to deal with; each presents\nproblems that can be solved with skill and practice. First there is long\ntime: the drawn-out, years-long kind of time that must be managed\n\n\nwith patience and gentle guidance. Our handling of long time should\nbe mosdy defensivethis is die art of not reacting impulsively, of\nwaiting for opportunity.\n\nwe shall be in trouble.\" So he had the fellow's feet cut off. Both\nfamilies did exactly the same thing, but one timed it right, the other\nwrong. Thus success depends on ... rhythm.\n\nLIEH TZU, QUOTED IN THE CHINESE LOOKING GLASS,\n\nDennis Bloodworth, 1967\n\nThe sultan [of Persia] had sentenced two men to death. One of\nthem, knowing how much the sultan loved his stallion, offered to teach\nthe horse to fly within a year in return for his life. The sultan, fancying\nhimself as the rider of the only flying horse in the world, agreed. The\nother prisoner looked at his friend in disbelief. \u201cYou know horses don\n'tfly. What made you come up with a crazy idea like that You're only\npostponing the inevitable.\u201d \u201cNot so,\u201d said the [first prisoner]. \u201cI have\nactually given myself four chances for freedom. First, the sultan might\ndie during the year. Second, I might die. Third, the horse might die.\nAnd fourth ... I might teach the horse to fly!\u201d\n\nthe craft of power.\n\nR.G. H. Siu,\n\nA fisherman in the month of May stood angling on the bank of\nthe Thames with an artificial fly. He threw his bait with so much art,\nthat a young trout was rushing toward it, when she was prevented by\nher mother. \u201cNever, \u201d said she, \u201cmy child, be too precipitate, where\nthere is a possibility of danger. Take due time to consider, before you\nrisk an action that may be fatal. How know you whether yon\nappearance be indeed a fly, or the snare of an enemy Let someone else\nmake the experiment before you. If it be a fly, he will very probably\nelude the first attack: and the second may be made, if not with success,\nat least with safety.\u201d She had no sooner spoken, than a gudgeon seized\nthe pretended fly, and became an example to the giddy daughter of the\nimportance of her mother's counsel.\n\nFABLES,\n\nRobert Dodsley, 1703-1764\n\nNext there is forced time: the short-term time that we can\nmanipulate as an offensive weapon, upsetting the timing of our\nopponents. Finally there is end time, when a plan must be executed\n\nwith speed and force. We have waited, found the moment, and must\nnot hesitate.\n\nLong Time. The famous seventeenth-century Ming painter Chou\nYung relates a story that altered his behavior forever. Late one winter\nafternoon he set out to visit a town that lay across die river from his\nown town. He was bringing some important books and papers with\nhim and had commissioned a young boy to help him carry them. As\ntile ferry neared the other side of the river, Chou Yung asked the\nboatman if they would have time to get to the town before its gates\nclosed, since it was a mile away and night was approaching. The\nboatman glanced at the boy, and at the bundle of loosely tied papers\nand books\u201cYes,\u201d he replied, \u201cif you do not walk too fast.\u201d\n\nAs they started out, however, the sun was setting. Afraid of being\nlocked out of the town at night, prey to local bandits, Chou and the boy\nwalked faster and faster, finally breaking into a run. Suddenly the\nstring around the papers broke and the documents scattered on the\nground. It took them many minutes to put the packet together again,\nand by the time they had reached the city gates, it was too late.\n\nWhen you force the pace out of fear and impatience, you create a\nnest of problems that require fixing, and you end up taking much\nlonger than if you had taken your time. Hurriers may occasionally get\nthere quicker, but papers fly everywhere, new dangers arise, and they\nfind themselves in constant crisis mode, fixing the problems that they\nthemselves have created. Sometimes not acting in the face of danger is\nyour best moveyou wait, you deliberately slow down. As time passes it\nwill eventually present opportunities you had not imagined.\n\nWaiting involves controlling not only your own emotions but\nthose of your colleagues, who, mistaking action for power, may try to\npush you into making rash moves. In your rivals, on the other hand,\nyou can encourage this same mistake: If you let them rush headlong\ninto trouble while you stand back and wait, you will soon find ripe\nmoments to intervene and pick up the pieces. This wise policy was the\nprincipal strategy of the great early-seventeenth-century emperor\nTokugawa Ieyasu of Japan. When his predecessor, the headstrong\nHideyoshi, whom he served as a general, staged a rash invasion of\nKorea, Ieyasu did not involve himself. He knew the invasion would be\na disaster and would lead to Hideyoshi's downfall. Better to stand\n\npatientiy on the sidelines, even for many years, and men be in position\nto seize power when the time is rightexactly what Ieyasu did, with\ngreat artistry.\n\nYou do not deliberately slow time down to live longer, or to take\nmore pleasure in the moment, but the better to play the game of power.\nFirst, when your mind is uncluttered by constant emergencies you will\nsee further into the future. Second, you will be able to resist the baits\nthat people\n\ndangle in front of you, and will keep yourself from becoming\nanother impatient sucker. Third, you will have more room to be\nflexible. Opportunities will inevitably arise that you had not expected\nand would have missed had you forced the pace. Fourth, you will not\nmove from one deal to the next without completing die first one. To\nbuild your power's foundation can take years; make sure that\nfoundation is secure. Do not be a flash in the pansuccess that is built\nup slowly and surely is the only kind that lasts.\n\nFinally, slowing time down will give you a perspective on the\ntimes you live in, letting you take a certain distance and putting you in\na less emotionally charged position to see the shapes of things to come.\nHurriers will often mistake surface phenomena for a real trend, seeing\nonly what they want to see. How much better to see what is really\nhappening, even if it is unpleasant or makes your task harder.\n\nForced Time. The trick in forcing time is to upset the timing of\nothersto make them hurry, to make diem wait, to make diem abandon\ntheir own pace, to distort dieir perception of time. By upsetting the\ntiming of your opponent while you stay patient, you open up time for\nyourself, which is half the game.\n\nIn 1473 the great Turkish sultan Mehmed the Conqueror invited\nnegotiations with Hungary to end the off-and-on war the two countries\nhad waged for years. When the Hungarian emissary arrived in Turkey\nto start the talks, Turkish officials humbly apologizedMehmed had just\nleft Istanbul, the capital, to battie his longtime foe, Uzun Hasan. But he\nurgently wanted peace with Hungary, and had asked that die emissary\njoin him at the front.\n\nWhen the emissary arrived at die site of die fighting, Mehmed\nhad already left it, moving eastward in pursuit of his swift foe. This\nhappened several times. Wherever the emissary stopped, the Turks\n\nlavished gifts and banquets on him, in pleasurable but time-consuming\nceremonies. Finally Mehmed defeated Uzun and met witii die\nemissary. Yet his terms for peace widi Hungary were excessively\nharsh. After a few days, the negotiations ended, and the usual\nstalemate remained in place. But this was fine widi Mehmed. In fact he\nhad planned it diat way all along: Plotting his campaign against Uzun,\nhe had seen tiiat diverting his armies to die east would leave his\nwestern flank vulnerable. To prevent Hungary from taking advantage\nof his weakness and his preoccupation elsewhere, he first dangled the\nlure of peace before his enemy, dien made them waitall on his own\nterms.\n\nMaking people wait is a powerful way of forcing time, as long as\ntiiey do not figure out what you are up to. You control the clock, they\nlinger in limboand rapidly come unglued, opening up opportunities for\nyou to strike. The opposite effect is equally powerful: You make your\nopponents hurry. Start off your dealings with diem slowly, dien\nsuddenly apply pressure, making diem feel tiiat everydiing is\nhappening at once. People who lack the time to think will make\nmistakesso set their deadlines for them.\n\nThis was the technique Machiavelli admired in Cesare Borgia,\nwho, during negotiations, would suddenly press vehementiy for a\ndecision, upsetting his opponent's timing and patience. For who would\ndare make Cesare wait\n\nJoseph Duveen, the famous art dealer, knew that if he gave an\nindecisive buyer like John D. Rockefeller a deadlinethe painting had to\nleave the country, another tycoon was interested in itdie client would\nbuy just in time. Freud noticed that patients who had spent years in\npsychoanalysis without improvement would miraculously recover just\nin time if he fixed a definite date for the end of the therapy. Jacques\nLacan, the famous French psychoanalyst, used a variation on this\ntactiche would sometimes end the customary hour session of therapy\nafter only ten minutes, without warning. After this happened several\ntimes, the patient would realize that he had better make maximum use\nof the time, rather than wasting much of the hour with a lot of talk that\nmeant nothing. The deadline, then, is a powerful tool. Close off the\nvistas of indecision and force people to make up their damn minds or\n\nget to the pointnever let them make you play on their excruciating\nterms. Never give them time.\n\nMagicians and showmen are experts in forcing time. Houdini\ncould often wriggle free of handcuffs in minutes, but he would draw\nthe escape out to an hour, making the audience sweat, as time came to\nan apparent standstill. Magicians have always known that the best way\nto alter our perception of time is often to slow down the pace. Creating\nsuspense brings time to a terrifying pause: The slower the magician's\nhands move, the easier it is to create the illusion of speed, making\npeople think the rabbit has appeared instantaneously. The great\nnineteenth-century magician Jean-Eugene Robert-Houdin took explicit\nnotice of this effect: \u201cThe more slowly a story is told,\u201d he said, \u201cthe\nshorter it seems.\u201d\n\nGoing slower also makes what you are doing more interestingthe\naudience yields to your pace, becomes entranced. It is a state in which\ntime whizzes delightfully by. You must practice such illusions, which\nshare in the hypnotist's power to alter perceptions of time.\n\nEnd Time. You can play the game with die utmost artistrywaiting\npatiently for the right moment to act, putting your competitors off their\nform by messing with their timingbut it won't mean a thing unless you\nknow how to finish. Do not be one of those people who look like\nparagons of patience but are actually just afraid to bring things to a\nclose: Patience is worthless unless combined with a willingness to fall\nruthlessly on your opponent at the right moment. You can wait as long\nas necessary for the conclusion to come, but when it comes it must\ncome quickly. Use speed to paralyze your opponent, cover up any\nmistakes you might make, and impress people with your aura of\nauthority and finality.\n\nWith the patience of a snake charmer, you draw the snake out\nwith calm and steady rhythms. Once the snake is out, though, would\nyou dangle your foot above its deadly head There is never a good\nreason to allow the\n\nslightest hitch in your endgame. Your mastery of timing can really\nonly be judged by how you work with end timehow you quickly\nchange the pace and bring things to a swift and definitive conclusion.\n\nImage: The Hawk.

At the same time\nhe was troubled by the lack of discipline and the overconfidenee of\nthese newly arrived barbarians, who would shout at him to attack the\nenemy and had no patience with his delaying tactics, and he therefore\ntried to win them over by argument. But when he saw that they were\ndiscontented and persisted in pressing their demands regardless of the\ncircumstances, he let them have their way and allowed them to engage\nthe enemy; he hoped that they would suffer a severe defeat without\nbeing completely crushed, and that this would make them better\ndisposed to obey his orders in future. The event tured out as he\nexpected and Serto-rius came to their rescue, provided a rallying point\nfor the fugitives, and led them safely back to his camp.

Before it he produced two horses, one\nof them old and enfeebled, the other large and lusty and\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nStarting out in life as a nondescript French seminary-school\nteacher, Joseph Fouche wandered from town to town for most of the\ndecade of the 1780s, teaching mathematics to young boys. Yet he\nnever completely committed himself to the church, never took his\n\nvows as a priesthe had bigger plans. Patiently waiting for his chance,\nhe kept his options open. And when the French Revolution broke out,\nin 1789, Fouche waited no longer: He got rid of his cassock, grew his\nhair long, and became a revolutionary. For this was the spirit of the\ntimes. To miss the boat at this critical moment could have spelt\ndisaster. Fouche did not miss the boat: Befriending the revolutionary\nleader Robespierre, he quickly rose in the rebel ranks. In 1792 the\ntown of Nantes elected Fouche to be its representative to the National\nConvention (created that year to frame a new constitution for a French\nrepublic).\n\nWhen Fouche arrived in Paris to take his seat at the convention, a\nviolent rift had broken out between die moderates and the radical\nJacobins. Fouche sensed that in the long run neitfier side would\nemerge victorious. Power rarely ends up in the hands of those who\nstart a revolution, or even of tiiose who further it; power sticks to those\nwho bring it to a conclusion. That was the side Fouche wanted to be\non.\n\nHis sense of timing was uncanny. He started as a moderate, for\nmoderates were in the majority. When the time came to decide on\nwhether or not to execute Louis XVI, however, he saw that the people\nwere clamoring for the king's head, so he cast the deciding votefor the\nguillotine. Now he had become a radical. Yet as tensions came to the\nboil in Paris, he foresaw the danger of being too closely associated\nwim any one faction, so he accepted a position in die provinces, where\nhe could lie low for a while. A few months later he was assigned to the\npost of proconsul in Lyons, where he oversaw the execution of dozens\nof aristocrats. At a certain moment, however, he called a halt to the\nkillings, sensing tiiat die mood of the country was turningand despite\nthe blood already on his hands, die citizens of Lyons hailed him as a\nsavior from what had become known as the Terror.\n\nSo far Fouche had played his cards brilliantly, but in 1794 his old\nfriend Robespierre recalled him to Paris to account for his actions in\nLyons. Robespierre had been the driving force behind the Terror. He\nhad sent heads on both the right and the left rolling, and Fouche, whom\nhe no longer trusted, seemed destined to provide the next head. Over\nthe next few weeks, a tense struggle ensued: While Robespierre railed\nopenly against Fouche, accusing of him dangerous ambitions and\n\ncalling for his arrest, the crafty Fouche worked more indirectiy, quietly\ngaining support among those who were beginning to tire of\nRobespierre's dictatorial control. Fouche was playing for time. He\nknew diat the longer he survived, the more disaffected citizens he\ncould rally against Robespierre. He had to have broad support before\nhe moved against the powerful leader. He rallied support among both\nthe moderates and the Jacobins, playing on the widespread fear of\nRobespierreeveryone was afraid of being die next to go to die\nguillotine. It all came to fruition on July 27: The convention\n\nturned against Robespierre, shouting down his usual lengthy\nspeech. He was quickly arrested, and a few days later it was\nRobespierre's head, not Fouche's, that fell into the basket.\n\nWhen Fouche returned to the convention after Robespierre's\ndeath, he played his most unexpected move: Having led the conspiracy\nagainst Robespierre, he was expected to sit with the moderates, but lo\nand behold, he once again changed sides, joining the radical Jacobins.\nFor perhaps the first time in his life he aligned himself with the\nminority. Clearly he sensed a reaction stirring: He knew mat the\nmoderate faction that had executed Robespierre, and was now about to\ntake power, would initiate a new round of the Terror, this time against\nthe radicals. In siding widi the Jacobins, then, Fouche was sitting with\nthe martyrs of the days to comethe people who would be considered\nblameless in the troubles that were on their way. Taking sides with\nwhat was about to become the losing team was a risky gambit, of\ncourse, but Fouche must have calculated he could keep his head long\nenough to quietly stir up the populace against the moderates and watch\nthem fall from power. And indeed, although the moderates did call for\nhis arrest in December of 1795, and would have sent him to the\nguillotine, too much time had passed. The executions had become\nunpopular with the people, and Fouche survived the swing of the\npendulum one more time.\n\nA new government took over, the Directoire. It was not, however,\na Jacobin government, but a moderate onemore moderate dian the\ngovernment that had reimposed the Terror. Fouche, the radical, had\nkept his head, but now he had to keep a low profile. He waited\npatiently on the sidelines for several years, allowing time to soften any\nbitter feelings against him, then he approached the Directoire and\n\n\nconvinced them he had a new passion: intelligence-gathering. He\nbecame a paid spy for the government, excelled at the job, and in 1799\nwas rewarded by being made minister of police. Now he was not just\nempowered but required to extend his spying to every corner of\nFrancea responsibility that would greatly reinforce his natural ability to\nsniff out where die wind was blowing. One of the first social trends he\ndetected, in fact, came in the person of Napoleon, a brash young\ngeneral whose destiny he right away saw was entwined with the future\nof France. When Napoleon unleashed a coup d'etat, on November 9,\n1799, Fouche pretended to be asleep. Indeed he slept the whole day.\nFor this indirect assistanceit might have been tiiought his job, after all,\nto prevent a military coupNapoleon kept him on as minister of police\nin the new regime.\n\nOver the next few years, Napoleon came to rely on Fouche more\nand more. He even gave this former revolutionary a tide, duke of\nOtranto, and rewarded him with great wealth. By 1808, however,\nFouche, always attuned to the times, sensed that Napoleon was on the\ndownswing. His futile war with Spain, a country mat posed no threat\nto France, was a sign that he was losing a sense of proportion. Never\none to be caught on a sinking ship, Fouche conspired with Talleyrand\nto bring about Napoleon's downfall. Al-\n\npossessing a flowing tail, which was remarkable for the thickness\nand beauty of its hair. By the side of the weak horse stood a tall strong\nman, and by the side of the powerful horse a short man of mean\nphysique. At a signal the strong man seized the tail of his horse and\ntried with all his strength to pull it towards him, as if to tear it off while\nthe weak man began to pull the hairs one by one from the tail of the\nstrong horse. The strong man, after tugging with all his might to no\npurpose and causing the spectators a great deal of amusement in the\nprocess, finally gave up the attempt, while the weak man quickly and\nwith very little trouble stripped his horse's tail completely bare. Then\nSertorius rose to his feet and said, \"Now you can see, my friends and\nallies, that perseverance is more effective than brute strength, and that\nthere are many difficulties that cannot be overcome if you try to do\neverything at once, but which will yield if you master them little by\nlittle. The truth is that a steady continuous effort is irresistible, for this\nis the way in which Time captures and subdues the greatest powers on\n\n\nearth. Now Time, you should remember, is a good friend and ally to\n\nthose who use their intelligence to choose the right moment, but a most\n\ndangerous enemy\nto those who rush into action at the wrong one.\"\nlife of sertorius,\nPlutarch,\nc. a.d. 46-120\nMr. Shih had two sons:\none loved learning; the\nother war.

By 1814 Napoleon's power\nhad crumbled and allied forces finally conquered him.\n\nThe next government was a restoration of the monarchy, in the\nform of King Louis XVIII, brother of Louis XVI. Fouche, his nose\nalways sniffing die air for the next social shift, knew Louis would not\nlast longhe had none of Napoleon's flair. Fouche once again played his\nwaiting game, lying low, staying away from the spodight. Sure\nenough, in February of 1815, Napoleon escaped from die island of\nElba, where he had been imprisoned. Louis XVIII panicked: His\npolicies had alienated die citizenry, who were clamoring for\nNapoleon's return. So Louis turned to the one man who could maybe\nhave saved his hide, Fouche, the former radical who had sent his\nbrother, Louis XVI, to die guillotine, but was now one of die most\npopular and widely admired politicians in France. Fouche, however,\nwould not side with a loser: He refused Louis's request for help by\npretending that his help was unnecessaryby swearing that Napoleon\nwould never return to power (although he knew otherwise). A short\ntime later, of course, Napoleon and his new citizen army were closing\nin on Paris.\n\nSeeing his reign about to collapse, feeling that Fouche had\nbetrayed him, and certain that he did not want this powerful and able\n\n\nman on Napoleon's team, King Louis ordered die minister's arrest and\nexecution. On March 16, 1815, policemen surrounded Fouche's coach\non a Paris boulevard. Was this finally his end Perhaps, but not\nimmediately: Fouche told the police that an ex-member of government\ncould not be arrested on the street. They fell for the story and allowed\nhim to return home. Later that day, though, they came to his house and\nonce again declared him under arrest. Fouche noddedbut would the\nofficers be so kind as allow a gentieman to wash and to change his\nclothes before leaving his house for the last time They gave tiieir\npermission, Fouche left the room, and the minutes went by. Fouche did\nnot return. Finally the policemen went into the next roomwhere they\nsaw a ladder against an open window, leading down to the garden\nbelow.\n\nThat day and the next the police combed Paris for Fouche, but by\nmen Napoleon's cannons were audible in the distance and die king and\nall the king's men had to flee the city. As soon as Napoleon entered\nParis, Fouche came out of hiding. He had cheated the executioner once\nagain. Napoleon greeted his former minister of police and gladly\nrestored him to his old post. During the 100 days diat Napoleon\nremained in power, until Waterloo, it was essentially Fouche who\ngoverned France. After Napoleon fell, Louis XVIII returned to the\nthrone, and like a cat with nine lives, Fouche stayed on to serve in yet\nanother governmentby tiien his power and influence had grown so\ngreat that not even the king dared challenge him.\n\nInterpretation\n\nIn a period of unprecedented turmoil, Joseph Fouche thrived\nthrough his\n\nmastery of the art of timing. He teaches us a number of key\nlessons.\n\nFirst, it is critical to recognize the spirit of the times. Fouche\nalways looked two steps ahead, found the wave mat would carry him\nto power, and rode it. You must always work with the times, anticipate\ntwists and turns, and never miss the boat. Sometimes the spirit of the\ntimes is obscure: Recognize it not by what is loudest and most obvious\nin it, but by what lies hidden and dormant. Look forward to the\nNapoleons of the future rather than holding on to the ruins of the past.\n\neee ERRNO a eres rrr ee ee\nmean running with them. Any potent social movement creates a\npowerful reaction, and it is wise to anticipate what that reaction will\nbe, as Fouche did after the execution of Robespierre. Rather than ride\nthe cresting wave of the moment, wait for the tide's ebb to carry you\nback to power. Upon occasion bet on the reaction that is brewing, and\nplace yourself in the vanguard of it.\nFinally, Fouche had remarkable patience. Without patience as\nyour sword and shield, your timing will fail and you will inevitably\n\u2018ind yourself a loser. When the times were against Fouche, he did not\nstruggle, get emotional, or strike out rashly. He kept his cool and\nmaintained a low profile, patiendy building support among the\ncitizenry, the bulwark in his next rise to power. Whenever he found\nhimself in the weaker position, he played for time, which he knew\nwould always be his ally if he was patient. Recognize the moment,\nthen, to hide in die grass or slither under a rock, as well as the moment\nto bare your fangs and attack.\n\nSpace we can recover, time never. Napoleon Bonaparte, 1769-\n1821\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nTime is an artificial concept diat we ourselves have created to\nmake the limidessness of eternity and die universe more bearable,\nmore human. Since we have constructed the concept of time, we are\nalso able to mold it to some degree, to play tricks with it. The time of a\nchild is long and slow, with vast expanses; the time of an adult whizzes\nby frighteningly fast. Time, then, depends on perception, which, we\nknow, can be willfully altered. This is die first thing to understand in\nmastering the art of timing. If the inner turmoil caused by our emotions\ntends to make time move faster, it follows that once we control our\nemotional responses to events, time will move much more slowly. This\naltered way of dealing witii tilings tends to lengdien our perception of\nfuture time, opens up possibilities that fear and anger close off, and\nallows us the patience tiiat is the principal requirement in the art of\ntiming.\n\nThere are three kinds of time for us to deal with; each presents\nproblems that can be solved with skill and practice. First there is long\ntime: the drawn-out, years-long kind of time that must be managed\n\n\nwith patience and gentle guidance. Our handling of long time should\nbe mosdy defensivethis is die art of not reacting impulsively, of\nwaiting for opportunity.\n\nwe shall be in trouble.\" So he had the fellow's feet cut off. Both\nfamilies did exactly the same thing, but one timed it right, the other\nwrong. Thus success depends on ... rhythm.\n\nLIEH TZU, QUOTED IN THE CHINESE LOOKING GLASS,\n\nDennis Bloodworth, 1967\n\nThe sultan [of Persia] had sentenced two men to death. One of\nthem, knowing how much the sultan loved his stallion, offered to teach\nthe horse to fly within a year in return for his life.

What made you come up with a crazy idea like that You're only\npostponing the inevitable.\u201d \u201cNot so,\u201d said the [first prisoner]. \u201cI have\nactually given myself four chances for freedom. First, the sultan might\ndie during the year. Second, I might die. Third, the horse might die.\nAnd fourth ... I might teach the horse to fly!\u201d\n\nthe craft of power.\n\nR.G. H. Siu,\n\nA fisherman in the month of May stood angling on the bank of\nthe Thames with an artificial fly. He threw his bait with so much art,\nthat a young trout was rushing toward it, when she was prevented by\nher mother. \u201cNever, \u201d said she, \u201cmy child, be too precipitate, where\nthere is a possibility of danger. Take due time to consider, before you\nrisk an action that may be fatal. How know you whether yon\nappearance be indeed a fly, or the snare of an enemy Let someone else\nmake the experiment before you. If it be a fly, he will very probably\nelude the first attack: and the second may be made, if not with success,\nat least with safety.\u201d She had no sooner spoken, than a gudgeon seized\nthe pretended fly, and became an example to the giddy daughter of the\nimportance of her mother's counsel.\n\nFABLES,\n\nRobert Dodsley, 1703-1764\n\nNext there is forced time: the short-term time that we can\nmanipulate as an offensive weapon, upsetting the timing of our\nopponents. Finally there is end time, when a plan must be executed\n\nwith speed and force. We have waited, found the moment, and must\nnot hesitate.\n\nLong Time. The famous seventeenth-century Ming painter Chou\nYung relates a story that altered his behavior forever. Late one winter\nafternoon he set out to visit a town that lay across die river from his\nown town. He was bringing some important books and papers with\nhim and had commissioned a young boy to help him carry them. As\ntile ferry neared the other side of the river, Chou Yung asked the\nboatman if they would have time to get to the town before its gates\nclosed, since it was a mile away and night was approaching. The\nboatman glanced at the boy, and at the bundle of loosely tied papers\nand books\u201cYes,\u201d he replied, \u201cif you do not walk too fast.\u201d\n\nAs they started out, however, the sun was setting. Afraid of being\nlocked out of the town at night, prey to local bandits, Chou and the boy\nwalked faster and faster, finally breaking into a run. Suddenly the\nstring around the papers broke and the documents scattered on the\nground. It took them many minutes to put the packet together again,\nand by the time they had reached the city gates, it was too late.\n\nWhen you force the pace out of fear and impatience, you create a\nnest of problems that require fixing, and you end up taking much\nlonger than if you had taken your time. Hurriers may occasionally get\nthere quicker, but papers fly everywhere, new dangers arise, and they\nfind themselves in constant crisis mode, fixing the problems that they\nthemselves have created. Sometimes not acting in the face of danger is\nyour best moveyou wait, you deliberately slow down. As time passes it\nwill eventually present opportunities you had not imagined.\n\nWaiting involves controlling not only your own emotions but\nthose of your colleagues, who, mistaking action for power, may try to\npush you into making rash moves. In your rivals, on the other hand,\nyou can encourage this same mistake: If you let them rush headlong\ninto trouble while you stand back and wait, you will soon find ripe\nmoments to intervene and pick up the pieces. This wise policy was the\nprincipal strategy of the great early-seventeenth-century emperor\nTokugawa Ieyasu of Japan. When his predecessor, the headstrong\nHideyoshi, whom he served as a general, staged a rash invasion of\nKorea, Ieyasu did not involve himself. He knew the invasion would be\na disaster and would lead to Hideyoshi's downfall. Better to stand\n\npatientiy on the sidelines, even for many years, and men be in position\nto seize power when the time is rightexactly what Ieyasu did, with\ngreat artistry.\n\nYou do not deliberately slow time down to live longer, or to take\nmore pleasure in the moment, but the better to play the game of power.\nFirst, when your mind is uncluttered by constant emergencies you will\nsee further into the future. Second, you will be able to resist the baits\nthat people\n\ndangle in front of you, and will keep yourself from becoming\nanother impatient sucker. Third, you will have more room to be\nflexible. Opportunities will inevitably arise that you had not expected\nand would have missed had you forced the pace. Fourth, you will not\nmove from one deal to the next without completing die first one. To\nbuild your power's foundation can take years; make sure that\nfoundation is secure. Do not be a flash in the pansuccess that is built\nup slowly and surely is the only kind that lasts.\n\nFinally, slowing time down will give you a perspective on the\ntimes you live in, letting you take a certain distance and putting you in\na less emotionally charged position to see the shapes of things to come.\nHurriers will often mistake surface phenomena for a real trend, seeing\nonly what they want to see. How much better to see what is really\nhappening, even if it is unpleasant or makes your task harder.\n\nForced Time. The trick in forcing time is to upset the timing of\nothersto make them hurry, to make diem wait, to make diem abandon\ntheir own pace, to distort dieir perception of time. By upsetting the\ntiming of your opponent while you stay patient, you open up time for\nyourself, which is half the game.\n\nIn 1473 the great Turkish sultan Mehmed the Conqueror invited\nnegotiations with Hungary to end the off-and-on war the two countries\nhad waged for years. When the Hungarian emissary arrived in Turkey\nto start the talks, Turkish officials humbly apologizedMehmed had just\nleft Istanbul, the capital, to battie his longtime foe, Uzun Hasan. But he\nurgently wanted peace with Hungary, and had asked that die emissary\njoin him at the front.\n\nWhen the emissary arrived at die site of die fighting, Mehmed\nhad already left it, moving eastward in pursuit of his swift foe. This\nhappened several times. Wherever the emissary stopped, the Turks\n\nlavished gifts and banquets on him, in pleasurable but time-consuming\nceremonies. Finally Mehmed defeated Uzun and met witii die\nemissary. Yet his terms for peace widi Hungary were excessively\nharsh. After a few days, the negotiations ended, and the usual\nstalemate remained in place. But this was fine widi Mehmed. In fact he\nhad planned it diat way all along: Plotting his campaign against Uzun,\nhe had seen tiiat diverting his armies to die east would leave his\nwestern flank vulnerable. To prevent Hungary from taking advantage\nof his weakness and his preoccupation elsewhere, he first dangled the\nlure of peace before his enemy, dien made them waitall on his own\nterms.\n\nMaking people wait is a powerful way of forcing time, as long as\ntiiey do not figure out what you are up to. You control the clock, they\nlinger in limboand rapidly come unglued, opening up opportunities for\nyou to strike. The opposite effect is equally powerful: You make your\nopponents hurry. Start off your dealings with diem slowly, dien\nsuddenly apply pressure, making diem feel tiiat everydiing is\nhappening at once. People who lack the time to think will make\nmistakesso set their deadlines for them.\n\nThis was the technique Machiavelli admired in Cesare Borgia,\nwho, during negotiations, would suddenly press vehementiy for a\ndecision, upsetting his opponent's timing and patience. For who would\ndare make Cesare wait\n\nJoseph Duveen, the famous art dealer, knew that if he gave an\nindecisive buyer like John D. Rockefeller a deadlinethe painting had to\nleave the country, another tycoon was interested in itdie client would\nbuy just in time. Freud noticed that patients who had spent years in\npsychoanalysis without improvement would miraculously recover just\nin time if he fixed a definite date for the end of the therapy. Jacques\nLacan, the famous French psychoanalyst, used a variation on this\ntactiche would sometimes end the customary hour session of therapy\nafter only ten minutes, without warning. After this happened several\ntimes, the patient would realize that he had better make maximum use\nof the time, rather than wasting much of the hour with a lot of talk that\nmeant nothing. The deadline, then, is a powerful tool. Close off the\nvistas of indecision and force people to make up their damn minds or\n\nget to the pointnever let them make you play on their excruciating\nterms. Never give them time.\n\nMagicians and showmen are experts in forcing time. Houdini\ncould often wriggle free of handcuffs in minutes, but he would draw\nthe escape out to an hour, making the audience sweat, as time came to\nan apparent standstill. Magicians have always known that the best way\nto alter our perception of time is often to slow down the pace. Creating\nsuspense brings time to a terrifying pause: The slower the magician's\nhands move, the easier it is to create the illusion of speed, making\npeople think the rabbit has appeared instantaneously. The great\nnineteenth-century magician Jean-Eugene Robert-Houdin took explicit\nnotice of this effect: \u201cThe more slowly a story is told,\u201d he said, \u201cthe\nshorter it seems.\u201d\n\nGoing slower also makes what you are doing more interestingthe\naudience yields to your pace, becomes entranced. It is a state in which\ntime whizzes delightfully by. You must practice such illusions, which\nshare in the hypnotist's power to alter perceptions of time.\n\nEnd Time. You can play the game with die utmost artistrywaiting\npatiently for the right moment to act, putting your competitors off their\nform by messing with their timingbut it won't mean a thing unless you\nknow how to finish. Do not be one of those people who look like\nparagons of patience but are actually just afraid to bring things to a\nclose: Patience is worthless unless combined with a willingness to fall\nruthlessly on your opponent at the right moment. You can wait as long\nas necessary for the conclusion to come, but when it comes it must\ncome quickly. Use speed to paralyze your opponent, cover up any\nmistakes you might make, and impress people with your aura of\nauthority and finality.\n\nWith the patience of a snake charmer, you draw the snake out\nwith calm and steady rhythms. Once the snake is out, though, would\nyou dangle your foot above its deadly head There is never a good\nreason to allow the\n\nslightest hitch in your endgame. Your mastery of timing can really\nonly be judged by how you work with end timehow you quickly\nchange the pace and bring things to a swift and definitive conclusion.\n\nImage: The Hawk.

The original text is: 'DISDAIN THINGS YOU CANNOT HAVE: IGNORING THEM\nIS THE BEST REVENGE\n\nJUDGMENT\n\nBy acknowledging a petty problem you give it existence and\ncredibility. The more attention you pay an enemy, the stronger you\nmake him; and a small mistake is often made worse and more visible\nwhen you try to fix it. It is sometimes best to leave things alone.

His exploits fascinated Americanshe seemed a man from\nanother era, part Robin Hood, part Don Juan. After a few years of\nbitter fighting, however, General Carranza emerged as the victor in the\nRevolution; the defeated Villa and his troops went back home, to the\nnorthern state of Chihuahua. His army dwindled and he tumed to\nbanditry again, damaging his popularity. Finally, perhaps out of\ndesperation, he began to rail against die United States, die gringos,\nwhom he blamed for his troubles.\n\nIn March of 1916, Pancho Villa raided Columbus, New Mexico.\nRampaging through the town, he and his gang killed seventeen\nAmerican soldiers and civilians. President Woodrow Wilson, like\nmany Americans, had admired Villa; now, however, the bandit needed\nto be punished. Wilson's advisers urged him to send troops into\nMexico to capture Villa. For a power as large as the United States, they\nargued, not to strike back at an army that had invaded its territory\nwould send the worst kind of signal. Furthermore, they continued,\nmany Americans saw Wilson as a pacifist, a principle the public\n\ndoubted as a response to violence; he needed to prove his mettle and\nmanliness by ordering the use of force.\n\nThe pressure on Wilson was strong, and before the month was\nout, with the approval of the Carranza government, he sent an army of\nten thousand soldiers to capture Pancho Villa. The venture was called\nthe Punitive Expedition, and its leader was the dashing General John J.\nPershing, who had defeated guerrillas in the Philippines and Native\nAmericans in the American Southwest. Certainly Pershing could find\nand overpower Pancho Villa.\n\nThe Punitive Expedition became a sensational story, and carloads\nof U.S. reporters followed Pershing into action. The campaign, they\nwrote, would be a test of American power. The soldiers carried the\nlatest in weaponry, communicated by radio, and were supported by\nreconnaissance from the air.\n\nIn the first few months, the troops split up into small units to\ncomb the wilds of northern Mexico. The Americans offered a $50,000\nreward for information leading to Villa's capture. But the Mexican\npeople, who had been disillusioned with Villa when he had returned to\nbanditry, now idolized him for facing mis mighty American army.\nThey began to give Pershing false leads: Villa had been seen in this\nvillage, or in that mountain hideaway, airplanes would be dispatched,\ntroops would scurry after them, and no one would ever see him. The\nwily bandit seemed to be always one step ahead of the American\nmilitary.\n\nBy the summer of that year, the expedition had swelled to\n123,000 men. They suffered through the stultifying heat, the\nmosquitoes, the wild terrain.

It climbed up on\n\nthey infuriated bodi the local people and the Mexican\ngovernment. At one point Pancho Villa hid in a mountain cave to\nrecover from a gunshot wound he received in a skirmish with the\nMexican army; looking down from his aerie, he could watch Pershing\nlead the exhausted American troops back and forth across the\nmountains, never getting any closer to their goal.\n\nAll the way into winter, Villa played his cat-and-mouse game.\nAmericans came to see the affair as a kind of slapstick farcein fact they\nbegan to admire Villa again, respecting his resourcefulness in eluding a\nsuperior force. In January of 1917, Wilson finally ordered Pershing's\nwithdrawal. As the troops made their way back to American territory,\nrebel forces pursued them, forcing the U.S. Army to use airplanes to\nprotect its rear flanks. The Punitive Expedition was being punished\nitselfit had turned into a retreat of the most humiliating sort.\n\nInterpretation\n\nWoodrow Wilson organized the Punitive Expedition as a show of\nforce: He\n\nwould teach Pancho Villa a lesson and in the process show the\nworld that\n\nno one, large or small, could attack the mighty United States and\nget away\n\nwith it. The expedition would be over in a few weeks, and Villa\nwould be\n\nforgotten.\n\nThat was not how it played out. The longer the expedition took,\nthe more it focused attention on the Americans' incompetence and on\nVilla's cleverness. Soon what was forgotten was not Villa but the raid\nthat had started it all. As a minor annoyance became an international\nembarrassment, and the enraged Americans dispatched more troops,\ndie imbalance between die size of the pursuer and the size of die\npursuedwho still managed to stay freemade the affair a joke. And in\nthe end this white elephant of an army had to lumber out of Mexico,\nhumiliated. The Punitive Expedition did the opposite of what it set out\nto do: It left Villa not only free but more popular than ever.\n\nWhat could Wilson have done differendy He could have\npressured the Carranza government to catch Villa for him.\nAlternatively, since many Mexicans had tired of Villa before the\n\nPunitive Expedition began, he could have worked quietly with diem\nand won their support for a much smaller raid to capture the bandit. He\ncould have organized a trap on the American side of the border,\nanticipating the next raid. Or he could have ignored die matter\naltogether for the time being, waiting for the Mexicans themselves to\ndo away with Villa of their own accord.\n\nRemember: You choose to let things bother you. You can just as\neasily choose not to notice the irritating offender, to consider the\nmatter trivial and unworthy of your interest. That is the powerful\nmove. What you do not react to cannot drag you down in a futile\nengagement. Your pride is not involved. The best lesson you can teach\nan irritating gnat is to consign it to oblivion by ignoring it. If it is\nimpossible to ignore (Pancho Villa had in fact killed American\ncitizens), then conspire in secret to do away with it, but\n\nnever inadvertently draw attention to the bothersome insect that\nwill go away or die on its own.

Catherine had\nfailed to produce a son, a male heir who would ensure the continuance\nof his dynasty, and Henry thought he knew why: He had read in the\nBible the passage, \u201cAnd if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is an\nunclean thing: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be\nchildless.\u201d Before marrying Henry, Catherine had married his older\nbrother Arthur, but Arthur had died five months later. Henry had\nwaited an appropriate time, then had married his brother's widow.\n\nCatherine was the daughter of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella\nof Spain, and by marrying her Henry had kept alive a valuable\n\nalliance. Now, however, Catherine had to assure him that her brief\nmarriage with Arthur had never been consummated. Otherwise Henry\nwould view their relationship as incestuous and their marriage as null\nand void. Catherine insisted that she had remained a virgin through her\nmarriage to Arthur, and Pope Clement VII supported her by giving his\nblessing to the union, which he could not have done had he considered\nit incestuous. Yet after years of marriage to Henry, Catherine had failed\nto produce a son, and in the early 1520s she had entered menopause.\nTo the king this could only mean one thing: She had lied about her\nvirginity, their union was incestuous, and God had punished them.\n\nThere was another reason why Henry wanted to get rid of\nCatherine: He had fallen in love with a younger woman, Anne Boleyn.\nNot only was he in love with her, but if he married her he could still\nhope to sire a legitimate son. The marriage to Catherine had to be\nannulled. For this, however, Henry had to apply to the Vatican. But\nPope Clement would never annul the marriage.\n\nBy the summer of 1527, rumors spread throughout Europe that\nHenry was about to attempt the impossibleto annul his marriage\nagainst Clement's wishes. Catherine would never abdicate, let alone\nvoluntarily enter a nunnery, as Henry had urged her. But Henry had his\nown strategy: He stopped sleeping in the same bed with Catherine,\nsince he considered her his sister-in-law, not his lawful wife. He\ninsisted on calling her Princess\n\nthe dais where the chief was seated and lay there, chewing its cud.\nEveryone was sure that this was some grave portent, and urged that the\nox be sent to a yin-yang diviner. However, the prime minister, the\nfather of the minister of the right, said, \u201cAn ox has no discrimination.\nIt has legsthere is nowhere it won't go. It does not make sense to\ndeprive an underpaid official of the wretched ox he needs in order to\nattend court.\u201d He returned the ox to its owner and changed the matting\non which it had lain. No untoward event of any kind occurred\nafterward. They say that if you see a prodigy and do not treat it as\nsuch, its character as a prodigy is destroyed.\n\nessays in idleness,\n\nKenko,\n\nJapan,\n\nfourteenth century\n\n\nAnd in this view it is advisable to let everyone of your\nacquaintance whether man or womanfeel now and then that you could\nvery well dispense with their company. This will consolidate\nfriendship. Nay, with most people there will be no harm in\noccasionally mixing a grain of disdain with your treatment of them;\nthat will make them value your friendship all the more. Chi non stima\nvien stimato, as a subtle Italian proverb has itto disregard is to win\nregard. But if we really think very highly of a person, we should\nconceal it from him like a crime. This is not a very gratifying thing to\ndo, but it is right.

Then he lost his temper, scattered the\npeas in all directions, and ran away.\n\nFABLES,\n\nLeo Tolstoy, 1828-1910\n\nDowager of Wales, her title as Arthur's widow. Finally, in 1531,\nhe banished her from court and shipped her off to a distant casde. The\npope ordered him to return her to court, on pain of excommunication,\nthe most severe penalty a Catholic could suffer. Henry not only\nignored diis threat, he insisted that his marriage to Cadierine had been\ndissolved, and in 1533 he married Anne Boleyn.\n\nClement refused to recognize the marriage, but Henry did not\ncare. He no longer recognized the pope's autiiority, and proceeded to\nbreak with the Roman Catholic Church, establishing the Church of\nEngland in its stead, with the king as the head of the new church. And\nso, not surprisingly, the newly formed Church of England proclaimed\nAnne Boleyn England's rightful queen.\n\nThe pope tried every threat in the book, but nothing worked.\nHenry simply ignored him. Clement fumedno one had ever treated him\nso contemptuously. Henry had humiliated him and he had no power of\nrecourse. Even excommunication (which he constantly threatened but\nnever carried out) would no longer matter.\n\n\nCatherine too felt the devastating sting of Henry's disdain. She\ntried to fight back, but in appealing to Henry her words fell on deaf\nears, and soon they fell on no one's. Isolated from die court, ignored by\ndie king, mad widi anger and frustration, Cadierine slowly\ndeteriorated, and finally died in January of 1536, from a cancerous\ntumor of the heart.\n\nInterpretation\n\nWhen you pay attention to a person, the two of you become\npartners of sorts, each moving in step to die actions and reactions of\nthe otiier. In the process you lose your initiative. It is a dynamic of all\ninteractions: By acknowledging otiier people, even if only to fight with\nthem, you open yourself to dieir influence. Had Henry locked horns\nwith Cadierine, he would have found himself mired in endless\narguments tiiat would have weakened his resolve and eventually worn\nhim down. (Cadierine was a strong, stubborn woman.) Had he set out\nto convince Clement to change his verdict on the marriage's validity, or\ntried to compromise and negotiate with him, he would have gotten\nbogged down in Clement's favorite tactic: playing for time, promising\nflexibility, but actually getting what popes always got dieir way.\n\nHenry would have none of this. He played a devastating power\ngametotal disdain. By ignoring people you cancel diem out. This\nunset-ties and infuriates thembut since they have no dealings witii you,\ndiere is notiiing they can do.\n\nThis is the offensive aspect of the law. Playing the card of\ncontempt is immensely powerful, for it lets you determine the\nconditions of die conflict. The war is waged on your terms. This is the\nultimate power pose: You are the king, and you ignore what offends\nyou. Watch how tins tactic infuriates peoplehalf of what they do is to\nget your attention, and when you withhold it from them, they flounder\nin frustration.\n\nMAN: Kick himhe'll forgive you. Flatter himhe may or may not\n\nsee through you. But ignore him and he'll hate you.\n\nIdries Shah, Caravan of Dreams, 1968\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nDesire often creates paradoxical effects: The more you want\nsomething, the more you chase after it, the more it eludes you. The\nmore interest you show, the more you repel the object of your desire.\n\nThis is because your interest is too strongit makes people awkward,\neven fearful. Uncontrollable desire makes you seem weak, unworthy,\npathetic.\n\nYou need to turn your back on what you want, show your\n\ncontempt and disdain. This is the kind of powerful response mat will\ndrive your targets crazy. They will respond with a desire of their own,\nwhich is simply to have an effect on youperhaps to possess you,\nperhaps to hurt you. If they want to possess you, you have successfully\ncompleted the first step of seduction. If they want to hurt you, you\nhave unsettled them and made them play by your rules (see Laws 8\nand 39 on baiting people into action).\nContempt is the prerogative of the king. Where his eyes turn,\nwhat he decides to see, is what has reality; what he ignores and turns\nhis back on is as good as dead. That was the weapon of King Louis\nXIVif he did not like you, he acted as if you were not there,\nmaintaining his superiority by cutting off the dynamic of interaction.\nThis is the power you have when you play the card of contempt,\nperiodically showing people mat you can do without them.\n\nIf choosing to ignore enhances your power, it follows that the\nopposite approachcommitment and engagementoften weakens you. By\npaying undue attention to a puny enemy, you look puny, and the longer\nit takes you to crush such an enemy, the larger the enemy seems. When\nAthens set out to conquer tlie island of Sicily, in 415 B.C., a giant\npower was attacking a tiny one. Yet by entangling Athens in a long-\ndrawn-out conflict, Syracuse, Sicily's most important city-state, was\nable to grow in stature and confidence. Finally defeating Athens, it\nmade itself famous for centuries to come. In recent times, President\nJohn F. Kennedy made a similar mistake in his attitude to Fidel Castro\nof Cuba: His failed invasion at the Bay of Pigs, in 1961, made Castro\nan international hero.\n\nA second danger: If you succeed in crushing the irritant, or even\nif you merely wound it, you create sympathy for the weaker side.\nCritics of Franklin D. Roosevelt complained bitterly about the money\nhis administration spent on government projects, but their attacks had\nno resonance with the public, who saw the president as working to end\ndie Great Depression. His opponents thought they had an example that\nwould show just how wasteful he had become: his dog, Fala, which he\n\n\nlavished with favors and attention. Critics railed at his\ninsensitivityspending taxpayers\u2019 money on a dog while so many\nAmericans were still in poverty. But Roosevelt had a response: How\ndare his critics attack a defenseless little dog\n\nAs some make gossip out of everything, so others make much ado\nabout everything. They are always talking big, [and] take everything\nseriously, making a quarrel and a mystery of it. You should take very\nfew grievances to heart, for to do so is to give yourself groundless\nworry. It is a topsyturvy way of behaving to take to heart cares which\nyou ought to throw over your shoulder. Many things which seemed\nimportant [at the time] turn out to be of no account when they are\nignored; and others, which seem trifling, appear formidable when you\npay attention to them. Things can easily be settled at the outset, but not\nso later on. In many cases, the remedy itself is the cause of the disease:\nto let things be is not the least satisfactory of life's rules.\n\nBaltasar GraciAn, 1601-1658\n\nThere was a certain\n\noriginal man who\n\ndesired to catch his\n\nown shadow.

In this case, the weak party involved was the president's dog and\nthe attack backfiredin the long run, it only made the president more\nsympadietic, since many people will naturally side with the\n\u201cunderdog,\u201d just as the American public came to sympathize with the\nwily but outnumbered Pan-cho Villa.\n\nIt is tempting to want to fix our mistakes, but the harder we try,\nthe worse we often make them. It is sometimes more politic to leave\nthem alone. In 1971, when the New York Times published die\nPentagon Papers, a group of government documents about the history\nof U.S. involvement in Indochina, Henry Kissinger erupted into a\nvolcanic rage. Furious about die Nixon administration's vulnerability\nto diis kind of damaging leak, he made recommendations that\neventually led to the formation of a group called die Plumbers to plug\ndie leaks. This was the unit that later broke into Democratic Party\noffices in the Watergate Hotel, setting off the chain of events that led to\nNixon's downfall. In reality the publication of the Pentagon Papers was\nnot a serious direat to the administration, but Kissinger's reaction made\nit a big deal. In trying to fix one problem, he created an-otiier: a\n\nparanoia for security that in die end was much more destructive to the\ngovernment. Had he ignored the Pentagon Papers, the scandal they had\ncreated would eventually have blown over.\n\nInstead of inadvertendy focusing attention on a problem, making\nit seem worse by publicizing how much concern and anxiety it is\ncausing you, it is often far wiser to play die contemptuous aristocrat,\nnot deigning to acknowledge die problem's existence. There are\nseveral ways to execute this strategy.\n\nFirst there is the sour-grapes approach. If there is something you\nwant but that you realize you cannot have, the worst thing you can do\nis draw attention to your disappointment by complaining about it. An\ninfinitely more powerful tactic is to act as if it never really interested\nyou in the first place. When the writer George Sand's supporters\nnominated her to be the first female member of the Academie\nFrancaise, in 1861, Sand quickly saw that the academy would never\nadmit her. Instead of whining, though, she claimed she had no interest\nin belonging to this group of worn-out, overrated, out-of-touch\nwindbags. Her disdain was die perfect response: Had she shown her\nanger at her exclusion, she would have revealed how much it meant to\nher. Instead she branded the academy a club of old menand why should\nshe be angry or disappointed at not having to spend her time with them\nCrying \u201csour grapes\u201d is sometimes seen as a reflection of the weak; it\nis actually the tactic of the powerful.\n\nSecond, when you are attacked by an inferior, deflect people's\nattention by making it clear that die attack has not even registered.\nLook away, or answer sweetly, showing how litde the attack concerns\nyou. Similarly, when you yourself have committed a blunder, the best\nresponse is often to make less of your mistake by treating it lightly.\n\nThe Japanese emperor Go-Saiin, a great disciple of the tea\nceremony,\n\nowned a priceless antique tea bowl that all the courtiers envied.\nOne day a guest, Dainagon Tsunehiro, asked if he could carry the tea\nbowl into the light, to examine it more closely. The bowl rarely left the\ntable, but the emperor was in good spirits and he consented. As\nDainagon carried the bowl to the railing of the verandah, however, and\nheld it up to the light, it slipped from his hands and fell on a rock in the\ngarden below, smashing into tiny fragments.\n\nThe emperor of course was furious. \u201cIt was indeed most clumsy\nof me to let it drop in this way,\u201d said Dainagon, with a deep bow, \u201cbut\nreally there is not much harm done. This Ido tea-bowl is a very old one\nand it is impossible to say how much longer it would have lasted, but\nanyhow it is not a thing of any public use, so I think it rather fortunate\nthat it has broken thus.\u201d This surprising response had an immediate\neffect: The emperor calmed down. Dainagon neither sniveled nor\noverapologized, but signaled his own worth and power by treating his\nmistake with a touch of disdain. The emperor had to respond with a\nsimilar aristocratic indifference; his anger had made him seem low and\npettyan image Dainagon was able to manipulate.\n\nAmong equals this tactic might backfire: Your indifference could\nmake you seem callous. But with a master, if you act quickly and\nwithout great fuss, it can work to great effect: You bypass his angry\nresponse, save him the time and energy he would waste by brooding\nover it, and allow him the opportunity to display his own lack of\npettiness publicly.\n\nIf we make excuses and denials when we are caught in a mistake\nor a deception, we stir the waters and make the situation worse. It is\noften wiser to play things the opposite way. The Renaissance writer\nPietro Aretino often boasted of his aristocratic lineage, which was, of\ncourse, a fiction, since he was actually the son of a shoemaker. When\nan enemy of his finally revealed the embarrassing truth, word quickly\nspread, and soon all of Venice (where he lived at the time) was aghast\nat Aretino's lies. Had he tried to defend himself, he would have only\ndragged himself down. His response was masterful: He announced that\nhe was indeed the son of a shoemaker, but this only proved his\ngreatness, since he had risen from the lowest stratum of society to its\nvery pinnacle. From then on he never mentioned his previous lie,\ntrumpeting instead his new position on the matter of his ancestry.\n\nRemember: The powerful responses to niggling, petty annoyances\nand irritations are contempt and disdain. Never show that something\nhas affected you, or that you are offendedthat only shows you have\nacknowledged a problem. Contempt is a dish that is best served cold\nand without affectation.\n\nImage:\n\nThe Tiny\n\nWound.\n\nIt is small but painful and irritating.

For there are many of whom we should have\nknown nothing if their distinguished opponents had taken no notice of\nthem. There is no revenge like oblivion, for it is the entombment of the\nunworthy in the dust of their own nothingness. (Baltasar Gracian,\n1601-1658)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nYou must play the card of contempt with care and delicacy.

His exploits fascinated Americanshe seemed a man from\nanother era, part Robin Hood, part Don Juan. After a few years of\nbitter fighting, however, General Carranza emerged as the victor in the\nRevolution; the defeated Villa and his troops went back home, to the\nnorthern state of Chihuahua. His army dwindled and he tumed to\nbanditry again, damaging his popularity. Finally, perhaps out of\ndesperation, he began to rail against die United States, die gringos,\nwhom he blamed for his troubles.\n\nIn March of 1916, Pancho Villa raided Columbus, New Mexico.\nRampaging through the town, he and his gang killed seventeen\nAmerican soldiers and civilians. President Woodrow Wilson, like\nmany Americans, had admired Villa; now, however, the bandit needed\nto be punished. Wilson's advisers urged him to send troops into\nMexico to capture Villa. For a power as large as the United States, they\nargued, not to strike back at an army that had invaded its territory\nwould send the worst kind of signal. Furthermore, they continued,\nmany Americans saw Wilson as a pacifist, a principle the public\n\ndoubted as a response to violence; he needed to prove his mettle and\nmanliness by ordering the use of force.\n\nThe pressure on Wilson was strong, and before the month was\nout, with the approval of the Carranza government, he sent an army of\nten thousand soldiers to capture Pancho Villa. The venture was called\nthe Punitive Expedition, and its leader was the dashing General John J.\nPershing, who had defeated guerrillas in the Philippines and Native\nAmericans in the American Southwest. Certainly Pershing could find\nand overpower Pancho Villa.\n\nThe Punitive Expedition became a sensational story, and carloads\nof U.S. reporters followed Pershing into action. The campaign, they\nwrote, would be a test of American power. The soldiers carried the\nlatest in weaponry, communicated by radio, and were supported by\nreconnaissance from the air.\n\nIn the first few months, the troops split up into small units to\ncomb the wilds of northern Mexico. The Americans offered a $50,000\nreward for information leading to Villa's capture. But the Mexican\npeople, who had been disillusioned with Villa when he had returned to\nbanditry, now idolized him for facing mis mighty American army.\nThey began to give Pershing false leads: Villa had been seen in this\nvillage, or in that mountain hideaway, airplanes would be dispatched,\ntroops would scurry after them, and no one would ever see him. The\nwily bandit seemed to be always one step ahead of the American\nmilitary.\n\nBy the summer of that year, the expedition had swelled to\n123,000 men. They suffered through the stultifying heat, the\nmosquitoes, the wild terrain.

At one point Pancho Villa hid in a mountain cave to\nrecover from a gunshot wound he received in a skirmish with the\nMexican army; looking down from his aerie, he could watch Pershing\nlead the exhausted American troops back and forth across the\nmountains, never getting any closer to their goal.\n\nAll the way into winter, Villa played his cat-and-mouse game.\nAmericans came to see the affair as a kind of slapstick farcein fact they\nbegan to admire Villa again, respecting his resourcefulness in eluding a\nsuperior force. In January of 1917, Wilson finally ordered Pershing's\nwithdrawal. As the troops made their way back to American territory,\nrebel forces pursued them, forcing the U.S. Army to use airplanes to\nprotect its rear flanks. The Punitive Expedition was being punished\nitselfit had turned into a retreat of the most humiliating sort.\n\nInterpretation\n\nWoodrow Wilson organized the Punitive Expedition as a show of\nforce: He\n\nwould teach Pancho Villa a lesson and in the process show the\nworld that\n\nno one, large or small, could attack the mighty United States and\nget away\n\nwith it. The expedition would be over in a few weeks, and Villa\nwould be\n\nforgotten.\n\nThat was not how it played out. The longer the expedition took,\nthe more it focused attention on the Americans' incompetence and on\nVilla's cleverness. Soon what was forgotten was not Villa but the raid\nthat had started it all. As a minor annoyance became an international\nembarrassment, and the enraged Americans dispatched more troops,\ndie imbalance between die size of the pursuer and the size of die\npursuedwho still managed to stay freemade the affair a joke. And in\nthe end this white elephant of an army had to lumber out of Mexico,\nhumiliated. The Punitive Expedition did the opposite of what it set out\nto do: It left Villa not only free but more popular than ever.\n\nWhat could Wilson have done differendy He could have\npressured the Carranza government to catch Villa for him.\nAlternatively, since many Mexicans had tired of Villa before the\n\nPunitive Expedition began, he could have worked quietly with diem\nand won their support for a much smaller raid to capture the bandit. He\ncould have organized a trap on the American side of the border,\nanticipating the next raid. Or he could have ignored die matter\naltogether for the time being, waiting for the Mexicans themselves to\ndo away with Villa of their own accord.\n\nRemember: You choose to let things bother you. You can just as\neasily choose not to notice the irritating offender, to consider the\nmatter trivial and unworthy of your interest. That is the powerful\nmove.

Catherine had\nfailed to produce a son, a male heir who would ensure the continuance\nof his dynasty, and Henry thought he knew why: He had read in the\nBible the passage, \u201cAnd if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is an\nunclean thing: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be\nchildless.\u201d Before marrying Henry, Catherine had married his older\nbrother Arthur, but Arthur had died five months later. Henry had\nwaited an appropriate time, then had married his brother's widow.\n\nCatherine was the daughter of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella\nof Spain, and by marrying her Henry had kept alive a valuable\n\nalliance. Now, however, Catherine had to assure him that her brief\nmarriage with Arthur had never been consummated. Otherwise Henry\nwould view their relationship as incestuous and their marriage as null\nand void. Catherine insisted that she had remained a virgin through her\nmarriage to Arthur, and Pope Clement VII supported her by giving his\nblessing to the union, which he could not have done had he considered\nit incestuous. Yet after years of marriage to Henry, Catherine had failed\nto produce a son, and in the early 1520s she had entered menopause.\nTo the king this could only mean one thing: She had lied about her\nvirginity, their union was incestuous, and God had punished them.\n\nThere was another reason why Henry wanted to get rid of\nCatherine: He had fallen in love with a younger woman, Anne Boleyn.\nNot only was he in love with her, but if he married her he could still\nhope to sire a legitimate son. The marriage to Catherine had to be\nannulled. For this, however, Henry had to apply to the Vatican. But\nPope Clement would never annul the marriage.\n\nBy the summer of 1527, rumors spread throughout Europe that\nHenry was about to attempt the impossibleto annul his marriage\nagainst Clement's wishes. Catherine would never abdicate, let alone\nvoluntarily enter a nunnery, as Henry had urged her. But Henry had his\nown strategy: He stopped sleeping in the same bed with Catherine,\nsince he considered her his sister-in-law, not his lawful wife. He\ninsisted on calling her Princess\n\nthe dais where the chief was seated and lay there, chewing its cud.\nEveryone was sure that this was some grave portent, and urged that the\nox be sent to a yin-yang diviner. However, the prime minister, the\nfather of the minister of the right, said, \u201cAn ox has no discrimination.\nIt has legsthere is nowhere it won't go. It does not make sense to\ndeprive an underpaid official of the wretched ox he needs in order to\nattend court.\u201d He returned the ox to its owner and changed the matting\non which it had lain.

Finally, in 1531,\nhe banished her from court and shipped her off to a distant casde. The\npope ordered him to return her to court, on pain of excommunication,\nthe most severe penalty a Catholic could suffer. Henry not only\nignored diis threat, he insisted that his marriage to Cadierine had been\ndissolved, and in 1533 he married Anne Boleyn.\n\nClement refused to recognize the marriage, but Henry did not\ncare. He no longer recognized the pope's autiiority, and proceeded to\nbreak with the Roman Catholic Church, establishing the Church of\nEngland in its stead, with the king as the head of the new church. And\nso, not surprisingly, the newly formed Church of England proclaimed\nAnne Boleyn England's rightful queen.\n\nThe pope tried every threat in the book, but nothing worked.\nHenry simply ignored him. Clement fumedno one had ever treated him\nso contemptuously. Henry had humiliated him and he had no power of\nrecourse. Even excommunication (which he constantly threatened but\nnever carried out) would no longer matter.\n\n\nCatherine too felt the devastating sting of Henry's disdain. She\ntried to fight back, but in appealing to Henry her words fell on deaf\nears, and soon they fell on no one's. Isolated from die court, ignored by\ndie king, mad widi anger and frustration, Cadierine slowly\ndeteriorated, and finally died in January of 1536, from a cancerous\ntumor of the heart.\n\nInterpretation\n\nWhen you pay attention to a person, the two of you become\npartners of sorts, each moving in step to die actions and reactions of\nthe otiier. In the process you lose your initiative. It is a dynamic of all\ninteractions: By acknowledging otiier people, even if only to fight with\nthem, you open yourself to dieir influence. Had Henry locked horns\nwith Cadierine, he would have found himself mired in endless\narguments tiiat would have weakened his resolve and eventually worn\nhim down. (Cadierine was a strong, stubborn woman.) Had he set out\nto convince Clement to change his verdict on the marriage's validity, or\ntried to compromise and negotiate with him, he would have gotten\nbogged down in Clement's favorite tactic: playing for time, promising\nflexibility, but actually getting what popes always got dieir way.\n\nHenry would have none of this.

The\nmore interest you show, the more you repel the object of your desire.\n\nThis is because your interest is too strongit makes people awkward,\neven fearful. Uncontrollable desire makes you seem weak, unworthy,\npathetic.\n\nYou need to turn your back on what you want, show your\n\ncontempt and disdain. This is the kind of powerful response mat will\ndrive your targets crazy. They will respond with a desire of their own,\nwhich is simply to have an effect on youperhaps to possess you,\nperhaps to hurt you. If they want to possess you, you have successfully\ncompleted the first step of seduction. If they want to hurt you, you\nhave unsettled them and made them play by your rules (see Laws 8\nand 39 on baiting people into action).\nContempt is the prerogative of the king. Where his eyes turn,\nwhat he decides to see, is what has reality; what he ignores and turns\nhis back on is as good as dead. That was the weapon of King Louis\nXIVif he did not like you, he acted as if you were not there,\nmaintaining his superiority by cutting off the dynamic of interaction.\nThis is the power you have when you play the card of contempt,\nperiodically showing people mat you can do without them.\n\nIf choosing to ignore enhances your power, it follows that the\nopposite approachcommitment and engagementoften weakens you. By\npaying undue attention to a puny enemy, you look puny, and the longer\nit takes you to crush such an enemy, the larger the enemy seems.

Instead of whining, though, she claimed she had no interest\nin belonging to this group of worn-out, overrated, out-of-touch\nwindbags. Her disdain was die perfect response: Had she shown her\nanger at her exclusion, she would have revealed how much it meant to\nher. Instead she branded the academy a club of old menand why should\nshe be angry or disappointed at not having to spend her time with them\nCrying \u201csour grapes\u201d is sometimes seen as a reflection of the weak; it\nis actually the tactic of the powerful.\n\nSecond, when you are attacked by an inferior, deflect people's\nattention by making it clear that die attack has not even registered.\nLook away, or answer sweetly, showing how litde the attack concerns\nyou. Similarly, when you yourself have committed a blunder, the best\nresponse is often to make less of your mistake by treating it lightly.\n\nThe Japanese emperor Go-Saiin, a great disciple of the tea\nceremony,\n\nowned a priceless antique tea bowl that all the courtiers envied.\nOne day a guest, Dainagon Tsunehiro, asked if he could carry the tea\nbowl into the light, to examine it more closely. The bowl rarely left the\ntable, but the emperor was in good spirits and he consented. As\nDainagon carried the bowl to the railing of the verandah, however, and\nheld it up to the light, it slipped from his hands and fell on a rock in the\ngarden below, smashing into tiny fragments.\n\nThe emperor of course was furious. \u201cIt was indeed most clumsy\nof me to let it drop in this way,\u201d said Dainagon, with a deep bow, \u201cbut\nreally there is not much harm done. This Ido tea-bowl is a very old one\nand it is impossible to say how much longer it would have lasted, but\nanyhow it is not a thing of any public use, so I think it rather fortunate\nthat it has broken thus.\u201d This surprising response had an immediate\neffect: The emperor calmed down. Dainagon neither sniveled nor\noverapologized, but signaled his own worth and power by treating his\nmistake with a touch of disdain. The emperor had to respond with a\nsimilar aristocratic indifference; his anger had made him seem low and\npettyan image Dainagon was able to manipulate.\n\nAmong equals this tactic might backfire: Your indifference could\nmake you seem callous. But with a master, if you act quickly and\nwithout great fuss, it can work to great effect: You bypass his angry\nresponse, save him the time and energy he would waste by brooding\nover it, and allow him the opportunity to display his own lack of\npettiness publicly.\n\nIf we make excuses and denials when we are caught in a mistake\nor a deception, we stir the waters and make the situation worse. It is\noften wiser to play things the opposite way. The Renaissance writer\nPietro Aretino often boasted of his aristocratic lineage, which was, of\ncourse, a fiction, since he was actually the son of a shoemaker. When\nan enemy of his finally revealed the embarrassing truth, word quickly\nspread, and soon all of Venice (where he lived at the time) was aghast\nat Aretino's lies. Had he tried to defend himself, he would have only\ndragged himself down. His response was masterful: He announced that\nhe was indeed the son of a shoemaker, but this only proved his\ngreatness, since he had risen from the lowest stratum of society to its\nvery pinnacle. From then on he never mentioned his previous lie,\ntrumpeting instead his new position on the matter of his ancestry.\n\nRemember: The powerful responses to niggling, petty annoyances\nand irritations are contempt and disdain. Never show that something\nhas affected you, or that you are offendedthat only shows you have\nacknowledged a problem. Contempt is a dish that is best served cold\nand without affectation.\n\nImage:\n\nThe Tiny\n\nWound.\n\nIt is small but painful and irritating. You try all sorts of\nmedicaments, you complain, you scratch and pick at the scab. Doctors\nonly make it worse, transforming the tiny wound into a grave matter. If\nonly you had left the wound alone, letting time heal it and freeing\nyourself of worry.\n\nAuthority: Know how to play the card of contempt. It is the most\npolitic kind of revenge. For there are many of whom we should have\nknown nothing if their distinguished opponents had taken no notice of\nthem. There is no revenge like oblivion, for it is the entombment of the\nunworthy in the dust of their own nothingness. (Baltasar Gracian,\n1601-1658)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nYou must play the card of contempt with care and delicacy. Most\nsmall troubles will vanish on their own if you leave diem be; but some\nwill grow and fester unless you attend to them. Ignore a person of\ninferior stature and the next time you look he has become a serious\nrival, and your contempt has made him vengeful as well. The great\nprinces of Renaissance Italy chose to ignore Cesare Borgia at the\noutset of his career as a young general in the army of his father, Pope\nAlexander VI. By the time they paid attention it was too latedie cub\nwas now a lion, gobbling up chunks of Italy. Often, tlien, while you\nshow contempt publicly you will also need to keep an eye on the\nproblem privately, monitoring its status and making sure it goes away.\nDo not let it become a cancerous cell.\n\nDevelop the skill of sensing problems when they are still small\nand taking care of them before they become intractable. Learn to\ndistinguish between the potentially disastrous and the mildly irritating,\nthe nuisance that will quietiy go away on its own. In eidier case,\nthough, never completely take your eye off it.

Great multitudes\naccompanied this royal progress, some of them following the queen on\nboth sides of the river from its very mouth, while others hurried down\nfrom the city of Tarsus to gaze at the sight. Gradually the crowds\ndrifted away from the marketplace,\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW I\n\nIn the early 1780s, word spread through Berlin of the strange and\nspectacular medical practice of a Dr. Weisleder. He performed his\nmiracles in an enormous converted beer hall, outside which Berliners\nbegan to notice ever longer lines of peoplethe blind, the lame, anyone\nwith an illness incurable by normal medicine. When it leaked out that\n\n\nthe doctor worked by exposing the patient to the rays of the moon, he\nsoon became dubbed The Moon Doctor of Berlin.\n\nSometime in 1783, it was reported that Dr. Weisleder had cured a\nwell-to-do woman of a terrible ailment. He suddenly became a\ncelebrity. Previously only the poorest Berliners had been seen waiting\noutside the beer hall in their rags; now magnificent carriages were\nparked outside, and gentlemen in frock coats, and ladies with\nenormous coiffures, lined the street as sunset drew near. Even folk\nwith the mildest of ailments came, out of sheer curiosity. As they\nwaited in line, the poorer clients would explain to the gentlemen and\nladies that the doctor only practiced when the moon was in its\nincrescent phase. Many would add that they themselves had already\nbeen exposed to die healing powers he called forth from the rays of the\nmoon. Even those who felt cured kept coming back, drawn by this\npowerful experience.\n\nInside the beer hall, a strange and stirring spectacle greeted the\nvisitor: Packed into the entrance hall was a crowd of all classes and\nethnic backgrounds, a veritable Tower of Babel. Through tall windows\non the northern side of the hall, silvery moonlight poured in at odd\nangles. The doctor and his wife, who, it seemed, was also able to effect\nthe cure, practiced on the second floor, which was reached by a\nstairway, at the end of the hall. As the line edged closer to the stairs,\nthe sick would hear shouts and cries from above, and word would\nspread of, perhaps, a blind gentleman suddenly able to see.\n\nOnce upstairs, the line would fork in two directions, toward a\nnorthern room for the doctor, a southern one for his wife, who worked\nonly on the ladies. Finally, after hours of anticipation and waiting in\nline, the gentlemen patients would be led before the amazing doctor\nhimself, an elderly man with a few stalks of wild gray hair and an air\nof nervous energy. He would take the patient (let us say a young boy,\nbrought in by his father), uncover the afflicted body part, and lift the\nboy up to the window, which faced the light of the moon. He would\ntub the site of the injury or illness, mumble something unintelligible,\nlook knowingly at the moon, and then, after collecting his fee, send the\nboy and his father on their way. Meanwhile, in the south-facing room,\nhis wife would be doing the same with the ladieswhich was odd, really,\nsince the moon cannot appear in two places at once; it cannot have\n\n\nbeen visible, in other words, from both windows. Apparendy the mere\nthought, idea, and symbol of the moon were enough, for the ladies did\nnot complain, and would later remark confidently that the wife of the\nMoon Doctor had the same healing powers as he.\n\nInterpretation\n\nDr. Weisleder may have known nothing about medicine, but he\nunderstood human nature. He recognized that people do not always\nwant words, or rational explanations, or demonstrations of the powers\nof science; they want an immediate appeal to their emotions. Give\nthem that and they will do the restsuch as imagine they can be healed\nby the light reflected from a rock a quarter million miles away. Dr.\nWeisleder had no need of pills, or of lengtfry lectures on the moon's\npower, or of any silly gadgetry to amplify its rays. He understood that\nthe simpler the spectacle the betterjust the moonlight pouring in from\nthe side, the stairway leading to the heavens, and the rays of the moon,\nwhether directly visible or not. Any added effects might have made it\nseem that the moon was not strong enough on its own. And the moon\nwas strong enoughit was a magnet for fantasies, as it has been\nthroughout history. Simply by associating himself with the image of\nthe moon, the doctor gained power.\n\nRemember: Your search for power depends on shortcuts. You\nmust always circumvent people's suspicions, their perverse desire to\nresist your will. Images are an extremely effective shortcut: Bypassing\nthe head, the seat of doubt and resistance, they aim straight for the\nheart. Overwhelming the eyes, they create powerful associations,\nbringing people together and stirring their emotions. With the white\nlight of the moon in their eyes, your targets are blinded to the\ndeceptions you practice.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II\n\nIn 1536 the future king Henri II of France took his first mistress,\nDiane de Poitiers. Diane was thirty-seven at the time, and was the\nwidow of the grand seneschal of Normandy. Henri, meanwhile, was a\nsprightly lad of seventeen, who was just beginning to sow his wild\noats. At first their union seemed merely platonic, with Henri showing\nan intensely spiritual devotion to Diane. But it soon became clear tiiat\nhe loved her in every way, preferring her bed to that of his young wife,\nCatherine de' Medicis.\n\n\nIn 1547 King Francis died and Henri ascended to the throne. This\nnew situation posed perils for Diane de Poitiers. She had just turned\nforty-eight, and despite her notorious cold baths and rumored youth\npotions, she was beginning to show her age; now that Henri was king,\nperhaps he would return to the queen's bed, and do as other kings had\ndonechoose mistresses from the bevy of beauties who made the French\ncourt the envy of Europe. He was, after all, only twenty-eight, and cut\na dashing figure. But Diane did not give up so easily. She would\ncontinue to enthrall her lover, as she had enthralled him for the past\neleven years.\n\nDiane's secret weapons were symbols and images, to which she\nhad always paid great attention. Early on in her relationship with\nHenri, she had created a motif by intertwining her initials with his, to\nsymbolize their union. The idea worked like a charm: Henri put this\ninsignia everywhere on his royal robes, on monuments, on churches,\non the facade of the\n\nwhere Antony awaited the queen enthroned on his tribunal, until\nat last he was left sitting quite alone. And the word spread on every\nside that Aphrodite had come to revel with Dionysus for the happiness\nof Asia. Antony then sent a message inviting Cleopatra to dine with\nhim. But she thought it more appropriate that he should come to her,\nand so, as he wished to show his courtesy and goodwill, he accepted\nand went. He found the preparations made to receive him magnificent\nbeyond words, but what astonished him most of all was the\nextraordinary number of lights. So many of these, it is said, were let\ndown from the roof and displayed on all sides at once, and they were\narranged and grouped in such ingenious patterns in relation to each\nother, some in squares and some in circles, that they created as brilliant\na spectacle as can ever have been devised to delight the eye.\n\nlife of antony, Plutarch, c. a.d. 46-120\n\nIn the Middle Ages the symbolist attitude was much more in\nevidence. ... Symbolism appears as a sort of short cut of thought.\nInstead of looking for the relation\n\nbetween two things by following the hidden detours of their\ncausal connexions, thought makes a leap and discovers their relation\nnot in the connexion of cause and effects, but in a connexion of\nsignification. ... Symbolist thought permits an infinity of relations\n\nbetween things. Each thing may denote a number of distinct ideas by\nits different special qualities, and a quality may have several symbolic\nmeanings. The highest conceptions have symbols by the thousand.\nNothing is too humble to represent and glory the sublime. The walnut\nsignifies Christ: the sweet kernel is His divine nature, the green and\npulpy outer peel is His humanity, the wooden shell between is the\ncross. Thus all things raise his thoughts to the eternal.. .. Every\nprecious stone, besides its natural splendour sparkles with the\nbrilliance of its symbolic values. The assimilation of roses and\nvirginity is much more than a poetic comparison, for it reveals their\ncommon essence. As each notion arises in the mind the logic of\nsymbolism creates an harmony of ideas.\n\nTHE WANING OF THE\n\nMIDDLE AGES,\n\nJOHAN HUIZINGA,\n\nLouvre, then the royal palace in Paris. Diane's favorite colors\nwere black and white, which she wore exclusively, and wherever it\nwas possible the insignia appeared in these colors. Everyone\nrecognized the symbol and its meaning. Soon after Henri took the\nthrone, however, Diane went still further: She decided to identify\nherself with the Roman goddess Diana, her namesake. Diana was the\ngoddess of the hunt, the traditional royal pastime and the particular\npassion of Henri. Equally important, in Renaissance art she\nsymbolized chastity and purity. For a woman like Diane to identify\nherself with tiiis goddess would instantly call up those images in the\ncourt, giving her an air of respectability. Symbolizing her \u201cchaste\u201d\nrelationship with Henri, it would also set her apart from the adulterous\nliaisons of royal mistresses past.\n\nTo effect this association, Diane began by completely\ntransforming her casde at Anet. She razed the building's structure and\nin its place erected a magnificent Doric-columned edifice modeled\nafter a Roman temple. It was made in white Normandy stone flecked\nwith black silex, reproducing Diane's trademark colors of black and\nwhite. The insignia of her and Henri's initials appeared on the columns,\nthe doors, the windows, the carpet. Meanwhile, symbols of\nDianacrescent moons, stags, and hounds adorned the gates and facade.\nInside, enormous tapestries depicting episodes in the life of the\n\ngoddess lay on the floors and hung on the walls. In the garden stood\nthe famous Goujon sculpture Diane Chasseresse, which is now in the\nLouvre, and which had an uncanny resemblance to Diane de Poitiers.\nPaintings and other depictions of Diana appeared in every corner of the\ncasde.\n\nAnet overwhelmed Henri, who soon was trumpeting the image of\nDiane de Poitiers as a Roman goddess. In 1548, when the couple\nappeared together in Lyons for a royal celebration, the townspeople\nwelcomed them with a tableau vivant depicting a scene with Diana the\nhuntress. France's greatest poet of die period, Pierre de Ronsard, began\nto write verses in honor of Dianaindeed a kind of cult of Diana sprang\nup, all inspired by the king's mistress. It seemed to Henri that Diane\nhad given herself a kind of divine aura, and as if he were destined to\nworship her for the rest of his life. And until his death, in 1559, he did\nremain faithful to hermaking her a duchess, giving her untold wealth,\nand displaying an almost religious devotion to his first and only\nmistress.\n\nInterpretation\n\nDiane de Poitiers, a woman from a modest bourgeois background,\nmanaged to captivate Henri for over twenty years. By the time he died\nshe was well into her sixties, yet his passion for her only increased\nwith the years. She knew the king well. He was not an intellectual but\na lover of die outdoorshe particularly loved jousting tournaments, with\ntheir bright pennants, brilliandy caparisoned horses, and beautifully\ndressed women. Henri's love of visual splendor seemed childlike to\nDiane, and she played on this weakness of his at every opportunity.\n\nMost astute of all was Diane's appropriation of the goddess Diana.\nHere she took the game beyond physical imagery into the realm of the\npsychic symbol. It was quite a feat to transform a king's mistress into\nan emblem of power and purity, but she managed it. Without the\nresonance of the goddess, Diane was merely an aging courtesan. With\nthe imagery and symbolism of Diana on her shoulders, she seemed a\nmythic force, destined for greatness.\n\nYou too can play with images like these, weaving visual clues\ninto an encompassing gestalt, as Diane did with her colors and her\ninsignia. Establish a trademark like these to set yourself apart. Then\ntake the game further: Find an image or symbol from the past that will\n\nneatly fit your situation, and put it on your shoulders like a cape. It will\nmake you seem larger man life.\n\nBecause of the light it shines on the other stars which make up a\nkind of\n\ncourt around it, because of the just and equal distribution of its\nrays to\n\nall alike, because of the good it brings to all places, producing\nlife, joy\n\nand action, because of its constancy from which it never varies, I\nchose\n\nthe sun as the most magnificent image to represent a great leader.\n\nLouis XIV, the Sun King, 1638-1715\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nUsing words to plead your case is risky business: Words are\ndangerous instruments, and often go astray. The words people use to\npersuade us virtually invite us to reflect on them with words of our\nown; we mull them over, and often end up believing the opposite of\nwhat they say. (That is part of our perverse nature.) It also happens that\nwords offend us, stirring up associations unintended by the speaker.\n\nThe visual, on the other hand, short-circuits the labyrinth of\nwords. It strikes with an emotional power and immediacy that leave no\ngaps for reflection and doubt. Like music, it leaps right over rational,\nreasonable thoughts. Imagine the Moon Doctor trying to make a case\nfor his medical practice, trying to convince the unconverted by telling\nthem about the healing powers of the moon, and about his own special\nconnection to a distant object in the sky. Fortunately for him, he was\nable to create a compelling spectacle that made words unnecessary.\nThe moment his patients entered the beer hall, the image of the moon\nspoke eloquently enough.\n\nUnderstand: Words put you on the defensive. If you have to\nexplain yourself your power is already in question. The image, on the\nother hand, imposes itself as a given. It discourages questions, creates\nforceful associations, resists unintended interpretations, communicates\ninstantly, and forges bonds that transcend social differences. Words stir\nup arguments and divisions; images bring people together. They are\nthe quintessential instruments of power.\n\nThe symbol has the same force, whether it is visual (the statue of\n\nThere was a man named Sakamotoya Hechigwan who lived in\nupper Kyoto.... When [Emperor] Hideyoshi gave his great Cha-no-yu\n[tea ceremony] meeting at Kitano in the tenth month of 1588,\nHechigwan set up a great red umbrella nine feet across mounted on a\nstick seven feet high. The circumference of the handle he surrounded\nfor about two feet by a reed fence in such a way that the rays of the sun\nwere reflected from it and diffused the colour of the umbrella all\naround. This device pleased Hideyoshi so much that he remitted\nHechigwan's taxes as a reward.\n\nCHA-NO-YU:\n\nTHE JAPANESE TEA\n\nCEREMONY,\n\nA. L. Sadler, 1962\n\nDiana) or a verbal description of something visual (the words \u201cthe\nSun King\u201d). The symbolic object stands for something else, something\nabstract (such as the image \u201cDiana\u201d standing for chastity). The abstract\nconcept purity, patriotism, courage, loveis full of emotional and\npowerful associations. The symbol is a shortcut of expression,\ncontaining dozens of meanings in one simple phrase or object. The\nsymbol of the Sun King, as explained by Louis XIV, can be read on\nmany layers, but the beauty of it is that its associations required no\nexplanation, spoke immediately to his subjects, distinguished him from\nall other kings, and conjured up a kind of majesty that went far beyond\nthe words themselves. The symbol contains untold power.\n\nThe first step in using symbols and images is to understand the\nprimacy of sight among the senses. Before the Renaissance, it has been\nargued, sight and the other sensestaste, touch, and so onoperated on a\nrelatively equal plane. Since then, however, the visual has come to\ndominate the others, and is the sense we most depend on and trust. As\nGracian said, \u201cThe truth is generally seen, rarely heard.\u201d When the\nRenaissance painter Fra Filippo Lippi was a captured slave among the\nMoors, he won his freedom by sketching a drawing of his master on a\nwhite wall with a piece of charcoal; when the owner saw the drawing,\nhe instantly understood the power of a man who could make such\nimages, and let Fra Lippi go. That one image was far more powerful\nthan any argument the artist could have made with words.\n\nNever neglect the way you arrange things visually. Factors like\ncolor, for example, have enormous symbolic resonance. When the con\nartist Yellow Kid Weil created a newsletter touting the phony stocks he\nwas peddling, he called it the \u201cRed Letter Newsletter\u201d and had it\nprinted, at considerable expense, in red ink. The color created a sense\nof urgency, power, and good fortune. Weil recognized details like these\nas keys to deceptionas do modern advertisers and mass-marketers. If\nyou use \u201cgold\u201d in the title of anything you are trying to sell, for\nexample, print it in gold. Since the eye predominates, people will\nrespond more to the color than to the word.\n\nThe visual contains great emotional power. The Roman emperor\nCon-stantine worshipped the sun as a god for most of his life; one day,\nthough, he looked up at die sun, and saw a cross superimposed on it.\nThe vision of the cross over the sun proved to him the ascendancy of\nthe new religion, and he converted not just himself but the whole\nRoman Empire to Christianity soon thereafter. All the preaching and\nproselytizing in the world could not have been as powerful. Find and\nassociate yourself with the images and symbols that will communicate\nin this immediate way today, and you will have untold power.\n\nMost effective of all is a new combinationa fusion of images and\nsymbols that have not been seen together before, but that through their\nassociation clearly demonstrate your new idea, message, religion. The\ncreation of new images and symbols out of old ones in this way has a\npoetic effect viewers' associations run rampant, giving them a sense of\nparticipation.\n\nVisual images often appear in a sequence, and the order in which\nthey appear creates a symbol. The first to appear, for instance,\nsymbolizes power; the image at the center seems to have central\nimportance.\n\nNear the end of World War II, orders came down from General\nEisenhower that American troops were to lead die way into Paris after\nits liberation from the Nazis. The French general Charles de Gaulle,\nhowever, realized that this sequence would imply that the Americans\nnow commanded die fate of France. Through much manipulation, de\nGaulle made certain that he and the French Second Armored Division\nwould appear at the head of the liberating force. The strategy worked:\nAfter he had successfully pulled off this stunt, the Allies started\n\ntreating him as the new leader of an independent France. De Gaulle\nknew tiiat a leader has to locate himself literally at die head of his\ntroops. This visual association is crucial to the emotional response that\nhe needs to elicit.\n\nThings change in die game of symbols: It is probably no longer\npossible to pose as a \u201csun king,\u201d or to wrap the mande of Diana around\nyou. Yet you can associate yourself with such symbols more indirecdy.\nAnd, of course, you can make your own mydiology out of figures from\nmore recent history, people who are comfortably dead but still\npowerfully associative in die public eye. The idea is to give yourself an\naura, a stature tiiat your normal banal appearance simply will not\ncreate. By herself Diane de Poitiers had no such radiant powers; she\nwas as human and ordinary as most of us. But the symbol elevated her\nabove die human lot, and made her seem divine.\n\nUsing symbols also has a courtier-like effect, since diey are often\ngentler dian brutish words. The psychotherapist Dr. Milton H.\nErickson always tried to find symbols and images that would\ncommunicate to die patient in ways that words could not. When\ndealing witii a severely troubled patient, he would not question him\ndirectiy but would talk about something irrelevant, such as driving\ntiirough the desert in Arizona, where he practiced in the 1950s. In\ndescribing this he would eventually come to an appropriate symbol for\nwhat he suspected was tile man's problem. If he felt the patient was\nisolated, say, Dr. Erickson would talk of a single iron-wood tree, and\nhow its isolation left it battered by the winds. Making an emotional\nconnection with die tree as a symbol, die patient would open up more\nreadily to the doctor's probing.\n\nUse die power of symbols as a way to rally, animate, and unite\nyour troops or team. During die rebellion against the French crown in\n1648, those loyal to the king disparaged the rebels by comparing them\nto the slingshots (in French, frondes) that little boys use to frighten big\nboys. Cardinal de Retz decided to turn this disparaging term into die\nrebels' symbol: The uprising was now known as the Fronde, and die\nrebels as frondeurs. They began to wear sashes in tiieir hats that\nsymbolized the slingshot, and the word became tiieir rallying cry.\nWidiout it the rebellion might well have petered out. Always find a\n\n\nsymbol to represent your causedie more emotional associations, the\nbetter.\n\nThe best way to use images and symbols is to organize tiiem into\na\n\ngrand spectacle that awes people and distracts them from\nunpleasant realities. This is easy to do: People love what is grand,\nspectacular, and larger than life. Appeal to their emotions and they will\nflock to your spectacle in hordes. The visual is the easiest route to their\nhearts.\n\nImage: The Cross and the Sun. Crucifixion and total radiance.\nWith one imposed over the other, a new reality takes shape a new\npower is in the ascendant. The symbolno explanation necessary.\n\nAuthority: The people are always impressed by the superficial\nappearance of things....

Gradually the crowds\ndrifted away from the marketplace,\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW I\n\nIn the early 1780s, word spread through Berlin of the strange and\nspectacular medical practice of a Dr. Weisleder. He performed his\nmiracles in an enormous converted beer hall, outside which Berliners\nbegan to notice ever longer lines of peoplethe blind, the lame, anyone\nwith an illness incurable by normal medicine. When it leaked out that\n\n\nthe doctor worked by exposing the patient to the rays of the moon, he\nsoon became dubbed The Moon Doctor of Berlin.\n\nSometime in 1783, it was reported that Dr. Weisleder had cured a\nwell-to-do woman of a terrible ailment. He suddenly became a\ncelebrity. Previously only the poorest Berliners had been seen waiting\noutside the beer hall in their rags; now magnificent carriages were\nparked outside, and gentlemen in frock coats, and ladies with\nenormous coiffures, lined the street as sunset drew near. Even folk\nwith the mildest of ailments came, out of sheer curiosity. As they\nwaited in line, the poorer clients would explain to the gentlemen and\nladies that the doctor only practiced when the moon was in its\nincrescent phase. Many would add that they themselves had already\nbeen exposed to die healing powers he called forth from the rays of the\nmoon. Even those who felt cured kept coming back, drawn by this\npowerful experience.\n\nInside the beer hall, a strange and stirring spectacle greeted the\nvisitor: Packed into the entrance hall was a crowd of all classes and\nethnic backgrounds, a veritable Tower of Babel. Through tall windows\non the northern side of the hall, silvery moonlight poured in at odd\nangles. The doctor and his wife, who, it seemed, was also able to effect\nthe cure, practiced on the second floor, which was reached by a\nstairway, at the end of the hall. As the line edged closer to the stairs,\nthe sick would hear shouts and cries from above, and word would\nspread of, perhaps, a blind gentleman suddenly able to see.\n\nOnce upstairs, the line would fork in two directions, toward a\nnorthern room for the doctor, a southern one for his wife, who worked\nonly on the ladies. Finally, after hours of anticipation and waiting in\nline, the gentlemen patients would be led before the amazing doctor\nhimself, an elderly man with a few stalks of wild gray hair and an air\nof nervous energy. He would take the patient (let us say a young boy,\nbrought in by his father), uncover the afflicted body part, and lift the\nboy up to the window, which faced the light of the moon. He would\ntub the site of the injury or illness, mumble something unintelligible,\nlook knowingly at the moon, and then, after collecting his fee, send the\nboy and his father on their way. Meanwhile, in the south-facing room,\nhis wife would be doing the same with the ladieswhich was odd, really,\nsince the moon cannot appear in two places at once; it cannot have\n\n\nbeen visible, in other words, from both windows. Apparendy the mere\nthought, idea, and symbol of the moon were enough, for the ladies did\nnot complain, and would later remark confidently that the wife of the\nMoon Doctor had the same healing powers as he.\n\nInterpretation\n\nDr. Weisleder may have known nothing about medicine, but he\nunderstood human nature. He recognized that people do not always\nwant words, or rational explanations, or demonstrations of the powers\nof science; they want an immediate appeal to their emotions. Give\nthem that and they will do the restsuch as imagine they can be healed\nby the light reflected from a rock a quarter million miles away. Dr.\nWeisleder had no need of pills, or of lengtfry lectures on the moon's\npower, or of any silly gadgetry to amplify its rays. He understood that\nthe simpler the spectacle the betterjust the moonlight pouring in from\nthe side, the stairway leading to the heavens, and the rays of the moon,\nwhether directly visible or not. Any added effects might have made it\nseem that the moon was not strong enough on its own. And the moon\nwas strong enoughit was a magnet for fantasies, as it has been\nthroughout history. Simply by associating himself with the image of\nthe moon, the doctor gained power.\n\nRemember: Your search for power depends on shortcuts. You\nmust always circumvent people's suspicions, their perverse desire to\nresist your will. Images are an extremely effective shortcut: Bypassing\nthe head, the seat of doubt and resistance, they aim straight for the\nheart. Overwhelming the eyes, they create powerful associations,\nbringing people together and stirring their emotions. With the white\nlight of the moon in their eyes, your targets are blinded to the\ndeceptions you practice.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II\n\nIn 1536 the future king Henri II of France took his first mistress,\nDiane de Poitiers. Diane was thirty-seven at the time, and was the\nwidow of the grand seneschal of Normandy. Henri, meanwhile, was a\nsprightly lad of seventeen, who was just beginning to sow his wild\noats. At first their union seemed merely platonic, with Henri showing\nan intensely spiritual devotion to Diane. But it soon became clear tiiat\nhe loved her in every way, preferring her bed to that of his young wife,\nCatherine de' Medicis.\n\n\nIn 1547 King Francis died and Henri ascended to the throne. This\nnew situation posed perils for Diane de Poitiers. She had just turned\nforty-eight, and despite her notorious cold baths and rumored youth\npotions, she was beginning to show her age; now that Henri was king,\nperhaps he would return to the queen's bed, and do as other kings had\ndonechoose mistresses from the bevy of beauties who made the French\ncourt the envy of Europe. He was, after all, only twenty-eight, and cut\na dashing figure. But Diane did not give up so easily. She would\ncontinue to enthrall her lover, as she had enthralled him for the past\neleven years.\n\nDiane's secret weapons were symbols and images, to which she\nhad always paid great attention. Early on in her relationship with\nHenri, she had created a motif by intertwining her initials with his, to\nsymbolize their union. The idea worked like a charm: Henri put this\ninsignia everywhere on his royal robes, on monuments, on churches,\non the facade of the\n\nwhere Antony awaited the queen enthroned on his tribunal, until\nat last he was left sitting quite alone. And the word spread on every\nside that Aphrodite had come to revel with Dionysus for the happiness\nof Asia. Antony then sent a message inviting Cleopatra to dine with\nhim. But she thought it more appropriate that he should come to her,\nand so, as he wished to show his courtesy and goodwill, he accepted\nand went. He found the preparations made to receive him magnificent\nbeyond words, but what astonished him most of all was the\nextraordinary number of lights. So many of these, it is said, were let\ndown from the roof and displayed on all sides at once, and they were\narranged and grouped in such ingenious patterns in relation to each\nother, some in squares and some in circles, that they created as brilliant\na spectacle as can ever have been devised to delight the eye.\n\nlife of antony, Plutarch, c. a.d. 46-120\n\nIn the Middle Ages the symbolist attitude was much more in\nevidence. ... Symbolism appears as a sort of short cut of thought.\nInstead of looking for the relation\n\nbetween two things by following the hidden detours of their\ncausal connexions, thought makes a leap and discovers their relation\nnot in the connexion of cause and effects, but in a connexion of\nsignification. ... Symbolist thought permits an infinity of relations\n\nbetween things. Each thing may denote a number of distinct ideas by\nits different special qualities, and a quality may have several symbolic\nmeanings. The highest conceptions have symbols by the thousand.\nNothing is too humble to represent and glory the sublime. The walnut\nsignifies Christ: the sweet kernel is His divine nature, the green and\npulpy outer peel is His humanity, the wooden shell between is the\ncross. Thus all things raise his thoughts to the eternal.. .. Every\nprecious stone, besides its natural splendour sparkles with the\nbrilliance of its symbolic values. The assimilation of roses and\nvirginity is much more than a poetic comparison, for it reveals their\ncommon essence. As each notion arises in the mind the logic of\nsymbolism creates an harmony of ideas.\n\nTHE WANING OF THE\n\nMIDDLE AGES,\n\nJOHAN HUIZINGA,\n\nLouvre, then the royal palace in Paris. Diane's favorite colors\nwere black and white, which she wore exclusively, and wherever it\nwas possible the insignia appeared in these colors. Everyone\nrecognized the symbol and its meaning. Soon after Henri took the\nthrone, however, Diane went still further: She decided to identify\nherself with the Roman goddess Diana, her namesake. Diana was the\ngoddess of the hunt, the traditional royal pastime and the particular\npassion of Henri. Equally important, in Renaissance art she\nsymbolized chastity and purity. For a woman like Diane to identify\nherself with tiiis goddess would instantly call up those images in the\ncourt, giving her an air of respectability. Symbolizing her \u201cchaste\u201d\nrelationship with Henri, it would also set her apart from the adulterous\nliaisons of royal mistresses past.\n\nTo effect this association, Diane began by completely\ntransforming her casde at Anet. She razed the building's structure and\nin its place erected a magnificent Doric-columned edifice modeled\nafter a Roman temple. It was made in white Normandy stone flecked\nwith black silex, reproducing Diane's trademark colors of black and\nwhite. The insignia of her and Henri's initials appeared on the columns,\nthe doors, the windows, the carpet. Meanwhile, symbols of\nDianacrescent moons, stags, and hounds adorned the gates and facade.\nInside, enormous tapestries depicting episodes in the life of the\n\ngoddess lay on the floors and hung on the walls. In the garden stood\nthe famous Goujon sculpture Diane Chasseresse, which is now in the\nLouvre, and which had an uncanny resemblance to Diane de Poitiers.\nPaintings and other depictions of Diana appeared in every corner of the\ncasde.\n\nAnet overwhelmed Henri, who soon was trumpeting the image of\nDiane de Poitiers as a Roman goddess. In 1548, when the couple\nappeared together in Lyons for a royal celebration, the townspeople\nwelcomed them with a tableau vivant depicting a scene with Diana the\nhuntress. France's greatest poet of die period, Pierre de Ronsard, began\nto write verses in honor of Dianaindeed a kind of cult of Diana sprang\nup, all inspired by the king's mistress. It seemed to Henri that Diane\nhad given herself a kind of divine aura, and as if he were destined to\nworship her for the rest of his life. And until his death, in 1559, he did\nremain faithful to hermaking her a duchess, giving her untold wealth,\nand displaying an almost religious devotion to his first and only\nmistress.\n\nInterpretation\n\nDiane de Poitiers, a woman from a modest bourgeois background,\nmanaged to captivate Henri for over twenty years. By the time he died\nshe was well into her sixties, yet his passion for her only increased\nwith the years. She knew the king well. He was not an intellectual but\na lover of die outdoorshe particularly loved jousting tournaments, with\ntheir bright pennants, brilliandy caparisoned horses, and beautifully\ndressed women. Henri's love of visual splendor seemed childlike to\nDiane, and she played on this weakness of his at every opportunity.\n\nMost astute of all was Diane's appropriation of the goddess Diana.\nHere she took the game beyond physical imagery into the realm of the\npsychic symbol. It was quite a feat to transform a king's mistress into\nan emblem of power and purity, but she managed it. Without the\nresonance of the goddess, Diane was merely an aging courtesan. With\nthe imagery and symbolism of Diana on her shoulders, she seemed a\nmythic force, destined for greatness.\n\nYou too can play with images like these, weaving visual clues\ninto an encompassing gestalt, as Diane did with her colors and her\ninsignia. Establish a trademark like these to set yourself apart. Then\ntake the game further: Find an image or symbol from the past that will\n\nneatly fit your situation, and put it on your shoulders like a cape. It will\nmake you seem larger man life.\n\nBecause of the light it shines on the other stars which make up a\nkind of\n\ncourt around it, because of the just and equal distribution of its\nrays to\n\nall alike, because of the good it brings to all places, producing\nlife, joy\n\nand action, because of its constancy from which it never varies, I\nchose\n\nthe sun as the most magnificent image to represent a great leader.\n\nLouis XIV, the Sun King, 1638-1715\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nUsing words to plead your case is risky business: Words are\ndangerous instruments, and often go astray. The words people use to\npersuade us virtually invite us to reflect on them with words of our\nown; we mull them over, and often end up believing the opposite of\nwhat they say. (That is part of our perverse nature.) It also happens that\nwords offend us, stirring up associations unintended by the speaker.\n\nThe visual, on the other hand, short-circuits the labyrinth of\nwords. It strikes with an emotional power and immediacy that leave no\ngaps for reflection and doubt. Like music, it leaps right over rational,\nreasonable thoughts. Imagine the Moon Doctor trying to make a case\nfor his medical practice, trying to convince the unconverted by telling\nthem about the healing powers of the moon, and about his own special\nconnection to a distant object in the sky. Fortunately for him, he was\nable to create a compelling spectacle that made words unnecessary.\nThe moment his patients entered the beer hall, the image of the moon\nspoke eloquently enough.\n\nUnderstand: Words put you on the defensive. If you have to\nexplain yourself your power is already in question. The image, on the\nother hand, imposes itself as a given. It discourages questions, creates\nforceful associations, resists unintended interpretations, communicates\ninstantly, and forges bonds that transcend social differences. Words stir\nup arguments and divisions; images bring people together. They are\nthe quintessential instruments of power.\n\nThe symbol has the same force, whether it is visual (the statue of\n\nThere was a man named Sakamotoya Hechigwan who lived in\nupper Kyoto.... When [Emperor] Hideyoshi gave his great Cha-no-yu\n[tea ceremony] meeting at Kitano in the tenth month of 1588,\nHechigwan set up a great red umbrella nine feet across mounted on a\nstick seven feet high. The circumference of the handle he surrounded\nfor about two feet by a reed fence in such a way that the rays of the sun\nwere reflected from it and diffused the colour of the umbrella all\naround. This device pleased Hideyoshi so much that he remitted\nHechigwan's taxes as a reward.\n\nCHA-NO-YU:\n\nTHE JAPANESE TEA\n\nCEREMONY,\n\nA. L. Sadler, 1962\n\nDiana) or a verbal description of something visual (the words \u201cthe\nSun King\u201d). The symbolic object stands for something else, something\nabstract (such as the image \u201cDiana\u201d standing for chastity). The abstract\nconcept purity, patriotism, courage, loveis full of emotional and\npowerful associations. The symbol is a shortcut of expression,\ncontaining dozens of meanings in one simple phrase or object. The\nsymbol of the Sun King, as explained by Louis XIV, can be read on\nmany layers, but the beauty of it is that its associations required no\nexplanation, spoke immediately to his subjects, distinguished him from\nall other kings, and conjured up a kind of majesty that went far beyond\nthe words themselves. The symbol contains untold power.\n\nThe first step in using symbols and images is to understand the\nprimacy of sight among the senses. Before the Renaissance, it has been\nargued, sight and the other sensestaste, touch, and so onoperated on a\nrelatively equal plane. Since then, however, the visual has come to\ndominate the others, and is the sense we most depend on and trust. As\nGracian said, \u201cThe truth is generally seen, rarely heard.\u201d When the\nRenaissance painter Fra Filippo Lippi was a captured slave among the\nMoors, he won his freedom by sketching a drawing of his master on a\nwhite wall with a piece of charcoal; when the owner saw the drawing,\nhe instantly understood the power of a man who could make such\nimages, and let Fra Lippi go. That one image was far more powerful\nthan any argument the artist could have made with words.\n\nNever neglect the way you arrange things visually. Factors like\ncolor, for example, have enormous symbolic resonance. When the con\nartist Yellow Kid Weil created a newsletter touting the phony stocks he\nwas peddling, he called it the \u201cRed Letter Newsletter\u201d and had it\nprinted, at considerable expense, in red ink. The color created a sense\nof urgency, power, and good fortune. Weil recognized details like these\nas keys to deceptionas do modern advertisers and mass-marketers. If\nyou use \u201cgold\u201d in the title of anything you are trying to sell, for\nexample, print it in gold. Since the eye predominates, people will\nrespond more to the color than to the word.\n\nThe visual contains great emotional power. The Roman emperor\nCon-stantine worshipped the sun as a god for most of his life; one day,\nthough, he looked up at die sun, and saw a cross superimposed on it.\nThe vision of the cross over the sun proved to him the ascendancy of\nthe new religion, and he converted not just himself but the whole\nRoman Empire to Christianity soon thereafter. All the preaching and\nproselytizing in the world could not have been as powerful. Find and\nassociate yourself with the images and symbols that will communicate\nin this immediate way today, and you will have untold power.\n\nMost effective of all is a new combinationa fusion of images and\nsymbols that have not been seen together before, but that through their\nassociation clearly demonstrate your new idea, message, religion. The\ncreation of new images and symbols out of old ones in this way has a\npoetic effect viewers' associations run rampant, giving them a sense of\nparticipation.\n\nVisual images often appear in a sequence, and the order in which\nthey appear creates a symbol. The first to appear, for instance,\nsymbolizes power; the image at the center seems to have central\nimportance.\n\nNear the end of World War II, orders came down from General\nEisenhower that American troops were to lead die way into Paris after\nits liberation from the Nazis. The French general Charles de Gaulle,\nhowever, realized that this sequence would imply that the Americans\nnow commanded die fate of France. Through much manipulation, de\nGaulle made certain that he and the French Second Armored Division\nwould appear at the head of the liberating force. The strategy worked:\nAfter he had successfully pulled off this stunt, the Allies started\n\ntreating him as the new leader of an independent France. De Gaulle\nknew tiiat a leader has to locate himself literally at die head of his\ntroops. This visual association is crucial to the emotional response that\nhe needs to elicit.\n\nThings change in die game of symbols: It is probably no longer\npossible to pose as a \u201csun king,\u201d or to wrap the mande of Diana around\nyou. Yet you can associate yourself with such symbols more indirecdy.\nAnd, of course, you can make your own mydiology out of figures from\nmore recent history, people who are comfortably dead but still\npowerfully associative in die public eye. The idea is to give yourself an\naura, a stature tiiat your normal banal appearance simply will not\ncreate. By herself Diane de Poitiers had no such radiant powers; she\nwas as human and ordinary as most of us. But the symbol elevated her\nabove die human lot, and made her seem divine.\n\nUsing symbols also has a courtier-like effect, since diey are often\ngentler dian brutish words. The psychotherapist Dr. Milton H.\nErickson always tried to find symbols and images that would\ncommunicate to die patient in ways that words could not. When\ndealing witii a severely troubled patient, he would not question him\ndirectiy but would talk about something irrelevant, such as driving\ntiirough the desert in Arizona, where he practiced in the 1950s. In\ndescribing this he would eventually come to an appropriate symbol for\nwhat he suspected was tile man's problem. If he felt the patient was\nisolated, say, Dr. Erickson would talk of a single iron-wood tree, and\nhow its isolation left it battered by the winds. Making an emotional\nconnection with die tree as a symbol, die patient would open up more\nreadily to the doctor's probing.\n\nUse die power of symbols as a way to rally, animate, and unite\nyour troops or team. During die rebellion against the French crown in\n1648, those loyal to the king disparaged the rebels by comparing them\nto the slingshots (in French, frondes) that little boys use to frighten big\nboys. Cardinal de Retz decided to turn this disparaging term into die\nrebels' symbol: The uprising was now known as the Fronde, and die\nrebels as frondeurs. They began to wear sashes in tiieir hats that\nsymbolized the slingshot, and the word became tiieir rallying cry.\nWidiout it the rebellion might well have petered out. Always find a\n\n\nsymbol to represent your causedie more emotional associations, the\nbetter.\n\nThe best way to use images and symbols is to organize tiiem into\na\n\ngrand spectacle that awes people and distracts them from\nunpleasant realities. This is easy to do: People love what is grand,\nspectacular, and larger than life. Appeal to their emotions and they will\nflock to your spectacle in hordes. The visual is the easiest route to their\nhearts.\n\nImage: The Cross and the Sun. Crucifixion and total radiance.\nWith one imposed over the other, a new reality takes shape a new\npower is in the ascendant.

Thought is\nfree; it cannot and should not be coerced; retire into the sanctuary of\nyour silence and if you sometimes allow yourself to break it, do so\nunder the aegis of a discreet few.\n\nBaltasar Gractan, 1601-1658\n\nTRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW\n\nAround the year 478 B.C., the city of Sparta sent an expedition to\nPersia led by die young Spartan nobleman Pausanias. The city-states of\nGreece had recently fought off a mighty invasion from Persia, and now\nPausanias, along with allied ships from Atiiens, had orders to punish\n\nthe invaders and win back the islands and coastal towns that the\nPersians had occupied. Bodi die Athenians and the Spartans had great\nrespect for Pausaniashe had proven himself as a fearless warrior, with\na flair for the dramatic.\n\nWith amazing speed, Pausanias and his troops took Cyprus, then\nmoved on to the mainland of Asia Minor known as the Hellespont and\ncaptured Byzantium (modern-day Istanbul). Now master of part of the\nPersian empire, Pausanias began to show signs of behavior that went\nbeyond his normal flamboyance. He appeared in public wearing\npomades in his hair and flowing Persian robes, and accompanied by a\nbodyguard of Egyptians. He held lavish banquets in which he sat in the\nPersian manner and demanded to be entertained. He stopped seeing his\nold friends, entered into communication with die Persian King Xerxes,\nand all in all affected the style and manner of a Persian dictator.\n\nClearly power and success had gone to Pausanias's head. His\narmy Athenians and Spartans alikeat first thought this a passing fancy:\nHe had always been a bit exaggerated in his gestures. But when he\nflaunted his disdain for die Greeks' simple way of life, and insulted the\ncommon Greek soldier, they began to feel he had gone too far.\nAlthough there was no concrete evidence for mis, rumors spread diat\nhe had gone over to the odier side, and that he dreamed of becoming a\nkind of Greek Xerxes. To quell die possibility of mutiny, the Spartans\nrelieved Pausanias of his command and called him home.\n\nPausanias, however, continued to dress in the Persian style, even\nin Sparta. After a few months he independently hired a trireme and\nreturned to the Hellespont, telling his compatriots he was going to\ncontinue the fight against the Persians. Actually, however, he had\ndifferent plansto make himself ruler of all Greece, with the aid of\nXerxes himself. The Spartans declared him a public enemy and sent a\nship to capture him. Pausanias surrendered, certain that he could clear\nhimself of the charges of treason. It did come out during die trial diat\nduring his reign as commander he had offended his fellow Greeks time\nand again, erecting monuments, for instance, in his own name, rather\nthan in those of the cities whose troops had fought alongside him, as\nwas the custom. Yet Pausanias proved right: Despite die evidence of\nhis numerous contacts with die enemy, die Spartans refused to\nimprison a man of such noble birth, and let him go.\n\n\nNow thinking himself untouchable, Pausanias hired a messenger\nto take a letter to Xerxes, but the messenger instead took the letter to\nthe Spartan authorities. These men wanted to find out more, so they\nhad the messenger arrange to meet Pausanias in a temple where they\ncould hide and listen behind a partition. What Pausanias said shocked\ndiemdiey had never heard such contempt for their ways spoken so\nbrazenly by one of their ownand they made arrangements for his\nimmediate arrest.\n\nOn his way home from the temple, Pausanias got word of what\nhad happened. He ran to another temple to hide, but the authorities\nfollowed him there and placed sentries all around. Pausanias refused to\nsurrender. Unwilling to forcibly remove him from the sacred temple,\nthe authorities kept him trapped inside, until he eventually died of\nstarvation.\n\nInterpretation\n\nAt first glance it might seem that Pausanias simply fell in love\nwith another culture, a phenomenon as old as time. Never comfortable\nwith the asceticism of the Spartans, he found himself enthralled by the\nPersian love of luxury and sensual pleasure. He put on Persian robes\nand perfumes with a sense of deliverance from Greek discipline and\nsimplicity.\n\nThis is how it appears when people adopt a culture in which they\nwere not raised. Often, however, there is also something else at play:\nPeople who flaunt their infatuation with a different culture are\nexpressing a disdain and contempt for their own. They are using the\noutward appearance of the exotic to separate themselves from the\ncommon folk who unques-tioningly follow the local customs and laws,\nand to express their sense of superiority. Otherwise they would act\nwith more dignity, showing respect for those who do not share their\ndesires. Indeed their need to show their difference so dramatically\noften makes them disliked by the people whose beliefs they challenge,\nindirecdy and subtly, perhaps, but offensively nonetheless.\n\nAs Thucydides wrote of Pausanias, \u201cBy his contempt for the laws\nand his imitation of foreign ways he had made himself very widely\nsuspected of being unwilling to abide by normal standards.\u201d Cultures\nhave norms that reflect centuries of shared beliefs and ideals. Do not\nexpect to scoff at such things with impunity. You will be punished\n\nsomehow, even if just through isolationa position of real\npowerlessness.\n\nMany of us, like Pausanias, feel the siren call of the exotic, the\nforeign. Measure and moderate diis desire. Flaunting your pleasure in\nalien ways of thinking and acting will reveal a different motiveto\ndemonstrate your superiority over your fellows.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nDuring the late sixteenth century, a violent reaction against the\nProtestant Reformation erupted in Italy. The Counter-Reformation, as\nit was called, included its own version of the Inquisition to root out all\ndeviations from the Catholic Church. Among its victims was the\nscientist Galileo, but an important thinker who suffered even greater\npersecution was the Dominican monk and philosopher Tommaso\nCampanella.\n\nA follower of the materialist doctrine of the Roman philosopher\nEpicurus, Campanella did not believe in miracles, or in heaven and\nhell. The Church had promoted such superstitions, he wrote, to control\nthe common folk by keeping them in fear. Such ideas verged on\natheism, and Campanella expressed them incautiously. In 1593 the\nInquisition threw him\n\nBene vixit, qui bene latuit \u201cHe lives well who conceals himself\nwell.\u201d\n\na.d. 18\n\nOvid, c. 43 B.C.\n\nWise men [should be] like coffers with double bottoms: Which\nwhen others look into, being opened, they see not all that they hold.\n\nSir Walter Raleigh, 1554-1618\n\nWHK.N THK WATKHS WERE CHANCED\n\nOnce upon a time Khidr, the teacher of Moses, called upon\nmankind with a warning. At a certain date, he said, all the water in the\nworld which had not been specially hoarded, would disappear. It\nwould then be renewed, with different water, which would drive men\nmad.

Next he wrote a book that\nexpressed the exact opposite of his own beliefs. Finally, and most\nbrilliantiy of all, he disguised his ideas while insinuating them at the\nsame time.

You seem to conform to die prevailing\northodoxy, but diose who know will understand die irony involved.\nYou are protected.\n\nIt is inevitable in society that certain values and customs lose\ncontact with dieir original motives and become oppressive. And mere\nwill always be those who rebel against such oppression, harboring\nideas far ahead of their time. As Campanella was forced to realize,\nhowever, there is no point in making a display of your dangerous ideas\nif diey only bring you suffering and persecution.

Laying your pearls before swine will only bring you\ntrouble.\n\nFor a long time I have not said what I believed, nor do I ever\nbelieve\n\nwhat I say, and if indeed sometimes I do happen to tell the truth,\n\nLhide it among so many lies that it is hard to find.\n\nNiccolo Machiavelli, in a letter to Francesco Guicciardini, May\n17, 1521\n\nNever combat any man's opinion; for though you reached the age\nof Methuselah, you would never have done setting him right upon all\nthe absurd things that he believes-It is also well to avoid correcting\n\npeople's mistakes in conversation, however good your intentions may\nbe; for it is easy to offend people, and difficult, if not impossible to\nmend them.\n\nIf you feel irritated by the absurd remarks of two people whose\nconversation you happen to overhear, you should imagine that you are\nlistening to the dialogue of two fools in a comedy. Probatum est. The\nman who comes into the world with the notion that he is really going\nto instruct it in matters of the highest importance, may thank his stars\nif he escapes with a whole skin.\n\nArthur\n\nSchopenhauer,\n\n1788-1860\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nWe all tell lies and hide our true feelings, for complete free\nexpression is a social impossibility. From an early age we learn to\nconceal our thoughts, telling die prickly and insecure what we know\nthey want to hear, watching carefully lest we offend diem. For most of\nus tiiis is naturalthere are ideas and values diat most people accept, and\nit is pointless to argue. We believe what we want to, men, but on die\noutside we wear a mask.\n\nThere are people, however, who see such restraints as an\nintolerable infringement on their freedom, and who have a need to\nprove the superi-\n\n\u201cLook around you,\u201d\n\nsaid the citizen. \"This is\n\nthe largest market in\n\nthe world. \"\n\n\u201cOh surely not,\u201d said\n\nthe traveller.\n\n\"Well, perhaps not\n\nthe largest,\" said the\n\ncitizen, \"but much\n\nthe best.\"\n\n\"You are certainly\n\nwrong there, \" said the\n\ntraveller. \"I can tell\n\nyou. ...\"\n\nThey buried the\n\nstranger in the dusk.\n\nFABLES,\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson, 1850-1894\n\nIf Machiavelli had had\n\na prince for disciple,\n\nthe first thing he would\n\nhave recommended\n\nhim to do would have\n\nbeen to write a book\n\nagainst Machiavellism.\n\nVoltaire, 1694-1778\n\nority of their values and beliefs. In the end, though, their\narguments convince only a few and offend a great deal more. The\nreason arguments do not work is that most people hold their ideas and\nvalues widiout thinking about them. There is a strong emotional\ncontent in their beliefs: They really do not want to have to rework their\nhabits of thinking, and when you challenge them, whether directly\nthrough your arguments or indirecdy through your behavior, they are\nhostile.\n\nWise and clever people learn early on that they can display\nconventional behavior and mouth conventional ideas widiout having to\nbelieve in diem. The power these people gain from blending in is that\nof being left alone to have die thoughts tfiey want to have, and to\nexpress diem to the people they want to express them to, without\nsuffering isolation or ostracism. Once tiiey have established\nthemselves in a position of power, they can try to convince a wider\ncircle of the correctness of dieir ideas perhaps working indirecdy,\nusing Campanella's strategies of irony and insinuation.\n\nIn the late fourteenth century, the Spanish began a massive\npersecution of die Jews, murdering Uiousands and driving others out\nof the country. Those who remained in Spain were forced to convert.\nYet over die next three hundred years, die Spanish noticed a\nphenomenon diat disturbed them: Many of die converts lived dieir\noutward lives as Cadiolics, yet somehow managed to retain their\nJewish beliefs, practicing the religion in private. Many of these so-\ncalled Marranos (originally a derogatory term, being the Spanish for\n\n\u201cpig\u201d) attained high levels of government office, married into die\nnobility, and gave every appearance of Christian piety, only to be\ndiscovered late in life as practicing Jews. (The Spanish Inquisition was\nspecifically commissioned to ferret diem out.) Over the years they\nmastered die art of dissimulation, displaying crucifixes liberally,\ngiving generous gifts to churches, even occasionally making anti-\nSemitic remarksand all die while maintaining their inner freedom and\nbeliefs.\n\nIn society, the Marranos knew, outward appearances are what\nmatter. This remains true today. The strategy is simple: As Campanella\ndid in writing Atheism Conquered, make a show of blending in, even\ngoing so far as to be the most zealous advocate of the prevailing\northodoxy. If you stick to conventional appearances in public few will\nbelieve you think differendy in private.\n\nDo not be so foolish as to imagine that in our own time the old\northodoxies are gone. Jonas Salk, for instance, thought science had\ngotten past politics and protocol. And so, in his search for a polio\nvaccine, he broke all die rulesgoing public widi a discovery before\nshowing it to the scientific community, taking credit for die vaccine\nwidiout acknowledging die scientists who had paved die way, making\nhimself a star. The public may have loved him but scientists shunned\nhim. His disrespect for his community's orthodoxies left him isolated,\nand he wasted years trying to heal die breach, and struggling for\n\u2018unding and cooperation.\n\nBertolt Brecht underwent a modern form of Inquisitionthe House\n\nUn-American Activities Committeeand approached it with\nconsiderable canniness. Having worked off and on in die American\n\u2018ilm industry during World War II, in 1947 Brecht was summoned to\nappear before the committee to answer questions on his suspected\nCommunist sympathies. Other writers called before die committee\nmade a point of attacking its members, and of acting as belligerently as\npossible in order to gain sympadry for themselves. Brecht, on die other\nhand, who had actually worked steadfastly for the Communist cause,\nplayed the opposite game: He answered questions wim ambiguous\ngeneralities that defied easy interpretation. Call it the Campanella\nstrategy. Brecht even wore a suita rare event for him and made a point\nof smoking a cigar during the proceedings, knowing that a key\n\n\ncommittee member had a passion for cigars. In the end he charmed the\ncommittee members, who let him go scot-free.\n\nBrecht then moved to East Germany, where he encountered a\ndifferent kind of Inquisition. Here the Communists were in power, and\nthey criticized his plays as decadent and pessimistic. He did not argue\nwith them, but made small changes in the performance scripts to shut\nthem up. Meanwhile he managed to preserve the published texts as\nwritten. His outward conformity in both cases gave him die freedom to\nwork unhindered, without having to change his thinking. In the end, he\nmade his way safely through dangerous times in different countries\nthrough the use of litde dances of orthodoxy, and proved he was more\npowerful than the forces of repression.\n\nNot only do people of power avoid the offenses of Pausanias and\nSalk, they also learn to play the clever fox and feign the common\ntouch. This has been die ploy of con artists and politicians throughout\ndie centuries. Leaders like Julius Caesar and Franklin D. Roosevelt\nhave overcome their natural aristocratic stance to cultivate a familiarity\nwith the common man. They have expressed tiiis familiarity in little\ngestures, often symbolic, to show the people that their leaders share\npopular values, despite their different status.\n\nThe logical extension of this practice is die invaluable ability to\nbe all things to all people. When you go into society, leave behind your\nown ideas and values, and put on the mask diat is most appropriate for\ndie group in which you find yourself. Bismarck played this game\nsuccessfully for yearsmere were people who vaguely understood what\nhe was up to, but not clearly enough that it mattered. People will\nswallow die bait because it flatters them to believe that you share their\nideas. They will not take you as a hypocrite if you are carefulfor how\ncan they accuse you of hypocrisy if you do not let them know exactly\nwhat you stand for Nor will they see you as lacking in values. Of\ncourse you have valuesdie values you share witii diem, while in their\ncompany.\n\nAuthority: Do not give dogs what is holy; and do not dirow your\npearls before swine, lest they trample them under foot and turn to\nattack you. (Jesus Christ, Matthew 7:6)\n\nImage: The Black The herd shuns the SheeD black sheep,\nuncertain whether or not it belongs with them. So it straggles behind,\n\n\nor wanders away from the herd, where it is cornered by wolves and\npromptly devoured. Stay with the herd there is safety in numbers.\nKeep your differences in your thoughts and not in your fleece.\n\nREVERSAL\n\nThe only time it is worth standing out is when you already stand\nout when you have achieved an unshakable position of power, and can\ndisplay your difference from others as a sign of the distance between\nyou. As president of the United States, Lyndon Johnson would\nsometimes hold meetings while he sat on the toilet. Since no one else\neither could or would claim such a \u201cprivilege,\u201d Johnson was showing\npeople that he did not have to observe the protocols and niceties of\nothers. The Roman emperor Caligula played the same game: He would\nwear a woman's negligee, or a bathrobe, to receive important visitors.\nHe even went so far as to have his horse elected consul. But it\nbackfired, for the people hated Caligula, and his gestures eventually\nbrought his overthrow. The truth is that even those who attain the\nheights of power would be better off at least affecting the common\ntouch, for at some point they may need popular support.\n\nFinally, there is always a place for the gadfly, the person who\nsuccessfully defies custom and mocks what has grown lifeless in a\nculture. Oscar Wilde, for example, achieved considerable social power\non this foundation: He made it clear that he disdained the usual ways\nof doing things, and when he gave public readings his audiences not\nonly expected him to insult them but welcomed it. We notice, however,\nthat his eccentric role eventually destroyed him. Even had he come to a\nbetter end, remember that he possessed an unusual genius: Without his\ngift to amuse and delight, his barbs would simply have offended\npeople.\n'.

The city-states of\nGreece had recently fought off a mighty invasion from Persia, and now\nPausanias, along with allied ships from Atiiens, had orders to punish\n\nthe invaders and win back the islands and coastal towns that the\nPersians had occupied. Bodi die Athenians and the Spartans had great\nrespect for Pausaniashe had proven himself as a fearless warrior, with\na flair for the dramatic.\n\nWith amazing speed, Pausanias and his troops took Cyprus, then\nmoved on to the mainland of Asia Minor known as the Hellespont and\ncaptured Byzantium (modern-day Istanbul). Now master of part of the\nPersian empire, Pausanias began to show signs of behavior that went\nbeyond his normal flamboyance. He appeared in public wearing\npomades in his hair and flowing Persian robes, and accompanied by a\nbodyguard of Egyptians. He held lavish banquets in which he sat in the\nPersian manner and demanded to be entertained. He stopped seeing his\nold friends, entered into communication with die Persian King Xerxes,\nand all in all affected the style and manner of a Persian dictator.\n\nClearly power and success had gone to Pausanias's head. His\narmy Athenians and Spartans alikeat first thought this a passing fancy:\nHe had always been a bit exaggerated in his gestures. But when he\nflaunted his disdain for die Greeks' simple way of life, and insulted the\ncommon Greek soldier, they began to feel he had gone too far.\nAlthough there was no concrete evidence for mis, rumors spread diat\nhe had gone over to the odier side, and that he dreamed of becoming a\nkind of Greek Xerxes. To quell die possibility of mutiny, the Spartans\nrelieved Pausanias of his command and called him home.\n\nPausanias, however, continued to dress in the Persian style, even\nin Sparta. After a few months he independently hired a trireme and\nreturned to the Hellespont, telling his compatriots he was going to\ncontinue the fight against the Persians. Actually, however, he had\ndifferent plansto make himself ruler of all Greece, with the aid of\nXerxes himself. The Spartans declared him a public enemy and sent a\nship to capture him. Pausanias surrendered, certain that he could clear\nhimself of the charges of treason. It did come out during die trial diat\nduring his reign as commander he had offended his fellow Greeks time\nand again, erecting monuments, for instance, in his own name, rather\nthan in those of the cities whose troops had fought alongside him, as\nwas the custom. Yet Pausanias proved right: Despite die evidence of\nhis numerous contacts with die enemy, die Spartans refused to\nimprison a man of such noble birth, and let him go.\n\n\nNow thinking himself untouchable, Pausanias hired a messenger\nto take a letter to Xerxes, but the messenger instead took the letter to\nthe Spartan authorities. These men wanted to find out more, so they\nhad the messenger arrange to meet Pausanias in a temple where they\ncould hide and listen behind a partition. What Pausanias said shocked\ndiemdiey had never heard such contempt for their ways spoken so\nbrazenly by one of their ownand they made arrangements for his\nimmediate arrest.\n\nOn his way home from the temple, Pausanias got word of what\nhad happened. He ran to another temple to hide, but the authorities\nfollowed him there and placed sentries all around. Pausanias refused to\nsurrender. Unwilling to forcibly remove him from the sacred temple,\nthe authorities kept him trapped inside, until he eventually died of\nstarvation.\n\nInterpretation\n\nAt first glance it might seem that Pausanias simply fell in love\nwith another culture, a phenomenon as old as time. Never comfortable\nwith the asceticism of the Spartans, he found himself enthralled by the\nPersian love of luxury and sensual pleasure. He put on Persian robes\nand perfumes with a sense of deliverance from Greek discipline and\nsimplicity.\n\nThis is how it appears when people adopt a culture in which they\nwere not raised. Often, however, there is also something else at play:\nPeople who flaunt their infatuation with a different culture are\nexpressing a disdain and contempt for their own. They are using the\noutward appearance of the exotic to separate themselves from the\ncommon folk who unques-tioningly follow the local customs and laws,\nand to express their sense of superiority. Otherwise they would act\nwith more dignity, showing respect for those who do not share their\ndesires. Indeed their need to show their difference so dramatically\noften makes them disliked by the people whose beliefs they challenge,\nindirecdy and subtly, perhaps, but offensively nonetheless.\n\nAs Thucydides wrote of Pausanias, \u201cBy his contempt for the laws\nand his imitation of foreign ways he had made himself very widely\nsuspected of being unwilling to abide by normal standards.\u201d Cultures\nhave norms that reflect centuries of shared beliefs and ideals. Do not\nexpect to scoff at such things with impunity. You will be punished\n\nsomehow, even if just through isolationa position of real\npowerlessness.\n\nMany of us, like Pausanias, feel the siren call of the exotic, the\nforeign. Measure and moderate diis desire. Flaunting your pleasure in\nalien ways of thinking and acting will reveal a different motiveto\ndemonstrate your superiority over your fellows.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nDuring the late sixteenth century, a violent reaction against the\nProtestant Reformation erupted in Italy. The Counter-Reformation, as\nit was called, included its own version of the Inquisition to root out all\ndeviations from the Catholic Church. Among its victims was the\nscientist Galileo, but an important thinker who suffered even greater\npersecution was the Dominican monk and philosopher Tommaso\nCampanella.\n\nA follower of the materialist doctrine of the Roman philosopher\nEpicurus, Campanella did not believe in miracles, or in heaven and\nhell. The Church had promoted such superstitions, he wrote, to control\nthe common folk by keeping them in fear. Such ideas verged on\natheism, and Campanella expressed them incautiously. In 1593 the\nInquisition threw him\n\nBene vixit, qui bene latuit \u201cHe lives well who conceals himself\nwell.\u201d\n\na.d. 18\n\nOvid, c. 43 B.C.\n\nWise men [should be] like coffers with double bottoms: Which\nwhen others look into, being opened, they see not all that they hold.\n\nSir Walter Raleigh, 1554-1618\n\nWHK.N THK WATKHS WERE CHANCED\n\nOnce upon a time Khidr, the teacher of Moses, called upon\nmankind with a warning.

Laying your pearls before swine will only bring you\ntrouble.\n\nFor a long time I have not said what I believed, nor do I ever\nbelieve\n\nwhat I say, and if indeed sometimes I do happen to tell the truth,\n\nLhide it among so many lies that it is hard to find.\n\nNiccolo Machiavelli, in a letter to Francesco Guicciardini, May\n17, 1521\n\nNever combat any man's opinion; for though you reached the age\nof Methuselah, you would never have done setting him right upon all\nthe absurd things that he believes-It is also well to avoid correcting\n\npeople's mistakes in conversation, however good your intentions may\nbe; for it is easy to offend people, and difficult, if not impossible to\nmend them.\n\nIf you feel irritated by the absurd remarks of two people whose\nconversation you happen to overhear, you should imagine that you are\nlistening to the dialogue of two fools in a comedy. Probatum est. The\nman who comes into the world with the notion that he is really going\nto instruct it in matters of the highest importance, may thank his stars\nif he escapes with a whole skin.\n\nArthur\n\nSchopenhauer,\n\n1788-1860\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nWe all tell lies and hide our true feelings, for complete free\nexpression is a social impossibility. From an early age we learn to\nconceal our thoughts, telling die prickly and insecure what we know\nthey want to hear, watching carefully lest we offend diem. For most of\nus tiiis is naturalthere are ideas and values diat most people accept, and\nit is pointless to argue. We believe what we want to, men, but on die\noutside we wear a mask.\n\nThere are people, however, who see such restraints as an\nintolerable infringement on their freedom, and who have a need to\nprove the superi-\n\n\u201cLook around you,\u201d\n\nsaid the citizen. \"This is\n\nthe largest market in\n\nthe world. \"\n\n\u201cOh surely not,\u201d said\n\nthe traveller.\n\n\"Well, perhaps not\n\nthe largest,\" said the\n\ncitizen, \"but much\n\nthe best.\"\n\n\"You are certainly\n\nwrong there, \" said the\n\ntraveller. \"I can tell\n\nyou. ...\"\n\nThey buried the\n\nstranger in the dusk.\n\nFABLES,\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson, 1850-1894\n\nIf Machiavelli had had\n\na prince for disciple,\n\nthe first thing he would\n\nhave recommended\n\nhim to do would have\n\nbeen to write a book\n\nagainst Machiavellism.\n\nVoltaire, 1694-1778\n\nority of their values and beliefs. In the end, though, their\narguments convince only a few and offend a great deal more. The\nreason arguments do not work is that most people hold their ideas and\nvalues widiout thinking about them. There is a strong emotional\ncontent in their beliefs: They really do not want to have to rework their\nhabits of thinking, and when you challenge them, whether directly\nthrough your arguments or indirecdy through your behavior, they are\nhostile.\n\nWise and clever people learn early on that they can display\nconventional behavior and mouth conventional ideas widiout having to\nbelieve in diem. The power these people gain from blending in is that\nof being left alone to have die thoughts tfiey want to have, and to\nexpress diem to the people they want to express them to, without\nsuffering isolation or ostracism. Once tiiey have established\nthemselves in a position of power, they can try to convince a wider\ncircle of the correctness of dieir ideas perhaps working indirecdy,\nusing Campanella's strategies of irony and insinuation.\n\nIn the late fourteenth century, the Spanish began a massive\npersecution of die Jews, murdering Uiousands and driving others out\nof the country. Those who remained in Spain were forced to convert.\nYet over die next three hundred years, die Spanish noticed a\nphenomenon diat disturbed them: Many of die converts lived dieir\noutward lives as Cadiolics, yet somehow managed to retain their\nJewish beliefs, practicing the religion in private. Many of these so-\ncalled Marranos (originally a derogatory term, being the Spanish for\n\n\u201cpig\u201d) attained high levels of government office, married into die\nnobility, and gave every appearance of Christian piety, only to be\ndiscovered late in life as practicing Jews. (The Spanish Inquisition was\nspecifically commissioned to ferret diem out.) Over the years they\nmastered die art of dissimulation, displaying crucifixes liberally,\ngiving generous gifts to churches, even occasionally making anti-\nSemitic remarksand all die while maintaining their inner freedom and\nbeliefs.\n\nIn society, the Marranos knew, outward appearances are what\nmatter. This remains true today. The strategy is simple: As Campanella\ndid in writing Atheism Conquered, make a show of blending in, even\ngoing so far as to be the most zealous advocate of the prevailing\northodoxy. If you stick to conventional appearances in public few will\nbelieve you think differendy in private.\n\nDo not be so foolish as to imagine that in our own time the old\northodoxies are gone. Jonas Salk, for instance, thought science had\ngotten past politics and protocol. And so, in his search for a polio\nvaccine, he broke all die rulesgoing public widi a discovery before\nshowing it to the scientific community, taking credit for die vaccine\nwidiout acknowledging die scientists who had paved die way, making\nhimself a star. The public may have loved him but scientists shunned\nhim. His disrespect for his community's orthodoxies left him isolated,\nand he wasted years trying to heal die breach, and struggling for\n\u2018unding and cooperation.\n\nBertolt Brecht underwent a modern form of Inquisitionthe House\n\nUn-American Activities Committeeand approached it with\nconsiderable canniness. Having worked off and on in die American\n\u2018ilm industry during World War II, in 1947 Brecht was summoned to\nappear before the committee to answer questions on his suspected\nCommunist sympathies. Other writers called before die committee\nmade a point of attacking its members, and of acting as belligerently as\npossible in order to gain sympadry for themselves. Brecht, on die other\nhand, who had actually worked steadfastly for the Communist cause,\nplayed the opposite game: He answered questions wim ambiguous\ngeneralities that defied easy interpretation. Call it the Campanella\nstrategy. Brecht even wore a suita rare event for him and made a point\nof smoking a cigar during the proceedings, knowing that a key\n\n\ncommittee member had a passion for cigars. In the end he charmed the\ncommittee members, who let him go scot-free.\n\nBrecht then moved to East Germany, where he encountered a\ndifferent kind of Inquisition. Here the Communists were in power, and\nthey criticized his plays as decadent and pessimistic. He did not argue\nwith them, but made small changes in the performance scripts to shut\nthem up. Meanwhile he managed to preserve the published texts as\nwritten. His outward conformity in both cases gave him die freedom to\nwork unhindered, without having to change his thinking. In the end, he\nmade his way safely through dangerous times in different countries\nthrough the use of litde dances of orthodoxy, and proved he was more\npowerful than the forces of repression.\n\nNot only do people of power avoid the offenses of Pausanias and\nSalk, they also learn to play the clever fox and feign the common\ntouch. This has been die ploy of con artists and politicians throughout\ndie centuries. Leaders like Julius Caesar and Franklin D. Roosevelt\nhave overcome their natural aristocratic stance to cultivate a familiarity\nwith the common man. They have expressed tiiis familiarity in little\ngestures, often symbolic, to show the people that their leaders share\npopular values, despite their different status.\n\nThe logical extension of this practice is die invaluable ability to\nbe all things to all people. When you go into society, leave behind your\nown ideas and values, and put on the mask diat is most appropriate for\ndie group in which you find yourself. Bismarck played this game\nsuccessfully for yearsmere were people who vaguely understood what\nhe was up to, but not clearly enough that it mattered. People will\nswallow die bait because it flatters them to believe that you share their\nideas. They will not take you as a hypocrite if you are carefulfor how\ncan they accuse you of hypocrisy if you do not let them know exactly\nwhat you stand for Nor will they see you as lacking in values. Of\ncourse you have valuesdie values you share witii diem, while in their\ncompany.\n\nAuthority: Do not give dogs what is holy; and do not dirow your\npearls before swine, lest they trample them under foot and turn to\nattack you. (Jesus Christ, Matthew 7:6)\n\nImage: The Black The herd shuns the SheeD black sheep,\nuncertain whether or not it belongs with them. So it straggles behind,\n\n\nor wanders away from the herd, where it is cornered by wolves and\npromptly devoured. Stay with the herd there is safety in numbers.\nKeep your differences in your thoughts and not in your fleece.\n\nREVERSAL\n\nThe only time it is worth standing out is when you already stand\nout when you have achieved an unshakable position of power, and can\ndisplay your difference from others as a sign of the distance between\nyou. As president of the United States, Lyndon Johnson would\nsometimes hold meetings while he sat on the toilet. Since no one else\neither could or would claim such a \u201cprivilege,\u201d Johnson was showing\npeople that he did not have to observe the protocols and niceties of\nothers. The Roman emperor Caligula played the same game: He would\nwear a woman's negligee, or a bathrobe, to receive important visitors.\nHe even went so far as to have his horse elected consul. But it\nbackfired, for the people hated Caligula, and his gestures eventually\nbrought his overthrow. The truth is that even those who attain the\nheights of power would be better off at least affecting the common\ntouch, for at some point they may need popular support.\n\nFinally, there is always a place for the gadfly, the person who\nsuccessfully defies custom and mocks what has grown lifeless in a\nculture. Oscar Wilde, for example, achieved considerable social power\non this foundation: He made it clear that he disdained the usual ways\nof doing things, and when he gave public readings his audiences not\nonly expected him to insult them but welcomed it. We notice, however,\nthat his eccentric role eventually destroyed him. Even had he come to a\nbetter end, remember that he possessed an unusual genius: Without his\ngift to amuse and delight, his barbs would simply have offended\npeople.\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The original text is: 'STIR UP WATERS TO CATCH FISH\n\nJUDGMENT\n\nAnger and emotion are strategically counterproductive. You must\nalways stay calm and objective. But if you can make your enemies\nangry while staying calm yourself you gain a decided advantage. Put\nyour enemies off-balance: Find the chink in their vanity through which\nyou can rattle them and you hold the strings.\n\nThe Kyoto Shoshidai Itakura Suwo-no-kami Shigemune was very\nfond of Cha-no-yu (the tea ceremony), and used to grind his own tea\nwhile sitting in the court as judge. And the reason was this. He once\nasked a friend of his who was his companion in Cha-no-yu, a tea\nmerchant named Eiki, to tell him frankly what was the public opinion\nabout him. \u201cWell,\u201dsaid Eiki, \u201cthey say that you gel irritated with those\nwho don't give their evidence very clearly and scold them, and so\npeople are afraid to bring lawsuits before you and if they do, the truth\ndoes not come out.\u201d \u201cAh, I am glad you have told me that,\u201d replied\nShigemune, \u201cfor now that I consider it, I have fallen into the habit o:\nspeaking sharply to people in this way, and no doubt humble folk and\nthose who are not ready in speech get flurried and are unable to put\ntheir case in the best light. I will see to it that this does not occur in the\nfuture.\u201d So after this he had a tea mill placed before him in court and\nin front of it the paper-covered shoji were drawn to, and Shigemune sat\nbehind them and ground the tea and thus kept his mind calm while he\nheard the cases. And he could\n\nTRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW,\n\nIn January of 1809, an agitated and anxious Napoleon hurried\nback to Paris from his Spanish wars. His spies and confidants had\nconfirmed a rumor that his foreign minister Talleyrand had conspired\nagainst him with Fouche, the minister of police. Immediately on\narriving in the capital the shocked emperor summoned his ministers to\nthe palace. Following them into the meeting right after their arrival, he\n\n\nbegan pacing up and down, and started rambling vaguely about\nplotters working against him, speculators bringing down the stock\nmarket, legislators delaying his policiesand his own ministers\nundermining him.\n\nAs Napoleon talked, Talleyrand leaned on the mantelpiece,\nlooking completely indifferent. Facing Talleyrand directly, Napoleon\nannounced, \u201cFor these ministers, treason has begun when they permit\nthemselves to doubt.\u201d At the word \u201ctreason\u201d the ruler expected his\nminister to be afraid. But Talleyrand only smiled, calm and bored.\n\nThe sight of a subordinate apparently serene in the face of charges\nthat could get him hanged pushed Napoleon to the edge. There were\nministers, he said, who wanted him dead, and he took a step closer to\nTalleyrand who stared back at him unfazed. Finally Napoleon\nexploded. \u201cYou are a coward,\u201d he screamed in Talleyrand's face, \u201ca\nman of no faidi. Nothing is sacred to you. You would sell your own\nfather. I have showered you with riches and yet there is nothing you\nwould not do to hurt me.\u201d The other ministers looked at each other in\ndisbeliefthey had never seen this fearless general, the conqueror of\nmost of Europe, so unhinged.\n\n\u201cYou deserve to be broken like glass,\u201d Napoleon continued,\nstamping. \u201cI have the power to do it, but I have too much contempt for\nyou to bother. Why didn't I have you hanged from die gates of the\nTuileries But there is still time for that.\u201d Yelling, almost out of bream,\nhis face red, his eyes bulging, he went on, \u201cYou, by the way, are\nnothing but shit in a silk stocking. ... What about your wife You never\ntold me that San Carlos was your wife's lover\u201d \u201cIndeed, sire, it did not\noccur to me that this information had any bearing on Your Majesty's\nglory or my own,\u201d said Talleyrand calmly, completely unflustered.\nAfter a few more insults, Napoleon walked away. Talleyrand slowly\ncrossed the room, moving with his characteristic limp. As an attendant\nhelped him with his cloak, he turned to his fellow ministers (all afraid\nthey would never see him again), and said, \u201cWhat a pity, gende-men,\nthat so great a man should have such bad manners.\u201d\n\nDespite his anger, Napoleon did not arrest his foreign minister. He\nmerely relieved him of his duties aj id banished him from die court,\nbelieving that for this man humiliation would be punishment enough.\nHe did not realize that word had quickly spread of his tiradeof how the\n\nemperor had completely lost control of himself, and how Talleyrand\nhad essentially humiliated him by maintaining his composure and\ndignity. A page had been turned: For the first time people had seen die\ngreat emperor lose his cool under fire. A feeling spread that he was on\ndie way down. As Talleyrand later said, \u201cThis is the beginning of the\nend.\u201d\n\nInterpretation\n\nThis was indeed the beginning of the end. Waterloo was still six\nyears ahead, but Napoleon was on a slow descent to defeat,\ncrystallizing in 1812 with his disastrous invasion of Russia. Talleyrand\nwas the first to see the signs of his decline, especially in the irrational\nwar with Spain. Sometime in 1808, die minister decided that for the\nfuture peace of Europe, Napoleon had to go. And so he conspired with\nFouche.\n\nIt is possible that the conspiracy was never anything more than a\nploya device to push Napoleon over the edge. For it is hard to believe\nthat two of the most practical men in history would only go halfway in\ntheir plotting. They may have been only stirring the waters, trying to\ngoad Napoleon into a misstep. And indeed, what they got was the\ntantrum mat laid out his loss of control for all to see. In fact,\nNapoleon's soon-famous blowup that afternoon had a profoundly\nnegative effect on his public image.\n\nThis is the problem with the angry response. At first it may strike\nfear and terror, but only in some, and as the days pass and the storm\nclears, other responses emergeembarrassment and uneasiness about the\nshouter's capacity for going out of control, and resentment of what has\nbeen said. Losing your temper, you always make unfair and\nexaggerated accusations. A few such tirades and people are counting\nthe days until you are gone.\n\nIn the face of a conspiracy against him, a conspiracy between his\ntwo most important ministers, Napoleon certainly had a right to feel\nangry and anxious. But by responding so angrily, and so publicly, he\nonly demonstrated his frustration. To show your frustration is to show\nthat you have lost your power to shape events; it is the helpless action\nof the child who resorts to a hysterical fit to get his way. The powerful\nnever reveal this kind of weakness.\n\n\nThere were a number of tilings Napoleon could have done in this\nsituation. He could have thought about the fact that two eminently\nsensible men had had reason to turn against him, and could have\nlistened and learned from them. He could have tried to win them back\nto him. He could even have gotten rid of them, making their\nimprisonment or death an ominous display of his power. No tirades, no\nchildish fits, no embarrassing after-effects-just a quiet and definitive\nsevering of ties.\n\nRemember: Tantrums neither intimidate nor inspire loyalty. They\nonly create doubts and uneasiness about your power. Exposing your\nweakness, these stormy eruptions often herald a fall.\n\neasily see whether his composure was ruffled or not by looking at\nthe tea, which would not fall evenly ground to the proper consistency\nif he got excited. And so justice was done impartially and people went\naway from his court satisfied.\n\ncha-no-yu:\n\nthe japanese tea\n\nceremony\n\nA.L.Sadler,\n\nIf possible, no animosity should be felt for anyone.... To speak\nangrily to a person, to show your hatred by what you say or by the way\nyou look, is an unnecessary proceedingdangerous, foolish, ridiculous,\nand vulgar.\n\nAnger or hatred should never be shown otherwise than in what\nyou do; and feelings will be all the more effective in action, in so far as\nyou avoid the exhibition of them in any other way. It is only the\ncoldblooded animals whose bite is poisonous.\n\nArthur\n\nSchopenhauer.\n\n1788-1860\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nBy the late 1920s, Haile Selassie had nearly achieved his goal of\nassuming total control over Ethiopia, a country he felt needed strong\nand unified leadership. As regent to the empress Zauditu (stepdaughter\nof the late queen) and heir to the throne, Selassie had spent several\nyears weakening the power of Ethiopia's various warlords. Now only\none real obstacle stood\n\nTHK MONKEY AND THE WASP\n\nA monkey, whilst munching a ripe pear, was pestered by the bare-\nfaced importunities of a wasp, who, nolens volens, would have a part.\nAfter threatening the monkey with his anger if he further hesitated to\nsubmit to his demand, he settled on the fruit; but was as soon knocked\noff by the monkey. The irritable wasp now had recourse to\ninvectiveand, after using the most insulting language, which the other\ncalmly listened to, he so worked himself up into violent passion that,\nlosing all consideration of the penalty, he flew to the face of the\nmonkey, and stung him with such rage that he was unable to extricate\nhis weapon, and was compelled to tear himself away, leaving it in the\nwoundthus entailing on himself a lingering death, accompanied by\npains much greater than those he had inflicted.\n\nFABLES,\n\nJonathan Birch, 1783-1847\n\nin his way: the empress and her husband, Ras Gugsa. Selassie\nknew the royal couple hated him and wanted to get rid of him, so to\ncut short their plotting he made Gugsa the governor of the northern\nprovince of Begemeder, forcing him to leave the capital, where the\nempress lived.\n\nFor several years Gugsa played the loyal administrator. But\nSelassie did not trust him: He knew that Gugsa and the empress were\nplotting revenge. As time passed and Gugsa made no move, the\nchances of a plot only increased. Selassie knew what he had to do:\ndraw Gugsa out, get under his skin, and push him into action before he\nwas ready.\n\nFor several years, a northern tribe, the Azebu Gallas, had been in\nvirtual rebellion against the throne, robbing and pillaging local villages\nand refusing to pay taxes. Selassie had done nothing to stop them,\nletting them grow stronger. Finally, in 1929, he ordered Ras Gugsa to\nlead an army against these disobedient tribesmen. Gugsa agreed, but\ninwardly he seethedhe had no grudge against the Azebu Gallas, and\nthe demand that he fight them hurt his pride. He could not disobey die\norder, but as he worked to put together an army, he began to spread an\nugly rumorthat Selassie was in cahoots with the pope, and planned to\nconvert the country to Roman Catholicism and make it a colony of\nItaly. Gugsa's army swelled, and some of the tribes from which its\n\nsoldiers came secredy agreed to fight Selassie. In March of 1930 an\nenormous force of 35,000 men began to march, not on the Azebu\nGallas but south, toward the capital of Addis Ababa. Made confident\nby his growing strength, Gugsa now openly led a holy war to depose\nSelassie and put the country back in the hands of true Christians.\n\nHe did not see the trap that had been laid for him. Before Selassie\nhad ordered Gugsa to fight the Azebu Gallas, he had secured the\nsupport of the Ethiopian church. And before the revolt got underway,\nhe had bribed several of Gugsa's key allies not to show up for battle.\nAs the rebel army marched south, airplanes flew overhead dropping\nleaflets announcing that the highest church officials had recognized\nSelassie as die true Christian leader of Ethiopia, and that tiiey had\nexcommunicated Gugsa for fomenting a civil war. These leaflets\nseverely blunted the emotions behind the holy crusade. And as batde\nloomed and the support that Gugsa's allies had promised him failed to\nshow up, soldiers began to flee or defect.\n\nWhen the batde came, the rebel army quicky collapsed. Refusing\nto surrender, Ras Gugsa was killed in die fighting. The empress,\ndistraught over her husband's death, died a few days later. On April 30,\nSelassie issued a formal proclamation announcing his new tide:\nEmperor of Ethiopia.\n\nInterpretation\n\nHaile Selassie always saw several moves ahead. He knew that if\nhe let Ras Gugsa decide die time and place of the revolt, the danger\nwould be much greater than if he forced Gugsa to act on Selassie's\nterms. So he goaded him into rebellion by offending his manly pride,\nasking him to fight people he had no quarrel with on behalf of a man\nhe hated. Thinking everything out\n\nahead, Selassie made sure that Gugsa's rebellion would come to\nnothing, and mat he could use it to do away with his last two enemies.\n\nThis is the essence of the Law: When the waters are still, your\nopponents have the time and space to plot actions that they will initiate\nand control. So stir the waters, force the fish to the surface, get them to\nact before they are ready, steal the initiative. The best way to do this is\nto play on uncontrollable emotionspride, vanity, love, hate. Once die\nwater is stirred up, the little fish cannot help but rise to the bait. The\n\nangrier they become, the less control they have, and finally they are\ncaught in the whirlpool you have made, and they drown.\n\nA sovereign should never launch an army out of anger, a leader\nshould never start a war out of wrath.\n\nSun-tzu, fourth century B. c.\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nAngry people usually end up looking ridiculous, for their\nresponse seems out of proportion to what occasioned it. They have\ntaken things too seriously, exaggerating the hurt or insult that has been\ndone to them. They are so sensitive to slight that it becomes comical\nhow much diey take personally. More comical still is their belief that\ntheir outbursts signify power. The truth is the opposite: Petulance is\nnot power, it is a sign of helplessness. People may temporarily be\ncowed by your tantrums, but in the end they lose respect for you. They\nalso realize they can easily undermine a person with so little self-\ncontrol.\n\nThe answer, however, is not to repress our angry or emotional\nresponses. For repression drains us of energy and pushes us into\nstrange behavior. Instead we have to change our perspective: We have\nto realize that nothing in the social realm, and in the game of power, is\npersonal.\n\nEveryone is caught up in a chain of events that long predates the\npresent moment. Our anger often stems from problems in our\nchildhood, from the problems of our parents which stem from their\nown childhood, on and on. Our anger also has roots in the many\ninteractions with others, the accumulated disappointments and\nheartaches that we have suffered. An individual will often appear as\nthe instigator of our anger but it is much more complicated, goes far\nbeyond what that individual did to us. If a person explodes with anger\nat you (and it seems out of proportion to what you did to them), you\nmust remind yourself that it is not exclusively directed at you do not be\nso vain. The cause is much larger, goes way back in time, involves\ndozens of prior hurts, and is actually not worth the bother to\nunderstand. Instead of seeing it as a personal grudge, look at the\nemotional outburst as a disguised power move, an attempt to control or\npunish you cloaked in the form of hurt feelings and anger.\n\nThis shift of perspective will let you play the game of power with\nmore clarity and energy. Instead of overreacting, and becoming\nensnared in peo-\n\nDITCH HIGH PRIEST\n\nKin'yo, an officer of the second rank, had a brother called the\nHigh Priest Ryogaku, an extremely bad-tempered man. Next to his\nmonastery grew a large nettle-tree which occasioned the nickname\npeople gave him, the Nettle-tree High Priest. \u201cThat name is\noutrageous,\u201d said the high priest, and cut down the tree. The stump still\nbeing left, people referred to him now as the Stump High Priest. More\nfurious than ever, Ryogaku had the stump dug up and thrown away, but\nthis left a big ditch. People now called him the Ditch High Priest.\n\nESSAYS IN IDLENESS, KENKO,\n\nJapan,\n\nfourteenth century\n\npie's emotions, you will turn their loss of control to your\nadvantage: You keep your head while they are losing theirs.\n\nDuring an important batde in the War of the Three Kingdoms, in\ndie third century A.D., advisers to die commander Ts'ao Ts'ao\ndiscovered documents showing that certain of his generals had\nconspired with die enemy, and urged him to arrest and execute diem.\nInstead he ordered the documents burned and die matter forgotten. At\nthis critical moment in the battle, to get upset or demand justice would\nhave reverberated against him: An angry action would have called\nattention to die generals' disloyalty, which would have harmed die\ntroops' morale. Justice could waithe would deal with the generals in\ntime. Ts'ao Ts'ao kept his head and made the right decision.\n\nCompare this to Napoleon's response to Talleyrand: Instead of\ntaking the conspiracy personally, the emperor should have played the\ngame like Ts'ao Ts'ao, carefully weighing die consequences of any\naction he took. The more powerful response in the end would have\nbeen to ignore Talleyrand, or to bring the minister gradually back to\nhis side and punish him later.\n\nAnger only cuts off our options, and die powerful cannot thrive\nwitii-out options. Once you train yourself not to take matters\npersonally, and to control your emotional responses, you will have\nplaced yourself in a position of tremendous power: Now you can play\n\nwith die emotional responses of odier people. Stir die insecure into\naction by impugning their manhood, and by dangling die prospect of\nan easy victory before tiieir faces. Do as Houdini did when challenged\nby die less successful escape artist Kleppini: Reveal an apparent\nweakness (Houdini let Kleppini steal the combination for a pair of\ncuffs) to lure your opponent into action. Then you can beat him with\nease. Widi the arrogant too you can appear weaker tiian you are,\ntaunting diem into a rash action.\n\nSun Pin, commander of die armies of Ch'i and loyal disciple of\nSun-tzu, once led his troops against the armies of Wei, which\noutnumbered him two to one. \u201cLet us light a hundred thousand fires\nwhen our army enters Wei,\u201d suggested Sun Pin, \u201cfifty thousand on die\nnext day, and only thirty thousand on the third.\u201d On the tiiird day the\nWei general exclaimed, \u201cI knew the men of Ch'i were cowards, and\nafter only three days more than half of diem have deserted!\u201d So,\nleaving behind his slow-moving heavy infantry, the general decided to\nseize the moment and move swiftly on die Ch'i camp with a lightiy\narmed force. Sun Pin's troops retreated, luring Wei's army into a\nnarrow pass, where tiiey ambushed and destroyed diem. Widi die Wei\ngeneral dead and his forces decimated, Sun Pin now easily defeated\nthe rest of his army.\n\nIn the face of a hot-headed enemy, finally, an excellent response\nis no response. Follow the Talleyrand tactic: Notiiing is as infuriating\nas a man who keeps his cool while others are losing theirs.

You must\nalways stay calm and objective. But if you can make your enemies\nangry while staying calm yourself you gain a decided advantage.

And the reason was this. He once\nasked a friend of his who was his companion in Cha-no-yu, a tea\nmerchant named Eiki, to tell him frankly what was the public opinion\nabout him. \u201cWell,\u201dsaid Eiki, \u201cthey say that you gel irritated with those\nwho don't give their evidence very clearly and scold them, and so\npeople are afraid to bring lawsuits before you and if they do, the truth\ndoes not come out.\u201d \u201cAh, I am glad you have told me that,\u201d replied\nShigemune, \u201cfor now that I consider it, I have fallen into the habit o:\nspeaking sharply to people in this way, and no doubt humble folk and\nthose who are not ready in speech get flurried and are unable to put\ntheir case in the best light. I will see to it that this does not occur in the\nfuture.\u201d So after this he had a tea mill placed before him in court and\nin front of it the paper-covered shoji were drawn to, and Shigemune sat\nbehind them and ground the tea and thus kept his mind calm while he\nheard the cases. And he could\n\nTRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW,\n\nIn January of 1809, an agitated and anxious Napoleon hurried\nback to Paris from his Spanish wars. His spies and confidants had\nconfirmed a rumor that his foreign minister Talleyrand had conspired\nagainst him with Fouche, the minister of police. Immediately on\narriving in the capital the shocked emperor summoned his ministers to\nthe palace. Following them into the meeting right after their arrival, he\n\n\nbegan pacing up and down, and started rambling vaguely about\nplotters working against him, speculators bringing down the stock\nmarket, legislators delaying his policiesand his own ministers\nundermining him.\n\nAs Napoleon talked, Talleyrand leaned on the mantelpiece,\nlooking completely indifferent. Facing Talleyrand directly, Napoleon\nannounced, \u201cFor these ministers, treason has begun when they permit\nthemselves to doubt.\u201d At the word \u201ctreason\u201d the ruler expected his\nminister to be afraid. But Talleyrand only smiled, calm and bored.\n\nThe sight of a subordinate apparently serene in the face of charges\nthat could get him hanged pushed Napoleon to the edge. There were\nministers, he said, who wanted him dead, and he took a step closer to\nTalleyrand who stared back at him unfazed. Finally Napoleon\nexploded. \u201cYou are a coward,\u201d he screamed in Talleyrand's face, \u201ca\nman of no faidi. Nothing is sacred to you. You would sell your own\nfather. I have showered you with riches and yet there is nothing you\nwould not do to hurt me.\u201d The other ministers looked at each other in\ndisbeliefthey had never seen this fearless general, the conqueror of\nmost of Europe, so unhinged.\n\n\u201cYou deserve to be broken like glass,\u201d Napoleon continued,\nstamping. \u201cI have the power to do it, but I have too much contempt for\nyou to bother. Why didn't I have you hanged from die gates of the\nTuileries But there is still time for that.\u201d Yelling, almost out of bream,\nhis face red, his eyes bulging, he went on, \u201cYou, by the way, are\nnothing but shit in a silk stocking. ... What about your wife You never\ntold me that San Carlos was your wife's lover\u201d \u201cIndeed, sire, it did not\noccur to me that this information had any bearing on Your Majesty's\nglory or my own,\u201d said Talleyrand calmly, completely unflustered.\nAfter a few more insults, Napoleon walked away. Talleyrand slowly\ncrossed the room, moving with his characteristic limp. As an attendant\nhelped him with his cloak, he turned to his fellow ministers (all afraid\nthey would never see him again), and said, \u201cWhat a pity, gende-men,\nthat so great a man should have such bad manners.\u201d\n\nDespite his anger, Napoleon did not arrest his foreign minister. He\nmerely relieved him of his duties aj id banished him from die court,\nbelieving that for this man humiliation would be punishment enough.\nHe did not realize that word had quickly spread of his tiradeof how the\n\nemperor had completely lost control of himself, and how Talleyrand\nhad essentially humiliated him by maintaining his composure and\ndignity. A page had been turned: For the first time people had seen die\ngreat emperor lose his cool under fire. A feeling spread that he was on\ndie way down. As Talleyrand later said, \u201cThis is the beginning of the\nend.\u201d\n\nInterpretation\n\nThis was indeed the beginning of the end. Waterloo was still six\nyears ahead, but Napoleon was on a slow descent to defeat,\ncrystallizing in 1812 with his disastrous invasion of Russia. Talleyrand\nwas the first to see the signs of his decline, especially in the irrational\nwar with Spain. Sometime in 1808, die minister decided that for the\nfuture peace of Europe, Napoleon had to go. And so he conspired with\nFouche.\n\nIt is possible that the conspiracy was never anything more than a\nploya device to push Napoleon over the edge. For it is hard to believe\nthat two of the most practical men in history would only go halfway in\ntheir plotting. They may have been only stirring the waters, trying to\ngoad Napoleon into a misstep. And indeed, what they got was the\ntantrum mat laid out his loss of control for all to see. In fact,\nNapoleon's soon-famous blowup that afternoon had a profoundly\nnegative effect on his public image.\n\nThis is the problem with the angry response. At first it may strike\nfear and terror, but only in some, and as the days pass and the storm\nclears, other responses emergeembarrassment and uneasiness about the\nshouter's capacity for going out of control, and resentment of what has\nbeen said. Losing your temper, you always make unfair and\nexaggerated accusations. A few such tirades and people are counting\nthe days until you are gone.\n\nIn the face of a conspiracy against him, a conspiracy between his\ntwo most important ministers, Napoleon certainly had a right to feel\nangry and anxious. But by responding so angrily, and so publicly, he\nonly demonstrated his frustration. To show your frustration is to show\nthat you have lost your power to shape events; it is the helpless action\nof the child who resorts to a hysterical fit to get his way. The powerful\nnever reveal this kind of weakness.\n\n\nThere were a number of tilings Napoleon could have done in this\nsituation. He could have thought about the fact that two eminently\nsensible men had had reason to turn against him, and could have\nlistened and learned from them. He could have tried to win them back\nto him. He could even have gotten rid of them, making their\nimprisonment or death an ominous display of his power. No tirades, no\nchildish fits, no embarrassing after-effects-just a quiet and definitive\nsevering of ties.\n\nRemember: Tantrums neither intimidate nor inspire loyalty. They\nonly create doubts and uneasiness about your power. Exposing your\nweakness, these stormy eruptions often herald a fall.\n\neasily see whether his composure was ruffled or not by looking at\nthe tea, which would not fall evenly ground to the proper consistency\nif he got excited. And so justice was done impartially and people went\naway from his court satisfied.\n\ncha-no-yu:\n\nthe japanese tea\n\nceremony\n\nA.L.Sadler,\n\nIf possible, no animosity should be felt for anyone.... To speak\nangrily to a person, to show your hatred by what you say or by the way\nyou look, is an unnecessary proceedingdangerous, foolish, ridiculous,\nand vulgar.\n\nAnger or hatred should never be shown otherwise than in what\nyou do; and feelings will be all the more effective in action, in so far as\nyou avoid the exhibition of them in any other way. It is only the\ncoldblooded animals whose bite is poisonous.\n\nArthur\n\nSchopenhauer.\n\n1788-1860\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nBy the late 1920s, Haile Selassie had nearly achieved his goal of\nassuming total control over Ethiopia, a country he felt needed strong\nand unified leadership. As regent to the empress Zauditu (stepdaughter\nof the late queen) and heir to the throne, Selassie had spent several\nyears weakening the power of Ethiopia's various warlords. Now only\none real obstacle stood\n\nTHK MONKEY AND THE WASP\n\nA monkey, whilst munching a ripe pear, was pestered by the bare-\nfaced importunities of a wasp, who, nolens volens, would have a part.\nAfter threatening the monkey with his anger if he further hesitated to\nsubmit to his demand, he settled on the fruit; but was as soon knocked\noff by the monkey. The irritable wasp now had recourse to\ninvectiveand, after using the most insulting language, which the other\ncalmly listened to, he so worked himself up into violent passion that,\nlosing all consideration of the penalty, he flew to the face of the\nmonkey, and stung him with such rage that he was unable to extricate\nhis weapon, and was compelled to tear himself away, leaving it in the\nwoundthus entailing on himself a lingering death, accompanied by\npains much greater than those he had inflicted.\n\nFABLES,\n\nJonathan Birch, 1783-1847\n\nin his way: the empress and her husband, Ras Gugsa. Selassie\nknew the royal couple hated him and wanted to get rid of him, so to\ncut short their plotting he made Gugsa the governor of the northern\nprovince of Begemeder, forcing him to leave the capital, where the\nempress lived.\n\nFor several years Gugsa played the loyal administrator. But\nSelassie did not trust him: He knew that Gugsa and the empress were\nplotting revenge. As time passed and Gugsa made no move, the\nchances of a plot only increased. Selassie knew what he had to do:\ndraw Gugsa out, get under his skin, and push him into action before he\nwas ready.\n\nFor several years, a northern tribe, the Azebu Gallas, had been in\nvirtual rebellion against the throne, robbing and pillaging local villages\nand refusing to pay taxes. Selassie had done nothing to stop them,\nletting them grow stronger. Finally, in 1929, he ordered Ras Gugsa to\nlead an army against these disobedient tribesmen. Gugsa agreed, but\ninwardly he seethedhe had no grudge against the Azebu Gallas, and\nthe demand that he fight them hurt his pride. He could not disobey die\norder, but as he worked to put together an army, he began to spread an\nugly rumorthat Selassie was in cahoots with the pope, and planned to\nconvert the country to Roman Catholicism and make it a colony of\nItaly. Gugsa's army swelled, and some of the tribes from which its\n\nsoldiers came secredy agreed to fight Selassie. In March of 1930 an\nenormous force of 35,000 men began to march, not on the Azebu\nGallas but south, toward the capital of Addis Ababa. Made confident\nby his growing strength, Gugsa now openly led a holy war to depose\nSelassie and put the country back in the hands of true Christians.\n\nHe did not see the trap that had been laid for him. Before Selassie\nhad ordered Gugsa to fight the Azebu Gallas, he had secured the\nsupport of the Ethiopian church. And before the revolt got underway,\nhe had bribed several of Gugsa's key allies not to show up for battle.\nAs the rebel army marched south, airplanes flew overhead dropping\nleaflets announcing that the highest church officials had recognized\nSelassie as die true Christian leader of Ethiopia, and that tiiey had\nexcommunicated Gugsa for fomenting a civil war. These leaflets\nseverely blunted the emotions behind the holy crusade. And as batde\nloomed and the support that Gugsa's allies had promised him failed to\nshow up, soldiers began to flee or defect.\n\nWhen the batde came, the rebel army quicky collapsed. Refusing\nto surrender, Ras Gugsa was killed in die fighting. The empress,\ndistraught over her husband's death, died a few days later. On April 30,\nSelassie issued a formal proclamation announcing his new tide:\nEmperor of Ethiopia.\n\nInterpretation\n\nHaile Selassie always saw several moves ahead. He knew that if\nhe let Ras Gugsa decide die time and place of the revolt, the danger\nwould be much greater than if he forced Gugsa to act on Selassie's\nterms. So he goaded him into rebellion by offending his manly pride,\nasking him to fight people he had no quarrel with on behalf of a man\nhe hated. Thinking everything out\n\nahead, Selassie made sure that Gugsa's rebellion would come to\nnothing, and mat he could use it to do away with his last two enemies.\n\nThis is the essence of the Law: When the waters are still, your\nopponents have the time and space to plot actions that they will initiate\nand control. So stir the waters, force the fish to the surface, get them to\nact before they are ready, steal the initiative. The best way to do this is\nto play on uncontrollable emotionspride, vanity, love, hate. Once die\nwater is stirred up, the little fish cannot help but rise to the bait. The\n\nangrier they become, the less control they have, and finally they are\ncaught in the whirlpool you have made, and they drown.\n\nA sovereign should never launch an army out of anger, a leader\nshould never start a war out of wrath.\n\nSun-tzu, fourth century B. c.\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nAngry people usually end up looking ridiculous, for their\nresponse seems out of proportion to what occasioned it. They have\ntaken things too seriously, exaggerating the hurt or insult that has been\ndone to them. They are so sensitive to slight that it becomes comical\nhow much diey take personally. More comical still is their belief that\ntheir outbursts signify power. The truth is the opposite: Petulance is\nnot power, it is a sign of helplessness. People may temporarily be\ncowed by your tantrums, but in the end they lose respect for you. They\nalso realize they can easily undermine a person with so little self-\ncontrol.\n\nThe answer, however, is not to repress our angry or emotional\nresponses. For repression drains us of energy and pushes us into\nstrange behavior. Instead we have to change our perspective: We have\nto realize that nothing in the social realm, and in the game of power, is\npersonal.\n\nEveryone is caught up in a chain of events that long predates the\npresent moment. Our anger often stems from problems in our\nchildhood, from the problems of our parents which stem from their\nown childhood, on and on. Our anger also has roots in the many\ninteractions with others, the accumulated disappointments and\nheartaches that we have suffered. An individual will often appear as\nthe instigator of our anger but it is much more complicated, goes far\nbeyond what that individual did to us. If a person explodes with anger\nat you (and it seems out of proportion to what you did to them), you\nmust remind yourself that it is not exclusively directed at you do not be\nso vain. The cause is much larger, goes way back in time, involves\ndozens of prior hurts, and is actually not worth the bother to\nunderstand. Instead of seeing it as a personal grudge, look at the\nemotional outburst as a disguised power move, an attempt to control or\npunish you cloaked in the form of hurt feelings and anger.\n\nThis shift of perspective will let you play the game of power with\nmore clarity and energy. Instead of overreacting, and becoming\nensnared in peo-\n\nDITCH HIGH PRIEST\n\nKin'yo, an officer of the second rank, had a brother called the\nHigh Priest Ryogaku, an extremely bad-tempered man. Next to his\nmonastery grew a large nettle-tree which occasioned the nickname\npeople gave him, the Nettle-tree High Priest. \u201cThat name is\noutrageous,\u201d said the high priest, and cut down the tree. The stump still\nbeing left, people referred to him now as the Stump High Priest. More\nfurious than ever, Ryogaku had the stump dug up and thrown away, but\nthis left a big ditch. People now called him the Ditch High Priest.\n\nESSAYS IN IDLENESS, KENKO,\n\nJapan,\n\nfourteenth century\n\npie's emotions, you will turn their loss of control to your\nadvantage: You keep your head while they are losing theirs.\n\nDuring an important batde in the War of the Three Kingdoms, in\ndie third century A.D., advisers to die commander Ts'ao Ts'ao\ndiscovered documents showing that certain of his generals had\nconspired with die enemy, and urged him to arrest and execute diem.\nInstead he ordered the documents burned and die matter forgotten. At\nthis critical moment in the battle, to get upset or demand justice would\nhave reverberated against him: An angry action would have called\nattention to die generals' disloyalty, which would have harmed die\ntroops' morale. Justice could waithe would deal with the generals in\ntime. Ts'ao Ts'ao kept his head and made the right decision.\n\nCompare this to Napoleon's response to Talleyrand: Instead of\ntaking the conspiracy personally, the emperor should have played the\ngame like Ts'ao Ts'ao, carefully weighing die consequences of any\naction he took. The more powerful response in the end would have\nbeen to ignore Talleyrand, or to bring the minister gradually back to\nhis side and punish him later.\n\nAnger only cuts off our options, and die powerful cannot thrive\nwitii-out options. Once you train yourself not to take matters\npersonally, and to control your emotional responses, you will have\nplaced yourself in a position of tremendous power: Now you can play\n\nwith die emotional responses of odier people. Stir die insecure into\naction by impugning their manhood, and by dangling die prospect of\nan easy victory before tiieir faces. Do as Houdini did when challenged\nby die less successful escape artist Kleppini: Reveal an apparent\nweakness (Houdini let Kleppini steal the combination for a pair of\ncuffs) to lure your opponent into action. Then you can beat him with\nease. Widi the arrogant too you can appear weaker tiian you are,\ntaunting diem into a rash action.\n\nSun Pin, commander of die armies of Ch'i and loyal disciple of\nSun-tzu, once led his troops against the armies of Wei, which\noutnumbered him two to one. \u201cLet us light a hundred thousand fires\nwhen our army enters Wei,\u201d suggested Sun Pin, \u201cfifty thousand on die\nnext day, and only thirty thousand on the third.\u201d On the tiiird day the\nWei general exclaimed, \u201cI knew the men of Ch'i were cowards, and\nafter only three days more than half of diem have deserted!\u201d So,\nleaving behind his slow-moving heavy infantry, the general decided to\nseize the moment and move swiftly on die Ch'i camp with a lightiy\narmed force. Sun Pin's troops retreated, luring Wei's army into a\nnarrow pass, where tiiey ambushed and destroyed diem. Widi die Wei\ngeneral dead and his forces decimated, Sun Pin now easily defeated\nthe rest of his army.\n\nIn the face of a hot-headed enemy, finally, an excellent response\nis no response. Follow the Talleyrand tactic: Notiiing is as infuriating\nas a man who keeps his cool while others are losing theirs. If it will\nwork to your advantage to unsetde people, affect die aristocratic, bored\npose, neimer mocking nor triumphant but simply indifferent. This will\nlight tiieir fuse.\n\nWhen they embarrass themselves with a temper tantrum, you will\nhave gained several victories, one of these being that in the face of\ntheir childishness you have maintained your dignity and composure.\n\nImage: The Pond of Fish.

Be lavish with your money and keep it circulating, for\ngenerosity is a sign and a magnet for power.\n\nHI Hill) THKASI HI.\n\nMany weak-minded persons in cities hope to discover property\nunder the surface of the earth and to make some profit from it. In the\nMaghrib there are many Berber \u201cstudents\u201d who are unable to make a\nliving by natural ways and means. They approach well-to-do people\nwith papers that have torn margins and contain either non-Arabic\nwriting or what they claim to be the translation of a document written\nby the owner of buried treasures, giving the clue to the hiding place. In\nthis way, they try to get their sustenance by [persuading the well-to-do]\nto send them out to dig and hunt for treasure. Occasionally, one of\nthese treasure hunters displays strange information or some remarkable\ntrick of magic with which he fools people into believing his other\nclaims, although, in fact, he knows nothing of magic and its\nprocedures.... The things that have been said about /treasure hunting]\nhave no scientific basis, nor are they based upon [factual] information.\nIt should be realized that although treasures are found, this happens\nrarely and by chance, not by systematic search.... Those who are\ndeluded or afflicted by these things must take refuge in God\n\nMONEY AND POWER\n\nIn the realm of power, everything must be judged by its cost, and\neverything has a price. What is offered for free or at bargain rates often\ncomes with a psychological price tagcomplicated feelings of\nobligation, compromises with quality, the insecurity those\n\ncompromises bring, on and on. The powerful learn early to protect\ntheir most valuable resources: independence and room to maneuver.\nBy paying the full price, they keep themselves free of dangerous\nentanglements and worries.\n\nBeing open and flexible with money also teaches the value of\nstrategic generosity, a variation on the old trick of \u201cgiving when you\nare about to take.\u201d By giving the appropriate gift, you put the recipient\nunder obligation. Generosity softens people upto be deceived. By\ngaining a reputation for liberality, you win people's admiration while\ndistracting them from your power plays. By strategically spreading\nyour wealth, you charm the other courtiers, creating pleasure and\nmaking valuable allies.\n\nLook at the masters of powerthe Caesars, the Queen Elizabeths,\nthe Michelangelos, the Medicis: Not a miser among them. Even the\ngreat con artists spend freely to swindle. Tight purse strings are\nunattractivewhen engaged in seduction, Casanova would give\ncompletely not only of himself but of his wallet. The powerful\nunderstand that money is psychologically charged, and that it is also a\nvessel of politeness and sociability. They make the human side of\nmoney a weapon in their armory.\n\nFor everyone able to play with money, thousands more are locked\nin a self-destructive refusal to use money creatively and strategically.\nThese types represent the opposite pole to the powerful, and you must\nlearn to recognize themeither to avoid their poisonous natures or to\nturn their inflexibility to your advantage:\n\nThe Greedy Fish. The greedy fish take the human side out of\nmoney. Cold and ruthless, they see only the lifeless balance sheet;\nviewing others solely as either pawns or obstructions in their pursuit of\nwealth, they trample on people's sentiments and alienate valuable\nallies. No one wants to work with the greedy fish, and over the years\nthey end up isolated, which often proves their undoing.\n\nGreedy fish are the con artist's bread and butter: Lured by the bait\nof easy money, they swallow the ruse hook, line, and sinker. They are\neasy to deceive, for they spend so much time dealing with numbers\n(not with people) that they become blind to psychology, including their\nown. Either avoid them before they exploit you or play on their greed\nto your gain.\n\nThe Bargain Demon. Powerful people judge everything by what it\ncosts, not just in money but in time, dignity, and peace of mind. And\nthis is exactly what Bargain Demons cannot do.

The\nstory soon spread of an Indian chief to the east of Peru who once each\nyear would ritually cover himself in gold dust and dive into a lake.\nSoon word of mouth transformed El Dorado, the \u201cGolden Man,\u201d into\nan empire called El Dorado, wealthier than the Incan, where the streets\nwere paved and the buildings inlaid with gold. This elaboration of die\nstory did not seem implausible, for surely a diief who could afford to\nwaste gold dust in a lake must rule a golden empire. Soon Spaniards\nwere searching for El Dorado all over northern South America.\n\nTHE MISKR\n\nA miser, to make sure of his property, sold all that he had and\nconverted it into a great lump of gold, which he hid in a hole in the\nground, and went continually to visit and inspect it. This roused the\ncuriosity of one of his workmen, who, suspecting that there was a\ntreasure, when his master's back was turned, went to the spot, and stole\nit away. When the miser returned and found the place empty, he wept\nand tore his hair. But a neighbor who saw him in this extravagant grief,\nand learned the cause of it, said: \u201cFret thyself no longer, but take a\nstone and put it in the same place, and think that it is your lump of\ngold; for, as you never meant to use it, the one will do you as much\ngood as the other.\u201d\n\nThe worth of money is not in its possession, but in its use.\n\nFABLES,\n\nAesop,\n\nsixth century b.c.\n\nThere is a popular saying in Japan that goes \u201cTada yori takai\nmono wa nai,\u201d meaning: \u201cNothing is more costly than something given\nfree of charge.\u201d\n\nTHE UNSPOKEN WAY, MICHIHIRO\n\nMatsumoto, 1988\n\nYusuf Ibn Jafar el-Amudl used to take sums of money, sometimes\nvery large ones, from those who came to study with him. A\ndistinguished legalist visiting him once said: \u201cI am enchanted and\nimpressed by your teachings, and I am sure that you are directing your\ndisciples in a proper manner. But it is not in accordance with tradition\nto take money for knowledge. Besides, the action is open to\nmisinterpretation.\u201d El-Amudi said: \"I have never sold any knowledge.\nThere is no money on earth sufficient to pay for it. As for\nmisinterpretation, the abstaining from taking money will not prevent it,\nfor it will find some other object. Rather should you know that a man\nwho takes money may be greedy for money, or he may not. But a man\nwho takes nothing at all is under the gravest\n\nIn February of 1541, the largest expedition yet in diis venture, led\nby Pizarro's brother Gonzalo, left Quito, in Ecuador. Resplendent in\ntheir armors and colorful silks, 340 Spaniards headed east, along with\n4,000 Indians to carry supplies and serve as scouts, 4,000 swine,\ndozens of llamas, and close to 1,000 dogs. But the expedition was soon\nhit by torrential rain, which rotted its gear and spoiled its food.\nMeanwhile, as Gonzalo Pizarro questioned die Indians diey met along\nthe way, diose who seemed to be widiholding information, or who had\nnot even heard of die fabulous kingdom, he would torture and feed to\nthe dogs. Word of the Spaniards' mur-derousness spread quickly\namong the Indians, who realized that the only way to avoid Gonzalo's\nwrath was to make up stories about El Dorado and send him as far\naway as possible. As Gonzalo and his men followed die leads die\nIndians gave diem, dien, they were only led farther into deep jungle.\n\nThe explorers' spirits sagged. Their uniforms had long since\nshredded; their armor rusted and they threw it away; their shoes were\ntorn to pieces, forcing Uiem to walk barefoot; the Indian slaves they\nhad set out with had either died or deserted them; diey had eaten not\nonly the swine but the hunting dogs and llamas. They lived on roots\nand fruit. Realizing that they could not continue this way, Pizarro\ndecided to risk river travel, and a barge was built out of rotting wood.\nBut die journey down die treacherous Napo River proved no easier.\nSetting up camp on die river's edge, Gonzalo sent scouts ahead on the\n\n\nbarge to find Indian settlements with food. He waited and waited for\nthe scouts to return, only to find out they had decided to desert the\nexpedition and continue down the river on their own.\n\nThe rain continued without end. Gonzalo's men forgot about El\nDorado; diey wanted only to return to Quito. Finally, in August of\n1542, a little over a hundred men, from an expedition originally\nnumbering in the thousands, managed to find their way back. To the\nresidents of Quito they seemed to have emerged from hell itself,\nwrapped in tatters and skins, dieir bodies covered in sores, and so\nemaciated as to be unrecognizable. For over a year and a half diey had\nmarched in an enormous circle, two tiiou-sand miles by foot. The vast\nsums of money invested in die expedition had yielded nothingno sign\nof El Dorado and no sign of gold. Interpretation\n\nEven after Gonzalo Pizarro's disaster, the Spaniards launched\nexpedition after expedition in search of El Dorado. And like Pizarro\nthe conquistadors would burn and loot villages, torture Indians, endure\nunimaginable hardships, and get no closer to gold. The money they\nspent on such expeditions cannot be calculated; yet despite die futility\nof the search, the lure of the fantasy endured.\n\nNot only did die search for El Dorado cost millions of livesboth\nIndian and Spanishit helped bring the ruin of die Spanish empire. Gold\nbecame Spain's obsession. The gold diat did find its way back to\nSpainand a lot didwas reinvested in more expeditions, or in die\npurchase of luxuries, ratiier dian in agriculture or any other productive\nendeavor. Whole Spanish towns were depopulated as dieir menfolk left\nto hunt gold. Farms\n\nfell into ruin, and die army had no recruits for its European wars.\nBy the end of the seventeenth century, the entire country had shrunk by\nmore than half of its population; the city of Madrid had gone from a\npopulation of 400,000 to 150,000. With diminishing returns from its\nefforts over so many years, Spain fell into a decline from which it\nnever recovered.\n\nPower requires self-discipline. The prospect of wealdi,\nparticularly easy, sudden wealth, plays havoc with the emotions. The\nsuddenly rich believe that more is always possible.

Sudden wealdi rarely lasts, for it is built on nothing\nsolid. Never let lust for money lure you out of the protective and\nenduring fortress of real power. Make power your goal and money will\n\u2018ind its way to you. Leave El Dorado for suckers and fools.\n\nTransgression IT\n\nIn the early eighteenth century, no one stood higher in English\nsociety than the Duke and Duchess of Marlborough. The duke, having\nled successful campaigns against die French, was considered Europe's\npremier general and strategist. And his wife, the duchess, after much\nmaneuvering, had established herself as die favorite of Queen Anne,\nwho became ruler of England in 1702. In 1704 die duke's triumph at\ndie Battle of Blenheim made him die toast of England, and to honor\nhim die queen awarded him a large plot of land in die town of\nWoodstock, and die funds to create a great palace mere. Calling his\nplanned home die Palace of Blenheim, die duke chose as his architect\nthe young John Vanbrugh, a kind of Renaissance man who wrote plays\nas well as designed buildings. And so construction began, in die\nsummer of 1705, with much fanfare and great hopes.\n\nVanbrugh had a dramatist's sense of architecture. His palace was\nto be a monument to Marlborough's brilliance and power, and was to\ninclude artificial lakes, enormous bridges, elaborate gardens, and other\nfantastical touches. From day one, however, die duchess could not be\npleased: She thought Vanbrugh was wasting money on yet another\nstand of trees; she wanted die palace finished as soon as possible. The\nduchess tortured Vanbrugh and his workmen on every detail. She was\nconsumed with petty matters; aldiough die government was paying for\nBlenheim, she counted every penny. Eventually her grumbling, about\nBlenheim and other things too, created an irreparable rift between her\nand Queen Anne, who, in 1711, dismissed her from the court, ordering\nher to vacate her apartments at the royal palace. When die duchess left\n(fuming over the loss of her position, and also of her royal salary), she\nemptied die apartment of every fixture down to the brass doorknobs.\n\nOver the next ten years, work on Blenheim would stop and start,\nas the funds became harder to procure from die government.

It was said that this old man\nwas a miser who hoarded his silver until It changed to gold, and that he\ncared more for gold than anything else in all the world. One day a\nwilderness tiger sprang at him and though he ran he could not escape,\nand the tiger carried him off in its mouth.\n\nThe woodcutter's son saw his father's danger, and ran to save him\nif possible. He carried a long knife, and as he could run faster than the\ntiger, who had a man to carry, he soon overtook them. His father was\nnot much hurt, for the tiger held him by his clothes. When the old\nwoodcutter saw his son about to stab the tiger he called out in great\nalarm: \"Do not spoil the tiger's skin! Do not spoil the tiger's skin! If\nyou can kill him without cutting holes in his\n\nskin we ean get many\n\npieces of silver for it.\n\nKill him, but do not cut\n\nhis body.\"\n\nWhile the son was\n\nlistening to his father's\n\ninstructions the tiger\n\nsuddenly dashed off\n\ninto the forest, carrying\n\nthe old man where the\n\nson could not reach\n\nhim, and he was soon\n\nkilled.\n\n\u201cChinese table,\u201d\n\nvarious kables\n\nfrom various places,\n\nDiane di Prima, ed.,\n\nIt is written in the histories of the prophets that Moses was sent to\nPharaoh with many miracles, wonders and honors. Now the daily\nration for Pharaoh's table was 4,000 sheep, 400 cows, 200 camels, and\na corresponding amount of chickens, fish, beverages, fried meats,\nsweets, and other things. All the people of Egypt and all his army used\nto eat at his table every day. For 400 years he had claimed divinity and\nnever ceased providing this food. When Moses prayed, saying, \u201cO\nLord, destroy Pharaoh,\u201d God answered his prayer and said, \u201c/ shall\ndestroy him in water, and I shall bestow all his wealth and that of his\nsoldiers on you and your peoples. \u201d Several\n\nthought Vanbrugh was out to ruin her. She quibbled over every\ncarload of stone and bushel of lime, counted every extra yard of iron\nrailing or foot of wainscot, hurling abuse at the wasteful workmen,\ncontractors, and surveyors. Marlborough, old and weary, wanted\nnoming more than to settle into the palace in his last years, but the\nproject became bogged down in a swamp of litigation, the workmen\nsuing the duchess for wages, the duchess suing the architect right back.\nIn die midst of this interminable wrangling, the duke died. He had\nnever spent a night in his beloved Blenheim.\n\nAfter Marlborough's death, it became clear mat he had a vast\nestate, worm over \u00a32 millionmore man enough to pay for finishing die\npalace. But the duchess would not relent: She held back Vanbrugh's\nwages as well as the workmen's, and finally had the architect\ndismissed. The man who took his place finished Blenheim in a few\nyears, following Vanbrugh's designs to the letter. Vanbrugh died in\n1726, locked out of the palace by the duchess, unable to set foot in his\ngreatest creation. Foreshadowing the romantic movement, Blenheim\nhad started a whole new trend in architecture, but had given its creator\na twenty-year nightmare. Interpretation\n\nFor die Duchess of Marlborough, money was a way to play\nsadistic power games. She saw the loss of money as a symbolic loss of\npower. With Vanbrugh her contortions went deeper still: He was a\ngreat artist, and she envied his power to create, to attain a fame outside\nher reach. She may not have had his gifts, but she did have the money\nto torture and abuse him over the pettiest detailsto ruin his life.\n\nThis kind of sadism, however, bears an awful price. It made\nconstruction that should have lasted ten years take twenty. It poisoned\n\nmany a relationship, alienated the duchess from the court, deeply\npained the duke (who wanted only to live peacefully in Blenheim),\ncreated endless lawsuits, and took years off Vanbrugh's life. Finally,\ntoo, posterity had the last word: Vanbrugh is recognized as a genius\nwhile the duchess is forever remembered for her consummate\ncheapness.\n\nThe powerful must have grandeur of spiritthey can never reveal\nany pettiness. And money is the most visible arena in which to display\neither grandeur or pettiness. Best spend freely, then, and create a\nreputation for generosity, which in the end will pay great dividends.\nNever let financial details blind you to the bigger picture of how\npeople perceive you. Their resentment will cost you in the long run.\nAnd if you want to meddle in the work of creative people under your\nhire, at least pay diem well. Your money will buy their submission\nbetter tiian your displays of power.\n\nOBSERVANCES OF THE LAW\n\nObservance I\n\nPietro Aretino, son of a lowly shoemaker, had catapulted himself\ninto fame as a writer of biting satires. But like every Renaissance\nartist, he needed to find a patron who would give him a comfortable\nlifestyle while not inter-\n\nfering with his work. In 1528 Aretino decided to attempt a new\nstrategy in the patronage game. Leaving Rome, he established himself\nin Venice, where few had heard of him. He had a fair amount of money\nhe had managed to save, but little else. Soon after he moved into his\nnew home, however, he threw open its doors to rich and poor, regaling\nthem with banquets and amusements. He befriended each and every\ngondolier, tipping mem royally. In the streets, he spread his money\nliberally, giving it away to beggars, orphans, washerwomen. Among\nthe city's commoners, word quickly spread that Aretino was more than\njust a great writer, he was a man of powera kind of lord.\n\nArtists and men of influence soon began to frequent Aretino's\nhouse. Within a few years he made himself a celebrity; no visiting\ndignitary would think of leaving Venice without paying him a call. His\ngenerosity had cost him most of his savings, but had bought him\ninfluence and a good name a cornerstone in the foundation of power.\nSince in Renaissance Italy as elsewhere the ability to spend freely was\n\nthe privilege of the rich, the aristocracy thought Aretino had to be a\nman of influence, since he spent money like one. And since the\ninfluence of a man of influence is worth buying, Aretino became the\nrecipient of all sorts of gifts and moneys. Dukes and duchesses,\nwealthy merchants, and popes and princes competed to gain his favor,\nand showered him with all kinds of presents.\n\nAretino's spending habits, of course, were strategic, and the\nstrategy worked like a charm. But for real money and comfort he\nneeded a great patron's bottomless pockets. Having surveyed the\npossibilities, he eventually set his sights on the extremely wealthy\nMarquis of Mantua, and wrote an epic poem that he dedicated to the\nmarquis. This was a common practice of writers looking for patronage:\nIn exchange for a dedication they would get a small stipend, enough to\nwrite yet another poem, so that they spent their lives in a kind of\nconstant servility. Aretino, however, wanted power, not a measly wage.\nHe might dedicate a poem to the marquis, but he would offer it to him\nas a gift, implying by doing so that he was not a hired hack looking for\na stipend but that he and the marquis were equals.\n\nAretino's gift-giving did not stop there: As a close friend of two\nof Venice's greatest artists, the sculptor Jacopo Sansovino and the\npainter Titian, he convinced these men to participate in his gift-giving\nscheme. Aretino had studied the marquis before going to work on him,\nand knew his taste inside and out; he was able to advise Sansovino and\nTitian what subject matter would please the marquis most. When he\nthen sent a Sansovino sculpture and a Titian painting to the marquis as\ngifts from all three of them, the man was beside himself with joy.\n\nOver die next few months, Aretino sent other giftsswords,\nsaddles, the glass that was a Venetian specialty, tilings he knew the\nmarquis prized. Soon he, Titian, and Sansovino began to receive gifts\nfrom the marquis in return. And the strategy went further: When the\nson-in-law of a friend of Aretino's found himself in jail in Mantua,\nAretino was able to get the marquis to arrange his release. Aretino's\nfriend, a wealthy merchant, was a man of great influence in Venice; by\nturning the goodwill he had built up\n\nyears passed by after this promise, and Pharaoh, doomed to ruin,\ncontinued to live in all his magnificence. Moses was impatient for God\nto destroy Pharaoh quickly, and he could not endure to wait any longer.\n\nSo he fasted for forty days and went to Mount Sinai, and in his\ncommuning with god he said, \"O Lord, Thou didst promise that Thou\nwouldst destroy Pharaoh, and still he has forsaken none of his\nblasphemies and pretensions. So when wilt Thou destroy him1'\n\nA voice came from The Truth saying, \u201cO Moses, you want Me to\ndestroy Pharaoh as quickly as possible, but a thousand times a\nthousand of My servants want Me never to do so, because they partake\nof his bounty and enjoy tranquillity under his rule. By My power I\nswear that as long as he provides abundant food and comfort for My\ncreatures, I shall not destroy him.\u201d Moses said, \u201cThen when will Thy\npromise be fulfilled \u201d God said, \u201cMy promise will be fulfilled when he\nwithholds his provision from My creatures. If ever he begins to lessen\nhis bounty, know that his hour is drawing near. \u201d\n\nIt chanced that one day Pharaoh said to Haman, \"Moses has\ngathered the Sons of Israel about him and is causing us disquiet. We\nknow not what will be\n\nthe issue of his affair with us. We must keep our stores full lest at\nany time we be without resources. So we must halve our daily rations\nand keep the saving in reserve.\" He deducted 2,000 sheep, 200 cows,\nand a 100 camels, and similarly every two or three days reduced the\nration. Moses then knew that the promise of The Truth was near to\nfulfillment, for excessive economy is a sign of decline and a bad omen.\nThe masters of tradition say that on the day when Pharaoh was\ndrowned only two ewes had been killed in his kitchen. Nothing is\nbetter than generosity... .If a man is rich and desires, without a royal\ncharter, to act like a lord; if he wants men to humble themselves before\nhim, to revere him and call him lord and prince, then tell him every\nday to spread a table with victuals. All those who have acquired\nrenown in the world, have gained it mainly through hospitality, while\nthe miserly and avaricious are despised in both WorldStar, BOOK OF\ngovernment or rules for kings, Nizam al-Mulk, eleventh century\n\nwith the marquis to use, Aretino had now bought this man's\nindebtedness, too, and he in turn would help Aretino when he could.\nThe circle of influence was growing wider. Time and again, Aretino\nwas able to cash in on the immense political power of the marquis,\nwho also helped him in his many court romances.\n\n\nEventually, however, the relationship became strained, as Aretino\ncame to feel that the marquis should have requited his generosity\nbetter. But he would not lower himself to begging or whining: Since\nthe exchange of gifts between the two men had made them equals, it\nwould not seem right to bring up money. He simply withdrew from the\nmarquis's circle and hunted for other wealthy prey, settling first on the\nFrench king Francis, then the Medicis, the Duke of Urbino, Emperor\nCharles V, and more. In the end, having many patrons meant he did not\nhave to bow to any of them, and his power seemed comparable to that\nof a great lord. Interpretation\n\nAretino understood two fundamental properties of money: First,\nthat it has to circulate to bring power. What money should buy is not\nlifeless objects but power over people. By keeping money in constant\ncirculation, Aretino bought an ever-expanding circle of influence tfiat\nin the end more than compensated him for his expenses.\n\nSecond, Aretino understood the key property of the gift. To give a\ngift is to imply that you and the recipient are equals at the very least, or\nthat you are the recipient's superior. A gift also involves an\nindebtedness or obligation; when friends, for instance, offer you\nsomething for free, you can be sure they expect something in return,\nand that to get it they are making you feel indebted. (The mechanism\nmay or may not be entirely conscious on their part, but this is how it\nworks.)\n\nAretino avoided such encumbrances on his freedom. Instead of\nacting like a menial who expects the powerful to pay his way in life, he\nturned the whole dynamic around; instead of being indebted to the\npowerful, he made the powerful indebted to him. This was the point of\nhis gift-giving, a ladder that carried him to the highest social levels. By\nthe end of his life he had become the most famous writer in Europe.\n\nUnderstand: Money may determine power relationships, but those\nrelationships need not depend on the amount of money you have; they\nalso depend on the way you use it. Powerful people give freely, buying\ninfluence rather than things. If you accept the inferior position because\nyou have no fortune yet, you may find yourself in it forever. Play the\ntrick that Aretino played on Italy's aristocracy: Imagine yourself an\nequal. Play the lord, give freely, open your doors, circulate your\n\nmoney, and create the facade of power through an alchemy that\ntransforms money into influence.\n\nObservance II\n\nSoon after Baron James Rothschild made his fortune in Paris in\nthe early 1820s, he faced his most intractable problem: How could a\nJew and a German, a total outsider to French society, win the respect\nof the xenophobic French upper classes Rothschild was a man who\nunderstood powerhe\n\nknew that his fortune would bring him status, but that if he\nremained socially alienated neither his status nor his fortune would\nlast. So he looked at the society of die time and asked what would win\ntheir hearts.\n\nCharity The French couldn't care less. Political influence He\nalready had that, and if anything it only made people more suspicious\nof him. The one weak spot, he decided, was boredom. In the period of\nthe restoration of the monarchy, the French upper classes were bored.\nSo Rothschild began to spend astounding sums of money on\nentertaining them. He hired the best architects in France to design his\ngardens and ballroom; he hired Marie-Antoine Careme, the most\ncelebrated French chef, to prepare die most lavish parties Paris had\never witnessed; no Frenchman could resist, even if the parties were\ngiven by a German Jew. Rothschild's weekly soirees began to attract\nbigger and bigger numbers. Over the next few years he won the only\nthing that would secure an outsider's power: social acceptance.\nInterpretation\n\nStrategic generosity is always a great weapon in building a\nsupport base, particularly for die outsider. But die Baron de Rodischild\nwas cleverer still: He knew it was his money mat had created the\nbarrier between him and the French, making him look ugly and\nuntrustworthy. The best way to overcome this was literally to waste\nhuge sums, a gesture to show he valued French culture and society\nover money. What Rothschild did resembled the famous podatch feasts\nof the American Northwest: By periodically destroying its wealth in a\ngiant orgy of festivals and bonfires, an Indian tribe would symbolize\nits power over other tribes. The base of its power was not money but\nits ability to spend, and its confidence in a superiority diat would\nrestore to it all diat die podatch had destroyed.\n\nIn the end, the baron's soirees reflected his desire to mingle not\njust in France's business world but in its society. By wasting money on\nhis pot-latches, he hoped to demonstrate that his power went beyond\nmoney into the more precious realm of culture. Rothschild may have\nwon social acceptance by spending money, but die support base he\ngained was one diat money alone could not buy. To secure his fortune\nhe had to \u201cwaste\u201d it. That is strategic generosity in a nutshelldie ability\nto be flexible with your wealdi, putting it to work, not to buy objects,\nbut to win people's hearts.\n\nObservance III\n\nThe Medicis of Renaissance Florence had built dieir immense\npower on the fortune diey had made in banking. But in Florence,\ncenturies-old republic diat it was, die idea diat money bought power\nwent against all the city's proud democratic values. Cosimo de' Medici,\ndie first of die family to gain great fame, worked around diis by\nkeeping a low profile. He never flaunted his wealdi. But by die time\nhis grandson Lorenzo came of age, in the 1470s, the family's wealdi\nwas too large, and tiieir influence too noticeable, to be disguised any\nlonger.\n\nLorenzo solved die problem in his own way by developing die\nstrategy of distraction diat has served people of wealdi ever since: He\nbecame\n\nTHE FLAME-COLORED CLOAK\n\nDuring the campaign of Cambyses in Egypt, a great many Greeks\nvisited that country for one reason or another: some, as was to be\nexpected, for trade, some to serve in the army, others, no doubt, out o:\nmere curiosity, to see what they could see. Amongst the sightseers was\nAeaces's son Sylo-son, the exiled brother of Poly crates of Samos.\nWhile he was in Egypt, Syloson had an extraordinary stroke of luck:\nhe was hanging about the streets of Memphis dressed in a flame-\ncolored cloak, when Darius, who at that time was a member o\nCambyses's guard and not yet of any particular importance, happened\nto catch sight of him and, seized with a sudden longing to possess the\ncloak, came up to Syloson and made him an offer for it.\n\nHis extreme anxiety to get it was obvious enough to Syloson, who\nwas inspired to say: \u201c1 am not selling this for any money, but if you\nmust have it, I will give it to you for free.\u201d Darius thereupon thanked\n\n\nhim warmly and took it. Syloson at the moment merely thought he had\nlost it by his foolish good nature; then came the death of Cambyses\nand the revolt of the seven against the Magus, and Darius ascended the\nthrone. Syloson now\n\nhad the news that the man whose request for the flame-colored\ncloak he had formerly gratified in Egypt had become king of Persia.\nHe hurried to Susa, sat down at the entrance of the royal palace, and\nclaimed to be included in the official list of the king's benefactors. The\nsentry on guard reported his claim to Darius, who asked in surprise\nwho the man might be. \u201cFor surely,\u201d he said, \u201cas I have so recently\ncome to the throne, there cannot be any Greek to whom 1 am indebted\nfor a service. Hardly any of them have been here yet, and I certainly\ncannot remember owing anything to a Greek. But bring him in all the\nsame, that I may know what he means by this claim. \u201d The guard\nescorted Syloson into the royal presence, and when the interpreters\nasked him who he was and what he had done to justify the statement\nthat he was the king's benefactor, he reminded Darius of the story of\nthe cloak, and said that he was the man who had given it him. \u201cSir, \u201d\nexclaimed Darius, \"you are the most generous of men; for while I was\nstill a person of no power or consequence you gave me a presentsmall\nindeed, but deserving then as much gratitude from me as would the\nmost splendid of gifts today. I will give you in return more silver and\ngold than you can count, that you may\nthe most illustrious patron of the arts that history has ever known.\nNot only did he spend lavishly on paintings, he created Italy's finest\napprentice schools for young artists. It was in one of these schools that\nthe young Michelangelo first caught the attention of Lorenzo, who\ninvited the artist to come and live in his house. He did the same with\nLeonardo da Vinci. Once under his wing, Michelangelo and Leonardo\nrequited his generosity by becoming loyal artists in his stable.\n\nWhenever Lorenzo faced an enemy, he would wield the weapon\nof patronage. When Pisa, Florence's traditional enemy, threatened to\nrebel against it in 1472, Lorenzo placated its people by pouring money\ninto its university, which had once been its pride and joy but had long\nago lost its luster. The Pisans had no defense against this insidious\nmaneuver, which simultaneously fed tfieir love of culture and blunted\ntheir desire for battle. Interpretation\n\n\nLorenzo undoubtedly loved the arts, but his patronage of artists\nhad a practical function as well, of which he was keenly aware. In\nFlorence at die time, banking was perhaps die least admired way of\nmaking money, and was certainly not a respected source of power. The\narts were at the other pole, the pole of quasi-religious transcendence.\nBy spending on die arts, Lorenzo diluted people's opinions of the ugly\nsource of his wealth, disguising himself in nobility. There is no better\nuse of strategic generosity man mat of distracting attention from an\nunsavory reality and wrapping oneself in the mantle of art or religion.\n\nObservance IV\n\nLouis XIV had an eagle eye for the strategic power of money.\nWhen he came to the throne, the powerful nobility had recendy proven\na thorn in the monarchy's side, and seethed with rebelliousness. So he\nimpoverished diese aristocrats by making them spend enormous sums\non maintaining their position in the court. Making them dependent on\nroyal largesse for their livelihood, he had them in his claws.\n\nNext Louis brought the nobles to their knees with strategic\ngenerosity. It would work like this: Whenever he noticed a stubborn\ncourtier whose influence he needed to gain, or whose troublemaking\nhe needed to squelch, he would use his vast wealth to soften the soil.\nFirst he would ignore his victim, making the man anxious. Then the\nman would suddenly find that his son had been given a well-paid post,\nor that funds had been spent liberally in his home region, or mat he had\nbeen given a painting he had long coveted. Presents would flow from\nLouis's hands. Finally, weeks or months later, Louis would ask for die\nfavor he had needed all along. A man who had once vowed to do\nanything to stop the king would find he had lost the desire to fight. A\nstraightforward bribe would have made him rebellious; this was far\nmore insidious. Facing hardened earth in which nothing could take\nroot, Louis loosened the soil before he planted his seeds. Interpretation\n\nLouis understood that there is a deep-rooted emotional element in\nour attitude to money, an element going back to childhood. When we\nare chil-\n\ndren, all kinds of complicated feelings about our parents center\naround gifts; we see die giving of a gift as a sign of love and approval.\nAnd that emotional element never goes away. The recipients of gifts,\nfinancial or otherwise, are suddenly as vulnerable as children,\n\nespecially when the gift comes from someone in authority. They\ncannot help opening up; their will is loosened, as Louis loosened the\nsoil.\n\nTo succeed best, the gift should come out of the blue. It should be\nremarkable for the fact that a gift like it has never been given before,\nor for being preceded by a cold shoulder from the giver. The more\noften you give to particular people, the blunter this weapon becomes.\nIf they don't take your gifts for granted, becoming monsters of\ningratitude, they will resent what appears to be charity. The sudden,\nunexpected, one-time gift will not spoil your children; it will keep\nthem under your thumb.\n\nObservance V\n\nThe antique dealer Fushimiya, who lived in the city of Edo\n(former name for Tokyo) in the seventeenth century, once made a stop\nat a village teahouse. After enjoying a cup of tea, he spent several\nminutes scrutinizing the cup, which he eventually paid for and took\naway with him. A local artisan, watching this, waited until Fushimiya\nleft the shop, then approached the old woman who owned the teahouse\nand asked her who tiiis man was. She told him it was Japan's most\n\u2018amous connoisseur, antique dealer to die lord of Izumo. The artisan\nran out of the shop, caught up with Fushimiya, and begged him to sell\nhim the cup, which must clearly be valuable if Fushimiya judged it so.\nFushimiya laughed heartily: \u201cIt's just an ordinary cup of Bizen ware,\u201d\nhe explained, \u201cand it is not valuable at all. The reason I was looking at\nit was that the steam seemed to hang about it strangely and I wondered\nif there wasn't a leak somewhere.\u201d (Devotees of the Tea Ceremony\nwere interested in any odd or accidental beauty in nature.) Since die\nartisan still seemed so excited about it, Fushimiya gave him the cup for\nree.\n\nThe artisan took die cup around, trying to find an expert who\nwould appraise it at a high price, but since all of them recognized it as\nan ordinary teacup he got nowhere. Soon he was neglecting his own\nbusiness, thinking only of die cup and die fortune it could bring.\nFinally he went to Edo to talk to Fushimiya at his shop. There the\ndealer, realizing that he had inadvertently caused this man pain by\nmaking him believe the cup had great worth, paid him 100 ryo (gold\npieces) for the cup as a kindness. The cup was indeed mediocre, but he\n\n\nwanted to rid the artisan of his obsession, while also allowing him to\nfeel tiiat his effort had not been wasted. The artisan thanked him and\nwent on his way.\n\nSoon word spread of Fushimiya's purchase of the teacup. Every\ndealer in Japan clamored for him to sell it, since a cup he had bought\nfor 100 ryo must be worth much more. He tried to explain the\ncircumstances in which he had bought die cup, but the dealers could\nnot be dissuaded. Fushimiya finally relented and put die cup up for\nsale.\n\nDuring the auction, two buyers simultaneously bid 200 ryo for the\nteacup, and then began to fight over who had bid first. Their fighting\n\nnever regret that you onee did a favor to Darius the son of\nHystaspes.\u201c \u201dMy lord,\u201c replied Syloson, \u201ddo not give me gold or\nsilver, but recover Samos for me, my native island, which now since\nOroetes killed my brother Poly-crates is in the hands of one of our\nservants. Let Samos be your gift to mebut let no man in the island be\nkilled or enslaved.\" Darius consented to Syloson's request, and\ndispatched a force under the command of Otanes, one of the seven,\nwith orders to do everything that Syloson had asked.\n\nthe histories, Herodotus, fifth century b.c.\n\nMoney is never spent to so much advantage as when you have\nbeen cheated out of it; for at one stroke you have purchased prudence.\n\nArthur\n\nSchopenhauer,\n\n1788-1860\n\nKung-yi Hsiu, premier of Lu, was fond offish. Therefore, people\nin the whole country conscientiously bought fish, which they presented\nto him. However, Kung-yi would not accept the presents. Against such\na step his younger brother remonstrated with him and said: \u201cYou like\nfish, indeed. Why don't you accept the present offish \u201d In reply, he\nsaid: \u201cIt is solely because I like fish that I would not accept the fish\nthey gave me. Indeed, if I accept the fish, I will be placed under an\nobligation to them. Once placed under an obligation to them, I will\nsome time have to bend the law. If I bend the law, I will be dismissed\nfrom the premiership. After being dismissed from the premiership, I\nmight not be able to supply myself with fish. On the contrary, if I do\n\n\nnot accept the fish from them and am not dismissed the premiership,\nhowever fond of fish, I can always supply myself with fish.\u201d\n\nChinese philosopher, third century b.c.\n\ntipped over a table and the teacup fell to the ground and broke\ninto several pieces. The auction was clearly over. Fushimiya glued and\nmended the cup, then stored it away, dunking the affair finished. Years\nlater, however, the great tea master Matsudaira Fumai visited the store,\nand asked to see the cup, which by then had become legendary. Fumai\nexamined it. \u201cAs a piece,\u201d he said, \u201cit is not up to much, but a Tea\nMaster prizes sentiment and association more than intrinsic value.\u201d He\nbought the cup for a high sum. A glued-together work of less than\nordinary craftsmanship had become one of the most famous objects in\nJapan. Interpretation\n\nThe story shows, first, an essential aspect of money: That it is\nhumans who have created it and humans who instill it with meaning\nand value. Second, with objects as with money, what the courtier most\nvalues are the sentiments and emotions embedded in themthese are\nwhat make them worth having. The lesson is simple: The more your\ngifts and your acts of generosity play with sentiment, the more\npowerful mey are. The object or concept that plays with a charged\nemotion or hits a chord of sentiment has more power than the money\nyou squander on an expensive yet lifeless present.\n\nObservance VI\n\nAkimoto Suzutomo, a wealthy adherent of the tea ceremony, once\ngave his page 100 ryo (gold pieces) and instructed him to purchase a\ntea bowl offered by a particular dealer. When the page saw the bowl,\nhe doubted it was worth that much, and after much bargaining got the\nprice reduced to 95 ryo. Days later, after Suzutomo had put the bowl to\nuse, the page proudly told him what he had done.\n\n\u201cWhat an ignoramus you are!\u201d replied Suzutomo. \u201cA tea bowl\nthat anyone asks 100 pieces of gold for can only be a family heirloom,\nand a thing like that is only sold when the family is pressed for money.\nAnd in that case tiiey will be hoping to find someone who will give\neven 150 pieces for it. So what sort of fellow is it who does not\nconsider their feelings Quite apart from that, a curio that you give 100\nryo for is something worth having, but one that has only cost 95 gives\n\n\na mean impression. So never let me see that tea bowl again!\u201d And he\nhad die bowl locked away, and never took it out. Interpretation\n\nWhen you insist on paying less, you may save your five ryo, but\ndie insult you cause and the cheap impression you create will cost you\nin reputation, which is the thing the powerful prize above all. Learn to\npay the full priceit will save you a lot in the end.\n\nObservance VII\n\nSometime near the beginning of die seventeenth century in Japan,\na group of generals whiled away the time before a big battle by staging\nan incense-smelling competition. Each participant anted up a prize for\nthe contest's winnersbows, arrows, saddles, and odier items a warrior\nwould covet.\n\nThe great Lord Date Masamune happened to pass by and was\ninduced to participate. For a prize, he offered the gourd that hung from\nhis belt. Everyone laughed, for no one wanted to win this cheap item.\nA retainer of die host finally accepted the gourd.\n\nWhen die party broke up, however, and the generals were chatting\noutside the tent, Masamune brought over his magnificent horse and\ngave it to the retainer. \u201cThere,\u201d he said, \u201ca horse has come out of the\ngourd.\u201d The stunned generals suddenly regretted their scorn at\nMasamune's gift. Interpretation\n\nMasamune understood the following: Money gives its possessor\nthe ability to give pleasure to others. The more you can do this, the\nmore you attract admiration. When you make a horse come out of a\ngourd, you give the ultimate demonstration of your power.\n\nImage: The River. To protect yourself or to save the resource, you\ndam it up.

A miserly\nman can conquer neither lands nor lordships, for he does not have a\nplentiful supply of friends with whom he may work his will. Whoever\nwants to have friends must not love his possessions but must acquire\nfriends by means of fair gifts; for in the same way that the lodestone\nsubtly draws iron to itself, so the gold and silver that a man gives\nattract the hearts of men. (The Romance of the Rose, Guillaume de\nLorris, c. 1200-1238)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nThe powerful never forget that what is offered for free is\ninevitably a trick. Friends who offer favors without asking for payment\nwill later want something far dearer than the money you would have\npaid them. The bargain has hidden problems, both material and\npsychological. Learn to pay, then, and to pay well.\n\nOn the other hand, this Law offers great opportunities for\nswindling and deception if you apply it from the other side. Dangling\nthe lure of a free lunch is the con artist's stock in trade.\n\nNo man was better at this than the most successful con artist of\nour age, Joseph Weil, a.k.a. \u201cThe Yellow Kid.\u201d The Yellow Kid\nlearned early that what made his swindles possible was his fellow\nhumans' greed. \u201cThis desire to get something for nothing,\u201d he once\nwrote, \u201chas been very costly to many people who have dealt with me\nand with other con men. . . . When people learnas I doubt they willthat\nthey can't get something for nothing, crime will diminish and we shall\nall live in greater harmony.\u201d Over the years Weil devised many ways\nto seduce people with the prospect of easy money. He would hand out\n\u201cfree\u201d real estatewho could resist such an offerand then the suckers\nwould learn they had to pay $25 to register the sale. Since the land was\nfree, it seemed worth the high fee, and the Yellow Kid would make\nthousands of dollars on the phony registration. In exchange he would\ngive his suckers a phony deed. Other times, he would tell suckers\nabout a fixed horse race, or a stock that would earn 200 percent in a\n\nfew weeks. As he spun his stories he would watch the sucker's eyes\nopen wide at the thought of a free lunch.\n\nThe lesson is simple: Bait your deceptions with the possibility of\neasy money. People are essentially lazy, and want wealth to fall in their\nlap rather than to work for it. For a small sum, sell them advice on how\nto make millions (P. T. Barnum did this later in life), and that small\nsum will become a fortune when multiplied by thousands of suckers.\nLure people in with the prospect of easy money and you have the room\nto work still more deceptions on them, since greed is powerful enough\nto blind your victims to anything. And as the Yellow Kid said, half the\nfun is teaching a moral lesson: Greed does not pay.\n'.

The powerful learn early to protect\ntheir most valuable resources: independence and room to maneuver.\nBy paying the full price, they keep themselves free of dangerous\nentanglements and worries.\n\nBeing open and flexible with money also teaches the value of\nstrategic generosity, a variation on the old trick of \u201cgiving when you\nare about to take.\u201d By giving the appropriate gift, you put the recipient\nunder obligation. Generosity softens people upto be deceived. By\ngaining a reputation for liberality, you win people's admiration while\ndistracting them from your power plays. By strategically spreading\nyour wealth, you charm the other courtiers, creating pleasure and\nmaking valuable allies.\n\nLook at the masters of powerthe Caesars, the Queen Elizabeths,\nthe Michelangelos, the Medicis: Not a miser among them.

The greedy fish take the human side out of\nmoney. Cold and ruthless, they see only the lifeless balance sheet;\nviewing others solely as either pawns or obstructions in their pursuit of\nwealth, they trample on people's sentiments and alienate valuable\nallies. No one wants to work with the greedy fish, and over the years\nthey end up isolated, which often proves their undoing.\n\nGreedy fish are the con artist's bread and butter: Lured by the bait\nof easy money, they swallow the ruse hook, line, and sinker. They are\neasy to deceive, for they spend so much time dealing with numbers\n(not with people) that they become blind to psychology, including their\nown. Either avoid them before they exploit you or play on their greed\nto your gain.\n\nThe Bargain Demon. Powerful people judge everything by what it\ncosts, not just in money but in time, dignity, and peace of mind. And\nthis is exactly what Bargain Demons cannot do. Wasting valuable time\ndigging for bargains, they worry endlessly about what they could have\ngotten elsewhere for a litde less. On top of that, the bargain item they\ndo buy is often shabby; perhaps it needs costly repairs, or will have to\nbe replaced twice as\n\nfast as a high-quality item. The costs of these pursuitsnot always\nin money (though the price of a bargain is often deceptive) but in time\nand peace of minddiscourage normal people from undertaking mem,\nbut for the Bargain Demon the bargain is an end in itself.\n\nThese types might seem to harm only themselves, but their\nattitudes are contagious: Unless you resist them they will infect you\nwith the insecure feeling that you should have looked harder to find a\ncheaper price. Don't argue with them or try to change diem. Just\nmentally add up the cost, in time and inner peace if not in hidden\nfinancial expense, of the irrational pursuit of a bargain.\n\nfrom their inability to make a living and their laziness in this\nrespect.

The\nstory soon spread of an Indian chief to the east of Peru who once each\nyear would ritually cover himself in gold dust and dive into a lake.\nSoon word of mouth transformed El Dorado, the \u201cGolden Man,\u201d into\nan empire called El Dorado, wealthier than the Incan, where the streets\nwere paved and the buildings inlaid with gold. This elaboration of die\nstory did not seem implausible, for surely a diief who could afford to\nwaste gold dust in a lake must rule a golden empire. Soon Spaniards\nwere searching for El Dorado all over northern South America.\n\nTHE MISKR\n\nA miser, to make sure of his property, sold all that he had and\nconverted it into a great lump of gold, which he hid in a hole in the\nground, and went continually to visit and inspect it. This roused the\ncuriosity of one of his workmen, who, suspecting that there was a\ntreasure, when his master's back was turned, went to the spot, and stole\nit away. When the miser returned and found the place empty, he wept\nand tore his hair. But a neighbor who saw him in this extravagant grief,\nand learned the cause of it, said: \u201cFret thyself no longer, but take a\nstone and put it in the same place, and think that it is your lump of\ngold; for, as you never meant to use it, the one will do you as much\ngood as the other.\u201d\n\nThe worth of money is not in its possession, but in its use.\n\nFABLES,\n\nAesop,\n\nsixth century b.c.\n\nThere is a popular saying in Japan that goes \u201cTada yori takai\nmono wa nai,\u201d meaning: \u201cNothing is more costly than something given\nfree of charge.\u201d\n\nTHE UNSPOKEN WAY, MICHIHIRO\n\nMatsumoto, 1988\n\nYusuf Ibn Jafar el-Amudl used to take sums of money, sometimes\nvery large ones, from those who came to study with him. A\ndistinguished legalist visiting him once said: \u201cI am enchanted and\nimpressed by your teachings, and I am sure that you are directing your\ndisciples in a proper manner. But it is not in accordance with tradition\nto take money for knowledge. Besides, the action is open to\nmisinterpretation.\u201d El-Amudi said: \"I have never sold any knowledge.\nThere is no money on earth sufficient to pay for it. As for\nmisinterpretation, the abstaining from taking money will not prevent it,\nfor it will find some other object. Rather should you know that a man\nwho takes money may be greedy for money, or he may not. But a man\nwho takes nothing at all is under the gravest\n\nIn February of 1541, the largest expedition yet in diis venture, led\nby Pizarro's brother Gonzalo, left Quito, in Ecuador. Resplendent in\ntheir armors and colorful silks, 340 Spaniards headed east, along with\n4,000 Indians to carry supplies and serve as scouts, 4,000 swine,\ndozens of llamas, and close to 1,000 dogs. But the expedition was soon\nhit by torrential rain, which rotted its gear and spoiled its food.\nMeanwhile, as Gonzalo Pizarro questioned die Indians diey met along\nthe way, diose who seemed to be widiholding information, or who had\nnot even heard of die fabulous kingdom, he would torture and feed to\nthe dogs. Word of the Spaniards' mur-derousness spread quickly\namong the Indians, who realized that the only way to avoid Gonzalo's\nwrath was to make up stories about El Dorado and send him as far\naway as possible. As Gonzalo and his men followed die leads die\nIndians gave diem, dien, they were only led farther into deep jungle.\n\nThe explorers' spirits sagged. Their uniforms had long since\nshredded; their armor rusted and they threw it away; their shoes were\ntorn to pieces, forcing Uiem to walk barefoot; the Indian slaves they\nhad set out with had either died or deserted them; diey had eaten not\nonly the swine but the hunting dogs and llamas. They lived on roots\nand fruit. Realizing that they could not continue this way, Pizarro\ndecided to risk river travel, and a barge was built out of rotting wood.\nBut die journey down die treacherous Napo River proved no easier.\nSetting up camp on die river's edge, Gonzalo sent scouts ahead on the\n\n\nbarge to find Indian settlements with food. He waited and waited for\nthe scouts to return, only to find out they had decided to desert the\nexpedition and continue down the river on their own.\n\nThe rain continued without end. Gonzalo's men forgot about El\nDorado; diey wanted only to return to Quito. Finally, in August of\n1542, a little over a hundred men, from an expedition originally\nnumbering in the thousands, managed to find their way back. To the\nresidents of Quito they seemed to have emerged from hell itself,\nwrapped in tatters and skins, dieir bodies covered in sores, and so\nemaciated as to be unrecognizable. For over a year and a half diey had\nmarched in an enormous circle, two tiiou-sand miles by foot. The vast\nsums of money invested in die expedition had yielded nothingno sign\nof El Dorado and no sign of gold. Interpretation\n\nEven after Gonzalo Pizarro's disaster, the Spaniards launched\nexpedition after expedition in search of El Dorado. And like Pizarro\nthe conquistadors would burn and loot villages, torture Indians, endure\nunimaginable hardships, and get no closer to gold. The money they\nspent on such expeditions cannot be calculated; yet despite die futility\nof the search, the lure of the fantasy endured.\n\nNot only did die search for El Dorado cost millions of livesboth\nIndian and Spanishit helped bring the ruin of die Spanish empire.

The gold diat did find its way back to\nSpainand a lot didwas reinvested in more expeditions, or in die\npurchase of luxuries, ratiier dian in agriculture or any other productive\nendeavor. Whole Spanish towns were depopulated as dieir menfolk left\nto hunt gold. Farms\n\nfell into ruin, and die army had no recruits for its European wars.\nBy the end of the seventeenth century, the entire country had shrunk by\nmore than half of its population; the city of Madrid had gone from a\npopulation of 400,000 to 150,000. With diminishing returns from its\nefforts over so many years, Spain fell into a decline from which it\nnever recovered.\n\nPower requires self-discipline.

Leave El Dorado for suckers and fools.\n\nTransgression IT\n\nIn the early eighteenth century, no one stood higher in English\nsociety than the Duke and Duchess of Marlborough. The duke, having\nled successful campaigns against die French, was considered Europe's\npremier general and strategist. And his wife, the duchess, after much\nmaneuvering, had established herself as die favorite of Queen Anne,\nwho became ruler of England in 1702. In 1704 die duke's triumph at\ndie Battle of Blenheim made him die toast of England, and to honor\nhim die queen awarded him a large plot of land in die town of\nWoodstock, and die funds to create a great palace mere. Calling his\nplanned home die Palace of Blenheim, die duke chose as his architect\nthe young John Vanbrugh, a kind of Renaissance man who wrote plays\nas well as designed buildings. And so construction began, in die\nsummer of 1705, with much fanfare and great hopes.\n\nVanbrugh had a dramatist's sense of architecture. His palace was\nto be a monument to Marlborough's brilliance and power, and was to\ninclude artificial lakes, enormous bridges, elaborate gardens, and other\nfantastical touches. From day one, however, die duchess could not be\npleased: She thought Vanbrugh was wasting money on yet another\nstand of trees; she wanted die palace finished as soon as possible. The\nduchess tortured Vanbrugh and his workmen on every detail. She was\nconsumed with petty matters; aldiough die government was paying for\nBlenheim, she counted every penny. Eventually her grumbling, about\nBlenheim and other things too, created an irreparable rift between her\nand Queen Anne, who, in 1711, dismissed her from the court, ordering\nher to vacate her apartments at the royal palace. When die duchess left\n(fuming over the loss of her position, and also of her royal salary), she\nemptied die apartment of every fixture down to the brass doorknobs.\n\nOver the next ten years, work on Blenheim would stop and start,\nas the funds became harder to procure from die government.

It was said that this old man\nwas a miser who hoarded his silver until It changed to gold, and that he\ncared more for gold than anything else in all the world. One day a\nwilderness tiger sprang at him and though he ran he could not escape,\nand the tiger carried him off in its mouth.\n\nThe woodcutter's son saw his father's danger, and ran to save him\nif possible. He carried a long knife, and as he could run faster than the\ntiger, who had a man to carry, he soon overtook them. His father was\nnot much hurt, for the tiger held him by his clothes. When the old\nwoodcutter saw his son about to stab the tiger he called out in great\nalarm: \"Do not spoil the tiger's skin! Do not spoil the tiger's skin! If\nyou can kill him without cutting holes in his\n\nskin we ean get many\n\npieces of silver for it.\n\nKill him, but do not cut\n\nhis body.\"\n\nWhile the son was\n\nlistening to his father's\n\ninstructions the tiger\n\nsuddenly dashed off\n\ninto the forest, carrying\n\nthe old man where the\n\nson could not reach\n\nhim, and he was soon\n\nkilled.\n\n\u201cChinese table,\u201d\n\nvarious kables\n\nfrom various places,\n\nDiane di Prima, ed.,\n\nIt is written in the histories of the prophets that Moses was sent to\nPharaoh with many miracles, wonders and honors. Now the daily\nration for Pharaoh's table was 4,000 sheep, 400 cows, 200 camels, and\na corresponding amount of chickens, fish, beverages, fried meats,\nsweets, and other things. All the people of Egypt and all his army used\nto eat at his table every day. For 400 years he had claimed divinity and\nnever ceased providing this food. When Moses prayed, saying, \u201cO\nLord, destroy Pharaoh,\u201d God answered his prayer and said, \u201c/ shall\ndestroy him in water, and I shall bestow all his wealth and that of his\nsoldiers on you and your peoples. \u201d Several\n\nthought Vanbrugh was out to ruin her. She quibbled over every\ncarload of stone and bushel of lime, counted every extra yard of iron\nrailing or foot of wainscot, hurling abuse at the wasteful workmen,\ncontractors, and surveyors. Marlborough, old and weary, wanted\nnoming more than to settle into the palace in his last years, but the\nproject became bogged down in a swamp of litigation, the workmen\nsuing the duchess for wages, the duchess suing the architect right back.\nIn die midst of this interminable wrangling, the duke died. He had\nnever spent a night in his beloved Blenheim.\n\nAfter Marlborough's death, it became clear mat he had a vast\nestate, worm over \u00a32 millionmore man enough to pay for finishing die\npalace. But the duchess would not relent: She held back Vanbrugh's\nwages as well as the workmen's, and finally had the architect\ndismissed. The man who took his place finished Blenheim in a few\nyears, following Vanbrugh's designs to the letter. Vanbrugh died in\n1726, locked out of the palace by the duchess, unable to set foot in his\ngreatest creation. Foreshadowing the romantic movement, Blenheim\nhad started a whole new trend in architecture, but had given its creator\na twenty-year nightmare. Interpretation\n\nFor die Duchess of Marlborough, money was a way to play\nsadistic power games. She saw the loss of money as a symbolic loss of\npower. With Vanbrugh her contortions went deeper still: He was a\ngreat artist, and she envied his power to create, to attain a fame outside\nher reach. She may not have had his gifts, but she did have the money\nto torture and abuse him over the pettiest detailsto ruin his life.\n\nThis kind of sadism, however, bears an awful price. It made\nconstruction that should have lasted ten years take twenty. It poisoned\n\nmany a relationship, alienated the duchess from the court, deeply\npained the duke (who wanted only to live peacefully in Blenheim),\ncreated endless lawsuits, and took years off Vanbrugh's life. Finally,\ntoo, posterity had the last word: Vanbrugh is recognized as a genius\nwhile the duchess is forever remembered for her consummate\ncheapness.\n\nThe powerful must have grandeur of spiritthey can never reveal\nany pettiness. And money is the most visible arena in which to display\neither grandeur or pettiness. Best spend freely, then, and create a\nreputation for generosity, which in the end will pay great dividends.\nNever let financial details blind you to the bigger picture of how\npeople perceive you. Their resentment will cost you in the long run.\nAnd if you want to meddle in the work of creative people under your\nhire, at least pay diem well. Your money will buy their submission\nbetter tiian your displays of power.\n\nOBSERVANCES OF THE LAW\n\nObservance I\n\nPietro Aretino, son of a lowly shoemaker, had catapulted himself\ninto fame as a writer of biting satires. But like every Renaissance\nartist, he needed to find a patron who would give him a comfortable\nlifestyle while not inter-\n\nfering with his work. In 1528 Aretino decided to attempt a new\nstrategy in the patronage game. Leaving Rome, he established himself\nin Venice, where few had heard of him. He had a fair amount of money\nhe had managed to save, but little else. Soon after he moved into his\nnew home, however, he threw open its doors to rich and poor, regaling\nthem with banquets and amusements. He befriended each and every\ngondolier, tipping mem royally. In the streets, he spread his money\nliberally, giving it away to beggars, orphans, washerwomen. Among\nthe city's commoners, word quickly spread that Aretino was more than\njust a great writer, he was a man of powera kind of lord.\n\nArtists and men of influence soon began to frequent Aretino's\nhouse. Within a few years he made himself a celebrity; no visiting\ndignitary would think of leaving Venice without paying him a call. His\ngenerosity had cost him most of his savings, but had bought him\ninfluence and a good name a cornerstone in the foundation of power.\nSince in Renaissance Italy as elsewhere the ability to spend freely was\n\nthe privilege of the rich, the aristocracy thought Aretino had to be a\nman of influence, since he spent money like one. And since the\ninfluence of a man of influence is worth buying, Aretino became the\nrecipient of all sorts of gifts and moneys. Dukes and duchesses,\nwealthy merchants, and popes and princes competed to gain his favor,\nand showered him with all kinds of presents.\n\nAretino's spending habits, of course, were strategic, and the\nstrategy worked like a charm. But for real money and comfort he\nneeded a great patron's bottomless pockets. Having surveyed the\npossibilities, he eventually set his sights on the extremely wealthy\nMarquis of Mantua, and wrote an epic poem that he dedicated to the\nmarquis. This was a common practice of writers looking for patronage:\nIn exchange for a dedication they would get a small stipend, enough to\nwrite yet another poem, so that they spent their lives in a kind of\nconstant servility. Aretino, however, wanted power, not a measly wage.\nHe might dedicate a poem to the marquis, but he would offer it to him\nas a gift, implying by doing so that he was not a hired hack looking for\na stipend but that he and the marquis were equals.\n\nAretino's gift-giving did not stop there: As a close friend of two\nof Venice's greatest artists, the sculptor Jacopo Sansovino and the\npainter Titian, he convinced these men to participate in his gift-giving\nscheme. Aretino had studied the marquis before going to work on him,\nand knew his taste inside and out; he was able to advise Sansovino and\nTitian what subject matter would please the marquis most. When he\nthen sent a Sansovino sculpture and a Titian painting to the marquis as\ngifts from all three of them, the man was beside himself with joy.\n\nOver die next few months, Aretino sent other giftsswords,\nsaddles, the glass that was a Venetian specialty, tilings he knew the\nmarquis prized. Soon he, Titian, and Sansovino began to receive gifts\nfrom the marquis in return. And the strategy went further: When the\nson-in-law of a friend of Aretino's found himself in jail in Mantua,\nAretino was able to get the marquis to arrange his release. Aretino's\nfriend, a wealthy merchant, was a man of great influence in Venice; by\nturning the goodwill he had built up\n\nyears passed by after this promise, and Pharaoh, doomed to ruin,\ncontinued to live in all his magnificence. Moses was impatient for God\nto destroy Pharaoh quickly, and he could not endure to wait any longer.\n\nSo he fasted for forty days and went to Mount Sinai, and in his\ncommuning with god he said, \"O Lord, Thou didst promise that Thou\nwouldst destroy Pharaoh, and still he has forsaken none of his\nblasphemies and pretensions. So when wilt Thou destroy him1'\n\nA voice came from The Truth saying, \u201cO Moses, you want Me to\ndestroy Pharaoh as quickly as possible, but a thousand times a\nthousand of My servants want Me never to do so, because they partake\nof his bounty and enjoy tranquillity under his rule. By My power I\nswear that as long as he provides abundant food and comfort for My\ncreatures, I shall not destroy him.\u201d Moses said, \u201cThen when will Thy\npromise be fulfilled \u201d God said, \u201cMy promise will be fulfilled when he\nwithholds his provision from My creatures. If ever he begins to lessen\nhis bounty, know that his hour is drawing near. \u201d\n\nIt chanced that one day Pharaoh said to Haman, \"Moses has\ngathered the Sons of Israel about him and is causing us disquiet. We\nknow not what will be\n\nthe issue of his affair with us. We must keep our stores full lest at\nany time we be without resources. So we must halve our daily rations\nand keep the saving in reserve.\" He deducted 2,000 sheep, 200 cows,\nand a 100 camels, and similarly every two or three days reduced the\nration. Moses then knew that the promise of The Truth was near to\nfulfillment, for excessive economy is a sign of decline and a bad omen.\nThe masters of tradition say that on the day when Pharaoh was\ndrowned only two ewes had been killed in his kitchen. Nothing is\nbetter than generosity... .If a man is rich and desires, without a royal\ncharter, to act like a lord; if he wants men to humble themselves before\nhim, to revere him and call him lord and prince, then tell him every\nday to spread a table with victuals. All those who have acquired\nrenown in the world, have gained it mainly through hospitality, while\nthe miserly and avaricious are despised in both WorldStar, BOOK OF\ngovernment or rules for kings, Nizam al-Mulk, eleventh century\n\nwith the marquis to use, Aretino had now bought this man's\nindebtedness, too, and he in turn would help Aretino when he could.\nThe circle of influence was growing wider. Time and again, Aretino\nwas able to cash in on the immense political power of the marquis,\nwho also helped him in his many court romances.\n\n\nEventually, however, the relationship became strained, as Aretino\ncame to feel that the marquis should have requited his generosity\nbetter. But he would not lower himself to begging or whining: Since\nthe exchange of gifts between the two men had made them equals, it\nwould not seem right to bring up money. He simply withdrew from the\nmarquis's circle and hunted for other wealthy prey, settling first on the\nFrench king Francis, then the Medicis, the Duke of Urbino, Emperor\nCharles V, and more. In the end, having many patrons meant he did not\nhave to bow to any of them, and his power seemed comparable to that\nof a great lord. Interpretation\n\nAretino understood two fundamental properties of money: First,\nthat it has to circulate to bring power. What money should buy is not\nlifeless objects but power over people. By keeping money in constant\ncirculation, Aretino bought an ever-expanding circle of influence tfiat\nin the end more than compensated him for his expenses.\n\nSecond, Aretino understood the key property of the gift. To give a\ngift is to imply that you and the recipient are equals at the very least, or\nthat you are the recipient's superior. A gift also involves an\nindebtedness or obligation; when friends, for instance, offer you\nsomething for free, you can be sure they expect something in return,\nand that to get it they are making you feel indebted. (The mechanism\nmay or may not be entirely conscious on their part, but this is how it\nworks.)\n\nAretino avoided such encumbrances on his freedom. Instead of\nacting like a menial who expects the powerful to pay his way in life, he\nturned the whole dynamic around; instead of being indebted to the\npowerful, he made the powerful indebted to him. This was the point of\nhis gift-giving, a ladder that carried him to the highest social levels. By\nthe end of his life he had become the most famous writer in Europe.\n\nUnderstand: Money may determine power relationships, but those\nrelationships need not depend on the amount of money you have; they\nalso depend on the way you use it. Powerful people give freely, buying\ninfluence rather than things. If you accept the inferior position because\nyou have no fortune yet, you may find yourself in it forever. Play the\ntrick that Aretino played on Italy's aristocracy: Imagine yourself an\nequal. Play the lord, give freely, open your doors, circulate your\n\nmoney, and create the facade of power through an alchemy that\ntransforms money into influence.\n\nObservance II\n\nSoon after Baron James Rothschild made his fortune in Paris in\nthe early 1820s, he faced his most intractable problem: How could a\nJew and a German, a total outsider to French society, win the respect\nof the xenophobic French upper classes Rothschild was a man who\nunderstood powerhe\n\nknew that his fortune would bring him status, but that if he\nremained socially alienated neither his status nor his fortune would\nlast. So he looked at the society of die time and asked what would win\ntheir hearts.\n\nCharity The French couldn't care less. Political influence He\nalready had that, and if anything it only made people more suspicious\nof him. The one weak spot, he decided, was boredom. In the period of\nthe restoration of the monarchy, the French upper classes were bored.\nSo Rothschild began to spend astounding sums of money on\nentertaining them. He hired the best architects in France to design his\ngardens and ballroom; he hired Marie-Antoine Careme, the most\ncelebrated French chef, to prepare die most lavish parties Paris had\never witnessed; no Frenchman could resist, even if the parties were\ngiven by a German Jew. Rothschild's weekly soirees began to attract\nbigger and bigger numbers. Over the next few years he won the only\nthing that would secure an outsider's power: social acceptance.\nInterpretation\n\nStrategic generosity is always a great weapon in building a\nsupport base, particularly for die outsider. But die Baron de Rodischild\nwas cleverer still: He knew it was his money mat had created the\nbarrier between him and the French, making him look ugly and\nuntrustworthy. The best way to overcome this was literally to waste\nhuge sums, a gesture to show he valued French culture and society\nover money. What Rothschild did resembled the famous podatch feasts\nof the American Northwest: By periodically destroying its wealth in a\ngiant orgy of festivals and bonfires, an Indian tribe would symbolize\nits power over other tribes. The base of its power was not money but\nits ability to spend, and its confidence in a superiority diat would\nrestore to it all diat die podatch had destroyed.\n\nIn the end, the baron's soirees reflected his desire to mingle not\njust in France's business world but in its society. By wasting money on\nhis pot-latches, he hoped to demonstrate that his power went beyond\nmoney into the more precious realm of culture. Rothschild may have\nwon social acceptance by spending money, but die support base he\ngained was one diat money alone could not buy. To secure his fortune\nhe had to \u201cwaste\u201d it. That is strategic generosity in a nutshelldie ability\nto be flexible with your wealdi, putting it to work, not to buy objects,\nbut to win people's hearts.\n\nObservance III\n\nThe Medicis of Renaissance Florence had built dieir immense\npower on the fortune diey had made in banking. But in Florence,\ncenturies-old republic diat it was, die idea diat money bought power\nwent against all the city's proud democratic values. Cosimo de' Medici,\ndie first of die family to gain great fame, worked around diis by\nkeeping a low profile. He never flaunted his wealdi. But by die time\nhis grandson Lorenzo came of age, in the 1470s, the family's wealdi\nwas too large, and tiieir influence too noticeable, to be disguised any\nlonger.\n\nLorenzo solved die problem in his own way by developing die\nstrategy of distraction diat has served people of wealdi ever since: He\nbecame\n\nTHE FLAME-COLORED CLOAK\n\nDuring the campaign of Cambyses in Egypt, a great many Greeks\nvisited that country for one reason or another: some, as was to be\nexpected, for trade, some to serve in the army, others, no doubt, out o:\nmere curiosity, to see what they could see. Amongst the sightseers was\nAeaces's son Sylo-son, the exiled brother of Poly crates of Samos.\nWhile he was in Egypt, Syloson had an extraordinary stroke of luck:\nhe was hanging about the streets of Memphis dressed in a flame-\ncolored cloak, when Darius, who at that time was a member o\nCambyses's guard and not yet of any particular importance, happened\nto catch sight of him and, seized with a sudden longing to possess the\ncloak, came up to Syloson and made him an offer for it.\n\nHis extreme anxiety to get it was obvious enough to Syloson, who\nwas inspired to say: \u201c1 am not selling this for any money, but if you\nmust have it, I will give it to you for free.\u201d Darius thereupon thanked\n\n\nhim warmly and took it. Syloson at the moment merely thought he had\nlost it by his foolish good nature; then came the death of Cambyses\nand the revolt of the seven against the Magus, and Darius ascended the\nthrone. Syloson now\n\nhad the news that the man whose request for the flame-colored\ncloak he had formerly gratified in Egypt had become king of Persia.\nHe hurried to Susa, sat down at the entrance of the royal palace, and\nclaimed to be included in the official list of the king's benefactors. The\nsentry on guard reported his claim to Darius, who asked in surprise\nwho the man might be. \u201cFor surely,\u201d he said, \u201cas I have so recently\ncome to the throne, there cannot be any Greek to whom 1 am indebted\nfor a service. Hardly any of them have been here yet, and I certainly\ncannot remember owing anything to a Greek. But bring him in all the\nsame, that I may know what he means by this claim. \u201d The guard\nescorted Syloson into the royal presence, and when the interpreters\nasked him who he was and what he had done to justify the statement\nthat he was the king's benefactor, he reminded Darius of the story of\nthe cloak, and said that he was the man who had given it him. \u201cSir, \u201d\nexclaimed Darius, \"you are the most generous of men; for while I was\nstill a person of no power or consequence you gave me a presentsmall\nindeed, but deserving then as much gratitude from me as would the\nmost splendid of gifts today. I will give you in return more silver and\ngold than you can count, that you may\nthe most illustrious patron of the arts that history has ever known.\nNot only did he spend lavishly on paintings, he created Italy's finest\napprentice schools for young artists. It was in one of these schools that\nthe young Michelangelo first caught the attention of Lorenzo, who\ninvited the artist to come and live in his house. He did the same with\nLeonardo da Vinci. Once under his wing, Michelangelo and Leonardo\nrequited his generosity by becoming loyal artists in his stable.\n\nWhenever Lorenzo faced an enemy, he would wield the weapon\nof patronage. When Pisa, Florence's traditional enemy, threatened to\nrebel against it in 1472, Lorenzo placated its people by pouring money\ninto its university, which had once been its pride and joy but had long\nago lost its luster. The Pisans had no defense against this insidious\nmaneuver, which simultaneously fed tfieir love of culture and blunted\ntheir desire for battle. Interpretation\n\n\nLorenzo undoubtedly loved the arts, but his patronage of artists\nhad a practical function as well, of which he was keenly aware. In\nFlorence at die time, banking was perhaps die least admired way of\nmaking money, and was certainly not a respected source of power. The\narts were at the other pole, the pole of quasi-religious transcendence.\nBy spending on die arts, Lorenzo diluted people's opinions of the ugly\nsource of his wealth, disguising himself in nobility. There is no better\nuse of strategic generosity man mat of distracting attention from an\nunsavory reality and wrapping oneself in the mantle of art or religion.\n\nObservance IV\n\nLouis XIV had an eagle eye for the strategic power of money.\nWhen he came to the throne, the powerful nobility had recendy proven\na thorn in the monarchy's side, and seethed with rebelliousness. So he\nimpoverished diese aristocrats by making them spend enormous sums\non maintaining their position in the court. Making them dependent on\nroyal largesse for their livelihood, he had them in his claws.\n\nNext Louis brought the nobles to their knees with strategic\ngenerosity. It would work like this: Whenever he noticed a stubborn\ncourtier whose influence he needed to gain, or whose troublemaking\nhe needed to squelch, he would use his vast wealth to soften the soil.\nFirst he would ignore his victim, making the man anxious. Then the\nman would suddenly find that his son had been given a well-paid post,\nor that funds had been spent liberally in his home region, or mat he had\nbeen given a painting he had long coveted. Presents would flow from\nLouis's hands. Finally, weeks or months later, Louis would ask for die\nfavor he had needed all along. A man who had once vowed to do\nanything to stop the king would find he had lost the desire to fight. A\nstraightforward bribe would have made him rebellious; this was far\nmore insidious. Facing hardened earth in which nothing could take\nroot, Louis loosened the soil before he planted his seeds. Interpretation\n\nLouis understood that there is a deep-rooted emotional element in\nour attitude to money, an element going back to childhood. When we\nare chil-\n\ndren, all kinds of complicated feelings about our parents center\naround gifts; we see die giving of a gift as a sign of love and approval.\nAnd that emotional element never goes away. The recipients of gifts,\nfinancial or otherwise, are suddenly as vulnerable as children,\n\nespecially when the gift comes from someone in authority. They\ncannot help opening up; their will is loosened, as Louis loosened the\nsoil.\n\nTo succeed best, the gift should come out of the blue. It should be\nremarkable for the fact that a gift like it has never been given before,\nor for being preceded by a cold shoulder from the giver. The more\noften you give to particular people, the blunter this weapon becomes.\nIf they don't take your gifts for granted, becoming monsters of\ningratitude, they will resent what appears to be charity. The sudden,\nunexpected, one-time gift will not spoil your children; it will keep\nthem under your thumb.\n\nObservance V\n\nThe antique dealer Fushimiya, who lived in the city of Edo\n(former name for Tokyo) in the seventeenth century, once made a stop\nat a village teahouse. After enjoying a cup of tea, he spent several\nminutes scrutinizing the cup, which he eventually paid for and took\naway with him. A local artisan, watching this, waited until Fushimiya\nleft the shop, then approached the old woman who owned the teahouse\nand asked her who tiiis man was. She told him it was Japan's most\n\u2018amous connoisseur, antique dealer to die lord of Izumo. The artisan\nran out of the shop, caught up with Fushimiya, and begged him to sell\nhim the cup, which must clearly be valuable if Fushimiya judged it so.\nFushimiya laughed heartily: \u201cIt's just an ordinary cup of Bizen ware,\u201d\nhe explained, \u201cand it is not valuable at all. The reason I was looking at\nit was that the steam seemed to hang about it strangely and I wondered\nif there wasn't a leak somewhere.\u201d (Devotees of the Tea Ceremony\nwere interested in any odd or accidental beauty in nature.) Since die\nartisan still seemed so excited about it, Fushimiya gave him the cup for\nree.\n\nThe artisan took die cup around, trying to find an expert who\nwould appraise it at a high price, but since all of them recognized it as\nan ordinary teacup he got nowhere. Soon he was neglecting his own\nbusiness, thinking only of die cup and die fortune it could bring.\nFinally he went to Edo to talk to Fushimiya at his shop. There the\ndealer, realizing that he had inadvertently caused this man pain by\nmaking him believe the cup had great worth, paid him 100 ryo (gold\npieces) for the cup as a kindness. The cup was indeed mediocre, but he\n\n\nwanted to rid the artisan of his obsession, while also allowing him to\nfeel tiiat his effort had not been wasted. The artisan thanked him and\nwent on his way.\n\nSoon word spread of Fushimiya's purchase of the teacup. Every\ndealer in Japan clamored for him to sell it, since a cup he had bought\nfor 100 ryo must be worth much more. He tried to explain the\ncircumstances in which he had bought die cup, but the dealers could\nnot be dissuaded. Fushimiya finally relented and put die cup up for\nsale.\n\nDuring the auction, two buyers simultaneously bid 200 ryo for the\nteacup, and then began to fight over who had bid first. Their fighting\n\nnever regret that you onee did a favor to Darius the son of\nHystaspes.\u201c \u201dMy lord,\u201c replied Syloson, \u201ddo not give me gold or\nsilver, but recover Samos for me, my native island, which now since\nOroetes killed my brother Poly-crates is in the hands of one of our\nservants. Let Samos be your gift to mebut let no man in the island be\nkilled or enslaved.\" Darius consented to Syloson's request, and\ndispatched a force under the command of Otanes, one of the seven,\nwith orders to do everything that Syloson had asked.\n\nthe histories, Herodotus, fifth century b.c.\n\nMoney is never spent to so much advantage as when you have\nbeen cheated out of it; for at one stroke you have purchased prudence.\n\nArthur\n\nSchopenhauer,\n\n1788-1860\n\nKung-yi Hsiu, premier of Lu, was fond offish. Therefore, people\nin the whole country conscientiously bought fish, which they presented\nto him. However, Kung-yi would not accept the presents. Against such\na step his younger brother remonstrated with him and said: \u201cYou like\nfish, indeed. Why don't you accept the present offish \u201d In reply, he\nsaid: \u201cIt is solely because I like fish that I would not accept the fish\nthey gave me. Indeed, if I accept the fish, I will be placed under an\nobligation to them. Once placed under an obligation to them, I will\nsome time have to bend the law. If I bend the law, I will be dismissed\nfrom the premiership. After being dismissed from the premiership, I\nmight not be able to supply myself with fish. On the contrary, if I do\n\n\nnot accept the fish from them and am not dismissed the premiership,\nhowever fond of fish, I can always supply myself with fish.\u201d\n\nChinese philosopher, third century b.c.\n\ntipped over a table and the teacup fell to the ground and broke\ninto several pieces. The auction was clearly over. Fushimiya glued and\nmended the cup, then stored it away, dunking the affair finished. Years\nlater, however, the great tea master Matsudaira Fumai visited the store,\nand asked to see the cup, which by then had become legendary. Fumai\nexamined it. \u201cAs a piece,\u201d he said, \u201cit is not up to much, but a Tea\nMaster prizes sentiment and association more than intrinsic value.\u201d He\nbought the cup for a high sum. A glued-together work of less than\nordinary craftsmanship had become one of the most famous objects in\nJapan. Interpretation\n\nThe story shows, first, an essential aspect of money: That it is\nhumans who have created it and humans who instill it with meaning\nand value. Second, with objects as with money, what the courtier most\nvalues are the sentiments and emotions embedded in themthese are\nwhat make them worth having. The lesson is simple: The more your\ngifts and your acts of generosity play with sentiment, the more\npowerful mey are. The object or concept that plays with a charged\nemotion or hits a chord of sentiment has more power than the money\nyou squander on an expensive yet lifeless present.\n\nObservance VI\n\nAkimoto Suzutomo, a wealthy adherent of the tea ceremony, once\ngave his page 100 ryo (gold pieces) and instructed him to purchase a\ntea bowl offered by a particular dealer. When the page saw the bowl,\nhe doubted it was worth that much, and after much bargaining got the\nprice reduced to 95 ryo. Days later, after Suzutomo had put the bowl to\nuse, the page proudly told him what he had done.\n\n\u201cWhat an ignoramus you are!\u201d replied Suzutomo. \u201cA tea bowl\nthat anyone asks 100 pieces of gold for can only be a family heirloom,\nand a thing like that is only sold when the family is pressed for money.\nAnd in that case tiiey will be hoping to find someone who will give\neven 150 pieces for it. So what sort of fellow is it who does not\nconsider their feelings Quite apart from that, a curio that you give 100\nryo for is something worth having, but one that has only cost 95 gives\n\n\na mean impression. So never let me see that tea bowl again!\u201d And he\nhad die bowl locked away, and never took it out. Interpretation\n\nWhen you insist on paying less, you may save your five ryo, but\ndie insult you cause and the cheap impression you create will cost you\nin reputation, which is the thing the powerful prize above all. Learn to\npay the full priceit will save you a lot in the end.\n\nObservance VII\n\nSometime near the beginning of die seventeenth century in Japan,\na group of generals whiled away the time before a big battle by staging\nan incense-smelling competition. Each participant anted up a prize for\nthe contest's winnersbows, arrows, saddles, and odier items a warrior\nwould covet.\n\nThe great Lord Date Masamune happened to pass by and was\ninduced to participate. For a prize, he offered the gourd that hung from\nhis belt. Everyone laughed, for no one wanted to win this cheap item.\nA retainer of die host finally accepted the gourd.\n\nWhen die party broke up, however, and the generals were chatting\noutside the tent, Masamune brought over his magnificent horse and\ngave it to the retainer. \u201cThere,\u201d he said, \u201ca horse has come out of the\ngourd.\u201d The stunned generals suddenly regretted their scorn at\nMasamune's gift. Interpretation\n\nMasamune understood the following: Money gives its possessor\nthe ability to give pleasure to others. The more you can do this, the\nmore you attract admiration. When you make a horse come out of a\ngourd, you give the ultimate demonstration of your power.\n\nImage: The River. To protect yourself or to save the resource, you\ndam it up. Soon, however, the waters become dank and pestilent. Only\nthe foulest forms of life can live in such stagnant waters; nothing\ntravels on them, all commerce stops. Destroy the dam. When water\nflows and circulates, it generates abundance, wealth, and power in ever\nlarger circles. The River must flood periodically for good things to\nflourish.\n\n/ took money only from those who could afford it and were\nwilling to go in with me in schemes they fancied would fleece others.\nThey wanted money for its own sake.

A miserly\nman can conquer neither lands nor lordships, for he does not have a\nplentiful supply of friends with whom he may work his will. Whoever\nwants to have friends must not love his possessions but must acquire\nfriends by means of fair gifts; for in the same way that the lodestone\nsubtly draws iron to itself, so the gold and silver that a man gives\nattract the hearts of men.

Friends who offer favors without asking for payment\nwill later want something far dearer than the money you would have\npaid them. The bargain has hidden problems, both material and\npsychological.

Dangling\nthe lure of a free lunch is the con artist's stock in trade.\n\nNo man was better at this than the most successful con artist of\nour age, Joseph Weil, a.k.a. \u201cThe Yellow Kid.\u201d The Yellow Kid\nlearned early that what made his swindles possible was his fellow\nhumans' greed. \u201cThis desire to get something for nothing,\u201d he once\nwrote, \u201chas been very costly to many people who have dealt with me\nand with other con men. . . . When people learnas I doubt they willthat\nthey can't get something for nothing, crime will diminish and we shall\nall live in greater harmony.\u201d Over the years Weil devised many ways\nto seduce people with the prospect of easy money. He would hand out\n\u201cfree\u201d real estatewho could resist such an offerand then the suckers\nwould learn they had to pay $25 to register the sale. Since the land was\nfree, it seemed worth the high fee, and the Yellow Kid would make\nthousands of dollars on the phony registration. In exchange he would\ngive his suckers a phony deed. Other times, he would tell suckers\nabout a fixed horse race, or a stock that would earn 200 percent in a\n\nfew weeks. As he spun his stories he would watch the sucker's eyes\nopen wide at the thought of a free lunch.\n\nThe lesson is simple: Bait your deceptions with the possibility of\neasy money. People are essentially lazy, and want wealth to fall in their\nlap rather than to work for it. For a small sum, sell them advice on how\nto make millions (P. T. Barnum did this later in life), and that small\nsum will become a fortune when multiplied by thousands of suckers.\nLure people in with the prospect of easy money and you have the room\nto work still more deceptions on them, since greed is powerful enough\nto blind your victims to anything. And as the Yellow Kid said, half the\nfun is teaching a moral lesson: Greed does not pay.\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Would the boy, only five at the time, prove as great a\nleader as the Sun King Louis XIV had transformed a country on the\nverge of civil war into the preeminent power in Europe. The last years\nof his reign had been difficulthe had been old and tiredbut it was hoped\nthat the child would develop into the kind of strong ruler who would\nreinvigorate the land and add to the firm foundation that Louis XIV\nhad laid.\n\nTo this end the child was given the best minds of France as his\ntutors, men who would instruct him in the arts of statecraft, in the\nmethods that the Sun King had perfected. Nodiing was neglected in his\neducation. But when Louis XV came to die throne, in 1726, a sudden\nchange came over him: He no longer had to study or please others or\nprove himself. He stood alone at the top of a great country, widi wealth\nand power at his command. He could do as he wished.\n\nIn die first years of his reign, Louis gave himself over to pleasure,\nleaving the government in the hands of a trusted minister, Andre-\nHercule de Fleury. This caused little concern, for he was a young man\nwho needed to sow his wild oats, and de Fleury was a good minister.\nBut it slowly became clear that this was more than a passing phase.\nLouis had no interest in governing. His main worry was not France's\n\u2018inances, or a possible war with Spain, but boredom. He could not\nstand being bored, and when he was not hunting deer, or chasing\nyoung girls, he whiled away his time at the gambling tables, losing\nhuge sums in a single night.\n\nThe court, as usual, reflected the tastes of the ruler. Gambling and\nlavish parties became the obsession. The courtiers had no concern with\nthe future of Francethey poured their energies into charming the king,\nangling for titles that would bring them life pensions, and for cabinet\npositions demanding litde work but paying huge salaries. Parasites\nflocked to the court, and the state's debts swelled.\n\nIn 1745 Louis fell in love with Madame de Pompadour, a woman\nof middle-class origin who had managed to rise dirough her charms,\nher intelligence, and a good marriage. Madame de Pompadour became\nthe official royal mistress; she also became France's arbiter of taste and\n\n\nfashion. But the Madame had political ambitions as well, and she\neventually emerged as the country's unofficial prime ministerit was\nshe, not Louis, who wielded hiring-and-firing power over France's\nmost important ministers.\n\nAs he grew older Louis only needed more diversion. On the\ngrounds of Versailles he built a brothel, Pare aux Cerfs, which housed\nsome of die prettiest young girls of France. Underground passages and\nhidden staircases gave Louis access at all hours. After Madame de\nPompadour died, in 1764, she was succeeded as royal mistress by\nMadame du Barry, who soon came to dominate the court, and who,\nlike de Pompadour before her, began to meddle in affairs of state. If a\nminister did not please her he would find himself fired. All of Europe\nwas aghast when du Barry, the daughter of a baker, managed to\narrange the firing of Etienne de Choiseul, the foreign\n\nminister and France's most able diplomat. He had shown her too\nlittie respect. As time went by, swindlers and charlatans made their\nnests in Versailles, and enticed Louis's interest in astrology, the occult,\nand fraudulent business deals. The young and pampered teenager who\nhad taken over France years before had only grown worse with age.\n\nThe motto that became attached to Louis's reign was \u201cApres moi,\nle deluge\u201d- \u201cAfter me the flood,\u201d or, Let France rot after I am gone.\nAnd indeed when Louis did go, in 1774, worn out by debauchery, his\ncountry and his own finances were in horrible disarray. His grandson\nLouis XVI inherited a realm in desperate need of reform and a strong\nleader. But Louis XVI was even weaker than his grandfather, and\ncould only watch as the country descended into revolution. In 1792 the\nrepublic introduced by the French Revolution declared the end of the\nmonarchy, and gave die king a new name, \u201cLouis the Last.\u201d A few\nmonths later he kneeled on the guillotine, his about-to-be-severed head\nstripped of all the radiance and power that die Sun King had invested\nin the crown.\n\nInterpretation\n\nFrom a country that had descended into civil war in die late\n1640s, Louis XIV forged the mightiest realm in Europe. Great generals\nwould tremble in his presence. A cook once made a mistake in\npreparing a dish and committed suicide rather than face the king's\nwrath. Louis XIV had many mistresses, but their power ended in the\n\nbedroom. He filled his court with the most brilliant minds of die age.\nThe symbol of his power was Versailles: Refusing to accept die palace\nof his forefathers, die Louvre, he built his own palace in what was then\nthe middle of nowhere, symbolizing that diis was a new order he had\n\u2018ounded, one without precedent. He made Versailles the centerpiece of\nhis reign, a place that all the powerful of Europe envied and visited\nwith a sense of awe. In essence, Louis took a great voidthe decaying\nmonarchy of Franceand filled it with his own symbols and radiant\npower.\n\nLouis XV, on the other hand, symbolizes the fate of all those who\ninherit somediing large or who follow in a great man's footsteps. It\nwould seem easy for a son or successor to build on die grand\noundation left for them, but in the realm of power the opposite is true.\nThe pampered, indulged son almost always squanders the inheritance,\n\u2018or he does not start with die father's need to fill a void. As Machiavelli\nstates, necessity is what impels men to take action, and once die\nnecessity is gone, only rot and decay are left. Having no need to\nincrease his store of power, Louis XV inevitably succumbed to inertia.\nUnder him, Versailles, the symbol of the Sun King's authority, became\na pleasure palace of incomparable banality, a kind of Las Vegas of die\nBourbon monarchy. It came to represent all that the oppressed\npeasantry of France hated about their king, and during die Revolution\nthey looted it with glee.\n\nLouis XV had only one way out of the trap awaiting the son or\nsuccessor of a man like the Sun King: to psychologically begin from\nnothing, to\n\nLIFE OF PERICLES\n\nAs a young man Pericles was inclined to shrink from facing the\npeople. One reason for this was that he was considered to bear a\ndistinct resemblance to the tyrant Pisistratus, and when men who were\nwell on in years remarked on the charm of Pericles' voice and the\nsmoothness and fluency of his speech, they were astonished at the\nresemblance between the two. The fact that he was rich and that he\ncame of a distinguished family and possessed exceedingly powerful\nfriends made the fear of ostracism very real to him, and at the\nbeginning of his career he took no part in politics but devoted himself\nto soldiering, in which he showed great daring and enterprise.\n\n\nHowever, the time came when Aristides was dead, Themistocles in\nexile, and Cimon frequently absent on distant campaigns. Then at last\nPericles decided to attach himself to the people's party and to take up\nthe cause of the poor and the many instead of that of the rich and the\nfew, in spite of the fact that this was quite contrary to his own\ntemperament, which was thoroughly aristocratic. He was afraid,\napparently, of being suspected of aiming at a dictatorship; so that when\nhe saw that\n\nCimon '.v sympathies were strongly with the nobles and that\nCimon was the idol of the aristocratic party, Pericles began to\ningratiate himself with the people, partly for self-preservation and\npartly by way of securing power against his rival. He now entered\nupon a new mode of life. He was never to be seen walking in any\nstreet except the one which led to the market-place and the council\nchamber.\n\nthe life of pericles,\n\nPlutarch,\n\nc. a.d. 46-120\n\nHow beneficial poverty may sometimes be to those with talent,\nand how it may serve as a powerful goad to make them perfect or\nexcellent in whatever occupation they might choose, can be seen very\nclearly in the actions of Pietro Perugino. Wishing by means of his\nability to attain some respectable rank, after leaving disastrous\ncalamities behind in Perugia and coming to Florence, he remained\nthere many months in poverty, sleeping in a chest, since he had no\nother bed; he turned night into day, and with the greatest zeal\ncontinually applied himself to\n\ndenigrate the past and his inheritance, and to move in a totally\nnew direction, creating his own world. Assuming you have the choice,\nit would be better to avoid the situation altogether, to place yourself\nwhere there is a vacuum of power, where you can be the one to bring\norder out of chaos without having to compete with another star in the\nsky. Power depends on appearing larger than other people, and when\nyou are lost in die shadow of the father, the king, the great predecessor,\nyou cannot possibly project such a presence.\n\nBut when they began to make sovereignty hereditary, the children\nquickly\n\ndegenerated from their fathers; and, so far from trying to equal\ntheir father's\n\nvirtues, they considered that a prince had nothing else to do than\nto excel\n\nall the rest in idleness, indulgence, and every other variety of\npleasure.\n\nNiccolo Machiavelli, 1469-1527\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nAlexander the Great had a dominant passion as a young manan\nintense dislike for his father, King Philip of Macedonia. He hated\nPhilip's cunning, cautious style of ruling, his bombastic speeches, his\ndrinking and whoring, and his love of wrestling and of other wastes of\ntime. Alexander knew he had to make himself the very opposite of his\ndomineering father: He would force himself to be bold and reckless, he\nwould control his tongue and be a man of few words, and he would not\nlose precious time in pursuit of pleasures that brought no glory.\nAlexander also resented the fact that Philip had conquered most of\nGreece: \u201cMy father will go on conquering till there is nothing\nextraordinary left for me to do,\u201d he once complained. While other sons\nof powerful men were content to inherit wealth and live a life of\nleisure, Alexander wanted only to outdo his father, to obliterate Philip's\nname from history by surpassing his accomplishments.\n\nAlexander itched to show others how superior he was to his\nfather. A Thessalian horse-dealer once brought a prize horse named\nBucephalus to sell to Philip. None of the king's grooms could get near\nthe horseit was far too savageand Philip berated the merchant for\nbringing him such a useless beast. Watching the whole affair,\nAlexander scowled and commented, \u201cWhat a horse they are losing for\nwant of skill and spirit to manage him!\u201d When he had said this several\ntimes, Philip had finally had enough, and challenged him to take on die\nhorse. He called the merchant back, secretly hoping his son would\nhave a nasty fall and learn a bitter lesson. But Alexander was die one\nto teach the lesson: Not only did he mount Bucephalus, he managed to\nride him at full gallop, taming the horse that would later carry him all\ndie way to India. The courtiers applauded wildly, but Philip seethed\ninside, seeing not a son but a rival to his power.\n\nAlexander's defiance of his father grew bolder. One day die two\nmen had a heated argument before die entire court, and Philip drew his\nsword as if to strike his son; having drunk too much wine, however,\nthe king stumbled. Alexander pointed at his father and jeered, \"Men of\nMacedonia,\n\nsee there the man who is preparing to pass from Europe to Asia.\nHe cannot pass from one table to another without falling.\"\n\nWhen Alexander was eighteen, a disgrunded courtier murdered\nPhilip. As word of the regicide spread through Greece, city after city\nrose up in rebellion against their Macedonian rulers. Philip's advisers\ncounseled Alexander, now the king, to proceed cautiously, to do as\nPhilip had done and conquer through cunning. But Alexander would\ndo tilings his way: He marched to the furthest reaches of the kingdom,\nsuppressed the rebellious towns, and reunited the empire with brutal\nefficiency.\n\nAs a young rebel grows older, his struggle against the father often\nwanes, and he gradually comes to resemble the very man he had\nwanted to defy. But Alexander's loathing of his father did not end with\nPhilip's death. Once he had consolidated Greece, he set his eyes on\nPersia, the prize that had eluded his father, who had dreamed of\nconquering Asia. If he defeated the Persians, Alexander would finally\nsurpass Philip in glory and fame.\n\nAlexander crossed into Asia with an army of 35,000 to face a\nPersian force numbering over a million. Before engaging die Persians\nin battle he passed through the town of Gordium. Here, in the town's\nmain temple, there stood an ancient chariot tied with cords made of die\nrind of the cornel tree. Legend had it that any man who could undo\nthese cordsthe Gordian knotwould rule the world. Many had tried to\nuntie the enormous and intricate knot, but none had succeeded.\nAlexander, seeing he could not possibly untie die knot with his bare\nhands, took out his sword and widi one slash cut it in half. This\nsymbolic gesture showed the world that he would not do as otiiers, but\nwould blaze his own path.\n\nAgainst astounding odds, Alexander conquered the Persians.\nMost expected him to stop thereit was a great triumph, enough to\nsecure his fame for eternity. But Alexander had die same relationship\nto his own deeds as he had to his father: His conquest of Persia\n\nrepresented die past, and he wanted never to rest on past triumphs, or\nto allow the past to outshine the present. He moved on to India,\nextending his empire beyond all known limits. Only his disgrunded\nand weary soldiers prevented him from going farther.\n\nInterpretation\n\nAlexander represents an extremely uncommon type in history: the\nson of a famous and successful man who manages to surpass the fatfier\nin glory and power. The reason this type is uncommon is simple: The\nfather most often manages to amass his fortune, his kingdom, because\nhe begins with litUe or nothing. A desperate urge impels him to\nsucceedhe has nothing to lose by cunning and impetuousness, and has\nno famous fatiier of his own to compete against. This kind of man has\nreason to believe in himselfto believe that his way of doing things is\nthe best, because, after all, it worked for him.\n\nWhen a man like this has a son, he becomes domineering and\noppressive, imposing his lessons on the son, who is starting off life in\ncircumstances totally different from diose in which the father himself\nbegan.\n\nthe study of his profession. After painting had become second\nnature to him, Pietro's only pleasure was always to be working in his\ncraft and constantly to be painting. And because he always had the\ndread of poverty before his eyes, he did things to make money which\nhe probably would not have bothered to do had he not been forced to\nsupport himself. Perhaps wealth would have closed to him and his\ntalent the path to excellence just as poverty had opened it up to him,\nbut need spurred him on since he desired to rise from such a miserable\nand lowly position // not perhaps to the summit and supreme height of\nexcellence, then at least to a point where he could have enough to live\non. For this reason, he took no notice of cold, hunger, discomfort,\ninconvenience, toil or shame if he could only live one day in ease and\nrepose; and he would always sayand as if it were a proverb that after\nbad weather, good weather must follow, and that during the good\nweather houses must be built for shelter in times of need.\n\nlives of the artists, Giorgio Vasari, 1511-1574\n\nThe slightest acquaintance with chess shows one that it is a play-\nsubstitute for the art of war and indeed it has been a favorite recreation\nof some of the greatest military leaders, from William the Conqueror\n\nto Napoleon. In the contest between the opposing armies the same\nprinciples of both strategy and tactics are displayed as in actual war,\nthe same foresight and powers of calculation are necessary, the same\ncapacity for divining the plans of the opponent, and the rigor with\nwhich decisions are followed by their consequences is, if anything,\neven more ruthless. More than that, it is plain that the unconscious\nmotive actuating the players is not the mere love of pugnacity\ncharacteristic of all competitive games, but the grimmer one of father-\nmurder. It is true that the original goal of capturing the king has been\ngiven up, but from the point of view of motive there is, except in\nrespect of crudity, not appreciable change in the present goal of\nsterilizing him in immobility... \u201cCheckmate \u201d means literally \u201cthe king\nis dead.\u201d ... Our knowledge of the unconscious motivation of chess-\nplaying tells us that what it represented could only have been the wish\nto overcome the father in an acceptable way.... It is no doubt signifi-\n\nInstead of allowing the son to go in a new direction, the father\nwill try to put him in his own shoes, perhaps secredy wishing die boy\nwill fail, as Philip half wanted to see Alexander thrown from\nBucephalus. Fathers envy Uieir sons' youdi and vigor, after all, and\ntheir desire is to control and dominate. The sons of such men tend to\nbecome cowed and cautious, terrified of losing what their fadiers have\ngained.\n\nThe son will never step out of his father's shadow unless he\nadopts die ruthless strategy of Alexander: disparage die past, create\nyour own kingdom, put die father in die shadows instead of letting him\ndo the same to you. If you cannot materially start from ground zeroit\nwould be foolish to renounce an inheritanceyou can at least begin from\nground zero psychologically, by throwing off the weight of die past\nand charting a new direction. Alexander instinctively recognized that\nprivileges of birth are impediments to power. Be merciless with the\npast, tiiennot only widi your fadier and his fadier but widi your own\nearlier achievements. Only the weak rest on their laurels and dote on\npast triumphs; in the game of power there is never time to rest.\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nIn many ancient kingdoms, for example Bengal and Sumatra,\nafter die king had ruled for several years his subjects would execute\nhim. This was done partly as a ritual of renewal, but also to prevent\n\nSS Oe eS eee\nestablish a permanent order, at the expense of other families and of his\n\nown sons. Instead of protecting die tribe and leading it in times of war,\nhe would attempt to dominate it. And so he would be beaten to deadi,\nor executed in an elaborate ritual. Now that he was no longer around\nor his honors to go to his head, he could be worshipped as a god.\nMeanwhile die field had been cleared for a new and youdiful order to\nestablish itself.\n\nThe ambivalent, hostile attitude towards the king or father figure\nalso finds expression in legends of heroes who do not know their\n\u2018adier. Moses, the archetypal man of power, was found abandoned\namong die bulrushes and never knew his parents; without a father to\ncompete widi him or limit him, he could attain the heights of power.\nHercules had no earthly father he was the son of the god Zeus. Later in\nhis life Alexander the Great spread the story that the god Jupiter\nAmmon had sired him, not Philip of Mace-don. Legends and rituals\nlike diese eliminate the human fadier because he symbolizes the\ndestructive power of die past.\n\nThe past prevents the young hero from creating his own worldhe\nmust do as his father did, even after that father is dead or powerless.\nThe hero must bow and scrape before his predecessor and yield to\ntradition and precedent. What had success in the past must be carried\nover to die present, even tiiough circumstances have greatiy changed.\nThe past also weighs die hero down with an inheritance that he is\nterrified of losing, making him timid and cautious.\n\nPower depends on die ability to fill a void, to occupy a field diat\nhas\n\nbeen cleared of the dead weight of the past. Only after the father\nfigure has been properly done away widi will you have die necessary\nspace to create and establish a new order. There are several strategies\nyou can adopt to accomplish thisvariations on the execution of die king\nthat disguise the violence of die impulse by channeling it in socially\nacceptable forms.\n\nPerhaps the simplest way to escape the shadow of the past is\nsimply to belittle it, playing on die timeless antagonism between the\ngenerations, stirring up me young against die old. For diis you need a\nconvenient older figure to pillory. Mao Tse-tung, confronting a culture\n\nea = eens, = beeen Ae ae\n\n\nthat fiercely resisted change, played on the suppressed resentment\nagainst the overbearing presence of me venerable Confucius in\nChinese culture. John F. Kennedy knew the dangers of getting lost in\nthe past; he radically distinguished his presidency from diat of his\npredecessor, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and also from die preceding\ndecade, die 1950s, which Eisenhower personified. Kennedy, for\ninstance, would not play die dull and fadierly game of golf a symbol of\nretirement and privilege, and Eisenhower's passion. Instead he played\nfootball on die White House lawn. In every aspect his administration\nrepresented vigor and youth, as opposed to die stodgy Eisenhower.\nKennedy had discovered an old truth: The young are easily set against\nthe old, since diey yearn to make their own place in the world and\nresent the shadow of tiieir fathers.\n\nThe distance you establish from your predecessor often demands\nsome symbolism, a way of advertising itself publicly. Louis XIV, for\nexample, created such symbolism when he rejected the traditional\npalace of die French kings and built his own palace of Versailles. King\nPhilip II of Spain did die same when he created his center of power,\ndie palace of El Esco-rial, in what was then die middle of nowhere.\nBut Louis carried the game further: He would not be a king like his\nfadier or earlier ancestors, he would not wear a crown or carly a\nscepter or sit on a dirone, he would establish a new kind of imposing\nautiiority widi symbols and rituals of its own. Louis made his\nancestors\u2019 rituals into laughable relics of the past. Follow his example:\nNever let yourself be seen as following your predecessor's paui. If you\ndo you will never surpass him. You must physically demonstrate your\ndifference, by establishing a style and symbolism that sets you apart.\n\nThe Roman emperor Augustus, successor to Julius Caesar,\nunderstood this moroughly. Caesar had been a great general, a\ndieatrical figure whose spectacles kept the Romans entertained, an\ninternational emissary seduced by die charms of Cleopatraa larger-\nthan-life figure. So Augustus, despite his own theatrical tendencies,\ncompeted with Caesar not by trying to outdo him but by differentiating\nhimself from him: He based his power on a return to Roman\nsimplicity, an austerity of both style and substance. Against die\nmemory of Caesar's sweeping presence Augustus posed a quiet and\nmanly dignity.\n\n\nThe problem widi the overbearing predecessor is that he fills die\nvistas before you widi symbols of die past. You have no room to create\nyour own name. To deal witii diis situation you need to hunt out the\nvacuumsthose\n\ncant that [nineteenth-century chess champion Paul] Morphy's\nsoaring odyssey into the higher realms of chess began just a year after\nthe unexpectedly sudden death of his father, which had been a great\nshock to him, and we may surmise that his brilliant effort of\nsublimation was, like Shakespeare's Hamlet and Freud's The\nInterpretation of Dreams, a reaction to this critical event....\n\nSomething should now be said about the reception Morphy's\nsuccesses met with, for they were of such a kind as to raise the\nquestion whether his subsequent collapse may not have been\ninfluenced through his perhaps belonging to the type that Freud has\ndescribed under the name of Die am Erfolge scheitern (\u201cThose\nwrecked by success\u201d)... Couched in more psychological language, was\nMorphy affrighted at his own presumptuousness when the light of\npublicity was thrown on [his great success] Freud has pointed out that\nthe people who break under the strain of too great success do so\nbecause they can endure it only in imagination, not in reality. To\ncastrate the father in a dream is a very different matter from doing it in\nreality. The real situation provokes the unconscious guilt in its full\norce, and the penalty may be mental collapse.\n\nTHE PROBLEM OF PAUL MORPHY,\n\nErnest Jones, 1951\n\nareas in culture that have been left vacant and in which you can\nbecome the first and principal figure to shine.\nWhen Pericles of Athens was about to launch a career as a\nstatesman, he looked for the one thing that was missing in Athenian\npolitics. Most of the great politicians of his time had allied themselves\nwith the aristocracy; indeed Pericles himself had aristocratic\ntendencies. Yet he decided to tiirow in his hat with the city's\ndemocratic elements. The choice had nothing to do with his personal\nbeliefs, but it launched him on a brilliant career. Out of necessity he\nbecame a man of the people. Instead of competing in an arena filled\nwith great leaders both past and present, he would make a name for\nhimself where no shadows could obscure his presence.\n\n\nWhen the painter Diego de Velazquez began his career, he knew\nhe could not compete in refinement and technique with the great\nRenaissance painters who had come before him. Instead he chose to\nwork in a style that by the standards of the time seemed coarse and\nrough, in a way that had never been seen before. And in mis style he\nexcelled. There were members of the Spanish court who wanted to\ndemonstrate their own break with the past; the newness of Velazquez's\nstyle thrilled them. Most people are afraid to break so boldly with\ntradition, but mey secretly admire those who can break up the old\nforms and reinvigorate the culture. This is why there is so much power\nto be gained from entering vacuums and voids.\n\nThere is a kind of stubborn stupidity that recurs throughout\nhistory, and is a strong impediment to power: The superstitious belief\nthat if the person before you succeeded by doing A, B, and C, you can\nre-create their success by doing the same thing. This cookie-cutter\napproach will seduce the uncreative, for it is easy, and appeals to their\ntimidity and their laziness. But circumstances never repeat themselves\nexactly.\n\nWhen General Douglas MacArthur assumed command of\nAmerican forces in the Philippines during World War II, an assistant\nhanded him a book containing the various precedents established by\nthe commanders before him, the methods that had been successful for\nthem. MacArthur asked the assistant how many copies there were of\nthis book. Six, the assistant answered. \u201cWell,\u201d the general replied,\n\u201cyou get all those six copies together and burn themevery one of them.\nI'll not be bound by precedents. Any time a problem comes up, I'll\nmake the decision at onceimmediately.\u201d Adopt this ruthless strategy\ntoward the past: Burn all the books, and train yourself to react to\ncircumstances as they happen.\n\nYou may believe that you have separated yourself from the\npredecessor or father figure, but as you grow older you must be\neternally vigilant lest you become the father you had rebelled against.\nAs a young man, Mao Tse-tung disliked his father and in the struggle\nagainst him found his own identity and a new set of values. But as he\naged, his father's ways crept back in. Mao's father had valued manual\nwork over intellect; Mao had scoffed at this as a young man, but as he\ngrew older he unconsciously returned to his father's views and echoed\n\n\nsuch outdated ideas by forcing a whole generation of Chinese\nintellectuals into manual labor, a nightmarish mistake that\n\ncost his regime dearly. Remember: You are your own father. Do\nnot let yourself spend years creating yourself only to let your guard\ndown and allow the ghost of the pastfather, habit, historyto sneak back\nin.\n\nFinally, as noted in the story of Louis XV, plenitude and\nprosperity tend to make us lazy and inactive: When our power is\nsecure we have no need to act. This is a serious danger, especially for\nthose who achieve success and power at an early age. The playwright\nTennessee Williams, for instance, found himself skyrocketed from\nobscurity to fame by the success of The Glass Menagerie. \u201cThe sort of\nlife which I had had previous to this popular success,\u201d he later wrote,\n\u201cwas one that required endurance, a life of clawing and scratching, but\nit was a good life because it was the sort of life for which the human\norganism is created. I was not aware of how much vital energy had\ngone into this struggle until the struggle was removed. This was\nsecurity at last. I sat down and looked about me and was suddenly very\ndepressed.\u201d Williams had a nervous breakdown, which may in fact\nhave been necessary for him: Pushed to the psychological edge, he\ncould start writing with the old vitality again, and he produced A\nStreetcar Named Desire. Fyodor Dostoyevsky, similarly, whenever he\nwrote a successful novel, would feel that the financial security he had\ngained made the act of creation unnecessary. He would take his entire\nsavings to the casino and would not leave until he had gambled away\nhis last penny. Once reduced to poverty he could write again.\n\nIt is not necessary to go to such extremes, but you must be\nprepared to return to square one psychologically rather than growing\nfat and lazy with prosperity. Pablo Picasso could deal with success, but\nonly by constantly changing the style of his painting, often breaking\ncompletely with what had made him successful before. How often our\nearly triumphs turn us into a kind of caricature of ourselves. Powerful\npeople recognize these traps; like Alexander the Great, they struggle\nconstantly to re-create themselves. The father must not be allowed to\nreturn; he must be slain at every step of the way.\n\nImage: The Father. He casts a giant shadow over his children,\nkeeping them in thrall long after he is gone by tying them to the past,\n\nsquashing their youthful spirit, and forcing them down the same tired\npath he followed himself. His tricks are many. At every crossroads you\nmust slay the father and step out of his shadow.\n\nAuthority: Beware of stepping into a great man's shoesyou will\nhave to accomplish twice as much to surpass him. Those who follow\nare taken for imitators. No matter how much they sweat, they will\nnever shed that burden. It is an uncommon skill to find a new path for\nexcellence, a modern route to celebrity. There are many roads to\nsingularity, not all of them well traveled. The newest ones can be\narduous, but they are often shortcuts to greatness. (Baltasar Gracian,\n1601-1658)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nThe shadow of a great predecessor could be used to advantage if\nit is chosen as a trick, a tactic that can be discarded once it has brought\nyou power. Napoleon III used the name and legend of his illustrious\ngrand-uncle Napoleon Bonaparte to help him become first president\nand then emperor of France. Once on the throne, however, he did not\nstay tied to the past; he quickly showed how different his reign would\nbe, and was careful to keep the public from expecting him to attain the\nheights that Bonaparte had attained.\n\nThe past often has elements worth appropriating, qualities that\nwould be foolish to reject out of a need to distinguish yourself. Even\nAlexander the Great recognized and was influenced by his father's skill\nin organizing an army. Making a display of doing things differently\nfrom your predecessor can make you seem childish and in fact out of\ncontrol, unless your actions have a logic of their own.\n\nJoseph II, son of the Austrian empress Maria Theresa, made a\nshow of doing the exact opposite of his motherdressing like an\nordinary citizen, staying in inns instead of palaces, appearing as the\n\u201cpeople's emperor.\u201d Maria Theresa, on the other hand, had been regal\nand aristocratic. The problem was that she had also been beloved, an\nempress who ruled wisely\n\nafter years of learning the hard way. If you have the kind of\nintelligence and instinct mat will point you in the right direction,\nplaying the rebel will not be dangerous. But if you are mediocre, as\nJoseph II was in comparison to his mother, you are better off learning\n\nfrom your predecessor's knowledge and experience, which are based\non something real.\n\nFinally, it is often wise to keep an eye on the young, your future\nrivals in power. Just as you try to rid yourself of your father, they will\nsoon play the same trick on you, denigrating everything you have\naccomplished. Just as you rise by rebelling against the past, keep an\neye on those rising from below, and never give them the chance to do\ndie same to you.\n\nThe great Baroque artist and architect Pietro Bernini was a master\nat sniffing out younger potential rivals and keeping mem in his\nshadow. One day a young stonemason named Francesco Borromini\nshowed Bemini his architectural sketches. Recognizing his talent\nimmediately, Bernini in-standy hired Borromini as his assistant, which\ndelighted the young man but was actually only a tactic to keep him\nclose at hand, so that he could play psychological games on him and\ncreate in him a kind of inferiority complex. And indeed, despite\nBorromini's brilliance, Bernini has the greater fame. His strategy with\nBorromini he made a lifelong practice: Fearing mat the great sculptor\nAlessandro Algardi, for example, would eclipse him in fame, he\narranged it so that Algardi could only find work as his assistant. And\nany assistant who rebelled against Bernini and tried to strike out on his\nown would find his career ruined.\n'.

Would the boy, only five at the time, prove as great a\nleader as the Sun King Louis XIV had transformed a country on the\nverge of civil war into the preeminent power in Europe. The last years\nof his reign had been difficulthe had been old and tiredbut it was hoped\nthat the child would develop into the kind of strong ruler who would\nreinvigorate the land and add to the firm foundation that Louis XIV\nhad laid.\n\nTo this end the child was given the best minds of France as his\ntutors, men who would instruct him in the arts of statecraft, in the\nmethods that the Sun King had perfected. Nodiing was neglected in his\neducation. But when Louis XV came to die throne, in 1726, a sudden\nchange came over him: He no longer had to study or please others or\nprove himself. He stood alone at the top of a great country, widi wealth\nand power at his command. He could do as he wished.\n\nIn die first years of his reign, Louis gave himself over to pleasure,\nleaving the government in the hands of a trusted minister, Andre-\nHercule de Fleury. This caused little concern, for he was a young man\nwho needed to sow his wild oats, and de Fleury was a good minister.\nBut it slowly became clear that this was more than a passing phase.\nLouis had no interest in governing. His main worry was not France's\n\u2018inances, or a possible war with Spain, but boredom. He could not\nstand being bored, and when he was not hunting deer, or chasing\nyoung girls, he whiled away his time at the gambling tables, losing\nhuge sums in a single night.\n\nThe court, as usual, reflected the tastes of the ruler. Gambling and\nlavish parties became the obsession. The courtiers had no concern with\nthe future of Francethey poured their energies into charming the king,\nangling for titles that would bring them life pensions, and for cabinet\npositions demanding litde work but paying huge salaries. Parasites\nflocked to the court, and the state's debts swelled.\n\nIn 1745 Louis fell in love with Madame de Pompadour, a woman\nof middle-class origin who had managed to rise dirough her charms,\nher intelligence, and a good marriage. Madame de Pompadour became\nthe official royal mistress; she also became France's arbiter of taste and\n\n\nfashion. But the Madame had political ambitions as well, and she\neventually emerged as the country's unofficial prime ministerit was\nshe, not Louis, who wielded hiring-and-firing power over France's\nmost important ministers.\n\nAs he grew older Louis only needed more diversion. On the\ngrounds of Versailles he built a brothel, Pare aux Cerfs, which housed\nsome of die prettiest young girls of France. Underground passages and\nhidden staircases gave Louis access at all hours. After Madame de\nPompadour died, in 1764, she was succeeded as royal mistress by\nMadame du Barry, who soon came to dominate the court, and who,\nlike de Pompadour before her, began to meddle in affairs of state. If a\nminister did not please her he would find himself fired. All of Europe\nwas aghast when du Barry, the daughter of a baker, managed to\narrange the firing of Etienne de Choiseul, the foreign\n\nminister and France's most able diplomat. He had shown her too\nlittie respect. As time went by, swindlers and charlatans made their\nnests in Versailles, and enticed Louis's interest in astrology, the occult,\nand fraudulent business deals. The young and pampered teenager who\nhad taken over France years before had only grown worse with age.\n\nThe motto that became attached to Louis's reign was \u201cApres moi,\nle deluge\u201d- \u201cAfter me the flood,\u201d or, Let France rot after I am gone.\nAnd indeed when Louis did go, in 1774, worn out by debauchery, his\ncountry and his own finances were in horrible disarray. His grandson\nLouis XVI inherited a realm in desperate need of reform and a strong\nleader. But Louis XVI was even weaker than his grandfather, and\ncould only watch as the country descended into revolution. In 1792 the\nrepublic introduced by the French Revolution declared the end of the\nmonarchy, and gave die king a new name, \u201cLouis the Last.\u201d A few\nmonths later he kneeled on the guillotine, his about-to-be-severed head\nstripped of all the radiance and power that die Sun King had invested\nin the crown.\n\nInterpretation\n\nFrom a country that had descended into civil war in die late\n1640s, Louis XIV forged the mightiest realm in Europe. Great generals\nwould tremble in his presence. A cook once made a mistake in\npreparing a dish and committed suicide rather than face the king's\nwrath. Louis XIV had many mistresses, but their power ended in the\n\nbedroom. He filled his court with the most brilliant minds of die age.\nThe symbol of his power was Versailles: Refusing to accept die palace\nof his forefathers, die Louvre, he built his own palace in what was then\nthe middle of nowhere, symbolizing that diis was a new order he had\n\u2018ounded, one without precedent. He made Versailles the centerpiece of\nhis reign, a place that all the powerful of Europe envied and visited\nwith a sense of awe. In essence, Louis took a great voidthe decaying\nmonarchy of Franceand filled it with his own symbols and radiant\npower.\n\nLouis XV, on the other hand, symbolizes the fate of all those who\ninherit somediing large or who follow in a great man's footsteps. It\nwould seem easy for a son or successor to build on die grand\noundation left for them, but in the realm of power the opposite is true.\nThe pampered, indulged son almost always squanders the inheritance,\n\u2018or he does not start with die father's need to fill a void. As Machiavelli\nstates, necessity is what impels men to take action, and once die\nnecessity is gone, only rot and decay are left. Having no need to\nincrease his store of power, Louis XV inevitably succumbed to inertia.\nUnder him, Versailles, the symbol of the Sun King's authority, became\na pleasure palace of incomparable banality, a kind of Las Vegas of die\nBourbon monarchy. It came to represent all that the oppressed\npeasantry of France hated about their king, and during die Revolution\nthey looted it with glee.\n\nLouis XV had only one way out of the trap awaiting the son or\nsuccessor of a man like the Sun King: to psychologically begin from\nnothing, to\n\nLIFE OF PERICLES\n\nAs a young man Pericles was inclined to shrink from facing the\npeople. One reason for this was that he was considered to bear a\ndistinct resemblance to the tyrant Pisistratus, and when men who were\nwell on in years remarked on the charm of Pericles' voice and the\nsmoothness and fluency of his speech, they were astonished at the\nresemblance between the two. The fact that he was rich and that he\ncame of a distinguished family and possessed exceedingly powerful\nfriends made the fear of ostracism very real to him, and at the\nbeginning of his career he took no part in politics but devoted himself\nto soldiering, in which he showed great daring and enterprise.\n\n\nHowever, the time came when Aristides was dead, Themistocles in\nexile, and Cimon frequently absent on distant campaigns. Then at last\nPericles decided to attach himself to the people's party and to take up\nthe cause of the poor and the many instead of that of the rich and the\nfew, in spite of the fact that this was quite contrary to his own\ntemperament, which was thoroughly aristocratic. He was afraid,\napparently, of being suspected of aiming at a dictatorship; so that when\nhe saw that\n\nCimon '.v sympathies were strongly with the nobles and that\nCimon was the idol of the aristocratic party, Pericles began to\ningratiate himself with the people, partly for self-preservation and\npartly by way of securing power against his rival. He now entered\nupon a new mode of life. He was never to be seen walking in any\nstreet except the one which led to the market-place and the council\nchamber.\n\nthe life of pericles,\n\nPlutarch,\n\nc. a.d. 46-120\n\nHow beneficial poverty may sometimes be to those with talent,\nand how it may serve as a powerful goad to make them perfect or\nexcellent in whatever occupation they might choose, can be seen very\nclearly in the actions of Pietro Perugino. Wishing by means of his\nability to attain some respectable rank, after leaving disastrous\ncalamities behind in Perugia and coming to Florence, he remained\nthere many months in poverty, sleeping in a chest, since he had no\nother bed; he turned night into day, and with the greatest zeal\ncontinually applied himself to\n\ndenigrate the past and his inheritance, and to move in a totally\nnew direction, creating his own world. Assuming you have the choice,\nit would be better to avoid the situation altogether, to place yourself\nwhere there is a vacuum of power, where you can be the one to bring\norder out of chaos without having to compete with another star in the\nsky. Power depends on appearing larger than other people, and when\nyou are lost in die shadow of the father, the king, the great predecessor,\nyou cannot possibly project such a presence.\n\nBut when they began to make sovereignty hereditary, the children\nquickly\n\ndegenerated from their fathers; and, so far from trying to equal\ntheir father's\n\nvirtues, they considered that a prince had nothing else to do than\nto excel\n\nall the rest in idleness, indulgence, and every other variety of\npleasure.\n\nNiccolo Machiavelli, 1469-1527\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nAlexander the Great had a dominant passion as a young manan\nintense dislike for his father, King Philip of Macedonia. He hated\nPhilip's cunning, cautious style of ruling, his bombastic speeches, his\ndrinking and whoring, and his love of wrestling and of other wastes of\ntime. Alexander knew he had to make himself the very opposite of his\ndomineering father: He would force himself to be bold and reckless, he\nwould control his tongue and be a man of few words, and he would not\nlose precious time in pursuit of pleasures that brought no glory.\nAlexander also resented the fact that Philip had conquered most of\nGreece: \u201cMy father will go on conquering till there is nothing\nextraordinary left for me to do,\u201d he once complained. While other sons\nof powerful men were content to inherit wealth and live a life of\nleisure, Alexander wanted only to outdo his father, to obliterate Philip's\nname from history by surpassing his accomplishments.\n\nAlexander itched to show others how superior he was to his\nfather. A Thessalian horse-dealer once brought a prize horse named\nBucephalus to sell to Philip. None of the king's grooms could get near\nthe horseit was far too savageand Philip berated the merchant for\nbringing him such a useless beast. Watching the whole affair,\nAlexander scowled and commented, \u201cWhat a horse they are losing for\nwant of skill and spirit to manage him!\u201d When he had said this several\ntimes, Philip had finally had enough, and challenged him to take on die\nhorse. He called the merchant back, secretly hoping his son would\nhave a nasty fall and learn a bitter lesson. But Alexander was die one\nto teach the lesson: Not only did he mount Bucephalus, he managed to\nride him at full gallop, taming the horse that would later carry him all\ndie way to India. The courtiers applauded wildly, but Philip seethed\ninside, seeing not a son but a rival to his power.\n\nAlexander's defiance of his father grew bolder. One day die two\nmen had a heated argument before die entire court, and Philip drew his\nsword as if to strike his son; having drunk too much wine, however,\nthe king stumbled. Alexander pointed at his father and jeered, \"Men of\nMacedonia,\n\nsee there the man who is preparing to pass from Europe to Asia.\nHe cannot pass from one table to another without falling.\"\n\nWhen Alexander was eighteen, a disgrunded courtier murdered\nPhilip. As word of the regicide spread through Greece, city after city\nrose up in rebellion against their Macedonian rulers. Philip's advisers\ncounseled Alexander, now the king, to proceed cautiously, to do as\nPhilip had done and conquer through cunning. But Alexander would\ndo tilings his way: He marched to the furthest reaches of the kingdom,\nsuppressed the rebellious towns, and reunited the empire with brutal\nefficiency.\n\nAs a young rebel grows older, his struggle against the father often\nwanes, and he gradually comes to resemble the very man he had\nwanted to defy. But Alexander's loathing of his father did not end with\nPhilip's death. Once he had consolidated Greece, he set his eyes on\nPersia, the prize that had eluded his father, who had dreamed of\nconquering Asia. If he defeated the Persians, Alexander would finally\nsurpass Philip in glory and fame.\n\nAlexander crossed into Asia with an army of 35,000 to face a\nPersian force numbering over a million. Before engaging die Persians\nin battle he passed through the town of Gordium. Here, in the town's\nmain temple, there stood an ancient chariot tied with cords made of die\nrind of the cornel tree. Legend had it that any man who could undo\nthese cordsthe Gordian knotwould rule the world. Many had tried to\nuntie the enormous and intricate knot, but none had succeeded.\nAlexander, seeing he could not possibly untie die knot with his bare\nhands, took out his sword and widi one slash cut it in half. This\nsymbolic gesture showed the world that he would not do as otiiers, but\nwould blaze his own path.\n\nAgainst astounding odds, Alexander conquered the Persians.\nMost expected him to stop thereit was a great triumph, enough to\nsecure his fame for eternity. But Alexander had die same relationship\nto his own deeds as he had to his father: His conquest of Persia\n\nrepresented die past, and he wanted never to rest on past triumphs, or\nto allow the past to outshine the present. He moved on to India,\nextending his empire beyond all known limits. Only his disgrunded\nand weary soldiers prevented him from going farther.\n\nInterpretation\n\nAlexander represents an extremely uncommon type in history: the\nson of a famous and successful man who manages to surpass the fatfier\nin glory and power. The reason this type is uncommon is simple: The\nfather most often manages to amass his fortune, his kingdom, because\nhe begins with litUe or nothing. A desperate urge impels him to\nsucceedhe has nothing to lose by cunning and impetuousness, and has\nno famous fatiier of his own to compete against. This kind of man has\nreason to believe in himselfto believe that his way of doing things is\nthe best, because, after all, it worked for him.\n\nWhen a man like this has a son, he becomes domineering and\noppressive, imposing his lessons on the son, who is starting off life in\ncircumstances totally different from diose in which the father himself\nbegan.\n\nthe study of his profession. After painting had become second\nnature to him, Pietro's only pleasure was always to be working in his\ncraft and constantly to be painting. And because he always had the\ndread of poverty before his eyes, he did things to make money which\nhe probably would not have bothered to do had he not been forced to\nsupport himself. Perhaps wealth would have closed to him and his\ntalent the path to excellence just as poverty had opened it up to him,\nbut need spurred him on since he desired to rise from such a miserable\nand lowly position // not perhaps to the summit and supreme height of\nexcellence, then at least to a point where he could have enough to live\non. For this reason, he took no notice of cold, hunger, discomfort,\ninconvenience, toil or shame if he could only live one day in ease and\nrepose; and he would always sayand as if it were a proverb that after\nbad weather, good weather must follow, and that during the good\nweather houses must be built for shelter in times of need.\n\nlives of the artists, Giorgio Vasari, 1511-1574\n\nThe slightest acquaintance with chess shows one that it is a play-\nsubstitute for the art of war and indeed it has been a favorite recreation\nof some of the greatest military leaders, from William the Conqueror\n\nto Napoleon. In the contest between the opposing armies the same\nprinciples of both strategy and tactics are displayed as in actual war,\nthe same foresight and powers of calculation are necessary, the same\ncapacity for divining the plans of the opponent, and the rigor with\nwhich decisions are followed by their consequences is, if anything,\neven more ruthless. More than that, it is plain that the unconscious\nmotive actuating the players is not the mere love of pugnacity\ncharacteristic of all competitive games, but the grimmer one of father-\nmurder. It is true that the original goal of capturing the king has been\ngiven up, but from the point of view of motive there is, except in\nrespect of crudity, not appreciable change in the present goal of\nsterilizing him in immobility... \u201cCheckmate \u201d means literally \u201cthe king\nis dead.\u201d ... Our knowledge of the unconscious motivation of chess-\nplaying tells us that what it represented could only have been the wish\nto overcome the father in an acceptable way.... It is no doubt signifi-\n\nInstead of allowing the son to go in a new direction, the father\nwill try to put him in his own shoes, perhaps secredy wishing die boy\nwill fail, as Philip half wanted to see Alexander thrown from\nBucephalus. Fathers envy Uieir sons' youdi and vigor, after all, and\ntheir desire is to control and dominate. The sons of such men tend to\nbecome cowed and cautious, terrified of losing what their fadiers have\ngained.\n\nThe son will never step out of his father's shadow unless he\nadopts die ruthless strategy of Alexander: disparage die past, create\nyour own kingdom, put die father in die shadows instead of letting him\ndo the same to you. If you cannot materially start from ground zeroit\nwould be foolish to renounce an inheritanceyou can at least begin from\nground zero psychologically, by throwing off the weight of die past\nand charting a new direction. Alexander instinctively recognized that\nprivileges of birth are impediments to power. Be merciless with the\npast, tiiennot only widi your fadier and his fadier but widi your own\nearlier achievements. Only the weak rest on their laurels and dote on\npast triumphs; in the game of power there is never time to rest.\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nIn many ancient kingdoms, for example Bengal and Sumatra,\nafter die king had ruled for several years his subjects would execute\nhim. This was done partly as a ritual of renewal, but also to prevent\n\nSS Oe eS eee\nestablish a permanent order, at the expense of other families and of his\n\nown sons. Instead of protecting die tribe and leading it in times of war,\nhe would attempt to dominate it. And so he would be beaten to deadi,\nor executed in an elaborate ritual. Now that he was no longer around\nor his honors to go to his head, he could be worshipped as a god.\nMeanwhile die field had been cleared for a new and youdiful order to\nestablish itself.\n\nThe ambivalent, hostile attitude towards the king or father figure\nalso finds expression in legends of heroes who do not know their\n\u2018adier. Moses, the archetypal man of power, was found abandoned\namong die bulrushes and never knew his parents; without a father to\ncompete widi him or limit him, he could attain the heights of power.\nHercules had no earthly father he was the son of the god Zeus. Later in\nhis life Alexander the Great spread the story that the god Jupiter\nAmmon had sired him, not Philip of Mace-don. Legends and rituals\nlike diese eliminate the human fadier because he symbolizes the\ndestructive power of die past.\n\nThe past prevents the young hero from creating his own worldhe\nmust do as his father did, even after that father is dead or powerless.\nThe hero must bow and scrape before his predecessor and yield to\ntradition and precedent. What had success in the past must be carried\nover to die present, even tiiough circumstances have greatiy changed.\nThe past also weighs die hero down with an inheritance that he is\nterrified of losing, making him timid and cautious.\n\nPower depends on die ability to fill a void, to occupy a field diat\nhas\n\nbeen cleared of the dead weight of the past. Only after the father\nfigure has been properly done away widi will you have die necessary\nspace to create and establish a new order. There are several strategies\nyou can adopt to accomplish thisvariations on the execution of die king\nthat disguise the violence of die impulse by channeling it in socially\nacceptable forms.\n\nPerhaps the simplest way to escape the shadow of the past is\nsimply to belittle it, playing on die timeless antagonism between the\ngenerations, stirring up me young against die old. For diis you need a\nconvenient older figure to pillory. Mao Tse-tung, confronting a culture\n\nea = eens, = beeen Ae ae\n\n\nthat fiercely resisted change, played on the suppressed resentment\nagainst the overbearing presence of me venerable Confucius in\nChinese culture. John F. Kennedy knew the dangers of getting lost in\nthe past; he radically distinguished his presidency from diat of his\npredecessor, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and also from die preceding\ndecade, die 1950s, which Eisenhower personified. Kennedy, for\ninstance, would not play die dull and fadierly game of golf a symbol of\nretirement and privilege, and Eisenhower's passion. Instead he played\nfootball on die White House lawn. In every aspect his administration\nrepresented vigor and youth, as opposed to die stodgy Eisenhower.\nKennedy had discovered an old truth: The young are easily set against\nthe old, since diey yearn to make their own place in the world and\nresent the shadow of tiieir fathers.\n\nThe distance you establish from your predecessor often demands\nsome symbolism, a way of advertising itself publicly. Louis XIV, for\nexample, created such symbolism when he rejected the traditional\npalace of die French kings and built his own palace of Versailles. King\nPhilip II of Spain did die same when he created his center of power,\ndie palace of El Esco-rial, in what was then die middle of nowhere.\nBut Louis carried the game further: He would not be a king like his\nfadier or earlier ancestors, he would not wear a crown or carly a\nscepter or sit on a dirone, he would establish a new kind of imposing\nautiiority widi symbols and rituals of its own. Louis made his\nancestors\u2019 rituals into laughable relics of the past. Follow his example:\nNever let yourself be seen as following your predecessor's paui. If you\ndo you will never surpass him. You must physically demonstrate your\ndifference, by establishing a style and symbolism that sets you apart.\n\nThe Roman emperor Augustus, successor to Julius Caesar,\nunderstood this moroughly. Caesar had been a great general, a\ndieatrical figure whose spectacles kept the Romans entertained, an\ninternational emissary seduced by die charms of Cleopatraa larger-\nthan-life figure. So Augustus, despite his own theatrical tendencies,\ncompeted with Caesar not by trying to outdo him but by differentiating\nhimself from him: He based his power on a return to Roman\nsimplicity, an austerity of both style and substance. Against die\nmemory of Caesar's sweeping presence Augustus posed a quiet and\nmanly dignity.\n\n\nThe problem widi the overbearing predecessor is that he fills die\nvistas before you widi symbols of die past. You have no room to create\nyour own name. To deal witii diis situation you need to hunt out the\nvacuumsthose\n\ncant that [nineteenth-century chess champion Paul] Morphy's\nsoaring odyssey into the higher realms of chess began just a year after\nthe unexpectedly sudden death of his father, which had been a great\nshock to him, and we may surmise that his brilliant effort of\nsublimation was, like Shakespeare's Hamlet and Freud's The\nInterpretation of Dreams, a reaction to this critical event....\n\nSomething should now be said about the reception Morphy's\nsuccesses met with, for they were of such a kind as to raise the\nquestion whether his subsequent collapse may not have been\ninfluenced through his perhaps belonging to the type that Freud has\ndescribed under the name of Die am Erfolge scheitern (\u201cThose\nwrecked by success\u201d)... Couched in more psychological language, was\nMorphy affrighted at his own presumptuousness when the light of\npublicity was thrown on [his great success] Freud has pointed out that\nthe people who break under the strain of too great success do so\nbecause they can endure it only in imagination, not in reality. To\ncastrate the father in a dream is a very different matter from doing it in\nreality. The real situation provokes the unconscious guilt in its full\norce, and the penalty may be mental collapse.\n\nTHE PROBLEM OF PAUL MORPHY,\n\nErnest Jones, 1951\n\nareas in culture that have been left vacant and in which you can\nbecome the first and principal figure to shine.\nWhen Pericles of Athens was about to launch a career as a\nstatesman, he looked for the one thing that was missing in Athenian\npolitics. Most of the great politicians of his time had allied themselves\nwith the aristocracy; indeed Pericles himself had aristocratic\ntendencies. Yet he decided to tiirow in his hat with the city's\ndemocratic elements. The choice had nothing to do with his personal\nbeliefs, but it launched him on a brilliant career. Out of necessity he\nbecame a man of the people. Instead of competing in an arena filled\nwith great leaders both past and present, he would make a name for\nhimself where no shadows could obscure his presence.\n\n\nWhen the painter Diego de Velazquez began his career, he knew\nhe could not compete in refinement and technique with the great\nRenaissance painters who had come before him. Instead he chose to\nwork in a style that by the standards of the time seemed coarse and\nrough, in a way that had never been seen before. And in mis style he\nexcelled. There were members of the Spanish court who wanted to\ndemonstrate their own break with the past; the newness of Velazquez's\nstyle thrilled them. Most people are afraid to break so boldly with\ntradition, but mey secretly admire those who can break up the old\nforms and reinvigorate the culture. This is why there is so much power\nto be gained from entering vacuums and voids.\n\nThere is a kind of stubborn stupidity that recurs throughout\nhistory, and is a strong impediment to power: The superstitious belief\nthat if the person before you succeeded by doing A, B, and C, you can\nre-create their success by doing the same thing. This cookie-cutter\napproach will seduce the uncreative, for it is easy, and appeals to their\ntimidity and their laziness. But circumstances never repeat themselves\nexactly.\n\nWhen General Douglas MacArthur assumed command of\nAmerican forces in the Philippines during World War II, an assistant\nhanded him a book containing the various precedents established by\nthe commanders before him, the methods that had been successful for\nthem. MacArthur asked the assistant how many copies there were of\nthis book. Six, the assistant answered. \u201cWell,\u201d the general replied,\n\u201cyou get all those six copies together and burn themevery one of them.\nI'll not be bound by precedents. Any time a problem comes up, I'll\nmake the decision at onceimmediately.\u201d Adopt this ruthless strategy\ntoward the past: Burn all the books, and train yourself to react to\ncircumstances as they happen.\n\nYou may believe that you have separated yourself from the\npredecessor or father figure, but as you grow older you must be\neternally vigilant lest you become the father you had rebelled against.\nAs a young man, Mao Tse-tung disliked his father and in the struggle\nagainst him found his own identity and a new set of values. But as he\naged, his father's ways crept back in. Mao's father had valued manual\nwork over intellect; Mao had scoffed at this as a young man, but as he\ngrew older he unconsciously returned to his father's views and echoed\n\n\nsuch outdated ideas by forcing a whole generation of Chinese\nintellectuals into manual labor, a nightmarish mistake that\n\ncost his regime dearly. Remember: You are your own father. Do\nnot let yourself spend years creating yourself only to let your guard\ndown and allow the ghost of the pastfather, habit, historyto sneak back\nin.\n\nFinally, as noted in the story of Louis XV, plenitude and\nprosperity tend to make us lazy and inactive: When our power is\nsecure we have no need to act. This is a serious danger, especially for\nthose who achieve success and power at an early age. The playwright\nTennessee Williams, for instance, found himself skyrocketed from\nobscurity to fame by the success of The Glass Menagerie. \u201cThe sort of\nlife which I had had previous to this popular success,\u201d he later wrote,\n\u201cwas one that required endurance, a life of clawing and scratching, but\nit was a good life because it was the sort of life for which the human\norganism is created. I was not aware of how much vital energy had\ngone into this struggle until the struggle was removed. This was\nsecurity at last. I sat down and looked about me and was suddenly very\ndepressed.\u201d Williams had a nervous breakdown, which may in fact\nhave been necessary for him: Pushed to the psychological edge, he\ncould start writing with the old vitality again, and he produced A\nStreetcar Named Desire. Fyodor Dostoyevsky, similarly, whenever he\nwrote a successful novel, would feel that the financial security he had\ngained made the act of creation unnecessary. He would take his entire\nsavings to the casino and would not leave until he had gambled away\nhis last penny. Once reduced to poverty he could write again.\n\nIt is not necessary to go to such extremes, but you must be\nprepared to return to square one psychologically rather than growing\nfat and lazy with prosperity. Pablo Picasso could deal with success, but\nonly by constantly changing the style of his painting, often breaking\ncompletely with what had made him successful before. How often our\nearly triumphs turn us into a kind of caricature of ourselves. Powerful\npeople recognize these traps; like Alexander the Great, they struggle\nconstantly to re-create themselves. The father must not be allowed to\nreturn; he must be slain at every step of the way.\n\nImage: The Father. He casts a giant shadow over his children,\nkeeping them in thrall long after he is gone by tying them to the past,\n\nsquashing their youthful spirit, and forcing them down the same tired\npath he followed himself. His tricks are many. At every crossroads you\nmust slay the father and step out of his shadow.\n\nAuthority: Beware of stepping into a great man's shoesyou will\nhave to accomplish twice as much to surpass him. Those who follow\nare taken for imitators. No matter how much they sweat, they will\nnever shed that burden. It is an uncommon skill to find a new path for\nexcellence, a modern route to celebrity. There are many roads to\nsingularity, not all of them well traveled. The newest ones can be\narduous, but they are often shortcuts to greatness. (Baltasar Gracian,\n1601-1658)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nThe shadow of a great predecessor could be used to advantage if\nit is chosen as a trick, a tactic that can be discarded once it has brought\nyou power. Napoleon III used the name and legend of his illustrious\ngrand-uncle Napoleon Bonaparte to help him become first president\nand then emperor of France. Once on the throne, however, he did not\nstay tied to the past; he quickly showed how different his reign would\nbe, and was careful to keep the public from expecting him to attain the\nheights that Bonaparte had attained.\n\nThe past often has elements worth appropriating, qualities that\nwould be foolish to reject out of a need to distinguish yourself. Even\nAlexander the Great recognized and was influenced by his father's skill\nin organizing an army. Making a display of doing things differently\nfrom your predecessor can make you seem childish and in fact out of\ncontrol, unless your actions have a logic of their own.\n\nJoseph II, son of the Austrian empress Maria Theresa, made a\nshow of doing the exact opposite of his motherdressing like an\nordinary citizen, staying in inns instead of palaces, appearing as the\n\u201cpeople's emperor.\u201d Maria Theresa, on the other hand, had been regal\nand aristocratic. The problem was that she had also been beloved, an\nempress who ruled wisely\n\nafter years of learning the hard way. If you have the kind of\nintelligence and instinct mat will point you in the right direction,\nplaying the rebel will not be dangerous. But if you are mediocre, as\nJoseph II was in comparison to his mother, you are better off learning\n\nfrom your predecessor's knowledge and experience, which are based\non something real.\n\nFinally, it is often wise to keep an eye on the young, your future\nrivals in power. Just as you try to rid yourself of your father, they will\nsoon play the same trick on you, denigrating everything you have\naccomplished. Just as you rise by rebelling against the past, keep an\neye on those rising from below, and never give them the chance to do\ndie same to you.\n\nThe great Baroque artist and architect Pietro Bernini was a master\nat sniffing out younger potential rivals and keeping mem in his\nshadow. One day a young stonemason named Francesco Borromini\nshowed Bemini his architectural sketches. Recognizing his talent\nimmediately, Bernini in-standy hired Borromini as his assistant, which\ndelighted the young man but was actually only a tactic to keep him\nclose at hand, so that he could play psychological games on him and\ncreate in him a kind of inferiority complex. And indeed, despite\nBorromini's brilliance, Bernini has the greater fame. His strategy with\nBorromini he made a lifelong practice: Fearing mat the great sculptor\nAlessandro Algardi, for example, would eclipse him in fame, he\narranged it so that Algardi could only find work as his assistant. And\nany assistant who rebelled against Bernini and tried to strike out on his\nown would find his career ruined.\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Neutralize their influence by isolating or\nbanishing them. Strike at the source of the trouble and the sheep will\nscatter.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW I\n\nNear the end of the sixth century B.C., the city-state of Athens\noverthrew the series of petty tyrants who had dominated its politics for\ndecades. It established instead a democracy that was to last over a\ncentury, a democracy that became the source of its power and its\nproudest achievement. But as the democracy evolved, so did a problem\nthe Athenians had never faced: How to deal with those who did not\nconcern themselves with the cohesion of a small city surrounded by\nenemies, who did not work for its greater glory, but thought of only\nthemselves and their own ambitions and petty intrigues The Athenians\nunderstood that these people, if left alone, would sow dissension,\ndivide the city into factions, and stir up anxieties, all of which could\nlead to the ruin of their democracy.\n\nViolent punishment no longer suited the new, civilized order that\nAthens had created. Instead the citizens found another, more\nsatisfying, and less brutal way to deal with the chronically selfish:\nEvery year they would gather in the marketplace and write on a piece\nof earthenware, an ostrakon, the name of an individual they wanted to\nsee banished from the city for ten years. If a particular name appeared\non six thousand ballots, that person would instantly be exiled. If no\n\none received six thousand votes, the person with the most ostraka\nrecording his name would suffer the ten-year \u201costracism.\u201d This ritual\nexpulsion became a kind of festival what a joy to be able to banish\nthose irritating, anxiety-inducing individuals who wanted to rise above\nthe group they should have served.\n\nIn 490 B.C., Aristides, one of the great generals of Athenian\nhistory, helped defeat the Persians at the battle of Marathon.\nMeanwhile, off the battlefield, his fairness as a judge had earned him\nthe nickname \u201cThe Just.\u201d But as the years went by the Athenians came\nto dislike him. He made such a show of his righteousness, and this,\nthey believed, disguised his feelings of superiority and scorn for the\ncommon folk. His omnipresence in Athenian politics became\nobnoxious; the citizens grew tired of hearing him called \u201cThe Just.\u201d\nThey feared that this was just the type of manjudgmental, haughtywho\nwould eventually stir up fierce divisions among them. In 482 B.C.,\ndespite Aristides' invaluable expertise in the continuing war with the\nPersians, they collected the ostraka and had him banished.\n\nAfter Aristides' ostracism, the great general Themistocles\nemerged as the city's premier leader. But his many honors and victories\nwent to his head, and he too became arrogant and overbearing,\nconstantly reminding the Athenians of his triumphs in battle, the\ntemples he had built, the dangers he had fended off. He seemed to be\nsaying mat without him the city would come to ruin. And so, in 472\nB.C., Themistocles' name was filled in on the ostraka and the city was\nrid of his poisonous presence.\n\nThe greatest political figure in fifth-century Athens was\nundoubtedly Pericles. Although several times threatened with\nostracism, he avoided that fate by maintaining close ties with the\npeople. Perhaps he had learned a lesson as a child from his favorite\ntutor, the incomparable Damon, who\n\nThe struggle now became fiercer than ever around the royal litter\n[of Atahualpa, king of the Incan empire]. It reeled more and more, and\nat length, several of the nobles who supported it having been slain, it\nwas overturned, and the Indian prince would have come with violence\nto the ground, had not his fall been broken by the efforts of Pizarro and\nsome other of the cavaliers, who caught him in their arms. The\nimperial borla was instantly snatched from his temples by a soldier,\n\nand the unhappy monarch, strongly secured, was removed to a\nneighboring building where he was carefully guarded. All attempt at\nresistance now ceased. The fate of the Inca [Atahualpa] soon spread\nover town and country. The charm that might have held the Peruvians\ntogether was dissolved. Every man thought only of his own safety.\nEven the [IncanJ soldiery encamped on the adjacent fields took the\nalarm, and, learning the fatal tidings, were seen flying in every\ndirection before their pursuers, who in the heat of triumph showed no\ntouch of mercy. At length night, more pitiful than man, threw her\nfriendly mantle over the fugitives, and the\n\nscattered troops of Pizarro rallied once more at the sound of the\ntrumpet in the bloody square of Cajamarca... [Atahualpa] was\nreverenced as more than a human. He was not merely the head of the\nstate, but the point to which all its institutions converged as to a\ncommon centerthe keystone of the political fabric which must fall to\npieces by its own weight when that was withdrawn. So it fared on the\n[execution] of Atahualpa. His death not only left the throne vacant,\nwithout any certain successor, but the manner of it announced to the\nPeruvian people that a hand stronger than that of their Incas had now\nseized the scepter, and that the dynasty of the Children of the Sun had\npassed away forever.\n\nTHE CONQUEST OF PERU,\n\nWilliam H. Prescott, 1847\n\nexcelled above all other Athenians in his intelligence, his musical\nskills, and his rhetorical abilities. It was Damon who had trained\nPericles in die arts of ruling. But he, too, suffered ostracism, for his\nsuperior airs and his insulting manner toward the commoners stirred\nup too much resentment.\n\nToward the end of the century there lived a man named\nHyperbolus. Most writers of the time describe him as the city's most\nworthless citizen: He did not care what anyone thought of him, and\nslandered whomever he disliked. He amused some, but irritated many\nmore. In 417 B.C., Hyperbolus saw an opportunity to stir up anger\nagainst the two leading politicians of the time, Alcibiades and Nicias.\nHe hoped that one of the two would be ostracized and that he would\nrise in mat man's place. His campaign seemed likely to succeed: The\nAthenians disliked Alcibiades' flamboyant and carefree lifestyle, and\n\nwere wary of Nicias' wealth and aloofness. They seemed certain to\nostracize one or die other. But Alcibiades and Nicias, although they\nwere otherwise enemies, pooled their resources and managed to turn\nthe ostracism on Hyperbolus instead. His obnoxious-ness, they argued,\ncould only be terminated by banishment.\n\nEarlier sufferers of ostracism had been formidable, powerful men.\nHyperbolus, however, was a low buffoon, and with his banishment the\nAthenians felt that ostracism had been degraded. And so they ended\nthe practice that for nearly a hundred years had been one of die keys to\nkeeping the peace within Athens.\n\nInterpretation\n\nThe ancient Athenians had social instincts unknown todaydie\npassage of centuries has blunted them. Citizens in the true sense of the\nword, the Athenians sensed the dangers posed by asocial behavior, and\nsaw how such behavior often disguises itself in otiier forms: the holier-\nthan-thou attitude that silendy seeks to impose its standards on others;\noverweening ambition at the expense of the common good; the\nflaunting of superiority; quiet scheming; terminal obnoxiousness.\nSome of Uiese behaviors would eat away at the city's cohesion by\ncreating factions and sowing dissension, odiers would ruin the\ndemocratic spirit by making the common citizen feel inferior and\nenvious. The Athenians did not try to reeducate people who acted in\nthese ways, or to absorb them somehow into the group, or to impose a\nviolent punishment that would only create other problems. The\nsolution was quick and effective: Get rid of them.\n\nWithin any group, trouble can most often be traced to a single\nsource, the unhappy, chronically dissatisfied one who will always stir\nup dissension and infect the group widi his or her ill ease. Before you\nknow what hit you the dissatisfaction spreads. Act before it becomes\nimpossible to disentangle one strand of misery from anodier, or to see\nhow die whole thing started. First, recognize troublemakers by their\noverbearing presence, or by their complaining nature. Once you spot\nthem do not try to reform them or appease diemmat will only make\nthings worse. Do not attack diem, whether directly or indirecdy, for\ndiey are poisonous in nature and\n\nwill work underground to destroy you. Do as the Adienians did:\nBanish them before it is too late. Separate them from the group before\n\n\nthey become the eye of a whirlpool. Do not give diem time to stir up\nanxieties and sow discontent; do not give them room to move. Let one\nperson suffer so that the rest can live in peace.\n\nWhen the tree falls, the monkeys scatter.\n\nChinese saying\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II\n\nIn 1296 the cardinals of die Catholic Church met in Rome to\nselect a new pope. They chose Cardinal Gaetani, for he was\nincomparably shrewd; such a man would make die Vatican a great\npower. Taking the name Boniface VIII, Gaetani soon proved he\ndeserved the cardinals' high opinion of him: He plotted his moves\ncarefully in advance, and stopped at nodiing to get his way. Once in\npower, Boniface quickly crushed his rivals and unified the Papal\nStates. The European powers began to fear him, and sent delegates to\nnegotiate widi him. The German King Albrecht of Austria even\nyielded some territory to Boniface. All was proceeding according to\nthe pope's plan.\n\nOne piece did not fall into place, however, and diat was Tuscany,\nthe richest part of Italy. If Boniface could conquer Florence, Tuscany's\nmost powerful city, die region would be his. But Florence was a proud\nrepublic, and would be hard to defeat. The pope had to play his cards\nskillfully.\n\nFlorence was divided by two rival factions, the Blacks and die\nWhites. The Whites were the merchant families diat had recendy and\nquickly risen to power and weakh; the Blacks were the older money.\nBecause of their popularity widi die people, die Whites retained\ncontrol of the city, to the Blacks' increasing resentment. The feud\nbetween the two grew steadily more bitter.\n\nHere Boniface saw his chance: He would plot to help the Blacks\ntake over the city, and Florence would be in his pocket. And as he\nstudied die situation he began to focus on one man, Dante Alighieri,\ndie celebrated writer, poet, and ardent supporter of die Whites. Dante\nhad always been interested in politics. He believed passionately in die\nrepublic, and often chastised his fellow citizens for their lack of spine.\nHe also happened to be the city's most eloquent public speaker. In\n1300, die year Boniface began plotting to take over Tuscany, Dante's\nfellow citizens had voted him in to Florence's highest elected position,\n\nmaking him one of the city's six priors. During his six-mondi term in\ndie post, he had stood firmly against the Blacks and against all of die\npope's attempts to sow disorder.\n\nBy 1301, however, Boniface had a new plan: He called in Charles\nde Valois, powerful brother of die king of France, to help bring order\nto Tuscany. As Charles marched through northern Italy, and Florence\nseedied widi anxiety and fear, Dante quickly emerged as die man who\ncould rally\n\nTHE WOLVES AND THE SHEEP\n\nOnce upon a time, the wolves sent an embassy to the sheep,\ndesiring that there might be peace between them for the time to come.\n\u201cWhy,\u201d said they, \u201cshould we be for ever waging this deadly strife\nThose wicked dogs are the cause of all; they are incessantly barking at\nus, and provoking us. Send them away, and there will be no longer any\nobstacle to our eternal friendship and peace.\u201d The silly sheep listened,\nthe dogs were dismissed, and the flock, thus deprived of their best\nprotectors, became an easy prey to their treacherous enemy.\n\nFABLES,\n\nAesop,\n\nsixth century b.c.\n\n[Themistocles's] fellow citizens reached the point at which their\njealousy made them listen to any slander at his expense, and so [he]\nwas forced to remind the assembly of his achievements until they\ncould bear this no longer. He once said to those who were complaining\nof him: \u201cWhy are you tired of receiving benefits so often from the\nsame men\u201d Besides this he gave offense to the people when he built\nthe temple of Artemis, for not only did he style the goddess Artemis\nAristohoule, or Artemis wisest in counselwith the hint that it was he\nwho had given the best counsel to the Athenians and the Greeksbut he\nchose a site for it near his own house at Melite.... So at last the\nAthenians banished him. They made use of the ostracism to humble\nhis great reputation and his authority, as indeed was their habit with\nany whose power they regarded as oppressive, or who had risen to an\neminence which they considered out of keeping with the equality of a\ndemocracy.\n\nthe life of\n\nthemistocles,\n\nPlutarch,\n\nc. a.d. 46-120\n\nthe people, arguing vehemently against appeasement and working\ndesperately to arm the citizens and to organize resistance against die\npope and his puppet French prince. By hook or by crook, Boniface had\nto neutralize Dante. And so, even as on the one hand he threatened\nFlorence with Charles de Valois, on the other he held out the olive\nbranch, the possibility of negotiations, hoping Dante would take the\nbait. And indeed the Florentines decided to send a delegation to Rome\nand try to negotiate a peace. To head the mission, predictably, they\nchose Dante.\n\nSome warned the poet that the wily pope was setting up a trap to\nlure him away, but Dante went to Rome anyway, arriving as the French\narmy stood before the gates of Florence. He felt sure that his eloquence\nand reason would win the pope over and save the city. Yet when the\npope met die poet and the Florentine delegates, he instandy intimidated\nthem, as he did so many. \u201cFall on your knees before me!\u201d he bellowed\nat their first meeting. \u201cSubmit to me! I tell you that in all truth I have\nnothing in my heart but to promote your peace.\u201d Succumbing to his\npowerful presence, the Florentines listened as the pope promised to\nlook after dieir interests. He then advised them to return home, leaving\none of their members behind to continue the talks. Boniface signaled\nthat the man to stay was to be Dante. He spoke with the utmost\npoliteness, but in essence it was an order.\n\nAnd so Dante remained in Rome. And while he and the pope\ncontinued their dialogue, Florence fell apart. With no one to rally the\nWhites, and with Charles de Valois using the pope's money to bribe\nand sow dissension, the Whites disintegrated, some arguing for\nnegotiations, others switching sides. Facing an enemy now divided and\nunsure of itself, the Blacks easily destroyed them widiin weeks,\nexacting violent revenge on them. And once the Blacks stood firmly in\npower, the pope finally dismissed Dante from Rome.\n\nThe Blacks ordered Dante to return home to face accusations and\nstand trial. When the poet refused, the Blacks condemned him to be\nburned to death if he ever set foot in Florence again. And so Dante\nbegan a miserable life of exile, wandering through Italy, disgraced in\nthe city that he loved, never to return to Florence, even after his death.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\nBoniface knew that if he only had a pretext to lure Dante away,\nFlorence would crumble. He played die oldest card in the\nbookthreatening with one hand while holding out the olive branch with\nthe otherand Dante fell for it. Once the poet was in Rome, the pope\nkept him there for as long as it took. For Boniface understood one of\nthe principal precepts in the game of power: One resolute person, one\ndisobedient spirit, can turn a flock of sheep into a den of lions. So he\nisolated the troublemaker. Without the backbone of the city to keep\nthem together, the sheep quickly scattered.\n\nLearn the lesson: Do not waste your time lashing out in all\ndirections at what seems to be a many-headed enemy. Find the one\nhead that mat-\n\ntersthe person with willpower, or smarts, or, most important of all,\ncharisma. Whatever it costs you, lure this person away, for once he is\nabsent his powers will lose their effect. His isolation can be physical\n(banishment or absence from the court), political (narrowing his base\nof support), or psychological (alienating him from the group through\nslander and insinuation). Cancer begins with a single cell; excise it\nbefore it spreads beyond cure.\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nIn the past, an entire nation would be ruled by a king and his\nhandful of ministers. Only the elite had any power to play witii. Over\nthe centuries, power has gradually become more and more diffused\nand democratized. This has created, however, a common\nmisperception that groups no longer have centers of powerthat power\nis spread out and scattered among many people. Actually, however,\npower has changed in its numbers but not in its essence. There may be\newer mighty tyrants commanding the power of life and death over\nmillions, but there remain thousands of petty tyrants ruling smaller\nrealms, and enforcing tiieir will dirough indirect power games,\ncharisma, and so on. In every group, power is concentrated in the\nhands of one or two people, for this is one area in which human nature\nwill never change: People will congregate around a single strong\npersonality like planets orbiting a sun.\n\nTo labor under the illusion diat tiiis kind of power center no\nlonger exists is to make endless mistakes, waste energy and time, and\n\n\nnever hit the target. Powerful people never waste time. Outwardly they\nmay play along with the gamepretending that power is shared among\nmanybut inwardly they keep their eyes on the inevitable few in die\ngroup who hold the cards. These are die ones they work on. When\ntroubles arise, they look for die underlying cause, the single strong\ncharacter who started the stirring and whose isolation or banishment\nwill settle die waters again.\n\nIn his family-dierapy practice, Dr. Milton H. Erickson found that\nif the family dynamic was unsettled and dysfunctional there was\ninevitably one person who was the stirrer, the troublemaker. In his\nsessions he would symbolically isolate tins rotten apple by seating him\nor her apart from the others, if only by a few feet. Slowly the odier\nfamily members would see the physically separate person as the source\nof their difficulty. Once you recognize who the stirrer is, pointing it out\nto odier people will accomplish a great deal. Understanding who\ncontrols die group dynamic is a critical realization. Remember: Stirrers\ndirive by hiding in the group, disguising their actions among the\nreactions of others. Render their actions visible and diey lose dieir\npower to upset.\n\nA key element in games of strategy is isolating die enemy's\npower. In chess you try to corner the king. In die Chinese game of go\nyou try to isolate the enemy's forces in small pockets, rendering them\nimmobile and ineffectual. It is often better to isolate your enemies than\nto destroy\n\nthemyou seem less brutal. The result, though, is the same, for in\ndie game of power, isolation spells deadi.\n\nThe most effective form of isolation is somehow to separate your\nvictims from their power base. When Mao Tse-tung wanted to\neliminate an enemy in the ruling elite, he did not confront the person\ndirectly; he silently and stealthily worked to isolate die man, divide his\nallies and turn diem away from him, shrink his support. Soon the man\nwould vanish on his own.\n\nPresence and appearance have great import in die game of power.\nTo seduce, particularly in the beginning stages, you need to be\nconstantly present, or create die feeling that you are; if you are often\nout of sight, die charm will wear off. Queen Elizabedi's prime minister,\nRobert Cecil, had two main rivals: die queen's favorite, die Earl of\n\nEssex, and her former favorite, Sir Walter Raleigh. He contrived to\nsend them both on a mission against Spain; with them away from the\ncourt he managed to wrap his tentacles around die queen, secure his\nposition as her top adviser and weaken her affection for Raleigh and\nthe earl. The lesson here is twofold: First, your absence from the court\nspells danger for you, and you should never leave die scene in a time\nof turmoil, for your absence can botii symbolize and induce a loss of\npower; second, and on die odier hand, luring your enemies away from\nthe court at critical moments is a great ploy.\n\nIsolation has other strategic uses. When trying to seduce people, it\nis often wise to isolate them from dieir usual social context. Once\nisolated they are vulnerable to you, and your presence becomes\nmagnified. Similarly, con artists often look for ways to isolate their\nmarks from their normal social milieux, steering them into new\nenvironments in which diey are no longer comfortable. Here they feel\nweak, and succumb to deception more easily. Isolation, then, can prove\na powerful way of bringing people under your spell to seduce or\nswindle diem.\n\nYou will often find powerful people who have alienated\nthemselves from the group. Perhaps their power has gone to their\nheads, and they consider themselves superior; perhaps they have lost\nthe knack of communicating with ordinary folk. Remember: This\nmakes them vulnerable. Powerful though they be, people like diis can\nbe turned to use.\n\nThe monk Rasputin gained his power over Czar Nicholas and\nCzarina Alexandra of Russia through dieir tremendous isolation from\nthe people. Alexandra in particular was a foreigner, and especially\nalienated from everyday Russians; Rasputin used his peasant origins to\ninsinuate himself into her good graces, for she desperately wanted to\ncommunicate witii her subjects. Once in the court's inner circle,\nRasputin made himself indispensable and attained great power.\nHeading straight for the center, he aimed for die one figure in Russia\nwho commanded power (the czarina dominated her husband), and\nfound he had no need to isolate her for the work was already done. The\nRasputin strategy can bring you great power: Always search out\npeople who hold high positions yet who find tiiem-\n\nselves isolated on the board. They are like apples falling into your\nlap, easily seduced, and able to catapult you into power yourself.\n\nFinally, the reason you strike at the shepherd is because such an\naction will dishearten the sheep beyond any rational measure. When\nHernando Cortes and Francisco Pizarro led their tiny forces against the\nAztec and Incan empires, they did not make the mistake of fighting on\nseveral fronts, nor were they intimidated by die numbers arrayed\nagainst them; they captured the kings, Moctezuma and Atahualpa. Vast\nempires fell into tiieir hands. With die leader gone the center of gravity\nis gone; there is nothing to revolve around and everything falls apart.\nAim at the leaders, bring them down, and look for the endless\nopportunities in the confusion that will ensue.\n\nImage: A Flock of Fatted\n\nSheep. Do not waste precious\n\ntime trying to steal a sheep or two; do\n\nnot risk life and limb by setting upon\n\nthe dogs that guard the flock. Aim at the\n\nshepherd. Lure him away and the dogs\n\nwill follow. Strike him down and the flock will\n\nscatteryou can pick them off one by one.\n\nAuthority: If you draw a bow, draw the strongest. If you use an\narrow, use the longest. To shoot a rider, first shoot his horse. To catch a\ngang of bandits, first capture its leader. Just as a country has its border,\nso the killing of men has its limits. If the enemy's attack can be stopped\n[with a blow to the head], why have any more dead and wounded than\nnecessary (Chinese poet Tu Fu, Tang dynasty, eighth century)\n\nREVERSAL\n\n\u201cAny harm you do to a man should be done in such a way mat\nyou need not fear his revenge,\u201d writes Machiavelli. If you act to isolate\nyour enemy, make sure he lacks the means to repay the favor. If you\napply this Law, in other words, apply it from a position of superiority,\nso that you have nothing to fear from his resentment.\n\nAndrew Johnson, Abraham Lincoln's successor as U.S. president,\nsaw Ulysses S. Grant as a troublesome member of his government. So\nhe isolated Grant, as a prelude to forcing him out. This only enraged\nthe great general, however, who responded by forming a support base\nin the Republican party and going on to become the next president. It\n\n\nwould have been far wiser to keep a man like Grant in the fold, where\nhe could do less harm, than to make him revengeful. And so you may\noften find it better to keep people on your side, where you can watch\nthem, than to risk creating an angry enemy. Keeping them close, you\ncan secretly whit-tie away at their support base, so that when the time\ncomes to cut them loose they will fall fast and hard without knowing\nwhat hit them.\n'.

It established instead a democracy that was to last over a\ncentury, a democracy that became the source of its power and its\nproudest achievement. But as the democracy evolved, so did a problem\nthe Athenians had never faced: How to deal with those who did not\nconcern themselves with the cohesion of a small city surrounded by\nenemies, who did not work for its greater glory, but thought of only\nthemselves and their own ambitions and petty intrigues The Athenians\nunderstood that these people, if left alone, would sow dissension,\ndivide the city into factions, and stir up anxieties, all of which could\nlead to the ruin of their democracy.\n\nViolent punishment no longer suited the new, civilized order that\nAthens had created. Instead the citizens found another, more\nsatisfying, and less brutal way to deal with the chronically selfish:\nEvery year they would gather in the marketplace and write on a piece\nof earthenware, an ostrakon, the name of an individual they wanted to\nsee banished from the city for ten years. If a particular name appeared\non six thousand ballots, that person would instantly be exiled. If no\n\none received six thousand votes, the person with the most ostraka\nrecording his name would suffer the ten-year \u201costracism.\u201d This ritual\nexpulsion became a kind of festival what a joy to be able to banish\nthose irritating, anxiety-inducing individuals who wanted to rise above\nthe group they should have served.\n\nIn 490 B.C., Aristides, one of the great generals of Athenian\nhistory, helped defeat the Persians at the battle of Marathon.\nMeanwhile, off the battlefield, his fairness as a judge had earned him\nthe nickname \u201cThe Just.\u201d But as the years went by the Athenians came\nto dislike him. He made such a show of his righteousness, and this,\nthey believed, disguised his feelings of superiority and scorn for the\ncommon folk. His omnipresence in Athenian politics became\nobnoxious; the citizens grew tired of hearing him called \u201cThe Just.\u201d\nThey feared that this was just the type of manjudgmental, haughtywho\nwould eventually stir up fierce divisions among them. In 482 B.C.,\ndespite Aristides' invaluable expertise in the continuing war with the\nPersians, they collected the ostraka and had him banished.\n\nAfter Aristides' ostracism, the great general Themistocles\nemerged as the city's premier leader. But his many honors and victories\nwent to his head, and he too became arrogant and overbearing,\nconstantly reminding the Athenians of his triumphs in battle, the\ntemples he had built, the dangers he had fended off. He seemed to be\nsaying mat without him the city would come to ruin. And so, in 472\nB.C., Themistocles' name was filled in on the ostraka and the city was\nrid of his poisonous presence.\n\nThe greatest political figure in fifth-century Athens was\nundoubtedly Pericles. Although several times threatened with\nostracism, he avoided that fate by maintaining close ties with the\npeople. Perhaps he had learned a lesson as a child from his favorite\ntutor, the incomparable Damon, who\n\nThe struggle now became fiercer than ever around the royal litter\n[of Atahualpa, king of the Incan empire]. It reeled more and more, and\nat length, several of the nobles who supported it having been slain, it\nwas overturned, and the Indian prince would have come with violence\nto the ground, had not his fall been broken by the efforts of Pizarro and\nsome other of the cavaliers, who caught him in their arms. The\nimperial borla was instantly snatched from his temples by a soldier,\n\nand the unhappy monarch, strongly secured, was removed to a\nneighboring building where he was carefully guarded. All attempt at\nresistance now ceased. The fate of the Inca [Atahualpa] soon spread\nover town and country. The charm that might have held the Peruvians\ntogether was dissolved. Every man thought only of his own safety.\nEven the [IncanJ soldiery encamped on the adjacent fields took the\nalarm, and, learning the fatal tidings, were seen flying in every\ndirection before their pursuers, who in the heat of triumph showed no\ntouch of mercy. At length night, more pitiful than man, threw her\nfriendly mantle over the fugitives, and the\n\nscattered troops of Pizarro rallied once more at the sound of the\ntrumpet in the bloody square of Cajamarca... [Atahualpa] was\nreverenced as more than a human. He was not merely the head of the\nstate, but the point to which all its institutions converged as to a\ncommon centerthe keystone of the political fabric which must fall to\npieces by its own weight when that was withdrawn. So it fared on the\n[execution] of Atahualpa. His death not only left the throne vacant,\nwithout any certain successor, but the manner of it announced to the\nPeruvian people that a hand stronger than that of their Incas had now\nseized the scepter, and that the dynasty of the Children of the Sun had\npassed away forever.\n\nTHE CONQUEST OF PERU,\n\nWilliam H. Prescott, 1847\n\nexcelled above all other Athenians in his intelligence, his musical\nskills, and his rhetorical abilities. It was Damon who had trained\nPericles in die arts of ruling. But he, too, suffered ostracism, for his\nsuperior airs and his insulting manner toward the commoners stirred\nup too much resentment.\n\nToward the end of the century there lived a man named\nHyperbolus. Most writers of the time describe him as the city's most\nworthless citizen: He did not care what anyone thought of him, and\nslandered whomever he disliked. He amused some, but irritated many\nmore. In 417 B.C., Hyperbolus saw an opportunity to stir up anger\nagainst the two leading politicians of the time, Alcibiades and Nicias.\nHe hoped that one of the two would be ostracized and that he would\nrise in mat man's place. His campaign seemed likely to succeed: The\nAthenians disliked Alcibiades' flamboyant and carefree lifestyle, and\n\nwere wary of Nicias' wealth and aloofness. They seemed certain to\nostracize one or die other. But Alcibiades and Nicias, although they\nwere otherwise enemies, pooled their resources and managed to turn\nthe ostracism on Hyperbolus instead. His obnoxious-ness, they argued,\ncould only be terminated by banishment.\n\nEarlier sufferers of ostracism had been formidable, powerful men.\nHyperbolus, however, was a low buffoon, and with his banishment the\nAthenians felt that ostracism had been degraded. And so they ended\nthe practice that for nearly a hundred years had been one of die keys to\nkeeping the peace within Athens.\n\nInterpretation\n\nThe ancient Athenians had social instincts unknown todaydie\npassage of centuries has blunted them. Citizens in the true sense of the\nword, the Athenians sensed the dangers posed by asocial behavior, and\nsaw how such behavior often disguises itself in otiier forms: the holier-\nthan-thou attitude that silendy seeks to impose its standards on others;\noverweening ambition at the expense of the common good; the\nflaunting of superiority; quiet scheming; terminal obnoxiousness.\nSome of Uiese behaviors would eat away at the city's cohesion by\ncreating factions and sowing dissension, odiers would ruin the\ndemocratic spirit by making the common citizen feel inferior and\nenvious. The Athenians did not try to reeducate people who acted in\nthese ways, or to absorb them somehow into the group, or to impose a\nviolent punishment that would only create other problems. The\nsolution was quick and effective: Get rid of them.\n\nWithin any group, trouble can most often be traced to a single\nsource, the unhappy, chronically dissatisfied one who will always stir\nup dissension and infect the group widi his or her ill ease. Before you\nknow what hit you the dissatisfaction spreads. Act before it becomes\nimpossible to disentangle one strand of misery from anodier, or to see\nhow die whole thing started. First, recognize troublemakers by their\noverbearing presence, or by their complaining nature. Once you spot\nthem do not try to reform them or appease diemmat will only make\nthings worse. Do not attack diem, whether directly or indirecdy, for\ndiey are poisonous in nature and\n\nwill work underground to destroy you. Do as the Adienians did:\nBanish them before it is too late. Separate them from the group before\n\n\nthey become the eye of a whirlpool. Do not give diem time to stir up\nanxieties and sow discontent; do not give them room to move. Let one\nperson suffer so that the rest can live in peace.\n\nWhen the tree falls, the monkeys scatter.\n\nChinese saying\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II\n\nIn 1296 the cardinals of die Catholic Church met in Rome to\nselect a new pope. They chose Cardinal Gaetani, for he was\nincomparably shrewd; such a man would make die Vatican a great\npower. Taking the name Boniface VIII, Gaetani soon proved he\ndeserved the cardinals' high opinion of him: He plotted his moves\ncarefully in advance, and stopped at nodiing to get his way. Once in\npower, Boniface quickly crushed his rivals and unified the Papal\nStates. The European powers began to fear him, and sent delegates to\nnegotiate widi him. The German King Albrecht of Austria even\nyielded some territory to Boniface. All was proceeding according to\nthe pope's plan.\n\nOne piece did not fall into place, however, and diat was Tuscany,\nthe richest part of Italy. If Boniface could conquer Florence, Tuscany's\nmost powerful city, die region would be his. But Florence was a proud\nrepublic, and would be hard to defeat. The pope had to play his cards\nskillfully.\n\nFlorence was divided by two rival factions, the Blacks and die\nWhites. The Whites were the merchant families diat had recendy and\nquickly risen to power and weakh; the Blacks were the older money.\nBecause of their popularity widi die people, die Whites retained\ncontrol of the city, to the Blacks' increasing resentment. The feud\nbetween the two grew steadily more bitter.\n\nHere Boniface saw his chance: He would plot to help the Blacks\ntake over the city, and Florence would be in his pocket. And as he\nstudied die situation he began to focus on one man, Dante Alighieri,\ndie celebrated writer, poet, and ardent supporter of die Whites. Dante\nhad always been interested in politics. He believed passionately in die\nrepublic, and often chastised his fellow citizens for their lack of spine.\nHe also happened to be the city's most eloquent public speaker. In\n1300, die year Boniface began plotting to take over Tuscany, Dante's\nfellow citizens had voted him in to Florence's highest elected position,\n\nmaking him one of the city's six priors. During his six-mondi term in\ndie post, he had stood firmly against the Blacks and against all of die\npope's attempts to sow disorder.\n\nBy 1301, however, Boniface had a new plan: He called in Charles\nde Valois, powerful brother of die king of France, to help bring order\nto Tuscany. As Charles marched through northern Italy, and Florence\nseedied widi anxiety and fear, Dante quickly emerged as die man who\ncould rally\n\nTHE WOLVES AND THE SHEEP\n\nOnce upon a time, the wolves sent an embassy to the sheep,\ndesiring that there might be peace between them for the time to come.\n\u201cWhy,\u201d said they, \u201cshould we be for ever waging this deadly strife\nThose wicked dogs are the cause of all; they are incessantly barking at\nus, and provoking us. Send them away, and there will be no longer any\nobstacle to our eternal friendship and peace.\u201d The silly sheep listened,\nthe dogs were dismissed, and the flock, thus deprived of their best\nprotectors, became an easy prey to their treacherous enemy.\n\nFABLES,\n\nAesop,\n\nsixth century b.c.\n\n[Themistocles's] fellow citizens reached the point at which their\njealousy made them listen to any slander at his expense, and so [he]\nwas forced to remind the assembly of his achievements until they\ncould bear this no longer. He once said to those who were complaining\nof him: \u201cWhy are you tired of receiving benefits so often from the\nsame men\u201d Besides this he gave offense to the people when he built\nthe temple of Artemis, for not only did he style the goddess Artemis\nAristohoule, or Artemis wisest in counselwith the hint that it was he\nwho had given the best counsel to the Athenians and the Greeksbut he\nchose a site for it near his own house at Melite.... So at last the\nAthenians banished him. They made use of the ostracism to humble\nhis great reputation and his authority, as indeed was their habit with\nany whose power they regarded as oppressive, or who had risen to an\neminence which they considered out of keeping with the equality of a\ndemocracy.\n\nthe life of\n\nthemistocles,\n\nPlutarch,\n\nc. a.d. 46-120\n\nthe people, arguing vehemently against appeasement and working\ndesperately to arm the citizens and to organize resistance against die\npope and his puppet French prince. By hook or by crook, Boniface had\nto neutralize Dante. And so, even as on the one hand he threatened\nFlorence with Charles de Valois, on the other he held out the olive\nbranch, the possibility of negotiations, hoping Dante would take the\nbait. And indeed the Florentines decided to send a delegation to Rome\nand try to negotiate a peace. To head the mission, predictably, they\nchose Dante.\n\nSome warned the poet that the wily pope was setting up a trap to\nlure him away, but Dante went to Rome anyway, arriving as the French\narmy stood before the gates of Florence.

And once the Blacks stood firmly in\npower, the pope finally dismissed Dante from Rome.\n\nThe Blacks ordered Dante to return home to face accusations and\nstand trial. When the poet refused, the Blacks condemned him to be\nburned to death if he ever set foot in Florence again.

Queen Elizabedi's prime minister,\nRobert Cecil, had two main rivals: die queen's favorite, die Earl of\n\nEssex, and her former favorite, Sir Walter Raleigh. He contrived to\nsend them both on a mission against Spain; with them away from the\ncourt he managed to wrap his tentacles around die queen, secure his\nposition as her top adviser and weaken her affection for Raleigh and\nthe earl. The lesson here is twofold: First, your absence from the court\nspells danger for you, and you should never leave die scene in a time\nof turmoil, for your absence can botii symbolize and induce a loss of\npower; second, and on die odier hand, luring your enemies away from\nthe court at critical moments is a great ploy.\n\nIsolation has other strategic uses. When trying to seduce people, it\nis often wise to isolate them from dieir usual social context. Once\nisolated they are vulnerable to you, and your presence becomes\nmagnified. Similarly, con artists often look for ways to isolate their\nmarks from their normal social milieux, steering them into new\nenvironments in which diey are no longer comfortable. Here they feel\nweak, and succumb to deception more easily. Isolation, then, can prove\na powerful way of bringing people under your spell to seduce or\nswindle diem.\n\nYou will often find powerful people who have alienated\nthemselves from the group. Perhaps their power has gone to their\nheads, and they consider themselves superior; perhaps they have lost\nthe knack of communicating with ordinary folk. Remember: This\nmakes them vulnerable. Powerful though they be, people like diis can\nbe turned to use.\n\nThe monk Rasputin gained his power over Czar Nicholas and\nCzarina Alexandra of Russia through dieir tremendous isolation from\nthe people. Alexandra in particular was a foreigner, and especially\nalienated from everyday Russians; Rasputin used his peasant origins to\ninsinuate himself into her good graces, for she desperately wanted to\ncommunicate witii her subjects. Once in the court's inner circle,\nRasputin made himself indispensable and attained great power.\nHeading straight for the center, he aimed for die one figure in Russia\nwho commanded power (the czarina dominated her husband), and\nfound he had no need to isolate her for the work was already done. The\nRasputin strategy can bring you great power: Always search out\npeople who hold high positions yet who find tiiem-\n\nselves isolated on the board. They are like apples falling into your\nlap, easily seduced, and able to catapult you into power yourself.\n\nFinally, the reason you strike at the shepherd is because such an\naction will dishearten the sheep beyond any rational measure. When\nHernando Cortes and Francisco Pizarro led their tiny forces against the\nAztec and Incan empires, they did not make the mistake of fighting on\nseveral fronts, nor were they intimidated by die numbers arrayed\nagainst them; they captured the kings, Moctezuma and Atahualpa. Vast\nempires fell into tiieir hands. With die leader gone the center of gravity\nis gone; there is nothing to revolve around and everything falls apart.\nAim at the leaders, bring them down, and look for the endless\nopportunities in the confusion that will ensue.\n\nImage: A Flock of Fatted\n\nSheep. Do not waste precious\n\ntime trying to steal a sheep or two; do\n\nnot risk life and limb by setting upon\n\nthe dogs that guard the flock. Aim at the\n\nshepherd. Lure him away and the dogs\n\nwill follow. Strike him down and the flock will\n\nscatteryou can pick them off one by one.\n\nAuthority: If you draw a bow, draw the strongest. If you use an\narrow, use the longest. To shoot a rider, first shoot his horse. To catch a\ngang of bandits, first capture its leader. Just as a country has its border,\nso the killing of men has its limits. If the enemy's attack can be stopped\n[with a blow to the head], why have any more dead and wounded than\nnecessary (Chinese poet Tu Fu, Tang dynasty, eighth century)\n\nREVERSAL\n\n\u201cAny harm you do to a man should be done in such a way mat\nyou need not fear his revenge,\u201d writes Machiavelli. If you act to isolate\nyour enemy, make sure he lacks the means to repay the favor. If you\napply this Law, in other words, apply it from a position of superiority,\nso that you have nothing to fear from his resentment.\n\nAndrew Johnson, Abraham Lincoln's successor as U.S. president,\nsaw Ulysses S. Grant as a troublesome member of his government. So\nhe isolated Grant, as a prelude to forcing him out. This only enraged\nthe great general, however, who responded by forming a support base\nin the Republican party and going on to become the next president. It\n\n\nwould have been far wiser to keep a man like Grant in the fold, where\nhe could do less harm, than to make him revengeful. And so you may\noften find it better to keep people on your side, where you can watch\nthem, than to risk creating an angry enemy. Keeping them close, you\ncan secretly whit-tie away at their support base, so that when the time\ncomes to cut them loose they will fall fast and hard without knowing\nwhat hit them.\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Below is an excerpt from my book titled '48 Laws of Power', specifically from Chapter '48 Laws of Power', Section 'LAW 43'. The original text is: 'WORK ON THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF OTHERS\n\nJUDGMENT\n\nCoercion creates a reaction that will eventually work against you.\nYou must seduce others into wanting to move in your direction. A\nperson you have seduced becomes your loyal pawn. And the way to\nseduce others is to operate on their individual psychologies and\nweaknesses. Soften up the resistant by working on their emotions,\nplaying on what they hold dear and what they fear. Ignore the hearts\nand minds of others and they will grow to hate you.\n\nThinking of the means by which he could most effectively\npersuade the Persians to revolt, [Cyrus's] deliberations led him to adopt\nthe following plan, which he found best suited to his purpose. He\nwrote on a roll of parchment that Astyages had appointed him to\ncommand the Persian army; then he summoned an assembly of the\nPersians, opened the roll in their presence and read out what he had\nwritten. \u201cAnd now, he added, I have an order for you: every man is to\nappear on parade with a billhook. ...\u201d The order was obeyed. All the\nmen assembled with their billhooks, and Cyrus's next command was\nthai before the day was out they should clear a certain piece of rough\nland full of thorn-bushes, about eighteen or twenty furlongs square.\nThis too was done, whereupon Cyrus issued the further order that they\nshould present themselves again on the following day, after having\ntaken a bath. Meanwhile, Cyrus collected and slaughtered all his\nfather's goats, sheep, and oxen in preparation for entertaining the\nwhole Persian army at a banquet, together with the best wine and bread\nhe could procure. The next day the guests assembled, and were\n\nTRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW.\n\nNear the end of the reign of Louis XV, all of France seemed\ndesperate for change. When the king's grandson and chosen successor,\ndie future Louis XVI, married the fifteen-year-old daughter of die\nempress of Austria, die French caught a glimpse of die future diat\n\nseemed hopeful. The young bride, Marie-Antoinette, was beautiful and\n\u2018ull of life. She instantiy changed the mood of die court, which was\nrank with Louis XV's debaucheries; even the common people, who had\nyet to see her, talked excitedly of Marie-Antoinette. The French had\ngrown disgusted widi the series of mistresses who had dominated\nLouis XV, and diey looked forward to serving dieir new queen. In\n773, when Marie-Antoinette publicly rode through the streets of Paris\nor the first time, applauding crowds swarmed around her carriage.\n\u201cHow fortunate,\u201d she wrote her mother, \u201cto be in a position in which\none can gain widespread affection at so littie cost.\u201d\nIn 1774 Louis XV died and Louis XVI took the tiirone. As soon\nas Marie-Antoinette became queen she abandoned herself to die\npleasures she loved die mostordering and wearing die most expensive\ngowns and jewelry in die realm; sporting die most elaborate hair in\nhistory, her sculpted coiffures rising as much as diree feet above her\nhead; and dirowing a constant succession of masked balls and fetes.\nAll of these whims she paid for on credit, never concerning herself\nwidi die cost or who paid die bills.\n\nMarie-Antoinette's greatest pleasure was the creation and\ndesigning of a private Garden of Eden at die Petit Trianon, a chateau\non die grounds of Versailles with its own woods. The gardens at die\nPetit Trianon were to be as \u201cnatural\u201d as possible, including moss\napplied by hand to the trees and rocks. To heighten the pastoral effect,\nthe queen employed peasant milkmaids to milk die finest-looking cows\nin the realm; launderers and cheese-makers in special peasant outfits\nshe helped design; shepherds to tend sheep with silk ribbons around\ntheir necks. When she inspected die barns, she would watch her\nmilkmaids squeezing milk into porcelain vases made at the royal\nceramic works. To pass die time, Marie-Antoinette would gatiier\nflowers in the woods around die Petit Trianon, or watch her \u201cgood\npeasants\u201d doing tiieir \u201cchores.\u201d The place became a separate world, its\ncommunity limited to her chosen favorites.\n\nWidi each new whim, the cost of maintaining the Petit Trianon\nsoared. Meanwhile, France itself was deteriorating: There was famine\nand widespread discontent. Even socially insulated courtiers seemed\nwith resentmentdie queen treated them like children. Only her\nfavorites mattered, and diese were becoming fewer and fewer. But\n\n\nMarie-Antoinette did not concern herself widi this. Not once\nthroughout her reign did she read a minister's report. Not once did she\ntour die provinces and rally the people to her side. Not once did she\nmingle among die Parisians, or receive a delegation from diem. She\ndid none of tiiese tilings because as queen she felt die people owed her\ntheir affection, and she was not required to love diem in return.\nIn 1784 die queen became embroiled in a scandal. As part of an\nelaborate swindle, die most expensive diamond necklace in Europe\nhad been\npurchased under her name, and during the swindlers' trial her\nlavish lifestyle became public: People heard about the money she spent\non jewels and dresses and masked dances. They gave her the nickname\n\u201cMadame Deficit,\u201d and from then on she became the focus of the\npeople's growing resentment. When she appeared in her box at the\nopera the audience greeted her witii hisses. Even the court turned\nagainst her. For while she had been running up her huge expenditures,\nthe country was headed for ruin.\nFive years later, in 1789, an unprecedented event took place: the\nbeginning of die French Revolution. The queen did not worrylet the\npeople have dieir Uttle rebellion, she seemed to think; it would soon\nquiet down and she would be able to resume her life of pleasure. That\nyear die people marched on Versailles, forcing the royal family to quit\nthe palace and take residence in Paris. This was a triumph for die\nrebels, but it offered die queen an opportunity to heal the wounds she\nhad opened and establish contact witii die people. The queen, however,\nhad not learned her lesson: Not once would she leave the palace during\nher stay in Paris. Her subjects could rot in hell for all she cared.\nIn 1792 the royal couple was moved from the palace to a prison,\nas the revolution officially declared die end of die monarchy. The\nollowing year Louis XVI was tried, found guilty, and guillotined. As\nMarie-Antoinette awaited die same fate, hardly a soul came to her\ndefensenot one of her former friends in die court, not one of Europe's\nodier monarchs (who, as members of dieir own countries\u2019 royal\namilies, had all die reason in die world to show that revolution did not\npay), not even her own family in Austria, including her brother, who\nnow Sat on the throne. She had become the world's pariah. In October\n\n\nof 1793, she finally knelt at the guillotine, unrepentant and defiant to\ndie bitter end.\n\nInterpretation\n\nFrom early on, Marie-Antoinette acquired the most dangerous of\nattitudes: As a young princess in Austria she was endlessly flattered\nand cajoled. As die future queen of the French court she was the center\nof everyone's attention. She never learned to charm or please other\npeople, to become attuned to dieir individual psychologies. She never\nhad to work to get her way, to use calculation or cunning or die arts of\npersuasion. And like everyone who is indulged from an early age, she\nevolved into a monster of in-sensitivity.\n\nMarie-Antoinette became the focus of an entire country's\ndissatisfaction because it is so infuriating to meet with a person who\nmakes no effort to seduce you or attempt to persuade you, even if only\nfor die purpose of deception. And do not imagine diat she represents a\nbygone era, or diat she is even rare. Her type is today more common\nthan ever. Such types live in dieir own bubbletiiey seem to feel tiiey\nare born kings and queens, and that attention is owed them. They do\nnot consider anyone else's nature, but bulldoze over people with the\nself-righteous arrogance of a Marie-Antoinette. Pampered and\nindulged as children, as adults tiiey still believe\n\ntold to sit down on the grass and enjoy themselves. After the meal\nCyrus asked them which they preferred yesterday's work or today's\namusement; and they replied that it was indeed a far cry from the\nprevious day's misery to their present pleasures. This was the answer\nwhich Cyrus wanted; he seized upon it at once and proceeded to lay\nbare what he had in mind. \u201cMen of Persia,\u201d he said, \u201clisten to me: obey\nmy orders, and you will be able to enjoy a thousand pleasures as good\nas this without ever turning your hands to menial labor; but, if you\ndisobey, yesterday 's task will be the pattern of innumerable others you\nwill be forced to perform. Take my advice and win your freedom. 1 am\nthe man destined to undertake your liberation, and it is my belief that\nyou are a match for the Medes in war as in everything else. It is the\ntruth I tell you. Do not delay, but fling off the yoke of Astyages at\nonce.\u201d\n\nThe Persians had long resented their subjection to the Medes. At\nlast they had found a leader, and welcomed with enthusiasm the\n\nprospect of liberty... On the present occasion the Persians under Cyrus\n\nrose against the Medes and from then onwards were masters of Asia.\nthe histories, Herodotus, fifth century b.c..\nTUK\nThe north wind and the\nsun were disputing\nwhich was the stronger,\nand agreed to\nacknowledge as the\nvictor whichever of\nthem could strip a\ntraveler of his clothing.\nThe wind tried first.\nBut its violent gusts\nonly made the man\nhold his clothes tightly\naround him, and when\nit blew harder still the\ncold made him so\nuncomfortable that he\nput on an extra wrap.\nEventually the wind\ngot tired of it and\nhanded him over to the\nsun.

At all times\nyou must attend to those around you, gauging their particular\npsychology, tailoring your words to what you know will entice and\nseduce them. This requires energy and art. The higher your station, the\ngreater the need to remain attuned to the hearts and minds of those\nbelow you, creating a base of support to maintain you at the pinnacle.\nWithout that base, your power will teeter, and at the slightest change of\nfortune those below will gladly assist in your fall from grace.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nIn A.D. 225, Chuko Liang, master strategist and chief minister to\nthe ruler of Shu in ancient China, confronted a dangerous situation.\nThe kingdom of Wei had mounted an all-out attack on Shu from the\nnorth. More dangerous still, Wei had formed an alliance with the\nbarbarous states to the south of Shu, led by King Menghuo. Chuko\nLiang had to deal with this second menace from the south before he\ncould hope to fend off Wei in the north.\n\nAs Chuko Liang prepared to march south against the barbarians, a\nwise man in his camp offered him advice. It would be impossible, this\nman said, to pacify the region by force. Liang would probably beat\nMenghuo, but as soon as he headed north again to deal with Wei,\nMenghuo would reinvade. \u201cIt is better to win hearts,\u201d said the wise\nman, \u201cthan cities; better to battie with hearts than with weapons. I hope\nyou will succeed in winning the hearts of these people.\u201d \u201cYou read my\nthoughts,\u201d responded Chuko Liang.\n\nAs Liang expected, Menghuo launched a powerful attack. But\nLiang laid a trap and managed to capture a large part of Menghuo's\narmy, including the king himself. Instead of punishing or executing his\nprisoners, however, he separated the soldiers from their king, had their\nshackles removed, regaled them with food and wine, and then\naddressed them. \u201cYou are all upright men,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe you all\nhave parents, wives, and children waiting for you at home. They are\ndoubtless shedding bitter tears at your fate. I am going to release you,\nso that you can return home to your loved ones and comfort them.\u201d\nThe men thanked Liang with tears in their eyes; then he sent for\n\nMenghuo. \u201cIf I release you,\u201d asked Liang, \u201cwhat will you do\u201d \u201cI will\npull my army together again,\u201d answered the king, \u201cand lead it against\nyou to a decisive battle. But if you capture me a second time, I will\nbow to your superiority.\u201d Not only did Liang order Menghuo released,\nhe gave him a gift of a horse and saddle. When angry lieutenants\nwondered why he did this, Liang told them, \u201cI can capture that man as\neasily as I can take something out of my pocket. I am trying to win his\nheart. When I do, peace will come of itself here in the south.\u201d\n\nAs Menghuo had said he would, he attacked again. But his own\nofficers, whom Liang had treated so well, rebelled against him,\ncaptured him, and turned him over to Liang, who asked him again die\nsame question as\n\nbefore. Menghuo replied that he had not been beaten fairly, but\nmerely betrayed by his own officers; he would fight again, but if\ncaptured a third time he would bow to Liang's superiority.\n\nOver the following months Liang outwitted Menghuo again and\nagain, capturing him a third, a fourth, and a fifth time. On each\noccasion Meng-huo's troops grew more dissatisfied. Liang had treated\nmem with respect; they had lost their heart for fighting. But every time\nChuko Liang asked Menghuo to yield, the great king would come up\nwith another excuse: You tricked me, I lost through bad luck, on and\non. If you capture me again, he would promise, I swear I will not\nbetray you. And so Liang would let him go.\n\nWhen he captured Menghuo for the sixth time, he asked the king\nthe same question again. \u201cIf you capture me a sevendi time,\u201d die king\nreplied, \u201cI shall give you my loyalty and never rebel again.\u201d \u201cVery\nwell,\u201d said Liang. \u201cBut if I capture you again, I will not release you.\u201d\n\nNow Menghuo and his soldiers fled to a far corner of their\nkingdom, the region of Wuge. Defeated so many times, Menghuo had\nonly one hope left: He would ask the help of King Wutugu of Wuge,\nwho had an immense and ferocious army. Wutugu's warriors wore an\narmor of tightly woven vines soaked in oil, then dried to an\nimpenetrable hardness. Wifh Menghuo at his side, Wutugu marched\ndiis mighty army against Liang, and this time the great strategist\nseemed frightened, leading his men in a hurried retreat. But he was\nmerely leading Wutugu into a trap: He cornered the king's men in a\nnarrow valley, then lit fires set all around them. When the fires reached\n\nthe soldiers Wutugu's whole army burst into flamethe oil in their\narmor, of course, being highly flammable. All of them perished.\n\nLiang had managed to separate Menghuo and his entourage from\nthe carnage in the valley, and the king found himself a captive for the\nseventh time. After this slaughter Liang could not bear to face his\nprisoner again. He sent a messenger to the captured king: \u201cHe has\ncommissioned me to release you. Mobilize another army against him,\nif you can, and try once more to defeat him.\u201d Sobbing, the king fell to\nthe ground, crawled to Liang on his hands and knees, and prostrated\nhimself at his feet. \u201cOh great minister,\u201d cried Menghuo, \u201cyours is the\nmajesty of Heaven. We men of the south will never again offer\nresistance to your rule.\u201d \u201cDo you now yield\u201d asked Liang. \u201cI, my sons,\nand my grandsons are deeply moved by Your Honor's boundless, life-\ngiving mercy. How could we not yield\u201d\n\nLiang honored Menghuo with a great banquet, reestablished him\non the throne, restored his conquered lands to his rule, then returned\nnorth with his army, leaving no occupying force. Liang never came\nbackhe had no need to: Menghuo had become his most devoted and\nunshakable ally.\n\nInterpretation\n\nChuko Liang had two options: Try to defeat the barbarians in the\nsouth with one crushing blow, or patiendy and slowly win them to his\nside over time. Most people more powerful man their enemy grab the\nfirst option and never consider die second, but the truly powerful think\nfar ahead: The\n\nThe men who have changed the universe have never gotten there\nby working on leaders, but rather by moving the masses. Working on\nleaders is the method of intrigue and only leads to secondary results.\nWorking on the masses, however, is the stroke of genius that changes\nthe face of the world.\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte, 1769-1821\n\nThis long and painful pursuit of Dariusfor in eleven days he\nmarched 33 hundred furlongsharassed his soldiers so that most of them\nwere ready to give it up, chiefly for want of water. While they were in\nthis distress, it happened that some Macedonians who had fetched\nwater in skins upon their mules from a river they had found out came\nabout noon to the place where Alexander was, and seeing him almost\n\nchoked with thirst, presently filled a helmet and offered it him.... Then\nhe took the helmet into his hands, and looking round about, when he\nsaw all those who were near him stretching their heads out and looking\nearnestly after the drink, he returned it again with thanks\n\nwithout tasting a drop of it. \u201cFor,\u201dsaid he, \u201cif I alone should drink,\nthe rest will be out of heart.\u201d The soldiers no sooner took notice of his\ntemperance and magnanimity upon this occasion, but they one and all\ncried out to him to lead them forward boldly, and began whipping on\ntheir horses. For whilst they had such a king they said they defied both\nweariness and thirst, and looked upon themselves to be little less than\nimmortal.\n\nthe life of\n\nalexander tiik great,\n\nPlutarch,\n\nc. a. n. 46-120\n\nfirst option may be quick and easy, but over time it brews ugly\nemotions in the hearts of the vanquished.

Our kingdoms lay in each man's\n\nmind.\nSeven Pillars ofWisdom, T. E. Lawrence, 1888-1935\nKEYS TO POWER\nIn the game of power, you are surrounded by people who have\nabsolutely no reason to help you unless it is in their interest to do so.\n\nAnd if you have nothing to offer their self-interest, you are likely to\nmake them hostile, for tfiey will see in you just one more competitor,\none more waster of their time. Those that overcome this prevailing\ncoldness are the ones who find the key that unlocks the stranger's heart\nand mind, seducing him into their corner, if necessary softening him\nup for a punch. But most people never learn this side of die game.\nWhen they meet someone new, rather than stepping back and probing\nto see what makes this person unique, they talk about themselves,\neager to impose their own willpower and prejudices. They argue,\nboast, and make a show of their power. They may not know it but they\nare secretly creating an enemy, a resister, because there is no more\ninfuriating feeling than having your individuality ignored, your own\npsychology unacknowledged. It makes you feel lifeless and resentful.\n\nRemember: The key to persuasion is softening people up and\nbreaking them down, gently. Seduce them with a two-pronged\napproach: Work on their emotions and play on their intellectual\nweaknesses. Be alert to both what separates them from everyone else\n(their individual psychology) and what they share with everyone else\n(their basic emotional responses). Aim at the primary emotionslove,\nhate, jealousy. Once you move their emotions you have reduced their\ncontrol, making them more vulnerable to persuasion.\n\nWhen Chuko Liang wanted to dissuade an important general of a\nrival kingdom from entering into an alliance with Ts'ao Ts'ao, Liang's\ndreaded enemy, he did not detail Ts'ao Ts'ao's cruelty, or attack him on\nmoral grounds. Instead Liang suggested that Ts'ao Ts'ao was really\nafter the gen-\n\neral's beautiful young wife. This hit die general in the gut, and\nwon him over. Mao Tse-tung similarly always appealed to popular\nemotions, and spoke in the simplest terms. Educated and well-read\nhimself, in his speeches he used visceral metaphors, voicing the\npublic's deepest anxieties and encouraging diem to vent meir\nfrustrations in public meetings. Radier than arguing die practical\naspects of a particular program, he would describe how it would affect\nthem on die most primitive, down-to-earth level. Do not believe diat\ndiis approach works only with die illiterate and unschooledit works on\none and all. All of us are mortal and face the same dreadful fate, and\n\n\nall of us share die desire for attachment and belonging. Stir up these\nemotions and you captivate our hearts.\n\nThe best way to do this is with a dramatic jolt, of the kind that\nChuko Liang created when he fed and released prisoners who expected\nonly the worst from him. Shaking diem to the core, he softened their\nhearts. Play on contrasts like this: Push people to despair, dien give\nthem relief. If diey expect pain and you give them pleasure, you win\nmeir hearts. Creating pleasure of any kind, in fact, will usually bring\nyou success, as will allaying fears and providing or promising security.\n\nSymbolic gestures are often enough to win sympadiy and\ngoodwill. A gesture of self-sacrifice, for examplea show that you\nsuffer as those around you dowill make people identify witii you, even\nif your suffering is symbolic or minor and dieirs is real. When you\nenter a group, make a gesture of goodwill; soften the group up for the\nharsher actions that will follow later.\n\nWhen T. E. Lawrence was fighting the Turks in die deserts of die\nMiddle East during World War I, he had an epiphany: It seemed to him\nthat conventional warfare had lost its value. The old-fashioned soldier\nwas lost in the enormous armies of the time, in which he was ordered\nabout like a lifeless pawn. Lawrence wanted to turn this around. For\nhim, every soldier's mind was a kingdom he had to conquer. A\ncommitted, psychologically motivated soldier would fight harder and\nmore creatively than a puppet.\n\nLawrence's perception is still more true in die world today, where\nso many of us feel alienated, anonymous, and suspicious of authority,\nall of which makes overt power plays and force even more\ncounterproductive and dangerous. Instead of manipulating lifeless\npawns, make mose on your side convinced and excited by die cause\nyou have enlisted diem in; this will not only make your work easier but\nit will also give you more leeway to deceive tilem later on. And to\naccomplish diis you need to deal with tiieir individual psychologies.\nNever clumsily assume that the tactic that worked on one person will\nnecessarily work on anodier. To find tile key diat will motivate diem,\nfirst get tiiem to open up. The more they talk, die more they reveal\nabout their likes and dislikesdie handles and levers to move diem widi.\n\nThe quickest way to secure people's minds is by demonstrating, as\nsimply as possible, how an action will benefit them. Self-interest is the\n\nstrongest motive of all: A great cause may capture minds, but\nonce die first flush of excitement is over, interest will flagunless there\nis something to be gained. Self-interest is the solider foundation. The\ncauses that work best use a noble veneer to cover a blatant appeal to\nself-interest; the cause seduces but the self-interest secures the deal.\n\nThe people who are best at appealing to people's minds are often\nartists, intellectuals, and those of a more poetic nature. This is because\nideas are most easily communicated through metaphors and imagery. It\nis always good policy, men, to have in your pocket at least one artist or\nintellectual who can appeal concretely to people's minds. Kings have\nalways kept a stable of writers in meir barn: Frederick the Great had\nhis Voltaire (until tiiey quarreled and separated), Napoleon won over\nGoethe. Conversely, Napoleon III's alienation of writers such as Victor\nHugo, whom he exiled from France, contributed to his growing\nunpopularity and eventual downfall. It is dangerous, then, to alienate\nthose who have powers of expression, and useful to pacify and exploit\nthem.\n\nFinally, learn to play the numbers game. The wider your support\nbase the stronger your power. Understanding that one alienated,\ndisaffected soul can spark a blaze of discontent, Louis XIV made sure\nto endear himself to die lowest members of his staff.

He\nwrote on a roll of parchment that Astyages had appointed him to\ncommand the Persian army; then he summoned an assembly of the\nPersians, opened the roll in their presence and read out what he had\nwritten. \u201cAnd now, he added, I have an order for you: every man is to\nappear on parade with a billhook. ...\u201d The order was obeyed. All the\nmen assembled with their billhooks, and Cyrus's next command was\nthai before the day was out they should clear a certain piece of rough\nland full of thorn-bushes, about eighteen or twenty furlongs square.\nThis too was done, whereupon Cyrus issued the further order that they\nshould present themselves again on the following day, after having\ntaken a bath. Meanwhile, Cyrus collected and slaughtered all his\nfather's goats, sheep, and oxen in preparation for entertaining the\nwhole Persian army at a banquet, together with the best wine and bread\nhe could procure. The next day the guests assembled, and were\n\nTRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW.\n\nNear the end of the reign of Louis XV, all of France seemed\ndesperate for change. When the king's grandson and chosen successor,\ndie future Louis XVI, married the fifteen-year-old daughter of die\nempress of Austria, die French caught a glimpse of die future diat\n\nseemed hopeful. The young bride, Marie-Antoinette, was beautiful and\n\u2018ull of life. She instantiy changed the mood of die court, which was\nrank with Louis XV's debaucheries; even the common people, who had\nyet to see her, talked excitedly of Marie-Antoinette. The French had\ngrown disgusted widi the series of mistresses who had dominated\nLouis XV, and diey looked forward to serving dieir new queen. In\n773, when Marie-Antoinette publicly rode through the streets of Paris\nor the first time, applauding crowds swarmed around her carriage.\n\u201cHow fortunate,\u201d she wrote her mother, \u201cto be in a position in which\none can gain widespread affection at so littie cost.\u201d\nIn 1774 Louis XV died and Louis XVI took the tiirone. As soon\nas Marie-Antoinette became queen she abandoned herself to die\npleasures she loved die mostordering and wearing die most expensive\ngowns and jewelry in die realm; sporting die most elaborate hair in\nhistory, her sculpted coiffures rising as much as diree feet above her\nhead; and dirowing a constant succession of masked balls and fetes.\nAll of these whims she paid for on credit, never concerning herself\nwidi die cost or who paid die bills.\n\nMarie-Antoinette's greatest pleasure was the creation and\ndesigning of a private Garden of Eden at die Petit Trianon, a chateau\non die grounds of Versailles with its own woods. The gardens at die\nPetit Trianon were to be as \u201cnatural\u201d as possible, including moss\napplied by hand to the trees and rocks. To heighten the pastoral effect,\nthe queen employed peasant milkmaids to milk die finest-looking cows\nin the realm; launderers and cheese-makers in special peasant outfits\nshe helped design; shepherds to tend sheep with silk ribbons around\ntheir necks. When she inspected die barns, she would watch her\nmilkmaids squeezing milk into porcelain vases made at the royal\nceramic works. To pass die time, Marie-Antoinette would gatiier\nflowers in the woods around die Petit Trianon, or watch her \u201cgood\npeasants\u201d doing tiieir \u201cchores.\u201d The place became a separate world, its\ncommunity limited to her chosen favorites.\n\nWidi each new whim, the cost of maintaining the Petit Trianon\nsoared. Meanwhile, France itself was deteriorating: There was famine\nand widespread discontent. Even socially insulated courtiers seemed\nwith resentmentdie queen treated them like children. Only her\nfavorites mattered, and diese were becoming fewer and fewer. But\n\n\nMarie-Antoinette did not concern herself widi this. Not once\nthroughout her reign did she read a minister's report. Not once did she\ntour die provinces and rally the people to her side. Not once did she\nmingle among die Parisians, or receive a delegation from diem. She\ndid none of tiiese tilings because as queen she felt die people owed her\ntheir affection, and she was not required to love diem in return.\nIn 1784 die queen became embroiled in a scandal. As part of an\nelaborate swindle, die most expensive diamond necklace in Europe\nhad been\npurchased under her name, and during the swindlers' trial her\nlavish lifestyle became public: People heard about the money she spent\non jewels and dresses and masked dances. They gave her the nickname\n\u201cMadame Deficit,\u201d and from then on she became the focus of the\npeople's growing resentment. When she appeared in her box at the\nopera the audience greeted her witii hisses. Even the court turned\nagainst her. For while she had been running up her huge expenditures,\nthe country was headed for ruin.\nFive years later, in 1789, an unprecedented event took place: the\nbeginning of die French Revolution. The queen did not worrylet the\npeople have dieir Uttle rebellion, she seemed to think; it would soon\nquiet down and she would be able to resume her life of pleasure. That\nyear die people marched on Versailles, forcing the royal family to quit\nthe palace and take residence in Paris. This was a triumph for die\nrebels, but it offered die queen an opportunity to heal the wounds she\nhad opened and establish contact witii die people. The queen, however,\nhad not learned her lesson: Not once would she leave the palace during\nher stay in Paris. Her subjects could rot in hell for all she cared.\nIn 1792 the royal couple was moved from the palace to a prison,\nas the revolution officially declared die end of die monarchy. The\nollowing year Louis XVI was tried, found guilty, and guillotined. As\nMarie-Antoinette awaited die same fate, hardly a soul came to her\ndefensenot one of her former friends in die court, not one of Europe's\nodier monarchs (who, as members of dieir own countries\u2019 royal\namilies, had all die reason in die world to show that revolution did not\npay), not even her own family in Austria, including her brother, who\nnow Sat on the throne. She had become the world's pariah. In October\n\n\nof 1793, she finally knelt at the guillotine, unrepentant and defiant to\ndie bitter end.\n\nInterpretation\n\nFrom early on, Marie-Antoinette acquired the most dangerous of\nattitudes: As a young princess in Austria she was endlessly flattered\nand cajoled. As die future queen of the French court she was the center\nof everyone's attention. She never learned to charm or please other\npeople, to become attuned to dieir individual psychologies. She never\nhad to work to get her way, to use calculation or cunning or die arts of\npersuasion. And like everyone who is indulged from an early age, she\nevolved into a monster of in-sensitivity.\n\nMarie-Antoinette became the focus of an entire country's\ndissatisfaction because it is so infuriating to meet with a person who\nmakes no effort to seduce you or attempt to persuade you, even if only\nfor die purpose of deception. And do not imagine diat she represents a\nbygone era, or diat she is even rare. Her type is today more common\nthan ever. Such types live in dieir own bubbletiiey seem to feel tiiey\nare born kings and queens, and that attention is owed them. They do\nnot consider anyone else's nature, but bulldoze over people with the\nself-righteous arrogance of a Marie-Antoinette. Pampered and\nindulged as children, as adults tiiey still believe\n\ntold to sit down on the grass and enjoy themselves. After the meal\nCyrus asked them which they preferred yesterday's work or today's\namusement; and they replied that it was indeed a far cry from the\nprevious day's misery to their present pleasures. This was the answer\nwhich Cyrus wanted; he seized upon it at once and proceeded to lay\nbare what he had in mind. \u201cMen of Persia,\u201d he said, \u201clisten to me: obey\nmy orders, and you will be able to enjoy a thousand pleasures as good\nas this without ever turning your hands to menial labor; but, if you\ndisobey, yesterday 's task will be the pattern of innumerable others you\nwill be forced to perform.

It is the\ntruth I tell you. Do not delay, but fling off the yoke of Astyages at\nonce.\u201d\n\nThe Persians had long resented their subjection to the Medes. At\nlast they had found a leader, and welcomed with enthusiasm the\n\nprospect of liberty... On the present occasion the Persians under Cyrus\n\nrose against the Medes and from then onwards were masters of Asia.\nthe histories, Herodotus, fifth century b.c..\nTUK\nThe north wind and the\nsun were disputing\nwhich was the stronger,\nand agreed to\nacknowledge as the\nvictor whichever of\nthem could strip a\ntraveler of his clothing.\nThe wind tried first.\nBut its violent gusts\nonly made the man\nhold his clothes tightly\naround him, and when\nit blew harder still the\ncold made him so\nuncomfortable that he\nput on an extra wrap.\nEventually the wind\ngot tired of it and\nhanded him over to the\nsun.

More dangerous still, Wei had formed an alliance with the\nbarbarous states to the south of Shu, led by King Menghuo. Chuko\nLiang had to deal with this second menace from the south before he\ncould hope to fend off Wei in the north.\n\nAs Chuko Liang prepared to march south against the barbarians, a\nwise man in his camp offered him advice. It would be impossible, this\nman said, to pacify the region by force. Liang would probably beat\nMenghuo, but as soon as he headed north again to deal with Wei,\nMenghuo would reinvade. \u201cIt is better to win hearts,\u201d said the wise\nman, \u201cthan cities; better to battie with hearts than with weapons. I hope\nyou will succeed in winning the hearts of these people.\u201d \u201cYou read my\nthoughts,\u201d responded Chuko Liang.\n\nAs Liang expected, Menghuo launched a powerful attack. But\nLiang laid a trap and managed to capture a large part of Menghuo's\narmy, including the king himself. Instead of punishing or executing his\nprisoners, however, he separated the soldiers from their king, had their\nshackles removed, regaled them with food and wine, and then\naddressed them. \u201cYou are all upright men,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe you all\nhave parents, wives, and children waiting for you at home. They are\ndoubtless shedding bitter tears at your fate. I am going to release you,\nso that you can return home to your loved ones and comfort them.\u201d\nThe men thanked Liang with tears in their eyes; then he sent for\n\nMenghuo. \u201cIf I release you,\u201d asked Liang, \u201cwhat will you do\u201d \u201cI will\npull my army together again,\u201d answered the king, \u201cand lead it against\nyou to a decisive battle. But if you capture me a second time, I will\nbow to your superiority.\u201d Not only did Liang order Menghuo released,\nhe gave him a gift of a horse and saddle. When angry lieutenants\nwondered why he did this, Liang told them, \u201cI can capture that man as\neasily as I can take something out of my pocket. I am trying to win his\nheart. When I do, peace will come of itself here in the south.\u201d\n\nAs Menghuo had said he would, he attacked again. But his own\nofficers, whom Liang had treated so well, rebelled against him,\ncaptured him, and turned him over to Liang, who asked him again die\nsame question as\n\nbefore. Menghuo replied that he had not been beaten fairly, but\nmerely betrayed by his own officers; he would fight again, but if\ncaptured a third time he would bow to Liang's superiority.\n\nOver the following months Liang outwitted Menghuo again and\nagain, capturing him a third, a fourth, and a fifth time. On each\noccasion Meng-huo's troops grew more dissatisfied. Liang had treated\nmem with respect; they had lost their heart for fighting. But every time\nChuko Liang asked Menghuo to yield, the great king would come up\nwith another excuse: You tricked me, I lost through bad luck, on and\non. If you capture me again, he would promise, I swear I will not\nbetray you. And so Liang would let him go.\n\nWhen he captured Menghuo for the sixth time, he asked the king\nthe same question again. \u201cIf you capture me a sevendi time,\u201d die king\nreplied, \u201cI shall give you my loyalty and never rebel again.\u201d \u201cVery\nwell,\u201d said Liang. \u201cBut if I capture you again, I will not release you.\u201d\n\nNow Menghuo and his soldiers fled to a far corner of their\nkingdom, the region of Wuge. Defeated so many times, Menghuo had\nonly one hope left: He would ask the help of King Wutugu of Wuge,\nwho had an immense and ferocious army. Wutugu's warriors wore an\narmor of tightly woven vines soaked in oil, then dried to an\nimpenetrable hardness. Wifh Menghuo at his side, Wutugu marched\ndiis mighty army against Liang, and this time the great strategist\nseemed frightened, leading his men in a hurried retreat. But he was\nmerely leading Wutugu into a trap: He cornered the king's men in a\nnarrow valley, then lit fires set all around them. When the fires reached\n\nthe soldiers Wutugu's whole army burst into flamethe oil in their\narmor, of course, being highly flammable. All of them perished.\n\nLiang had managed to separate Menghuo and his entourage from\nthe carnage in the valley, and the king found himself a captive for the\nseventh time. After this slaughter Liang could not bear to face his\nprisoner again. He sent a messenger to the captured king: \u201cHe has\ncommissioned me to release you. Mobilize another army against him,\nif you can, and try once more to defeat him.\u201d Sobbing, the king fell to\nthe ground, crawled to Liang on his hands and knees, and prostrated\nhimself at his feet. \u201cOh great minister,\u201d cried Menghuo, \u201cyours is the\nmajesty of Heaven. We men of the south will never again offer\nresistance to your rule.\u201d \u201cDo you now yield\u201d asked Liang. \u201cI, my sons,\nand my grandsons are deeply moved by Your Honor's boundless, life-\ngiving mercy. How could we not yield\u201d\n\nLiang honored Menghuo with a great banquet, reestablished him\non the throne, restored his conquered lands to his rule, then returned\nnorth with his army, leaving no occupying force. Liang never came\nbackhe had no need to: Menghuo had become his most devoted and\nunshakable ally.\n\nInterpretation\n\nChuko Liang had two options: Try to defeat the barbarians in the\nsouth with one crushing blow, or patiendy and slowly win them to his\nside over time. Most people more powerful man their enemy grab the\nfirst option and never consider die second, but the truly powerful think\nfar ahead: The\n\nThe men who have changed the universe have never gotten there\nby working on leaders, but rather by moving the masses. Working on\nleaders is the method of intrigue and only leads to secondary results.\nWorking on the masses, however, is the stroke of genius that changes\nthe face of the world.\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte, 1769-1821\n\nThis long and painful pursuit of Dariusfor in eleven days he\nmarched 33 hundred furlongsharassed his soldiers so that most of them\nwere ready to give it up, chiefly for want of water. While they were in\nthis distress, it happened that some Macedonians who had fetched\nwater in skins upon their mules from a river they had found out came\nabout noon to the place where Alexander was, and seeing him almost\n\nchoked with thirst, presently filled a helmet and offered it him.... Then\nhe took the helmet into his hands, and looking round about, when he\nsaw all those who were near him stretching their heads out and looking\nearnestly after the drink, he returned it again with thanks\n\nwithout tasting a drop of it. \u201cFor,\u201dsaid he, \u201cif I alone should drink,\nthe rest will be out of heart.\u201d The soldiers no sooner took notice of his\ntemperance and magnanimity upon this occasion, but they one and all\ncried out to him to lead them forward boldly, and began whipping on\ntheir horses. For whilst they had such a king they said they defied both\nweariness and thirst, and looked upon themselves to be little less than\nimmortal.\n\nthe life of\n\nalexander tiik great,\n\nPlutarch,\n\nc. a. n. 46-120\n\nfirst option may be quick and easy, but over time it brews ugly\nemotions in the hearts of the vanquished.

Our kingdoms lay in each man's\n\nmind.\nSeven Pillars ofWisdom, T. E. Lawrence, 1888-1935\nKEYS TO POWER\nIn the game of power, you are surrounded by people who have\nabsolutely no reason to help you unless it is in their interest to do so.\n\nAnd if you have nothing to offer their self-interest, you are likely to\nmake them hostile, for tfiey will see in you just one more competitor,\none more waster of their time. Those that overcome this prevailing\ncoldness are the ones who find the key that unlocks the stranger's heart\nand mind, seducing him into their corner, if necessary softening him\nup for a punch. But most people never learn this side of die game.\nWhen they meet someone new, rather than stepping back and probing\nto see what makes this person unique, they talk about themselves,\neager to impose their own willpower and prejudices. They argue,\nboast, and make a show of their power. They may not know it but they\nare secretly creating an enemy, a resister, because there is no more\ninfuriating feeling than having your individuality ignored, your own\npsychology unacknowledged. It makes you feel lifeless and resentful.\n\nRemember: The key to persuasion is softening people up and\nbreaking them down, gently. Seduce them with a two-pronged\napproach: Work on their emotions and play on their intellectual\nweaknesses. Be alert to both what separates them from everyone else\n(their individual psychology) and what they share with everyone else\n(their basic emotional responses). Aim at the primary emotionslove,\nhate, jealousy. Once you move their emotions you have reduced their\ncontrol, making them more vulnerable to persuasion.\n\nWhen Chuko Liang wanted to dissuade an important general of a\nrival kingdom from entering into an alliance with Ts'ao Ts'ao, Liang's\ndreaded enemy, he did not detail Ts'ao Ts'ao's cruelty, or attack him on\nmoral grounds. Instead Liang suggested that Ts'ao Ts'ao was really\nafter the gen-\n\neral's beautiful young wife. This hit die general in the gut, and\nwon him over. Mao Tse-tung similarly always appealed to popular\nemotions, and spoke in the simplest terms. Educated and well-read\nhimself, in his speeches he used visceral metaphors, voicing the\npublic's deepest anxieties and encouraging diem to vent meir\nfrustrations in public meetings. Radier than arguing die practical\naspects of a particular program, he would describe how it would affect\nthem on die most primitive, down-to-earth level. Do not believe diat\ndiis approach works only with die illiterate and unschooledit works on\none and all. All of us are mortal and face the same dreadful fate, and\n\n\nall of us share die desire for attachment and belonging. Stir up these\nemotions and you captivate our hearts.\n\nThe best way to do this is with a dramatic jolt, of the kind that\nChuko Liang created when he fed and released prisoners who expected\nonly the worst from him. Shaking diem to the core, he softened their\nhearts. Play on contrasts like this: Push people to despair, dien give\nthem relief. If diey expect pain and you give them pleasure, you win\nmeir hearts. Creating pleasure of any kind, in fact, will usually bring\nyou success, as will allaying fears and providing or promising security.\n\nSymbolic gestures are often enough to win sympadiy and\ngoodwill. A gesture of self-sacrifice, for examplea show that you\nsuffer as those around you dowill make people identify witii you, even\nif your suffering is symbolic or minor and dieirs is real. When you\nenter a group, make a gesture of goodwill; soften the group up for the\nharsher actions that will follow later.\n\nWhen T. E. Lawrence was fighting the Turks in die deserts of die\nMiddle East during World War I, he had an epiphany: It seemed to him\nthat conventional warfare had lost its value. The old-fashioned soldier\nwas lost in the enormous armies of the time, in which he was ordered\nabout like a lifeless pawn. Lawrence wanted to turn this around. For\nhim, every soldier's mind was a kingdom he had to conquer. A\ncommitted, psychologically motivated soldier would fight harder and\nmore creatively than a puppet.\n\nLawrence's perception is still more true in die world today, where\nso many of us feel alienated, anonymous, and suspicious of authority,\nall of which makes overt power plays and force even more\ncounterproductive and dangerous. Instead of manipulating lifeless\npawns, make mose on your side convinced and excited by die cause\nyou have enlisted diem in; this will not only make your work easier but\nit will also give you more leeway to deceive tilem later on. And to\naccomplish diis you need to deal with tiieir individual psychologies.\nNever clumsily assume that the tactic that worked on one person will\nnecessarily work on anodier. To find tile key diat will motivate diem,\nfirst get tiiem to open up. The more they talk, die more they reveal\nabout their likes and dislikesdie handles and levers to move diem widi.\n\nThe quickest way to secure people's minds is by demonstrating, as\nsimply as possible, how an action will benefit them. Self-interest is the\n\nstrongest motive of all: A great cause may capture minds, but\nonce die first flush of excitement is over, interest will flagunless there\nis something to be gained. Self-interest is the solider foundation. The\ncauses that work best use a noble veneer to cover a blatant appeal to\nself-interest; the cause seduces but the self-interest secures the deal.\n\nThe people who are best at appealing to people's minds are often\nartists, intellectuals, and those of a more poetic nature. This is because\nideas are most easily communicated through metaphors and imagery. It\nis always good policy, men, to have in your pocket at least one artist or\nintellectual who can appeal concretely to people's minds. Kings have\nalways kept a stable of writers in meir barn: Frederick the Great had\nhis Voltaire (until tiiey quarreled and separated), Napoleon won over\nGoethe. Conversely, Napoleon III's alienation of writers such as Victor\nHugo, whom he exiled from France, contributed to his growing\nunpopularity and eventual downfall. It is dangerous, then, to alienate\nthose who have powers of expression, and useful to pacify and exploit\nthem.\n\nFinally, learn to play the numbers game. The wider your support\nbase the stronger your power. Understanding that one alienated,\ndisaffected soul can spark a blaze of discontent, Louis XIV made sure\nto endear himself to die lowest members of his staff. You too must\nconstantiy win over more allies on all levelsa time will inevitably\ncome when you will need diem.\n\nImage: The Keyhole. People build walls to keep you out; never\nforce your way in you will find only more walls within walls. There\nare doors in these walls, doors to the heart and mind, and they have\ntiny keyholes. Peer through the keyhole, find the key that opens the\ndoor, and you have access to their will with no ugly signs of forced\nentry.\n\nAuthority: The difficulties in the way of persuasion lie in my\nknowing the heart of the persuaded in order thereby to fit my wording\ninto it... . For this reason, whoever attempts persuasion before the\nthrone, must carefully observe the sovereign's feelings of love and\nhate, his secret wishes and fears, before he can conquer his heart.\n(Han-fei-tzu, Chinese philosopher, third century B.C.)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nThere is no possible reversal to this Law.\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Below is an excerpt from my book titled '48 Laws of Power', specifically from Chapter '48 Laws of Power', Section 'LAW 44'. The original text is: 'DISARM AND INFURIATE WITH THE MIRROR EFFECT\n\nJUDGMENT\n\nThe mirror reflects reality, but it is also the perfect tool for\ndeception: When you mirror your enemies, doing exactly as they do,\nthey cannot figure out your strategy. The Mirror Effect mocks and\nhumiliates them, making them overreact. By holding up a mirror to\ntheir psyches, you seduce them with the illusion that you share their\nvalues; by holding up a mirror to their actions, you teach them a\nlesson. Few can resist the power of the Mirror Effect.\n\nMIRROR EFFECTS: Preliminary Typology\n\nMirrors have the power to disturb us. Gazing at our reflection in\nthe mirror, we most often see what we want to seethe image of\nourselves with which we are most comfortable. We tend not to look\ntoo closely, ignoring the wrinkles and blemishes. But if we do look\nhard at the reflected image, we sometimes feel that we are seeing\nourselves as others see us, as a person among other people, an object\nrather than a subject. That feeling makes us shudderwe see ourselves,\nbut from the outside, minus the thoughts, spirit, and soul that fill our\nconsciousness. We are a thing.\n\nIn using Mirror Effects we symbolically re-create this disturbing\npower by mirroring the actions of other people, mimicking their\nmovements to unsettle and infuriate them. Made to feel mocked,\ncloned, objectlike, an image without a soul, they get angry. Or do the\nsame thing slightly differ-endy and they might feel disarmedyou have\nperfectly reflected their wishes and desires. This is the narcissistic\npower of mirrors. In either case, the Mirror Effect unsettles your\ntargets, whether angering or entrancing them, and in mat instant you\nhave die power to manipulate or seduce them. The Effect contains\ngreat power because it operates on the most primitive emotions.\n\nThere are four main Mirror Effects in the realm of power:\n\n\nThe Neutralizing Effect. In ancient Greek mythology, the Gorgon\nMedusa had serpents for hair, protruding tongue, massive teeth, and a\nface so ugly that anyone who gazed at her was turned into stone, out of\nfright. But the hero Perseus managed to slay Medusa by polishing his\nbronze shield into a mirror, men using the reflection in the mirror to\nguide him as he crept up and cut off her head without looking at her\ndirectly. If the shield in this instance was a mirror, the mirror also was\na kind of shield: Medusa could not see Perseus, she saw only her own\nreflected actions, and behind this screen the hero stole up and\ndestroyed her.\n\nThis is me essence of the Neutralizing Effect: Do what your\nenemies do, following their actions as best you can, and they cannot\nsee what you are up tothey are blinded by your mirror. Their strategy\nfor dealing with you depends on your reacting to them in a way\ncharacteristic of you; neutralize it by playing a game of mimicry with\nthem. The tactic has a mocking, even infuriating effect. Most of us\nremember the childhood experience of someone teasing us by\nrepeating our words exactiyafter a while, usually not long, we wanted\nto punch diem in the face. Working more subdy as an adult, you can\nstill unsettie your opponents diis way; shielding your own strategy\nwidi the mirror, you lay invisible traps, or push your opponents into\nthe trap they planned for you.\n\nThis powerful technique has been used in military strategy since\nthe days of Sun-tzu; in our own time it often appears in political\ncampaigning. It is also useful for disguising those situations in which\nyou have no particular strategy yourself. This is the Warrior's Mirror.\n\nA reverse version of the Neutralizing Effect is the Shadow: You\n\nTHE MERCHANT AND HIS ITiIEND\n\nA certain merchant once had a great desire to make a long\njourney. Now in regard that he was not very wealthy, \u201cIt is requisite,\u201d\nsaid he to himself, \u201cthat before my departure 1 should leave some part\nof my estate in the city, to the end that if I meet with ill luck in my\ntravels, I may have wherewithal to keep me at my return.\u201d To this\npurpose he delivered a great number of bars of iron, which were a\nprincipal part of his wealth, in trust to one of his friends, desiring him\nto keep them during his absence; and then, taking his leave, away he\nwent. Some time after, having had but ill luck in his travels, he\n\nreturned home; and the first thing he did was to go to his friend, and\ndemand his iron: but his friend, who owed several sums of money,\nhaving sold the iron to pay his own debts, made him this answer: \u201c\nTruly, friend,\u201d said he, \u201cI put your iron into a room that was close\nlocked, imagining it would have been there as secure as my own gold;\nbut an accident has happened which no one could have suspected, for\nthere was a rat in the room which ate it all up.\u201d The merchant,\npretending ignorance, replied, \"It is a terrible misfortune to me indeed;\nbut I know of\n\nold that rats love iron extremely; I have suffered by them many\ntimes before in the same manner, and therefore can the better bear my\npresent affliction.\u201c This answer extremely pleased the friend, who was\nglad to hear the merchant so well inclined to believe that a rat had\neaten his iron; and to remove all suspicions, desired him to dine with\nhim the next day. The merchant promised he would, but in the\nmeantime he met in the middle of the city one of his friend's children;\nthe child he carried home, and locked up in a room. The next day he\nwent to his friend, who seemed to be in great affliction, which he\nasked him the cause of, as if he had been perfectly ignorant of what\nhad happened. \u201dO, my dear friend,\u201c answered the other, \u201dI beg you to\nexcuse me, if you do not see me so cheerful as otherwise I would be; I\nhave lost one of my children; I have had him cried by sound of\ntrumpet, but I know not what is become of him. \u201c \u201dOf* replied the\nmerchant, \u201d1 am grieved to hear this; for yesterday in the evening, as I\nparted from hence, I saw an owl in the air with a child in his claws; but\nwhether it were yours I cannot tell.\u201c \u201cWhy, you most foolish and\nabsurd creature!,' replied the friend, \"are you not ashamed to tell such\nan egregious lie An owl, that weighs at\n\nshadow your opponents' every move without their seeing you.\nUse the Shadow to gather information that will neutralize their strategy\nlater on, when you will be able to thwart their every move. The\nShadow is effective because to follow the movements of others is to\ngain valuable insights into their habits and routines. The Shadow is the\npreeminent device for detectives and spies.\n\nThe Narcissus Effect. Gazing at an image in the waters of a pond,\nthe Greek youth Narcissus fell in love with it. And when he found out\nthat the image was his own reflection, and that he therefore could not\n\n\nconsummate his love, he despaired and drowned himself. All of us\nhave a similar problem: We are profoundly in love with ourselves, but\nsince this love excludes a love object outside ourselves, it remains\ncontinuously unsatisfied and unfulfilled. The Narcissus Effect plays on\nthis universal narcissism: You look deep into the souls of odier people;\nfathom their inmost desires, their values, their tastes, their spirit; and\nyou reflect it back to them, making yourself into a kind of mirror\nimage. Your ability to reflect their psyche gives you great power over\nthem; they may even feel a tinge of love.\n\nThis is simply the ability to mimic another person not physically,\nbut psychologically, and it is immensely powerful because it plays\nupon the unsatisfied self-love of a child. Normally, people bombard us\nwith their experiences, their tastes. They hardly ever make the effort to\nsee things through our eyes. This is annoying, but it also creates great\nopportunity: If you can show you understand another person by\nreflecting their inmost feelings, they will be entranced and disarmed,\nall the more so because it happens so rarely. No one can resist this\nfeeling of being harmoniously reflected in the outside world, even\nthough you might well be manufacturing it for their benefit, and for\ndeceptive purposes of your own.\n\nThe Narcissus Effect works wonders in both social life and\nbusiness; it gives us both the Seducer's and the Courtier's Mirror.\n\nThe Moral Effect The power of verbal argument is extremely\nlimited, and often accomplishes the opposite of what is intended. As\nGracian remarks, \u201cThe truth is generally seen, rarely heard.\u201d The\nMoral Effect is a perfect way to demonstrate your ideas through action.\nQuite simply, you teach others a lesson by giving them a taste of their\nown medicine.\n\nIn the Moral Effect, you mirror what other people have done to\nyou, and do so in a way that makes them realize you are doing to them\nexacdy what they did to you. You make them feel that their behavior\nhas been unpleasant, as opposed to hearing you complain and whine\nabout it, which only gets their defenses up. And as they feel the result\nof dieir actions mirrored back at them, they realize in the profoundest\nsense how they hurt or punish others with their unsocial behavior. You\nobjectify the qualities you want them to feel ashamed of and create a\nmirror in which they can gaze at their follies and learn a lesson about\n\nthemselves. This technique is often used by educators, psychologists,\nand anyone who has to deal with un-\n\npleasant and unconscious behavior. This is the Teacher's Mirror.\nWhether or not there is actually anydiing wrong witii the way people\nhave treated you, however, it can often be to your advantage to reflect\nit back to them in a way that makes them feel guilty about it.\n\nThe Hallucinatory Effect Mirrors are tremendously deceptive, for\nthey create a sense that you are looking at the real world. Actually,\nthough, you are only staring at a piece of glass, which, as everyone\nknows, cannot show the world exactly as it is: Everything in a mirror\nis reversed. When Alice goes dirough the looking glass in Lewis\nCarroll's book, she enters a world that is back-to-front, and more than\njust visually.\n\nThe Hallucinatory Effect comes from creating a perfect copy of\nan object, a place, a person. This copy acts as a kind of dummypeople\ntake it for the real thing, because it has the physical appearance of the\nreal thing. This is the preeminent technique of con artists, who\nstrategically mimic the real world to deceive you. It also has\napplications in any arena that requires camouflage. This is the\nDeceiver's Mirror.\n\nOBSERVANCES OF MIRROR EFFECTS\n\nObservance I\n\nIn February of 1815, the emperor Napoleon escaped from the\nisland of Elba, where he had been imprisoned by die allied forces of\nEurope, and returned to Paris in a march that stirred the French nation,\nrallying troops and citizens of all classes to his side and chasing his\nsuccessor, King Louis XVIII, off the throne. By March, however,\nhaving reestablished himself in power, he had to face the fact that\nFrance's situation had gravely changed. The country was devastated,\nhe had no allies among the other European nations, and his most loyal\nand important ministers had deserted him or left the country. Only one\nman remained from die old regimeJoseph Fouche, his former minister\nof police.\n\nNapoleon had relied on Fouche to do his dirty work throughout\nhis previous reign, but he had never been able to figure his minister\nout. He kept a corps of agents to spy on all of his ministers, so that he\nwould always have an edge on them, but no one had gotten anything\n\non Fouche. If suspected of some misdeed, the minister would not get\nangry or take the accusation personallyhe would submit, nod, smile,\nand change colors chameleonlike, adapting to tiie requirements of die\nmoment. At first diis had seemed somewhat pleasant and charming,\nbut after a while it frustrated Napoleon, who felt outdone by this\nslippery man. At one time or another he had fired all of his most\nimportant ministers, including Talleyrand, but he never touched\nFouche. And so, in 1815, back in power and in need of help, he felt he\nhad no choice but to reappoint Fouche as his minister of police.\n\nSeveral weeks into his new reign, Napoleon's spies told him they\nbe-\n\nmost not above two or three pounds, can he carry a boy that\nweighs above fifty\u201c \u201dWhy, \u201c replied the merchant, \u201ddo you make such\na wonder at that As if in a country where one rat can eat a hundred\ntons ' weight of iron, it were such a wonder for an owl to carry a child\nthat weighs not over fifty pounds in all!\" The friend, upon this, found\nthat the merchant was no such fool as he took him to be, begged his\npardon for the cheat which he designed to have put upon him, restored\nhim the value of his iron, and so had his son again. ,\n\nIndia,\n\nfourth century\n\nWhen you have come to grips and are striving together with the\nenemy, and you realize that you cannot advance, you \u201csoak in\u201d and\nbecome one with the enemy. You can win by applying a suitable\ntechnique while you are mutually entangled. ... You can win often\ndecisively with the advantage of knowing how to \u201csoak \u201d into the\nenemy, whereas, were you to draw apart, you would lose the chance to\nwin.\n\na book of five rings, Miyamoto Musashi, Japan, seventeenth\ncentury\n\nOne day Mr. Fox decided to fork out And invite old Mrs. Stork\nout. The dinner wasn 't elaborate Being habitually mean, He didn 't go\nin for haute cuisine In fact it consisted of a shallow plate Of thin gruel.\nWithin a minute Our joker had lapped his plate clean; Meanwhile his\nguest. fishing away with her beak, Got not a morsel in it. To pay him\nback for this cruel Practical joke, the stork invited The fox to dinner\nthe following week. \u201cI should be delighted,\u201d He replied; \u201c When it\n\ncomes to friends I never stand upon pride. \u201d Punctually on the day he\nran To his hostess's house and at once began Praising everything:\n\u201cWhat taste! What chic! And the fooddone just to a turn!\u201d Then sat\ndown with a hearty appetite (Foxes are always ready to eat) And\nsavored the delicious smell of meat. It was minced meat and servedto\nserve him right! In a long-necked, narrow-mouthed urn. The stork,\neasily stooping, Enjoyed her fill With her long bill; His snout, though,\n\nlieved Fouche was in secret contact with ministers of foreign\ncountries, including Metternich of Austria. Afraid that his most\nvaluable minister was betraying him to his enemies, Napoleon had to\nfind out the truth before it was too late. He could not confront Fouche\ndirectlyin person the man was as slippery as an eel. He needed hard\nproof.\n\nThis seemed to come in April, when the emperor's private police\ncap tured a Viennese gentleman who had come to Paris to pass\ninformation on to Fouche. Ordering the man brought before him,\nNapoleon threatened to shoot him then and mere unless he confessed;\nthe man broke down and admitted he had given Fouche a letter from\nMetternich, written in invisible ink, arranging for a secret meeting of\nspecial agents in Basel. Napoleon accordingly ordered one of his own\nagents to infiltrate this meeting. If Fouche was indeed planning to\nbetray him, he would finally be caught red-handed and would hang.\n\nNapoleon waited impatiently for the agent's return, but to his\nbewilderment the agent showed up days later reporting that he had\nheard nothing that would implicate Fouche in a conspiracy. In fact it\nseemed that the other agents present suspected Fouche of double-\ncrossing them, as if he were working for Napoleon all along. Napoleon\ndid not believe this for an instantFouche had somehow outwitted him\nagain.\n\nThe following morning Fouche visited Napoleon, and remarked,\n\u201cBy me way, sire, I never told you tiiat I had a letter from Metternich a\nfew days ago; my mind was so full of things of greater moment.\nBesides, his emissary omitted to give me die powder needed to make\ndie writing legible. . . . Here at lengdi is the letter.\u201d Sure that Fouche\nwas toying widi him, Napoleon exploded, \u201cYou are a traitor, Fouche! I\nought to have you hanged.\u201d He continued to harangue Fouche, but\ncould not fire him without proof. Fouche only expressed amazement at\n\ndie emperor's words, but inwardly he smiled, for all along he had been\nplaying a mirroring game. Interpretation\n\nFouche had known for years that Napoleon kept on top of those\naround him by spying on them day and night. The minister had\nsurvived this game by having his own spies spy on Napoleon's spies,\ndius neutralizing any action Napoleon might take against him. In the\ncase of die meeting in Basel, he even turned die tables: Knowing about\nNapoleon's double agent, he set it up so that it would appear as if\nFouche were a loyal double agent too.\n\nFouche gained power and flourished in a period of great tumult\nby mirroring those around him. During the French Revolution he was a\nradical Jacobin; after die Terror he became a moderate republican; and\nunder Napoleon he became a committed imperialist whom Napoleon\nennobled and made die duke of Otranto. If Napoleon took up the\nweapon of digging up dirt on people, Fouche made sure he had die dirt\non Napoleon, as well as on everyone else. This also allowed him to\npredict die emperor's plans and desires, so that he could echo his boss's\nsentiments before he had even uttered diem. Shielding his actions witii\na mirror strategy, Fouche could also plot offensive moves widiout\nbeing caught in die act.\n\nThis is the power of mirroring those around you. First, you give\npeople\n\nthe feeling that you share their thoughts and goals. Second, if they\nsuspect you have ulterior motives, the mirror shields you from them,\npreventing them from figuring out your strategy. Eventually this will\ninfuriate and unsettle them. By playing the double, you steal their\nthunder, suck away dieir initiative, make them feel helpless. You also\ngain die ability to choose when and how to unsettle themanother\navenue to power. And the mirror saves you mental energy: simply\nechoing die moves of others gives you the space you need to develop a\nstrategy of your own.\n\nObservance II\n\nEarly on in his career, the ambitious statesman and general\nAlcibiades of Athens (450-404 B.C.) fashioned a formidable weapon\nthat became the source of his power. In every encounter widi odiers, he\nwould sense dieir moods and tastes, then carefully tailor his words and\nactions to mirror their inmost desires. He would seduce diem with the\n\nidea that dieir values were superior to everyone else's, and that his goal\nwas to model himself on them or help them realize dieir dreams. Few\ncould resist his charm.\n\nThe first man to fall under his spell was die philosopher Socrates.\nAlcibiades represented the opposite of the Socratic ideal of simplicity\nand uprightness: He lived lavishly and was completely unprincipled.\nWhenever he met Socrates, however, he mirrored the older man's\nsobriety, eating simply, accompanying Socrates on long walks, and\ntalking only of philosophy and virtue. Socrates was not completely\nfooledhe was not unaware of Alcibiades' otiier life. But diat only made\nhim vulnerable to a logic that flattered him: Only in my presence, he\nfelt, does this man submit to a virtuous influence; only I have such\npower over him. This feeling intoxicated Socrates, who became\nAlcibiades' fervent admirer and supporter, one day even risking his\nown life to rescue the young man in battle.\n\nThe Adienians considered Alcibiades dieir greatest orator, for he\nhad an uncanny ability to tune in to his audience's aspirations, and\nmirror their desires. He made his greatest speeches in support of die\ninvasion of Sicily, which he diought would bring great wealth to\nAdiens and limidess glory to himself. The speeches gave expression to\nyoung Adienians' thirst to conquer lands for themselves, rather than\nliving off die victories of their ancestors. But he also tailored his words\nto reflect older men's nostalgia for die glory years when Adiens led die\nGreeks against Persia, and dien went on to create an empire. All\nAthens now dreamed of conquering Sicily; Alcibiades' plan was\napproved, and he was made the expedition's commander.\n\nWhile Alcibiades was leading die invasion of Sicily, however,\ncertain Adienians fabricated charges against him of profaning sacred\nstatues. He knew his enemies would have him executed if he returned\nhome, so at die last minute he deserted the Adienian fleet and defected\nto Athens's bitter enemy, Sparta. The Spartans welcomed this great\nman to their side, but diey knew his reputation and were wary of him.\nAlcibiades loved luxury; die Spartans were a warrior people who\nworshipped austerity, and they were afraid he would corrupt their\nyouth. But much to dieir relief, the Al-\n\nbeing the wrong shape and size, He had to return to his den\n\nEmpty-bellied, tail dragging, ears drooping,\n\nAs red in the face as a fox who's been caught by a hen.\n\nselected fables, Jean de La Fontaine, 1621-1695\n\nWhen I wish to find out how wise, or how stupid, or how good, or\nhow wicked is any one, or what are his thoughts at the moment, I\nfashion the expression of my face, as accurately as possible, in\naccordance with the expression of his, and then wait to see what\nthoughts or sentiments arise in my mind or heart, as if to match or\ncorrespond with the expression.\n\nEdgar Allan Poe, 1809-1849\n\nLorenzo [de' Medici] lost no opportunity of increasing the respect\nwhich Pope Innocent now felt for him and of gaining his friendship, if\npossible his affection. He took the trouble to discover the Pope's tastes\nand indulged them accordingly. He sent him ... casks of his favourite\nwine.... He sent him courteous, flattering letters in which he assured\nhim, when the Pope was ill, that he felt his sufferings as though they\nwere his own, in which he encouraged him with such fortifying\nstatements as \u201ca Pope is what he wills to be, \u201d and in which, as though\nincidentally, he included his views on the proper course of papal\npolicies. Innocent was gratified by Lorenzo's attentions and convinced\nby his arguments.... So completely, indeed, did he come to share his\nopinions that, as the disgruntled Ferrarese ambassador put it, \u201cthe Pope\nsleeps with the eyes of the Magnificent Lorenzo. \u201d\n\nthe house\n\nof medici:\n\nits rise and fall,\n\nChristopher Hibbert,\n\ncibiades who arrived in Sparta was not at all what they expected:\nHe wore his hair untrimmed (as they did), took cold baths, ate coarse\nbread and black broth, and wore simple domes. To the Spartans this\nsignified mat he had come to see their way of life as superior to the\nAthenian; greater than they were, he had chosen to be a Spartan rather\nthan being born one, and should thus be honored above all others.\nThey fell under his spell and gave him great powers. Unfortunately\nAlcibiades rarely knew how to rein in his charmhe managed to seduce\nthe king of Sparta's wife and make her pregnant. When this became\npublic he once more had to flee for his life.\n\nThis time Alcibiades defected to Persia, where he suddenly went\nfrom Spartan simplicity to embracing die lavish Persian lifestyle down\nto the last detail. It was of course immensely flattering to the Persians\nto see a Greek of Alcibiades' stature prefer their culture over his own,\nand they showered him with honors, land, and power. Once seduced by\nthe mirror, they failed to notice that behind this shield Alcibiades was\nplaying a double game, se-credy helping the Athenians in their war\nwith Sparta and thus reingratiat-ing himself with the city to which he\ndesperately wanted to return, and which welcomed him back with open\narms in 408 B.C. Interpretation\n\nEarly in his political career, Alcibiades made a discovery that\nchanged his whole approach to power: He had a colorful and forceful\npersonality, but when he argued his ideas strongly with other people he\nwould win over a few while at the same time alienating many more.\nThe secret to gaining ascendancy over large numbers, he came to\nbelieve, was not to impose his colors but to absorb the colors of those\naround him, like a chameleon. Once people fell for the trick, the\ndeceptions he went on to practice would be invisible to them.\n\nUnderstand: Everyone is wrapped up in their own narcissistic\nshell. When you try to impose your own ego on them, a wall goes up,\nresistance is increased. By mirroring them, however, you seduce them\ninto a kind of narcissistic rapture: They are gazing at a double of their\nown soul. This double is actually manufactured in its entirety by you.\nOnce you have used the mirror to seduce them, you have great power\nover them.\n\nIt is worth noting, however, the dangers in the promiscuous use of\nthe mirror. In Alcibiades' presence people felt larger, as if their egos\nhad been doubled. But once he left, they felt empty and diminished,\nand when they saw him mirroring completely different people as\ntotally as he had mirrored them, they felt not just diminished but\nbetrayed. Alcibiades' overuse of the Mirror Effect made whole peoples\nfeel used, so that he constandy had to flee from one place to another.\nIndeed Alcibiades so angered the Spartans that they finally had him\nmurdered. He had gone too far. The Seducer's Mirror must be used\nwith caution and discrimination.\n\nObservance III\n\nIn 1652 the recendy widowed Baroness Mancini moved her\nfamily from\n\nRome to Paris, where she could count on the influence and\nprotection of\n\nher brother Cardinal Mazarin, the French prime minister. Of the\nbaroness's five daughters, four dazzled the court with their beauty and\nhigh spirits. These infamously charming nieces of Cardinal Mazarin\nbecame known as the Mazarinettes, and soon found themselves invited\nto all the most important court functions.\n\nOne daughter, Marie Mancini, did not share this good fortune, for\nshe lacked the beauty and grace of her sisterswho, along with her\nmother and even Cardinal Mazarin, eventually came to dislike her, for\nthey felt she spoiled the family image. They tried to persuade her to\nenter a convent, where she would be less of an embarrassment, but she\nrefused. Instead she applied herself to her studies, learning Latin and\nGreek, perfecting her French, and practicing her musical skills. On the\nrare occasions when the family would let her attend court affairs, she\ntrained herself to be an artful listener, sizing people up for their\nweaknesses and hidden desires. And when she finally met the future\nKing Louis XIV, in 1657 (Louis was seventeen years old, Marie\neighteen), she decided that to spite her family and uncle, she would\nfind a way to make this young man fall in love with her.\n\nThis was a seemingly impossible task for such a plain-looking\ngirl, but Marie studied the future king closely. She noticed that her\nsisters\u2019 frivolity did not please him, and she sensed that he loathed the\nscheming and petty politicking that went on all around him. She saw\nthat he had a romantic na-turehe read adventure novels, insisted on\nmarching at the head of his armies, and had high ideals and a passion\nfor glory. The court did not feed these fantasies of his; it was a banal,\nsuperficial world that bored him.\n\nThe key to Louis's heart, Marie saw, would be to construct a\nmirror reflecting his fantasies and his youthful yearnings for glory and\nromance. To begin with she immersed herself in the romantic novels,\npoems, and plays that she knew the young king read voraciously.\nWhen Louis began to engage her in conversation, to his delight she\nwould talk of the things that stirred his soulnot this fashion or that\npiece of gossip, but rather courtly love, the deeds of great knights, the\n\nnobility of past kings and heroes. She fed his thirst for glory by\ncreating an image of an august, superior king whom he could aspire to\nbecome. She stirred his imagination.\n\nAs the future Sun King spent more and more time in Marie's\npresence, it eventually became clear that he had fallen in love with the\nleast likely young woman of the court. To the horror of her sisters and\nmother, he showered Marie Mancini with attention. He brought her\nalong on his military campaigns, and made a show of stationing her\nwhere she could watch as he marched into battle. He even promised\nMarie that he would marry her and make her queen.\n\nMazarin, however, would never allow the king to marry his niece,\na woman who could bring France no diplomatic or royal alliances.\nLouis had to marry a princess of Spain or Austria. In 1658 Louis\nsuccumbed to the pressure and agreed to break off the first romantic\ninvolvement of his life. He did so with much regret, and at the end of\nhis life he acknowledged that he never loved anyone as much as Marie\nMancini.\n\nWittgenstein had an extraordinary gift for divining the thoughts of\nthe person with whom he was engaged in discussion. While the other\nstruggled to put his thought into words, Wittgenstein would perceive\nwhat it was and state it for him. This power of his, which sometimes\nseemed uncanny, was made possible, I am sure, by his own prolonged\nand continuous researches.\n\nLUDWIO WITTGENSTEIN: A MEMOIR,\n\nNorman Malcolm. 1958\n\nThe doctor should be opaque to his patients, and like a mirror,\nshould show them nothing but what is shown to him.\n\nSigmund Freud, 1856-1939\n\nInterpretation\n\nMarie Mancini played the seducer's game to perfection. First, she\ntook a step back, to study her prey. Seduction often fails to get past the\nfirst step because it is too aggressive; the first move must always be a\nretreat. By studying the king from a distance Marie saw what\ndistinguished him from otiiershis high ideals, romantic nature, and\nsnobbish disdain for petty politics. Marie's next step was to make a\nmirror for these hidden yearnings on Louis's part, letting him glimpse\nwhat he himself could bea godlike king!\n\nThis mirror had several functions: Satisfying Louis's ego by\ngiving him a double to look at, it also focused on him so exclusively as\nto give him the feeling that Marie existed for him alone. Surrounded\nby a pack of scheming courtiers who only had their own self-interest at\nheart, he could not fail to be touched by this devotional focus. Finally\nMarie's mirror set up an ideal for him to live up to: the noble knight of\nthe medieval court. To a soul both romantic and ambitious, nothing\ncould be more intoxicating than to have someone hold up an idealized\nreflection of him. In effect it was Marie Mancini who created the\nimage of die Sun Kingindeed Louis later admitted the enormous part\nshe had played in fashioning his radiant self-image.\n\nThis is the power of the Seducer's Mirror: By doubling the tastes\nand ideals of the target, it shows your attention to his or her\npsychology, an attention more charming than any aggressive pursuit.\nFind out what sets the other person apart, then hold up the mirror that\nwill reflect it and bring it out of diem. Feed their fantasies of power\nand greatness by reflecting their ideals, and they will succumb.\n\nObservance IV\n\nIn 1538, with the death of his mother, Helena, the eight-year-old\nfuture czar Ivan IV (or Ivan the Terrible) of Russia became an orphan.\nFor the next five years he watched as the princely class, the boyars,\nterrorized the country. Now and then, to mock the young Ivan, they\nwould make him wear a crown and scepter and place him on the\nthrone. When the little boy's feet dangled over the edge of the chair,\nthey would laugh and lift him off it, handing him from man to man in\nthe air, making him feel his helplessness compared to them.\n\nWhen Ivan was thirteen, he boldly murdered the boyar leader and\nascended to the dirone. For the next few decades he struggled to\nsubdue the boyars' power, but they continued to defy him. By 1575 his\nefforts to transform Russia and defeat its enemies had exhausted him.\nMeanwhile, his subjects were complaining bitterly about his endless\nwars, his secret police, the unvanquished and oppressive boyars. His\nown ministers began to question his moves. Finally he had had\nenough. In 1564 he had temporarily abandoned the throne, forcing his\nsubjects to call him back to power. Now he took the strategy a step\nfurther, and abdicated.\n\nTo take his place Ivan elevated a general of his, Simeon\nBekbulatovich,\n\nto the throne. But although Simeon had recently converted to\nChristianity, he was by birth a Tartar, and his enthronement was an\ninsult to Ivan's subjects, since Russians looked down on the Tartars as\ninferiors and infidels. Yet Ivan ordered that all Russians, including the\nboyars, pledge obedience to their new ruler. And while Simeon moved\ninto the Kremlin, Ivan lived in a humble house on Moscow's outskirts,\nrom which he would sometimes visit the palace, bow before the\nthrone, sit among the other boyars, and humbly petition Simeon for\n\u2018avors.\n\nOver time it became clear that Simeon was a kind of king's\ndouble. He dressed like Ivan, and acted like Ivan, but he had no real\npower, since no one would really obey him. The boyars at the court\nwho were old enough to remember taunting Ivan when he was a boy,\nby placing him on the throne, saw the connection: They had made Ivan\neel like a weak pretender, so now he mirrored them by placing a weak\npretender of his own on the throne.\n\nFor two long years Ivan held the mirror of Simeon up to the\nRussian people. The mirror said: Your whining and disobedience have\nmade me a czar widi no real power, so I will reflect back to you a czar\nwith no real power. You have treated me disrespectfully, so I will do\nthe same to you, making Russia the laughingstock of the world. In\n1577, in the name of the Russian people, the chastised boyars once\nagain begged Ivan to return to the throne, which he did. He lived as\nczar until his death, in 1584, and the conspiracies, complaining, and\nsecond-guessing disappeared along with Simeon. Interpretation\n\nIn 1564, after threatening to abdicate, Ivan had been granted\nabsolute powers. But these powers had slowly been chipped away as\nevery sector of societythe boyars, the church, the governmentvied for\nmore control. Foreign wars had exhausted the country, internal\nbickering had increased, and Ivan's attempts to respond had been met\nwidi scorn. Russia had turned into a kind of boisterous classroom in\nwhich the pupils laughed openly at the teacher. If he raised his voice or\ncomplained, he only met more resistance. He had to teach them a\nlesson, give them a taste of meir own medicine. Simeon Bekbulatovich\nwas the mirror he used to do so.\n\n\nAfter two years in which the throne had been an object of ridicule\nand disgust, the Russian people learned their lesson. They wanted their\nczar back, conceding to him all the dignity and respect that the position\nshould always have commanded. For the rest of his reign, Russia and\nIvan got along fine.\n\nUnderstand: People are locked in their own experiences. When\nyou whine about some insensitivity on their part, they may seem to\nunderstand, but inwardly they are untouched and even more resistant.\nThe goal of power is always to lower people's resistance to you. For\nmis you need tricks, and one trick is to teach them a lesson.\n\nInstead of haranguing people verbally, then, create a kind of\nmirror of their behavior. In doing so you leave them two choices: They\ncan ignore\n\nyou, or they can start to think about themselves. And even if tfiey\nignore you, you will have planted a seed in their unconscious that will\neventually take root. When you mirror their behavior, incidentally, do\nnot be afraid to add a touch of caricature and exaggeration, as Ivan did\nby entiironing a Tartarit is the little spice in die soup mat will open\ndieir eyes and make diem see the ridiculousness in dieir own actions.\n\nObservance V\n\nDr. Milton H. Erickson, a pioneer in strategic psychodierapy,\nwould often educate his patients powerfully but indirectly by creating\na kind of mirror effect. Constructing an analogy to make patients see\nthe trutii on their own, he would bypass their resistance to change.\nWhen Dr. Erickson treated married couples complaining of sexual\nproblems, for instance, he often found that psychotherapy's tradition of\ndirect confrontation and problem-airing only heightened the spouses'\nresistance and sharpened their differences. Instead, he would draw a\nhusband and wife out on other topics, often banal ones, trying to find\nan analogy for die sexual conflict.\n\nIn one couple's first session, the pair were discussing their eating\nhabits, especially at dinner. The wife preferred die leisurely approacha\ndrink before the meal, some appetizers, and then a small main course,\nall at a slow, civilized pace. This frustrated the husbandhe wanted to\nget dinner over quickly and to dig right into the main course, the\nbigger the better. As the conversation continued, the couple began to\ncatch glimpses of an analogy to their problems in bed. The moment\n\n\nthey made tiiis connection, however, Dr. Erickson would change the\nsubject, carefully avoiding a discussion of the real problem.\n\nThe couple diought Erickson was just getting to know them and\nwould deal widi the problem direcdy die next time he saw diem. But at\ndie end of diis first session, Dr. Erickson directed them to arrange a\ndinner a few nights away tiiat would combine each person's desire:\nThe wife would get the slow meal, including time spent bonding, and\nthe husband would get the big dishes he wanted to eat. Widiout\nrealizing they were acting under the doctor's gende guidance, the\ncouple would walk into a mirror of their problem, and in the mirror\nthey would solve their problems themselves, ending die evening just as\nthe doctor had hopedby mirroring the improved dinner dynamics in\nbed.\n\nIn dealing with more severe problems, such as die schizophrenic's\nmirror fantasy world of his or her own construction, Dr. Erickson\nwould always try to enter the mirror and work within it. He once\ntreated a hospital inmate who believed he was Jesus Christdraping\nsheets around his body, talking in vague parables, and bombarding\nstaff and patients widi endless Christian proselytizing. No therapy or\ndrugs seemed to work, until one day Dr. Erickson went up to die young\nman and said, \u201cI understand you have had experience as a carpenter.\u201d\nBeing Christ, the patient had to say that he had had such experience,\nand Erickson immediately put him to work building bookcases and\notiier useful items, allowing him to wear his Jesus garb. Over the next\nweeks, as the patient worked on diese projects,\n\nhis mind became less occupied with Jesus fantasies and more\nfocused on his labor. As the carpentry work took precedence, a psychic\nshift took effect: The religious fantasies remained, but faded\ncomfortably into the background, allowing the man to function in\nsociety. Interpretation\n\nCommunication depends on metaphors and symbols, which are\nthe basis of language itself. A metaphor is a kind of mirror to the\nconcrete and real, which it often expresses more clearly and deeply\nthan a literal description does. When you are dealing with the\nintractable willpower of other people, direct communication often only\nheightens their resistance.\n\n\nThis happens most clearly when you complain about people's\nbehavior, particularly in sensitive areas such as their lovemaking. You\nwill effect a far more lasting change if, like Dr. Erickson, you construct\nan analogy, a symbolic mirror of the situation, and guide the other\nthrough it. As Christ himself understood, talking in parables is often\nthe best way to teach a lesson, for it allows people to realize the truth\non tfieir own.\n\nWhen dealing with people who are lost in the reflections of\nfantasy worlds (including a host of people who do not live in mental\nhospitals), never try to push them into reality by shattering their\nmirrors. Instead, enter meir world and operate inside it, under their\ntules, gently guiding them out of the hall of mirrors tiiey have entered.\n\nObservance VI\n\nThe great sixteenth-century Japanese tea master Takeno Sho-o\nonce passed by a house and noticed a young man watering flowers\nnear his front gate. Two things caught Sho-o's attentionfirst, the\ngraceful way the man performed his task; and, second, the stunningly\nbeautiful rose of Sharon blossoms that bloomed in the garden. He\nstopped and introduced himself to the man, whose name was Sen no\nRikyu. Shoo wanted to stay, but he had a prior engagement and had to\nhurry off. Before he left, however, Rikyu invited him to take tea with\nhim the following morning. Sho-o happily accepted.\n\nWhen Sho-o opened the garden gate the next day, he was\nhorrified to see that not a single flower remained. More than anything\nelse, he had come to see the rose of Sharon blossoms that he had not\nhad the time to appreciate the day before; now, disappointed, he started\nto leave, but at the gate he stopped himself, and decided to enter Sen\nno Rikyu's tea room. Immediately inside, he stopped in his tracks and\ngazed in astonishment: Before him a vase hung from the ceiling, and in\nthe vase stood a single rose of Sharon blossom, the most beautiful in\nthe garden. Somehow Sen no Rikyu had read his guest's thoughts, and,\nwith this one eloquent gesture, had demonstrated that this day guest\nand host would be in perfect harmony.\n\nSen no Rikyu went on to become the most famous tea master of\nall, and his trademark was this uncanny ability to harmonize himself\nwith his guests' tfioughts and to think one step ahead, enchanting them\nby adapting to their taste.\n\n\nOne day Rikyu was invited to tea by Yamashina Hechigwan, an\nad-\n\nmirer of the tea ceremony but also a man with a vivid sense of\nhumor. When Rikyu arrived at Hechigwan's home, he found the garden\ngate shut, so he opened it to look for the host. On the other side of the\ngate he saw that someone had first dug a ditch, then carefully covered\nit over widi canvas and earth. Realizing that Hechigwan had planned a\npractical joke, he obligingly walked right into the ditch, muddying his\nclothes in the process.\n\nApparently horrified, Hechigwan came running out, and hurried\nRikyu to a bath mat for some inexplicable reason stood already\nprepared. After bathing, Rikyu joined Hechigwan in the tea ceremony,\nwhich both enjoyed immensely, sharing a laugh about the accident.\nLater Sen no Rikyu explained to a friend that he had heard about\nHechigwan's practical joke beforehand, \u201cBut since it should always be\none's aim to conform to the wishes of one's host, I fell into the hole\nknowingly and thus assured the success of the meeting. Tea is by no\nmeans mere obsequiousness, but there is no tea where the host and\nguest are not in harmony with one another.\u201d Hechigwan's vision of the\ndignified Sen no Rikyu at the bottom of a ditch had pleased him\nendlessly, but Rikyu had gained a pleasure of his own in complying\nwith his host's wish and watching him amuse himself in this way.\nInterpretation\n\nSen no Rikyu was no magician or seerhe watched those around\nhim acutely, plumbing the subde gestures that revealed a hidden desire,\nthen producing that desire's image. Although Sho-o never spoke of\nbeing enchanted by the rose of Sharon blossoms, Rikyu read it in his\neyes. If mirroring a person's desires meant falling into a ditch, so be it.\nRikyu's power resided in his skillful use of the Courtier's Mirror,\nwhich gave him the appearance of an unusual ability to see into other\npeople.\n\nLearn to manipulate die Courtier's Mirror, for it will bring you\ngreat power. Study people's eyes, follow their gesturessurer barometers\nof pain and pleasure than any spoken word. Notice and remember the\ndetailsthe doming, the choice of friends, the daily habits, the tossed-out\nremarks that reveal hidden and rarely indulged desires. Soak it all in,\nfind out what lies under the surface, then make yourself the mirror of\n\ntheir unspoken selves. That is the key to this power: The other person\nhas not asked for your consideration, has not mentioned his pleasure in\nthe rose of Sharon, and when you reflect it back to him his pleasure is\nheightened because it is unasked for. Remember: The wordless\ncommunication, the indirect compliment, contains the most power. No\none can resist the enchantment of the Courtier's Mirror.\n\nObservance VII\n\nYellow Kid Weil, con artist extraordinaire, used the Deceiver's\nMirror in his most brilliant cons. Most audacious of all was his re-\ncreation of a bank in Muncie, Indiana. When Weil read one day that\nthe Merchants Bank in Muncie had moved, he saw an opportunity he\ncould not pass up.\n\nWeil rented out the original Merchants building, which still\ncontained bank furniture, complete with teller windows. He bought\nmoney bags,\n\nstenciled a bank's invented name on them, filled them with steel\nwashers, and arrayed them impressively behind the teller windows,\nalong with bundles of boodlereal bills hiding newspaper cut to size.\nFor his bank's staff and customers Weil hired gamblers, bookies, girls\nrom local bawdy houses, and other assorted confederates. He even\nhad a local thug pose as a bank dick.\nClaiming to be the broker for a certificate investment the bank\nwas offering, Weil would fish the waters and hook the proper wealthy\nsucker. He would bring this man to the bank and ask to see the\npresident. An \u201cofficer\u201d of the bank would tell them that they had to\nwait, which only heightened the realism of the conone always has to\nwait to see the bank president. And as they waited the bank would\nbustle with banklike activity, as call girls and bookies in disguise\nfloated in and out, making deposits and withdrawals and tipping their\nhats to the phony bank dick. Lulled by this perfect copy of reality, the\nsucker would deposit $50,000 into the fake bank without a worry in\nthe world.\n\nOver the years Weil did the same thing with a deserted yacht club,\nan abandoned brokerage office, a relocated real estate office, and a\ncompletely realistic gambling club. Interpretation\n\nThe mirroring of reality offers immense deceptive powers. The\nright uniform, the perfect accent, the proper propsthe deception cannot\n\n\nbe deciphered because it is enmeshed in a simulation of reality. People\nhave an intense desire and need to believe, and their first instinct is to\ntrust a well-constructed facade, to mistake it for reality. After all, we\ncannot go around doubting the reality of everything we seethat would\nbe too exhausting. We habitually accept appearances, and this is a\ncredulity you can use.\n\nIn this particular game it is the first moment that counts the most.\nIf your suckers' suspicions are not raised by their first glance at the\nmirror's reflection, they will stay suppressed. Once they enter your hall\nof mirrors, they will be unable to distinguish the real from the fake,\nand it will become easier and easier to deceive them. Remember:\nStudy the world's surfaces and learn to mirror them in your habits,\nyour manner, your clothes. Like a carnivorous plant, to unsuspecting\ninsects you will look like all the other plants in the field.\n\nAuthority: The task of a military operation is to accord\ndeceptively with the intentions of the enemy . . . get to what they want\nfirst, subtly anticipate them. Maintain discipline and adapt to the\nenemy. .. . Thus, at first you are like a maiden, so the enemy opens his\ndoor; then you are like a rabbit on the loose, so the enemy cannot keep\nyou out. (Sun-tzu, fourth century B.C.)\n\nImage: The Shield of Perseus. It is polished into a reflecting\nmirror. Medusa cannot see you, only her own hideousness reflected\nback at her. Behind such a mirror you can deceive, mock, and\ninfuriate. With one blow you sever Medusa's unsuspecting head.\n\nA WARNING: BEWARE OF MIRRORED SITUATIONS\nMirrors contain great power but also dangerous reefs, including the\nmirrored situationa situation that seems to reflect or closely resemble a\nprevious one, mostly in style and surface appearance. You can often\nback into such a situation without fully understanding it, while those\naround you understand it quite well, and compare it and you to\nwhatever happened before. Most often you suffer by the comparison,\nseeming either weaker than the previous occupant of your position or\nelse tainted by any unpleasant associations that person has left behind.\n\nIn 1864 the composer Richard Wagner moved to Munich at the\nbehest of Ludwig II, known variously as the Swan King or the Mad\nKing of Bavaria. Ludwig was Wagner's biggest fan and most generous\npatron. The strength of his support turned Wagner's headonce\n\nestablished in Munich under the king's protection, he would be able to\nsay and do whatever he wanted.\n\nWagner moved into a lavish house, which the king eventually\nbought for him. This house was but a stone's throw from the former\nhome of Lola Montez, the notorious courtesan who had plunged\nLudwig IPs grandfather into a crisis that had forced him to abdicate.\nWarned that he could be infected by this association, Wagner only\nscoffed\u201cI am no Lola Montez,\u201d he said. Soon enough, however, the\ncitizens of Munich began to resent the favors and money showered on\nWagner, and dubbed him \u201cthe second Lola,\u201d or \u201cLolotte.\u201d He\nunconsciously began to tread in Lola's footsteps spending money\nextravagantly, meddling in matters beyond music, even dabbling in\npolitics and advising the king on cabinet appointments. Meanwhile\nLudwig's affection for Wagner seemed intense and undignified for a\nking-just like his grandfather's love for Lola Montez.\n\nEventually Ludwig's ministers wrote him a letter: \u201cYour Majesty\nnow stands at a fateful parting of the ways: you have to choose\nbetween the love and respect of your faithful people and the\n\u2018friendship\u2019 of Richard Wagner.\u201d In December of 1865, Ludwig\npolitely asked his friend to leave and never return. Wagner had\ninadvertently placed himself in Lola Montez's reflection. Once there,\neverything he did reminded the stolid Bavarians of that dread woman,\nand there was nothing he could do about it.\n\nAvoid such association-effects like the plague. In a mirrored\nsituation you have little or no control over the reflections and\nrecollections that will be connected to you, and any situation beyond\nyour control is dangerous. Even if the person or event has positive\nassociations, you will suffer from not being able to live up to them,\nsince the past generally appears greater than the present. If you ever\nnotice people associating you with some past event or person, do\neverything you can to separate yourself from that memory and to\nshatter the reflection.\n\n'.

The Mirror Effect mocks and\nhumiliates them, making them overreact. By holding up a mirror to\ntheir psyches, you seduce them with the illusion that you share their\nvalues; by holding up a mirror to their actions, you teach them a\nlesson. Few can resist the power of the Mirror Effect.\n\nMIRROR EFFECTS: Preliminary Typology\n\nMirrors have the power to disturb us. Gazing at our reflection in\nthe mirror, we most often see what we want to seethe image of\nourselves with which we are most comfortable. We tend not to look\ntoo closely, ignoring the wrinkles and blemishes. But if we do look\nhard at the reflected image, we sometimes feel that we are seeing\nourselves as others see us, as a person among other people, an object\nrather than a subject. That feeling makes us shudderwe see ourselves,\nbut from the outside, minus the thoughts, spirit, and soul that fill our\nconsciousness. We are a thing.\n\nIn using Mirror Effects we symbolically re-create this disturbing\npower by mirroring the actions of other people, mimicking their\nmovements to unsettle and infuriate them. Made to feel mocked,\ncloned, objectlike, an image without a soul, they get angry. Or do the\nsame thing slightly differ-endy and they might feel disarmedyou have\nperfectly reflected their wishes and desires. This is the narcissistic\npower of mirrors. In either case, the Mirror Effect unsettles your\ntargets, whether angering or entrancing them, and in mat instant you\nhave die power to manipulate or seduce them. The Effect contains\ngreat power because it operates on the most primitive emotions.\n\nThere are four main Mirror Effects in the realm of power:\n\n\nThe Neutralizing Effect. In ancient Greek mythology, the Gorgon\nMedusa had serpents for hair, protruding tongue, massive teeth, and a\nface so ugly that anyone who gazed at her was turned into stone, out of\nfright. But the hero Perseus managed to slay Medusa by polishing his\nbronze shield into a mirror, men using the reflection in the mirror to\nguide him as he crept up and cut off her head without looking at her\ndirectly. If the shield in this instance was a mirror, the mirror also was\na kind of shield: Medusa could not see Perseus, she saw only her own\nreflected actions, and behind this screen the hero stole up and\ndestroyed her.\n\nThis is me essence of the Neutralizing Effect: Do what your\nenemies do, following their actions as best you can, and they cannot\nsee what you are up tothey are blinded by your mirror. Their strategy\nfor dealing with you depends on your reacting to them in a way\ncharacteristic of you; neutralize it by playing a game of mimicry with\nthem. The tactic has a mocking, even infuriating effect. Most of us\nremember the childhood experience of someone teasing us by\nrepeating our words exactiyafter a while, usually not long, we wanted\nto punch diem in the face. Working more subdy as an adult, you can\nstill unsettie your opponents diis way; shielding your own strategy\nwidi the mirror, you lay invisible traps, or push your opponents into\nthe trap they planned for you.\n\nThis powerful technique has been used in military strategy since\nthe days of Sun-tzu; in our own time it often appears in political\ncampaigning. It is also useful for disguising those situations in which\nyou have no particular strategy yourself. This is the Warrior's Mirror.\n\nA reverse version of the Neutralizing Effect is the Shadow: You\n\nTHE MERCHANT AND HIS ITiIEND\n\nA certain merchant once had a great desire to make a long\njourney. Now in regard that he was not very wealthy, \u201cIt is requisite,\u201d\nsaid he to himself, \u201cthat before my departure 1 should leave some part\nof my estate in the city, to the end that if I meet with ill luck in my\ntravels, I may have wherewithal to keep me at my return.\u201d To this\npurpose he delivered a great number of bars of iron, which were a\nprincipal part of his wealth, in trust to one of his friends, desiring him\nto keep them during his absence; and then, taking his leave, away he\nwent. Some time after, having had but ill luck in his travels, he\n\nreturned home; and the first thing he did was to go to his friend, and\ndemand his iron: but his friend, who owed several sums of money,\nhaving sold the iron to pay his own debts, made him this answer: \u201c\nTruly, friend,\u201d said he, \u201cI put your iron into a room that was close\nlocked, imagining it would have been there as secure as my own gold;\nbut an accident has happened which no one could have suspected, for\nthere was a rat in the room which ate it all up.\u201d The merchant,\npretending ignorance, replied, \"It is a terrible misfortune to me indeed;\nbut I know of\n\nold that rats love iron extremely; I have suffered by them many\ntimes before in the same manner, and therefore can the better bear my\npresent affliction.\u201c This answer extremely pleased the friend, who was\nglad to hear the merchant so well inclined to believe that a rat had\neaten his iron; and to remove all suspicions, desired him to dine with\nhim the next day. The merchant promised he would, but in the\nmeantime he met in the middle of the city one of his friend's children;\nthe child he carried home, and locked up in a room. The next day he\nwent to his friend, who seemed to be in great affliction, which he\nasked him the cause of, as if he had been perfectly ignorant of what\nhad happened. \u201dO, my dear friend,\u201c answered the other, \u201dI beg you to\nexcuse me, if you do not see me so cheerful as otherwise I would be; I\nhave lost one of my children; I have had him cried by sound of\ntrumpet, but I know not what is become of him. \u201c \u201dOf* replied the\nmerchant, \u201d1 am grieved to hear this; for yesterday in the evening, as I\nparted from hence, I saw an owl in the air with a child in his claws; but\nwhether it were yours I cannot tell.\u201c \u201cWhy, you most foolish and\nabsurd creature!,' replied the friend, \"are you not ashamed to tell such\nan egregious lie An owl, that weighs at\n\nshadow your opponents' every move without their seeing you.\nUse the Shadow to gather information that will neutralize their strategy\nlater on, when you will be able to thwart their every move. The\nShadow is effective because to follow the movements of others is to\ngain valuable insights into their habits and routines. The Shadow is the\npreeminent device for detectives and spies.\n\nThe Narcissus Effect. Gazing at an image in the waters of a pond,\nthe Greek youth Narcissus fell in love with it. And when he found out\nthat the image was his own reflection, and that he therefore could not\n\n\nconsummate his love, he despaired and drowned himself. All of us\nhave a similar problem: We are profoundly in love with ourselves, but\nsince this love excludes a love object outside ourselves, it remains\ncontinuously unsatisfied and unfulfilled. The Narcissus Effect plays on\nthis universal narcissism: You look deep into the souls of odier people;\nfathom their inmost desires, their values, their tastes, their spirit; and\nyou reflect it back to them, making yourself into a kind of mirror\nimage. Your ability to reflect their psyche gives you great power over\nthem; they may even feel a tinge of love.\n\nThis is simply the ability to mimic another person not physically,\nbut psychologically, and it is immensely powerful because it plays\nupon the unsatisfied self-love of a child. Normally, people bombard us\nwith their experiences, their tastes. They hardly ever make the effort to\nsee things through our eyes. This is annoying, but it also creates great\nopportunity: If you can show you understand another person by\nreflecting their inmost feelings, they will be entranced and disarmed,\nall the more so because it happens so rarely. No one can resist this\nfeeling of being harmoniously reflected in the outside world, even\nthough you might well be manufacturing it for their benefit, and for\ndeceptive purposes of your own.\n\nThe Narcissus Effect works wonders in both social life and\nbusiness; it gives us both the Seducer's and the Courtier's Mirror.\n\nThe Moral Effect The power of verbal argument is extremely\nlimited, and often accomplishes the opposite of what is intended. As\nGracian remarks, \u201cThe truth is generally seen, rarely heard.\u201d The\nMoral Effect is a perfect way to demonstrate your ideas through action.\nQuite simply, you teach others a lesson by giving them a taste of their\nown medicine.\n\nIn the Moral Effect, you mirror what other people have done to\nyou, and do so in a way that makes them realize you are doing to them\nexacdy what they did to you. You make them feel that their behavior\nhas been unpleasant, as opposed to hearing you complain and whine\nabout it, which only gets their defenses up. And as they feel the result\nof dieir actions mirrored back at them, they realize in the profoundest\nsense how they hurt or punish others with their unsocial behavior. You\nobjectify the qualities you want them to feel ashamed of and create a\nmirror in which they can gaze at their follies and learn a lesson about\n\nthemselves. This technique is often used by educators, psychologists,\nand anyone who has to deal with un-\n\npleasant and unconscious behavior. This is the Teacher's Mirror.\nWhether or not there is actually anydiing wrong witii the way people\nhave treated you, however, it can often be to your advantage to reflect\nit back to them in a way that makes them feel guilty about it.\n\nThe Hallucinatory Effect Mirrors are tremendously deceptive, for\nthey create a sense that you are looking at the real world. Actually,\nthough, you are only staring at a piece of glass, which, as everyone\nknows, cannot show the world exactly as it is: Everything in a mirror\nis reversed. When Alice goes dirough the looking glass in Lewis\nCarroll's book, she enters a world that is back-to-front, and more than\njust visually.\n\nThe Hallucinatory Effect comes from creating a perfect copy of\nan object, a place, a person. This copy acts as a kind of dummypeople\ntake it for the real thing, because it has the physical appearance of the\nreal thing. This is the preeminent technique of con artists, who\nstrategically mimic the real world to deceive you. It also has\napplications in any arena that requires camouflage. This is the\nDeceiver's Mirror.\n\nOBSERVANCES OF MIRROR EFFECTS\n\nObservance I\n\nIn February of 1815, the emperor Napoleon escaped from the\nisland of Elba, where he had been imprisoned by die allied forces of\nEurope, and returned to Paris in a march that stirred the French nation,\nrallying troops and citizens of all classes to his side and chasing his\nsuccessor, King Louis XVIII, off the throne. By March, however,\nhaving reestablished himself in power, he had to face the fact that\nFrance's situation had gravely changed. The country was devastated,\nhe had no allies among the other European nations, and his most loyal\nand important ministers had deserted him or left the country. Only one\nman remained from die old regimeJoseph Fouche, his former minister\nof police.\n\nNapoleon had relied on Fouche to do his dirty work throughout\nhis previous reign, but he had never been able to figure his minister\nout. He kept a corps of agents to spy on all of his ministers, so that he\nwould always have an edge on them, but no one had gotten anything\n\non Fouche. If suspected of some misdeed, the minister would not get\nangry or take the accusation personallyhe would submit, nod, smile,\nand change colors chameleonlike, adapting to tiie requirements of die\nmoment. At first diis had seemed somewhat pleasant and charming,\nbut after a while it frustrated Napoleon, who felt outdone by this\nslippery man. At one time or another he had fired all of his most\nimportant ministers, including Talleyrand, but he never touched\nFouche. And so, in 1815, back in power and in need of help, he felt he\nhad no choice but to reappoint Fouche as his minister of police.\n\nSeveral weeks into his new reign, Napoleon's spies told him they\nbe-\n\nmost not above two or three pounds, can he carry a boy that\nweighs above fifty\u201c \u201dWhy, \u201c replied the merchant, \u201ddo you make such\na wonder at that As if in a country where one rat can eat a hundred\ntons ' weight of iron, it were such a wonder for an owl to carry a child\nthat weighs not over fifty pounds in all!\" The friend, upon this, found\nthat the merchant was no such fool as he took him to be, begged his\npardon for the cheat which he designed to have put upon him, restored\nhim the value of his iron, and so had his son again. ,\n\nIndia,\n\nfourth century\n\nWhen you have come to grips and are striving together with the\nenemy, and you realize that you cannot advance, you \u201csoak in\u201d and\nbecome one with the enemy.

The dinner wasn 't elaborate Being habitually mean, He didn 't go\nin for haute cuisine In fact it consisted of a shallow plate Of thin gruel.\nWithin a minute Our joker had lapped his plate clean; Meanwhile his\nguest. fishing away with her beak, Got not a morsel in it. To pay him\nback for this cruel Practical joke, the stork invited The fox to dinner\nthe following week. \u201cI should be delighted,\u201d He replied; \u201c When it\n\ncomes to friends I never stand upon pride. \u201d Punctually on the day he\nran To his hostess's house and at once began Praising everything:\n\u201cWhat taste! What chic! And the fooddone just to a turn!\u201d Then sat\ndown with a hearty appetite (Foxes are always ready to eat) And\nsavored the delicious smell of meat. It was minced meat and servedto\nserve him right! In a long-necked, narrow-mouthed urn. The stork,\neasily stooping, Enjoyed her fill With her long bill; His snout, though,\n\nlieved Fouche was in secret contact with ministers of foreign\ncountries, including Metternich of Austria. Afraid that his most\nvaluable minister was betraying him to his enemies, Napoleon had to\nfind out the truth before it was too late. He could not confront Fouche\ndirectlyin person the man was as slippery as an eel. He needed hard\nproof.\n\nThis seemed to come in April, when the emperor's private police\ncap tured a Viennese gentleman who had come to Paris to pass\ninformation on to Fouche. Ordering the man brought before him,\nNapoleon threatened to shoot him then and mere unless he confessed;\nthe man broke down and admitted he had given Fouche a letter from\nMetternich, written in invisible ink, arranging for a secret meeting of\nspecial agents in Basel. Napoleon accordingly ordered one of his own\nagents to infiltrate this meeting. If Fouche was indeed planning to\nbetray him, he would finally be caught red-handed and would hang.\n\nNapoleon waited impatiently for the agent's return, but to his\nbewilderment the agent showed up days later reporting that he had\nheard nothing that would implicate Fouche in a conspiracy. In fact it\nseemed that the other agents present suspected Fouche of double-\ncrossing them, as if he were working for Napoleon all along. Napoleon\ndid not believe this for an instantFouche had somehow outwitted him\nagain.\n\nThe following morning Fouche visited Napoleon, and remarked,\n\u201cBy me way, sire, I never told you tiiat I had a letter from Metternich a\nfew days ago; my mind was so full of things of greater moment.\nBesides, his emissary omitted to give me die powder needed to make\ndie writing legible. . . . Here at lengdi is the letter.\u201d Sure that Fouche\nwas toying widi him, Napoleon exploded, \u201cYou are a traitor, Fouche! I\nought to have you hanged.\u201d He continued to harangue Fouche, but\ncould not fire him without proof. Fouche only expressed amazement at\n\ndie emperor's words, but inwardly he smiled, for all along he had been\nplaying a mirroring game. Interpretation\n\nFouche had known for years that Napoleon kept on top of those\naround him by spying on them day and night. The minister had\nsurvived this game by having his own spies spy on Napoleon's spies,\ndius neutralizing any action Napoleon might take against him. In the\ncase of die meeting in Basel, he even turned die tables: Knowing about\nNapoleon's double agent, he set it up so that it would appear as if\nFouche were a loyal double agent too.\n\nFouche gained power and flourished in a period of great tumult\nby mirroring those around him. During the French Revolution he was a\nradical Jacobin; after die Terror he became a moderate republican; and\nunder Napoleon he became a committed imperialist whom Napoleon\nennobled and made die duke of Otranto. If Napoleon took up the\nweapon of digging up dirt on people, Fouche made sure he had die dirt\non Napoleon, as well as on everyone else. This also allowed him to\npredict die emperor's plans and desires, so that he could echo his boss's\nsentiments before he had even uttered diem. Shielding his actions witii\na mirror strategy, Fouche could also plot offensive moves widiout\nbeing caught in die act.\n\nThis is the power of mirroring those around you. First, you give\npeople\n\nthe feeling that you share their thoughts and goals. Second, if they\nsuspect you have ulterior motives, the mirror shields you from them,\npreventing them from figuring out your strategy. Eventually this will\ninfuriate and unsettle them. By playing the double, you steal their\nthunder, suck away dieir initiative, make them feel helpless. You also\ngain die ability to choose when and how to unsettle themanother\navenue to power. And the mirror saves you mental energy: simply\nechoing die moves of others gives you the space you need to develop a\nstrategy of your own.\n\nObservance II\n\nEarly on in his career, the ambitious statesman and general\nAlcibiades of Athens (450-404 B.C.) fashioned a formidable weapon\nthat became the source of his power. In every encounter widi odiers, he\nwould sense dieir moods and tastes, then carefully tailor his words and\nactions to mirror their inmost desires. He would seduce diem with the\n\nidea that dieir values were superior to everyone else's, and that his goal\nwas to model himself on them or help them realize dieir dreams. Few\ncould resist his charm.\n\nThe first man to fall under his spell was die philosopher Socrates.\nAlcibiades represented the opposite of the Socratic ideal of simplicity\nand uprightness: He lived lavishly and was completely unprincipled.\nWhenever he met Socrates, however, he mirrored the older man's\nsobriety, eating simply, accompanying Socrates on long walks, and\ntalking only of philosophy and virtue. Socrates was not completely\nfooledhe was not unaware of Alcibiades' otiier life. But diat only made\nhim vulnerable to a logic that flattered him: Only in my presence, he\nfelt, does this man submit to a virtuous influence; only I have such\npower over him. This feeling intoxicated Socrates, who became\nAlcibiades' fervent admirer and supporter, one day even risking his\nown life to rescue the young man in battle.\n\nThe Adienians considered Alcibiades dieir greatest orator, for he\nhad an uncanny ability to tune in to his audience's aspirations, and\nmirror their desires. He made his greatest speeches in support of die\ninvasion of Sicily, which he diought would bring great wealth to\nAdiens and limidess glory to himself. The speeches gave expression to\nyoung Adienians' thirst to conquer lands for themselves, rather than\nliving off die victories of their ancestors. But he also tailored his words\nto reflect older men's nostalgia for die glory years when Adiens led die\nGreeks against Persia, and dien went on to create an empire. All\nAthens now dreamed of conquering Sicily; Alcibiades' plan was\napproved, and he was made the expedition's commander.\n\nWhile Alcibiades was leading die invasion of Sicily, however,\ncertain Adienians fabricated charges against him of profaning sacred\nstatues. He knew his enemies would have him executed if he returned\nhome, so at die last minute he deserted the Adienian fleet and defected\nto Athens's bitter enemy, Sparta. The Spartans welcomed this great\nman to their side, but diey knew his reputation and were wary of him.\nAlcibiades loved luxury; die Spartans were a warrior people who\nworshipped austerity, and they were afraid he would corrupt their\nyouth. But much to dieir relief, the Al-\n\nbeing the wrong shape and size, He had to return to his den\n\nEmpty-bellied, tail dragging, ears drooping,\n\nAs red in the face as a fox who's been caught by a hen.\n\nselected fables, Jean de La Fontaine, 1621-1695\n\nWhen I wish to find out how wise, or how stupid, or how good, or\nhow wicked is any one, or what are his thoughts at the moment, I\nfashion the expression of my face, as accurately as possible, in\naccordance with the expression of his, and then wait to see what\nthoughts or sentiments arise in my mind or heart, as if to match or\ncorrespond with the expression.\n\nEdgar Allan Poe, 1809-1849\n\nLorenzo [de' Medici] lost no opportunity of increasing the respect\nwhich Pope Innocent now felt for him and of gaining his friendship, if\npossible his affection. He took the trouble to discover the Pope's tastes\nand indulged them accordingly. He sent him ... casks of his favourite\nwine.... He sent him courteous, flattering letters in which he assured\nhim, when the Pope was ill, that he felt his sufferings as though they\nwere his own, in which he encouraged him with such fortifying\nstatements as \u201ca Pope is what he wills to be, \u201d and in which, as though\nincidentally, he included his views on the proper course of papal\npolicies. Innocent was gratified by Lorenzo's attentions and convinced\nby his arguments.... So completely, indeed, did he come to share his\nopinions that, as the disgruntled Ferrarese ambassador put it, \u201cthe Pope\nsleeps with the eyes of the Magnificent Lorenzo. \u201d\n\nthe house\n\nof medici:\n\nits rise and fall,\n\nChristopher Hibbert,\n\ncibiades who arrived in Sparta was not at all what they expected:\nHe wore his hair untrimmed (as they did), took cold baths, ate coarse\nbread and black broth, and wore simple domes. To the Spartans this\nsignified mat he had come to see their way of life as superior to the\nAthenian; greater than they were, he had chosen to be a Spartan rather\nthan being born one, and should thus be honored above all others.\nThey fell under his spell and gave him great powers. Unfortunately\nAlcibiades rarely knew how to rein in his charmhe managed to seduce\nthe king of Sparta's wife and make her pregnant. When this became\npublic he once more had to flee for his life.\n\nThis time Alcibiades defected to Persia, where he suddenly went\nfrom Spartan simplicity to embracing die lavish Persian lifestyle down\nto the last detail. It was of course immensely flattering to the Persians\nto see a Greek of Alcibiades' stature prefer their culture over his own,\nand they showered him with honors, land, and power. Once seduced by\nthe mirror, they failed to notice that behind this shield Alcibiades was\nplaying a double game, se-credy helping the Athenians in their war\nwith Sparta and thus reingratiat-ing himself with the city to which he\ndesperately wanted to return, and which welcomed him back with open\narms in 408 B.C. Interpretation\n\nEarly in his political career, Alcibiades made a discovery that\nchanged his whole approach to power: He had a colorful and forceful\npersonality, but when he argued his ideas strongly with other people he\nwould win over a few while at the same time alienating many more.\nThe secret to gaining ascendancy over large numbers, he came to\nbelieve, was not to impose his colors but to absorb the colors of those\naround him, like a chameleon. Once people fell for the trick, the\ndeceptions he went on to practice would be invisible to them.\n\nUnderstand: Everyone is wrapped up in their own narcissistic\nshell. When you try to impose your own ego on them, a wall goes up,\nresistance is increased. By mirroring them, however, you seduce them\ninto a kind of narcissistic rapture: They are gazing at a double of their\nown soul. This double is actually manufactured in its entirety by you.\nOnce you have used the mirror to seduce them, you have great power\nover them.\n\nIt is worth noting, however, the dangers in the promiscuous use of\nthe mirror. In Alcibiades' presence people felt larger, as if their egos\nhad been doubled. But once he left, they felt empty and diminished,\nand when they saw him mirroring completely different people as\ntotally as he had mirrored them, they felt not just diminished but\nbetrayed. Alcibiades' overuse of the Mirror Effect made whole peoples\nfeel used, so that he constandy had to flee from one place to another.\nIndeed Alcibiades so angered the Spartans that they finally had him\nmurdered. He had gone too far. The Seducer's Mirror must be used\nwith caution and discrimination.\n\nObservance III\n\nIn 1652 the recendy widowed Baroness Mancini moved her\nfamily from\n\nRome to Paris, where she could count on the influence and\nprotection of\n\nher brother Cardinal Mazarin, the French prime minister. Of the\nbaroness's five daughters, four dazzled the court with their beauty and\nhigh spirits. These infamously charming nieces of Cardinal Mazarin\nbecame known as the Mazarinettes, and soon found themselves invited\nto all the most important court functions.\n\nOne daughter, Marie Mancini, did not share this good fortune, for\nshe lacked the beauty and grace of her sisterswho, along with her\nmother and even Cardinal Mazarin, eventually came to dislike her, for\nthey felt she spoiled the family image. They tried to persuade her to\nenter a convent, where she would be less of an embarrassment, but she\nrefused. Instead she applied herself to her studies, learning Latin and\nGreek, perfecting her French, and practicing her musical skills. On the\nrare occasions when the family would let her attend court affairs, she\ntrained herself to be an artful listener, sizing people up for their\nweaknesses and hidden desires. And when she finally met the future\nKing Louis XIV, in 1657 (Louis was seventeen years old, Marie\neighteen), she decided that to spite her family and uncle, she would\nfind a way to make this young man fall in love with her.\n\nThis was a seemingly impossible task for such a plain-looking\ngirl, but Marie studied the future king closely. She noticed that her\nsisters\u2019 frivolity did not please him, and she sensed that he loathed the\nscheming and petty politicking that went on all around him. She saw\nthat he had a romantic na-turehe read adventure novels, insisted on\nmarching at the head of his armies, and had high ideals and a passion\nfor glory. The court did not feed these fantasies of his; it was a banal,\nsuperficial world that bored him.\n\nThe key to Louis's heart, Marie saw, would be to construct a\nmirror reflecting his fantasies and his youthful yearnings for glory and\nromance. To begin with she immersed herself in the romantic novels,\npoems, and plays that she knew the young king read voraciously.\nWhen Louis began to engage her in conversation, to his delight she\nwould talk of the things that stirred his soulnot this fashion or that\npiece of gossip, but rather courtly love, the deeds of great knights, the\n\nnobility of past kings and heroes. She fed his thirst for glory by\ncreating an image of an august, superior king whom he could aspire to\nbecome. She stirred his imagination.\n\nAs the future Sun King spent more and more time in Marie's\npresence, it eventually became clear that he had fallen in love with the\nleast likely young woman of the court. To the horror of her sisters and\nmother, he showered Marie Mancini with attention. He brought her\nalong on his military campaigns, and made a show of stationing her\nwhere she could watch as he marched into battle. He even promised\nMarie that he would marry her and make her queen.\n\nMazarin, however, would never allow the king to marry his niece,\na woman who could bring France no diplomatic or royal alliances.\nLouis had to marry a princess of Spain or Austria. In 1658 Louis\nsuccumbed to the pressure and agreed to break off the first romantic\ninvolvement of his life. He did so with much regret, and at the end of\nhis life he acknowledged that he never loved anyone as much as Marie\nMancini.\n\nWittgenstein had an extraordinary gift for divining the thoughts of\nthe person with whom he was engaged in discussion. While the other\nstruggled to put his thought into words, Wittgenstein would perceive\nwhat it was and state it for him. This power of his, which sometimes\nseemed uncanny, was made possible, I am sure, by his own prolonged\nand continuous researches.\n\nLUDWIO WITTGENSTEIN: A MEMOIR,\n\nNorman Malcolm. 1958\n\nThe doctor should be opaque to his patients, and like a mirror,\nshould show them nothing but what is shown to him.\n\nSigmund Freud, 1856-1939\n\nInterpretation\n\nMarie Mancini played the seducer's game to perfection. First, she\ntook a step back, to study her prey. Seduction often fails to get past the\nfirst step because it is too aggressive; the first move must always be a\nretreat. By studying the king from a distance Marie saw what\ndistinguished him from otiiershis high ideals, romantic nature, and\nsnobbish disdain for petty politics. Marie's next step was to make a\nmirror for these hidden yearnings on Louis's part, letting him glimpse\nwhat he himself could bea godlike king!\n\nThis mirror had several functions: Satisfying Louis's ego by\ngiving him a double to look at, it also focused on him so exclusively as\nto give him the feeling that Marie existed for him alone. Surrounded\nby a pack of scheming courtiers who only had their own self-interest at\nheart, he could not fail to be touched by this devotional focus. Finally\nMarie's mirror set up an ideal for him to live up to: the noble knight of\nthe medieval court. To a soul both romantic and ambitious, nothing\ncould be more intoxicating than to have someone hold up an idealized\nreflection of him. In effect it was Marie Mancini who created the\nimage of die Sun Kingindeed Louis later admitted the enormous part\nshe had played in fashioning his radiant self-image.\n\nThis is the power of the Seducer's Mirror: By doubling the tastes\nand ideals of the target, it shows your attention to his or her\npsychology, an attention more charming than any aggressive pursuit.\nFind out what sets the other person apart, then hold up the mirror that\nwill reflect it and bring it out of diem. Feed their fantasies of power\nand greatness by reflecting their ideals, and they will succumb.\n\nObservance IV\n\nIn 1538, with the death of his mother, Helena, the eight-year-old\nfuture czar Ivan IV (or Ivan the Terrible) of Russia became an orphan.\nFor the next five years he watched as the princely class, the boyars,\nterrorized the country. Now and then, to mock the young Ivan, they\nwould make him wear a crown and scepter and place him on the\nthrone. When the little boy's feet dangled over the edge of the chair,\nthey would laugh and lift him off it, handing him from man to man in\nthe air, making him feel his helplessness compared to them.\n\nWhen Ivan was thirteen, he boldly murdered the boyar leader and\nascended to the dirone. For the next few decades he struggled to\nsubdue the boyars' power, but they continued to defy him. By 1575 his\nefforts to transform Russia and defeat its enemies had exhausted him.\nMeanwhile, his subjects were complaining bitterly about his endless\nwars, his secret police, the unvanquished and oppressive boyars. His\nown ministers began to question his moves. Finally he had had\nenough. In 1564 he had temporarily abandoned the throne, forcing his\nsubjects to call him back to power. Now he took the strategy a step\nfurther, and abdicated.\n\nTo take his place Ivan elevated a general of his, Simeon\nBekbulatovich,\n\nto the throne. But although Simeon had recently converted to\nChristianity, he was by birth a Tartar, and his enthronement was an\ninsult to Ivan's subjects, since Russians looked down on the Tartars as\ninferiors and infidels. Yet Ivan ordered that all Russians, including the\nboyars, pledge obedience to their new ruler. And while Simeon moved\ninto the Kremlin, Ivan lived in a humble house on Moscow's outskirts,\nrom which he would sometimes visit the palace, bow before the\nthrone, sit among the other boyars, and humbly petition Simeon for\n\u2018avors.\n\nOver time it became clear that Simeon was a kind of king's\ndouble. He dressed like Ivan, and acted like Ivan, but he had no real\npower, since no one would really obey him. The boyars at the court\nwho were old enough to remember taunting Ivan when he was a boy,\nby placing him on the throne, saw the connection: They had made Ivan\neel like a weak pretender, so now he mirrored them by placing a weak\npretender of his own on the throne.\n\nFor two long years Ivan held the mirror of Simeon up to the\nRussian people. The mirror said: Your whining and disobedience have\nmade me a czar widi no real power, so I will reflect back to you a czar\nwith no real power. You have treated me disrespectfully, so I will do\nthe same to you, making Russia the laughingstock of the world. In\n1577, in the name of the Russian people, the chastised boyars once\nagain begged Ivan to return to the throne, which he did. He lived as\nczar until his death, in 1584, and the conspiracies, complaining, and\nsecond-guessing disappeared along with Simeon. Interpretation\n\nIn 1564, after threatening to abdicate, Ivan had been granted\nabsolute powers. But these powers had slowly been chipped away as\nevery sector of societythe boyars, the church, the governmentvied for\nmore control. Foreign wars had exhausted the country, internal\nbickering had increased, and Ivan's attempts to respond had been met\nwidi scorn. Russia had turned into a kind of boisterous classroom in\nwhich the pupils laughed openly at the teacher. If he raised his voice or\ncomplained, he only met more resistance. He had to teach them a\nlesson, give them a taste of meir own medicine. Simeon Bekbulatovich\nwas the mirror he used to do so.\n\n\nAfter two years in which the throne had been an object of ridicule\nand disgust, the Russian people learned their lesson. They wanted their\nczar back, conceding to him all the dignity and respect that the position\nshould always have commanded. For the rest of his reign, Russia and\nIvan got along fine.\n\nUnderstand: People are locked in their own experiences. When\nyou whine about some insensitivity on their part, they may seem to\nunderstand, but inwardly they are untouched and even more resistant.\nThe goal of power is always to lower people's resistance to you. For\nmis you need tricks, and one trick is to teach them a lesson.\n\nInstead of haranguing people verbally, then, create a kind of\nmirror of their behavior. In doing so you leave them two choices: They\ncan ignore\n\nyou, or they can start to think about themselves. And even if tfiey\nignore you, you will have planted a seed in their unconscious that will\neventually take root. When you mirror their behavior, incidentally, do\nnot be afraid to add a touch of caricature and exaggeration, as Ivan did\nby entiironing a Tartarit is the little spice in die soup mat will open\ndieir eyes and make diem see the ridiculousness in dieir own actions.\n\nObservance V\n\nDr. Milton H. Erickson, a pioneer in strategic psychodierapy,\nwould often educate his patients powerfully but indirectly by creating\na kind of mirror effect. Constructing an analogy to make patients see\nthe trutii on their own, he would bypass their resistance to change.\nWhen Dr. Erickson treated married couples complaining of sexual\nproblems, for instance, he often found that psychotherapy's tradition of\ndirect confrontation and problem-airing only heightened the spouses'\nresistance and sharpened their differences. Instead, he would draw a\nhusband and wife out on other topics, often banal ones, trying to find\nan analogy for die sexual conflict.\n\nIn one couple's first session, the pair were discussing their eating\nhabits, especially at dinner. The wife preferred die leisurely approacha\ndrink before the meal, some appetizers, and then a small main course,\nall at a slow, civilized pace. This frustrated the husbandhe wanted to\nget dinner over quickly and to dig right into the main course, the\nbigger the better. As the conversation continued, the couple began to\ncatch glimpses of an analogy to their problems in bed. The moment\n\n\nthey made tiiis connection, however, Dr. Erickson would change the\nsubject, carefully avoiding a discussion of the real problem.\n\nThe couple diought Erickson was just getting to know them and\nwould deal widi the problem direcdy die next time he saw diem. But at\ndie end of diis first session, Dr. Erickson directed them to arrange a\ndinner a few nights away tiiat would combine each person's desire:\nThe wife would get the slow meal, including time spent bonding, and\nthe husband would get the big dishes he wanted to eat. Widiout\nrealizing they were acting under the doctor's gende guidance, the\ncouple would walk into a mirror of their problem, and in the mirror\nthey would solve their problems themselves, ending die evening just as\nthe doctor had hopedby mirroring the improved dinner dynamics in\nbed.\n\nIn dealing with more severe problems, such as die schizophrenic's\nmirror fantasy world of his or her own construction, Dr. Erickson\nwould always try to enter the mirror and work within it. He once\ntreated a hospital inmate who believed he was Jesus Christdraping\nsheets around his body, talking in vague parables, and bombarding\nstaff and patients widi endless Christian proselytizing. No therapy or\ndrugs seemed to work, until one day Dr. Erickson went up to die young\nman and said, \u201cI understand you have had experience as a carpenter.\u201d\nBeing Christ, the patient had to say that he had had such experience,\nand Erickson immediately put him to work building bookcases and\notiier useful items, allowing him to wear his Jesus garb. Over the next\nweeks, as the patient worked on diese projects,\n\nhis mind became less occupied with Jesus fantasies and more\nfocused on his labor. As the carpentry work took precedence, a psychic\nshift took effect: The religious fantasies remained, but faded\ncomfortably into the background, allowing the man to function in\nsociety. Interpretation\n\nCommunication depends on metaphors and symbols, which are\nthe basis of language itself. A metaphor is a kind of mirror to the\nconcrete and real, which it often expresses more clearly and deeply\nthan a literal description does. When you are dealing with the\nintractable willpower of other people, direct communication often only\nheightens their resistance.\n\n\nThis happens most clearly when you complain about people's\nbehavior, particularly in sensitive areas such as their lovemaking. You\nwill effect a far more lasting change if, like Dr. Erickson, you construct\nan analogy, a symbolic mirror of the situation, and guide the other\nthrough it. As Christ himself understood, talking in parables is often\nthe best way to teach a lesson, for it allows people to realize the truth\non tfieir own.\n\nWhen dealing with people who are lost in the reflections of\nfantasy worlds (including a host of people who do not live in mental\nhospitals), never try to push them into reality by shattering their\nmirrors. Instead, enter meir world and operate inside it, under their\ntules, gently guiding them out of the hall of mirrors tiiey have entered.\n\nObservance VI\n\nThe great sixteenth-century Japanese tea master Takeno Sho-o\nonce passed by a house and noticed a young man watering flowers\nnear his front gate. Two things caught Sho-o's attentionfirst, the\ngraceful way the man performed his task; and, second, the stunningly\nbeautiful rose of Sharon blossoms that bloomed in the garden. He\nstopped and introduced himself to the man, whose name was Sen no\nRikyu. Shoo wanted to stay, but he had a prior engagement and had to\nhurry off. Before he left, however, Rikyu invited him to take tea with\nhim the following morning. Sho-o happily accepted.\n\nWhen Sho-o opened the garden gate the next day, he was\nhorrified to see that not a single flower remained. More than anything\nelse, he had come to see the rose of Sharon blossoms that he had not\nhad the time to appreciate the day before; now, disappointed, he started\nto leave, but at the gate he stopped himself, and decided to enter Sen\nno Rikyu's tea room. Immediately inside, he stopped in his tracks and\ngazed in astonishment: Before him a vase hung from the ceiling, and in\nthe vase stood a single rose of Sharon blossom, the most beautiful in\nthe garden. Somehow Sen no Rikyu had read his guest's thoughts, and,\nwith this one eloquent gesture, had demonstrated that this day guest\nand host would be in perfect harmony.\n\nSen no Rikyu went on to become the most famous tea master of\nall, and his trademark was this uncanny ability to harmonize himself\nwith his guests' tfioughts and to think one step ahead, enchanting them\nby adapting to their taste.\n\n\nOne day Rikyu was invited to tea by Yamashina Hechigwan, an\nad-\n\nmirer of the tea ceremony but also a man with a vivid sense of\nhumor. When Rikyu arrived at Hechigwan's home, he found the garden\ngate shut, so he opened it to look for the host. On the other side of the\ngate he saw that someone had first dug a ditch, then carefully covered\nit over widi canvas and earth. Realizing that Hechigwan had planned a\npractical joke, he obligingly walked right into the ditch, muddying his\nclothes in the process.\n\nApparently horrified, Hechigwan came running out, and hurried\nRikyu to a bath mat for some inexplicable reason stood already\nprepared. After bathing, Rikyu joined Hechigwan in the tea ceremony,\nwhich both enjoyed immensely, sharing a laugh about the accident.\nLater Sen no Rikyu explained to a friend that he had heard about\nHechigwan's practical joke beforehand, \u201cBut since it should always be\none's aim to conform to the wishes of one's host, I fell into the hole\nknowingly and thus assured the success of the meeting. Tea is by no\nmeans mere obsequiousness, but there is no tea where the host and\nguest are not in harmony with one another.\u201d Hechigwan's vision of the\ndignified Sen no Rikyu at the bottom of a ditch had pleased him\nendlessly, but Rikyu had gained a pleasure of his own in complying\nwith his host's wish and watching him amuse himself in this way.\nInterpretation\n\nSen no Rikyu was no magician or seerhe watched those around\nhim acutely, plumbing the subde gestures that revealed a hidden desire,\nthen producing that desire's image. Although Sho-o never spoke of\nbeing enchanted by the rose of Sharon blossoms, Rikyu read it in his\neyes. If mirroring a person's desires meant falling into a ditch, so be it.\nRikyu's power resided in his skillful use of the Courtier's Mirror,\nwhich gave him the appearance of an unusual ability to see into other\npeople.\n\nLearn to manipulate die Courtier's Mirror, for it will bring you\ngreat power. Study people's eyes, follow their gesturessurer barometers\nof pain and pleasure than any spoken word. Notice and remember the\ndetailsthe doming, the choice of friends, the daily habits, the tossed-out\nremarks that reveal hidden and rarely indulged desires. Soak it all in,\nfind out what lies under the surface, then make yourself the mirror of\n\ntheir unspoken selves. That is the key to this power: The other person\nhas not asked for your consideration, has not mentioned his pleasure in\nthe rose of Sharon, and when you reflect it back to him his pleasure is\nheightened because it is unasked for. Remember: The wordless\ncommunication, the indirect compliment, contains the most power. No\none can resist the enchantment of the Courtier's Mirror.\n\nObservance VII\n\nYellow Kid Weil, con artist extraordinaire, used the Deceiver's\nMirror in his most brilliant cons. Most audacious of all was his re-\ncreation of a bank in Muncie, Indiana. When Weil read one day that\nthe Merchants Bank in Muncie had moved, he saw an opportunity he\ncould not pass up.\n\nWeil rented out the original Merchants building, which still\ncontained bank furniture, complete with teller windows. He bought\nmoney bags,\n\nstenciled a bank's invented name on them, filled them with steel\nwashers, and arrayed them impressively behind the teller windows,\nalong with bundles of boodlereal bills hiding newspaper cut to size.\nFor his bank's staff and customers Weil hired gamblers, bookies, girls\nrom local bawdy houses, and other assorted confederates. He even\nhad a local thug pose as a bank dick.\nClaiming to be the broker for a certificate investment the bank\nwas offering, Weil would fish the waters and hook the proper wealthy\nsucker. He would bring this man to the bank and ask to see the\npresident. An \u201cofficer\u201d of the bank would tell them that they had to\nwait, which only heightened the realism of the conone always has to\nwait to see the bank president. And as they waited the bank would\nbustle with banklike activity, as call girls and bookies in disguise\nfloated in and out, making deposits and withdrawals and tipping their\nhats to the phony bank dick. Lulled by this perfect copy of reality, the\nsucker would deposit $50,000 into the fake bank without a worry in\nthe world.\n\nOver the years Weil did the same thing with a deserted yacht club,\nan abandoned brokerage office, a relocated real estate office, and a\ncompletely realistic gambling club. Interpretation\n\nThe mirroring of reality offers immense deceptive powers. The\nright uniform, the perfect accent, the proper propsthe deception cannot\n\n\nbe deciphered because it is enmeshed in a simulation of reality. People\nhave an intense desire and need to believe, and their first instinct is to\ntrust a well-constructed facade, to mistake it for reality. After all, we\ncannot go around doubting the reality of everything we seethat would\nbe too exhausting. We habitually accept appearances, and this is a\ncredulity you can use.\n\nIn this particular game it is the first moment that counts the most.\nIf your suckers' suspicions are not raised by their first glance at the\nmirror's reflection, they will stay suppressed. Once they enter your hall\nof mirrors, they will be unable to distinguish the real from the fake,\nand it will become easier and easier to deceive them. Remember:\nStudy the world's surfaces and learn to mirror them in your habits,\nyour manner, your clothes. Like a carnivorous plant, to unsuspecting\ninsects you will look like all the other plants in the field.\n\nAuthority: The task of a military operation is to accord\ndeceptively with the intentions of the enemy . . . get to what they want\nfirst, subtly anticipate them. Maintain discipline and adapt to the\nenemy. .. . Thus, at first you are like a maiden, so the enemy opens his\ndoor; then you are like a rabbit on the loose, so the enemy cannot keep\nyou out. (Sun-tzu, fourth century B.C.)\n\nImage: The Shield of Perseus. It is polished into a reflecting\nmirror. Medusa cannot see you, only her own hideousness reflected\nback at her. Behind such a mirror you can deceive, mock, and\ninfuriate. With one blow you sever Medusa's unsuspecting head.\n\nA WARNING: BEWARE OF MIRRORED SITUATIONS\nMirrors contain great power but also dangerous reefs, including the\nmirrored situationa situation that seems to reflect or closely resemble a\nprevious one, mostly in style and surface appearance. You can often\nback into such a situation without fully understanding it, while those\naround you understand it quite well, and compare it and you to\nwhatever happened before. Most often you suffer by the comparison,\nseeming either weaker than the previous occupant of your position or\nelse tainted by any unpleasant associations that person has left behind.\n\nIn 1864 the composer Richard Wagner moved to Munich at the\nbehest of Ludwig II, known variously as the Swan King or the Mad\nKing of Bavaria. Ludwig was Wagner's biggest fan and most generous\npatron. The strength of his support turned Wagner's headonce\n\nestablished in Munich under the king's protection, he would be able to\nsay and do whatever he wanted.\n\nWagner moved into a lavish house, which the king eventually\nbought for him. This house was but a stone's throw from the former\nhome of Lola Montez, the notorious courtesan who had plunged\nLudwig IPs grandfather into a crisis that had forced him to abdicate.\nWarned that he could be infected by this association, Wagner only\nscoffed\u201cI am no Lola Montez,\u201d he said. Soon enough, however, the\ncitizens of Munich began to resent the favors and money showered on\nWagner, and dubbed him \u201cthe second Lola,\u201d or \u201cLolotte.\u201d He\nunconsciously began to tread in Lola's footsteps spending money\nextravagantly, meddling in matters beyond music, even dabbling in\npolitics and advising the king on cabinet appointments. Meanwhile\nLudwig's affection for Wagner seemed intense and undignified for a\nking-just like his grandfather's love for Lola Montez.\n\nEventually Ludwig's ministers wrote him a letter: \u201cYour Majesty\nnow stands at a fateful parting of the ways: you have to choose\nbetween the love and respect of your faithful people and the\n\u2018friendship\u2019 of Richard Wagner.\u201d In December of 1865, Ludwig\npolitely asked his friend to leave and never return. Wagner had\ninadvertently placed himself in Lola Montez's reflection. Once there,\neverything he did reminded the stolid Bavarians of that dread woman,\nand there was nothing he could do about it.\n\nAvoid such association-effects like the plague. In a mirrored\nsituation you have little or no control over the reflections and\nrecollections that will be connected to you, and any situation beyond\nyour control is dangerous. Even if the person or event has positive\nassociations, you will suffer from not being able to live up to them,\nsince the past generally appears greater than the present. If you ever\nnotice people associating you with some past event or person, do\neverything you can to separate yourself from that memory and to\nshatter the reflection.\n\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Below is an excerpt from my book titled '48 Laws of Power', specifically from Chapter '48 Laws of Power', Section 'LAW 45'. The original text is: 'PREACH THE NEED\n\nFOR CHANGE, BUT\n\nNEVER REFORM\n\nTOO MUCH AT ONCE\n\nJUDGMENT\n\nEveryone understands the need for change in the abstract, but on\nthe day-to-day level people are creatures of habit. Too much\ninnovation is traumatic, and will lead to revolt. If you are new to a\nposition of power, or an outsider trying to build a power base, make a\nshow of respecting the old way of doing things. If change is necessary,\nmake it feel like a gentle improvement on the past.\n\nTRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW,\n\nSometime in die early 1520s, King Henry VIII of England\ndecided to divorce his wife, Catfierine of Aragon, because she had\nfailed to bear him a son, and because he had fallen in love with die\nyoung and comely Anne Boleyn. The pope, Clement VII, opposed die\ndivorce, and threatened die king widi excommunication. The king's\nmost powerful minister, Cardinal Wolsey, also saw no need for\ndivorceand his halfhearted support of die king cost him his position\nand soon his life.\n\nOne man in Henry's cabinet, Thomas Cromwell, not only\nsupported him in his desire for a divorce but had an idea for realizing\nit! a complete break widi die past. He convinced die king mat by\nsevering ties widi Rome and making himself the head of a newly\nformed English church, he could divorce Cadierine and marry Anne.\nBy 1531 Henry saw diis as die only solution. To reward Cromwell for\nhis simple but brilliant idea, he elevated diis son of a blacksmitii to die\npost of royal councillor.\n\nBy 1534 Cromwell had been named die king's secretary, and as\nme power behind die dirone he had become die most powerful man in\nEngland. But for him die break widi Rome went beyond die\n\n\nsatisfaction of die king's carnal desires: He envisioned a new\nProtestant order in England, wim die power of die Cadiolic Church\nsmashed and its vast wealdi in the hands of die king and die\ngovernment. In diat same year he initiated a complete survey of die\nchurches and monasteries of England. And as it turned out, die\ntreasures and moneys diat die churches had accumulated over me\ncenturies were far more tiian he had imagined; his spies and agents\ncame back widi astonishing figures.\n\nTo justify his schemes, Cromwell circulated stories about die\ncorruption in die English monasteries, dieir abuse of power, their\nexploitation of die people tiiey supposedly served. Having won\nParhament's support for breaking up die monasteries, he began to seize\nmeir holdings and to put diem out of existence one by one. At die same\ntime, he began to impose Protestantism, introducing reforms in\nreligious ritual and punishing tiiose who stuck to Cadiolicism, and who\nnow were called heretics. Virtually overnight, England was converted\nto a new official religion.\n\nA terror fell on die country. Some people had suffered under die\nCatiiolic Church, which before die reforms had been immensely\npowerful, but most Britons had strong ties to Cadiolicism and to its\ncomforting rituals. They watched in horror as churches were\ndemolished, images of die Madonna and saints were broken in pieces,\nstained-glass windows were smashed, and die churches\u2019 treasures were\nconfiscated. Widi monasteries diat had succored die poor suddenly\ngone, the poor now flooded die streets. The growing ranks of die\nbeggar class were further swelled by former monks. On top of all diis,\nCromwell levied high taxes to pay for his ecclesiastical reforms.\n\nIn 1535 powerful revolts in die North of England tiireatened to\ntopple Henry from his throne. By die following year he had suppressed\ndie rebellions, but he had also begun to see die costs of Cromwell's\nreforms. The king himself had never wanted to go diis farhe had only\nwanted a di-\n\nWHKRK CHRISTMAS CAME FROM Celebrating the turn of\nthe year is an ancient custom. The Romans celebrated the Saturnalia,\nthe festival of Saturn, god of the harvest, between December 17 and\n23. It was the most cheerful festival of the year. All work and\ncommerce stopped, and the streets were filled with crowds and a\n\ncarnival atmosphere. Slaves were temporarily freed, and the houses\nwere decorated with laurel branches. People visited one another,\nbringing gifts of wax candles and little clay figurines.\n\nLong before the birth of Christ, the Jews celebrated an eight-day\nFestival of Lights [at the same season], and it is believed that the\nGermanic peoples held a great festival not only at midsummer but also\nat the winter solstice, when they celebrated the rebirth of the sun and\nhonored the great fertility gods Wotan and Freyja, Donar (Thor) and\nFreyr. Even after the Emperor Constantine (a.d. 306-337) declared\nChristianity to be Rome's official imperial religion, the evocation of\nlight and fertility as an important component of pre-Christian\nmidwinter celebrations could not be entirely suppressed. In the year\n274 the Roman Emperor Aure-lian (a.d. 214-275) had established an\nofficial\n\ncult of the sun-god Mithras, declaring his birthday, December 25,\na national holiday. The cult of Mithras, the Aryan god of light, had\nspread from Persia through Asia Minor to Greece, Rome, and as far as\nthe Germanic lands and Britain. Numerous ruins of his shrines still\ntestify to the high regard in which this god was held, especially by the\nRoman legions, as a bringer of fertility, peace, and victory. So it was a\nclever move when, in the year a.d. 354, the Christian church under\nPope Liberius (352-366) co-opted the birthday of Mithras and declared\nDecember 25 to be the birthday of Jesus Christ.\n\nNEUEZURCHER ZEITUNG,\n\nAnne-Susanne\n\nRISCHKE,\n\nDecember 25, 1983\n\nvorce. It was now Cromwell's turn to watch uneasily as die king\nbegan slowly to undo his reforms, reinstating Catiiolic sacraments and\nodier rituals that Cromwell had oudawed.\n\nSensing his fall from grace, in 1540 Cromwell decided to regain\nHenry's favor with one throw of the dice: He would find the king a\nnew wife. Henry's third wife, Jane Seymour, had died a few years\nbefore, and he had been pining for a new young queen. It was\nCromwell who found him one: Anne of Cleves, a German princess\nand, most important to Cromwell, a Protestant. On Cromwell's\ncommission, the painter Holbein produced a flattering portrait of\n\nAnne; when Henry saw it, he fell in love, and agreed to marry her.\nCromwell seemed back in favor.\n\nUnfortunately, however, Holbein's painting was highly idealized,\nand when die king finally met die princess she did not please him in\ndie least. His anger against Cromwellfirst for the ill-conceived\nreforms, now for saddling him widi an unattractive and Protestant\nwifecould no longer be contained. In June of mat year, Cromwell was\narrested, charged as a Protestant extremist and a heretic, and sent to die\nTower. Six weeks later, before a large and enthusiastic crowd, the\npublic executioner cut off his head.\n\nInterpretation\n\nThomas Cromwell had a simple idea: He would break up die\npower and wealdi of the Church and lay die foundation for\nProtestantism in England. And he would do tfiis in a mercilessly short\ntime. He knew his speedy reforms would cause pain and resentment,\nbut he tiiought diese feelings would fade in a few years. More\nimportant, by identifying himself with change, he would become die\nleader of die new order, making die king dependent on him. But mere\nwas a problem in his strategy: Like a billiard ball hit too hard against\nthe cushion, his reforms had reactions and caroms he did not envision\nand could not control.\n\nThe man who initiates strong reforms often becomes the\nscapegoat for any kind of dissatisfaction. And eventually me reaction\nto his reforms may consume him, for change is upsetting to the human\nanimal, even when it is for die good. Because die world is and always\nhas been full of insecurity and mreat, we latch on to familiar faces and\ncreate habits and rituals to make the world more comfortable. Change\ncan be pleasant and even sometimes desirable in the abstract, but too\nmuch of it creates an anxiety that will stir and boil beneatii die surface\nand dien eventually erupt.\n\nNever underestimate die hidden conservatism of those around\nyou. It is powerful and entrenched. Never let die seductive charm of an\nidea cloud your reason: Just as you cannot make people see the world\nyour way, you cannot wrench diem into die future with painful\nchanges. They will rebel. If reform is necessary, anticipate die reaction\nagainst it and find ways to disguise the change and sweeten die poison.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nAs a young Communist in the 1920s, Mao Tse-tung understood\nbetter dian\n\nany of his colleagues die incredible odds against a Communist\nvictory in\n\nChina. With their small numbers, limited funds, lack of military\nexperience, and small arsenal of weapons, the Party had no hope of\nsuccess unless it won over China's immense peasant population. But\nwho in the world was more conservative, more rooted in tradition, than\nthe Chinese peasantry The oldest civilization on the planet had a\nhistory that would never loosen its power, no matter how violent the\nrevolution. The ideas of Confucius remained as alive in the 1920s as\nthey had been in the sixdi century B.C., when the philosopher was\nalive. Despite the oppressions of the current system, would the\npeasantry ever give up the deep-rooted values of die past for the great\nunknown of Communism\nThe solution, as Mao saw it, involved a simple deception: Cloak\nthe revolution in the clothing of the past, making it comforting and\nlegitimate in people's eyes. One of Mao's favorite books was the very\npopular medieval Chinese novel The Water Margin, which recounts\nthe exploits of a Chinese Robin Hood and his robber band as they\nstruggle against a corrupt and evil monarch. In China in Mao's time,\namily ties dominated over any other kind, for the Confucian hierarchy\nof father and oldest son remained firmly in place; but The Water\nMargin preached a superior value die fraternal ties of the band of\nrobbers, the nobility of the cause that unites people beyond blood. The\nnovel had great emotional resonance for Chinese people, who love to\nroot for the underdog. Time and again, then, Mao would present his\nrevolutionary army as an extension of the robber band in The Water\nMargin, likening his struggle to the timeless conflict between the\noppressed peasantry and an evil emperor. He made the past seem to\nenvelop and legitimize the Communist cause; the peasantry could feel\ncomfortable witii and even support a group with such roots in the past.\n\nEven once the Party came to power, Mao continued to associate it\nwith the past. He presented himself to the masses not as a Chinese\nLenin but as a modern Chuko Liang, the real-life third-century\nstrategist who figures prominently in the popular historical novel The\nRomance of the Three Kingdoms. Liang was more man a great\n\n\ngeneralhe was a poet, a philosopher, and a figure of stern moral\nrectitude. So Mao represented himself as a poet-warrior like Liang, a\nman who mixed strategy with philosophy and preached a new ethics.\nHe made himself appear like a hero from the great Chinese tradition of\nwarrior statesmen.\n\nSoon, everything in Mao's speeches and writings had a reference\nto an earlier period in Chinese history. He recalled, for example, the\ngreat Emperor Ch'in, who had unified the country in the third century\nB.C. Ch'in had burned the works of Confucius, consolidated and\ncompleted the building of the Great Wall, and given his name to China.\nLike Ch'in, Mao also had brought the country together, and had sought\nbold reforms against an oppressive past. Ch'in had traditionally been\nseen as a violent dictator whose reign was short; the brilliance of\nMao's strategy was to turn this around, simultaneously reinterpreting\nCh'in, justifying his rule in die eyes of present-day Chinese, and using\nhim to justify the violence of the new order that Mao himself was\ncreating.\n\nAfter the failed Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s, a power\nstruggle\n\nemerged in die Communist Party in which Mao's main foe was\nLin Rao, once a close friend of his. To make clear to die masses die\ndifference between his philosophy and Lin's, Mao once again exploited\ndie past: He cast his opponent as representing Confucius, a philosopher\nLin in fact would constantiy quote. And Confucius signified die\nconservatism of die past. Mao associated himself, on die odier hand,\nwidi die ancient philosophical movement known as Legalism,\nexemplified by die writings of Han-fei-tzu. The Legalists disdained\nConfucian ediics; tiiey believed in die need for violence to create a\nnew order. They worshiped power. To give himself weight in die\nstruggle, Mao unleashed a nationwide propaganda campaign against\nConfucius, using die issues of Confucianism versus Legalism to whip\ndie young into a kind of frenzied revolt against die older generation.\nThis grand context enveloped a ratiier banal power struggle, and Mao\nonce again won over die masses and triumphed over his enemies.\n\nInterpretation\n\nNo people had a more profound attachment to die past tiian die\nChinese. In die face of tiiis enormous obstacle to reform, Mao's\n\nstrategy was simple: Instead of struggling against die past, he turned it\nto his advantage, associating his radical Communists witii die romantic\n\u2018igures of Chinese history. Weaving the story of die War of die Three\nKingdoms into die struggle between die United States, die Soviet\nUnion, and China, he cast himself as Chuko Liang. As die emperors\nhad, he welcomed die cultiike adoration of the masses, understanding\ntiiat die Chinese could not function witiiout some kind of father figure\nto admire. And after he made a terrible blunder widi die Great Leap\nForward, trying to force modernization on die country and failing\nmiserably, he never repeated his mistake: From men on, radical change\nhad to be cloaked in die comfortable clotiies of die past.\nThe lesson is simple: The past is powerful. What has happened\nbefore seems greater; habit and history give any act weight. Use tiiis to\nyour advantage. When you destroy die familiar you create a void or\nvacuum; people fear die chaos tiiat will flood in to fill it. You must\navoid stirring up such fears at all cost. Borrow the weight and\nlegitimacy from die past, however remote, to create a comforting and\namiliar presence. This will give your actions romantic associations,\nadd to your presence, and cloak die nature of die changes you are\nattempting.\n\nIt must be considered that there is nothing more difficult to carry\nout,\n\nnor more doubtful of success, nor more dangerous to handle,\n\nthan to initiate a new order of things.\n\nNiccolb Machiavelli, 1469-1527\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nHuman psychology contains many dualities, one of diem being\ntiiat even while people understand die need for change, knowing how\nimportant it is for institutions and individuals to be occasionally\nrenewed, tiiey are also ir-\n\nritated and upset by changes that affect diem personally. They\nknow diat change is necessary, and that novelty provides relief from\nboredom, but deep inside they cling to the past. Change in die abstract,\nor superficial change, tiiey desire, but a change that upsets core habits\nand routines is deeply disturbing to diem.\n\nNo revolution has gone widiout a powerful later reaction against\nit, for in the long run die void it creates proves too unsettling to die\n\n\nhuman animal, who unconsciously associates such voids witii deatii\nand chaos. The opportunity for change and renewal seduces people to\nthe side of die revolution, but once dieir enthusiasm fades, which it\nwill, tiiey are left witii a certain emptiness. Yearning for die past, diey\ncreate an opening for it to creep back in.\n\nFor Machiavelli, die prophet who preaches and brings change can\nonly survive by taking up arms: When die masses inevitably yearn for\nthe past, he must be ready to use force. But me armed prophet cannot\nlast long unless he quickly creates a new set of values and rituals to\nreplace die old ones, and to soodie die anxieties of diose who dread\nchange. It is far easier, and less bloody, to play a kind of con game.\nPreach change as much as you like, and even enact your reforms, but\ngive diem die comforting appearance of older events and traditions.\n\nReigning from A.D. 8 to A.D. 23, die Chinese emperor Wang\nMang emerged from a period of great historical turbulence in which\ndie people yearned for order, an order represented for diem by\nConfucius. Some two hundred years earlier, however, Emperor Ch'in\nhad ordered die writings of Confucius burned. A few years later, word\nhad spread diat certain texts had miraculously survived, hidden under\ndie scholar's house. These texts may not have been genuine, but they\ngave Wang his opportunity: He first confiscated diem, dien had his\nscribes insert passages into them diat seemed to support me changes he\nhad been imposing on die country. When he released the texts, it\nseemed diat Confucius sanctioned Wang's reforms, and die people felt\ncomforted and accepted diem more easily.\n\nUnderstand: The fact diat die past is dead and buried gives you\ndie freedom to reinterpret it. To support your cause, tinker with die\n\u2018acts. The past is a text in which you can safely insert your own lines.\nA simple gesture like using an old title, or keeping die same\nnumber for a group, will tie you to die past and support you with die\nautiiority of history. As Machiavelli himself observed, die Romans\nused tiiis device when tiiey transformed dieir monarchy into a\nrepublic. They may have installed two consuls in place of die king, but\nsince die king had been served by twelve lictors, they retained die\nsame number to serve under the consuls. The king had personally\nperformed an annual sacrifice, in a great spectacle that stirred die\npublic; die republic retained diis practice, only transferring it to a\n\n\nspecial \u201cchief of die ceremony, whom tiiey called die King of die\nsacrifice.\u201d These and similar gestures satisfied die people and kept\ndiem from clamoring for the monarchy's return.\n\nAnodier strategy to disguise change is to make a loud and public\ndisplay of support for the values of die past. Seem to be a zealot for\ntradition\n\nand few will notice how unconventional you really are.\nRenaissance Florence had a centuries-old republic, and was suspicious\nof anyone who flouted its traditions. Cosimo de' Medici made a show\nof enthusiastic support for the republic, while in reality he worked to\nbring the city under the control of his wealthy family. In form, die\nMedicis retained the appearance of a republic; in substance, they\nrendered it powerless. They quietly enacted a radical change, while\nappearing to safeguard tradition.\n\nScience claims a search for truth that would seem to protect it\nfrom conservatism and the irrationality of habit: It is a culture of\ninnovation. Yet when Charles Darwin published his ideas of evolution,\nhe faced fiercer opposition from his fellow scientists than from\nreligious authorities. His theories challenged too many fixed ideas.\nJonas Salk ran into the same wall with his radical innovations in\nimmunology, as did Max Planck with his revolutionizing of physics.\nPlanck later wrote of the scientific opposition he faced, \u201cA new\nscientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and\nmaking them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually\ndie, and a new generation grows up that is familiar witii it.\u201d\n\nThe answer to this innate conservatism is to play die courtier's\ngame. Galileo did this at the beginning of his scientific career; he later\nbecame more confrontational, and paid for it. So pay lip service to\ntradition. Identify the elements in your revolution that can be made to\nseem to build on the past. Say the right things, make a show of\nconformity, and meanwhile let your theories do their radical work.\nPlay with appearances and respect past protocol. This is true in every\narenascience being no exception.\n\nFinally, powerful people pay attention to the Zeitgeist. If tiieir\nreform is too far ahead of its time, few will understand it, and it will\nstir up anxiety and be hopelessly misinterpreted. The changes you\nmake must seem less innovative than they are. England did eventually\n\nbecome a Protestant nation, as Cromwell wished, but it took over a\ncentury of gradual evolution.\n\nWatch the Zeitgeist. If you work in a tumultuous time, there is\npower to be gained by preaching a return to the past, to comfort,\ntradition, and ritual. During a period of stagnation, on the other hand,\nplay the card of reform and revolutionbut beware of what you stir up.\nThose who finish a revolution are rarely those who start it. You will\nnot succeed at this dangerous game unless you are willing to forestall\ndie inevitable reaction against it by playing with appearances and\nbuilding on die past.\n\nAuthority: He who desires or attempts to reform the government\nof a state, and wishes to have it accepted, must at least retain the\nsemblance of the old forms; so that it may seem to the people that\nthere has been no change in the institutions, even though in fact they\nare entirely different from the old ones. For the great majority of\nmankind are satisfied with appearances, as though they were realities.\n(Niccolo Machiavelli, 1469-1527)\n\nImage: The Cat.\n\nCreature of habit, it loves the\n\nwarmth of the familiar. Upset its\n\nroutines, disrupt its space, and it will\n\ngrow unmanageable and psychotic.\n\nPlacate it by supporting its rituals. If\n\nchange is necessary, deceive the cat by\n\nkeeping the smell of the past alive;\n\nplace objects familiar to it in\n\nstrategic locations.\n\nREVERSAL\n\nThe past is a corpse to be used as you see fit. If what happened in\nthe recent past was painful and harsh, it is self-destructive to associate\nyourself with it. When Napoleon came to power, the French\nRevolution was fresh in everyone's minds. If the court that he\nestablished had borne any resemblance to the lavish court of Louis\nXVI and Marie-Antoinette, his courtiers would have spent all their\ntime worrying about their own necks. Instead, Napoleon established a\ncourt remarkable for its sobriety and lack of ostentation. It was the\n\ncourt of a man who valued work and military virtues. This new form\nseemed appropriate and reassuring.\n\nIn other words, pay attention to the times. But understand: If you\nmake a bold change from the past, you must avoid at all costs the\nappearance of a void or vacuum, or you will create terror. Even an ugly\nrecent history will seem preferable to an empty space. Fill diat space\nimmediately with new rituals and forms.

Too much\ninnovation is traumatic, and will lead to revolt. If you are new to a\nposition of power, or an outsider trying to build a power base, make a\nshow of respecting the old way of doing things. If change is necessary,\nmake it feel like a gentle improvement on the past.\n\nTRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW,\n\nSometime in die early 1520s, King Henry VIII of England\ndecided to divorce his wife, Catfierine of Aragon, because she had\nfailed to bear him a son, and because he had fallen in love with die\nyoung and comely Anne Boleyn. The pope, Clement VII, opposed die\ndivorce, and threatened die king widi excommunication. The king's\nmost powerful minister, Cardinal Wolsey, also saw no need for\ndivorceand his halfhearted support of die king cost him his position\nand soon his life.\n\nOne man in Henry's cabinet, Thomas Cromwell, not only\nsupported him in his desire for a divorce but had an idea for realizing\nit! a complete break widi die past. He convinced die king mat by\nsevering ties widi Rome and making himself the head of a newly\nformed English church, he could divorce Cadierine and marry Anne.\nBy 1531 Henry saw diis as die only solution. To reward Cromwell for\nhis simple but brilliant idea, he elevated diis son of a blacksmitii to die\npost of royal councillor.\n\nBy 1534 Cromwell had been named die king's secretary, and as\nme power behind die dirone he had become die most powerful man in\nEngland. But for him die break widi Rome went beyond die\n\n\nsatisfaction of die king's carnal desires: He envisioned a new\nProtestant order in England, wim die power of die Cadiolic Church\nsmashed and its vast wealdi in the hands of die king and die\ngovernment. In diat same year he initiated a complete survey of die\nchurches and monasteries of England. And as it turned out, die\ntreasures and moneys diat die churches had accumulated over me\ncenturies were far more tiian he had imagined; his spies and agents\ncame back widi astonishing figures.\n\nTo justify his schemes, Cromwell circulated stories about die\ncorruption in die English monasteries, dieir abuse of power, their\nexploitation of die people tiiey supposedly served. Having won\nParhament's support for breaking up die monasteries, he began to seize\nmeir holdings and to put diem out of existence one by one. At die same\ntime, he began to impose Protestantism, introducing reforms in\nreligious ritual and punishing tiiose who stuck to Cadiolicism, and who\nnow were called heretics. Virtually overnight, England was converted\nto a new official religion.\n\nA terror fell on die country. Some people had suffered under die\nCatiiolic Church, which before die reforms had been immensely\npowerful, but most Britons had strong ties to Cadiolicism and to its\ncomforting rituals. They watched in horror as churches were\ndemolished, images of die Madonna and saints were broken in pieces,\nstained-glass windows were smashed, and die churches\u2019 treasures were\nconfiscated. Widi monasteries diat had succored die poor suddenly\ngone, the poor now flooded die streets. The growing ranks of die\nbeggar class were further swelled by former monks. On top of all diis,\nCromwell levied high taxes to pay for his ecclesiastical reforms.\n\nIn 1535 powerful revolts in die North of England tiireatened to\ntopple Henry from his throne. By die following year he had suppressed\ndie rebellions, but he had also begun to see die costs of Cromwell's\nreforms. The king himself had never wanted to go diis farhe had only\nwanted a di-\n\nWHKRK CHRISTMAS CAME FROM Celebrating the turn of\nthe year is an ancient custom. The Romans celebrated the Saturnalia,\nthe festival of Saturn, god of the harvest, between December 17 and\n23. It was the most cheerful festival of the year. All work and\ncommerce stopped, and the streets were filled with crowds and a\n\ncarnival atmosphere. Slaves were temporarily freed, and the houses\nwere decorated with laurel branches. People visited one another,\nbringing gifts of wax candles and little clay figurines.\n\nLong before the birth of Christ, the Jews celebrated an eight-day\nFestival of Lights [at the same season], and it is believed that the\nGermanic peoples held a great festival not only at midsummer but also\nat the winter solstice, when they celebrated the rebirth of the sun and\nhonored the great fertility gods Wotan and Freyja, Donar (Thor) and\nFreyr. Even after the Emperor Constantine (a.d. 306-337) declared\nChristianity to be Rome's official imperial religion, the evocation of\nlight and fertility as an important component of pre-Christian\nmidwinter celebrations could not be entirely suppressed. In the year\n274 the Roman Emperor Aure-lian (a.d. 214-275) had established an\nofficial\n\ncult of the sun-god Mithras, declaring his birthday, December 25,\na national holiday. The cult of Mithras, the Aryan god of light, had\nspread from Persia through Asia Minor to Greece, Rome, and as far as\nthe Germanic lands and Britain. Numerous ruins of his shrines still\ntestify to the high regard in which this god was held, especially by the\nRoman legions, as a bringer of fertility, peace, and victory. So it was a\nclever move when, in the year a.d. 354, the Christian church under\nPope Liberius (352-366) co-opted the birthday of Mithras and declared\nDecember 25 to be the birthday of Jesus Christ.\n\nNEUEZURCHER ZEITUNG,\n\nAnne-Susanne\n\nRISCHKE,\n\nDecember 25, 1983\n\nvorce. It was now Cromwell's turn to watch uneasily as die king\nbegan slowly to undo his reforms, reinstating Catiiolic sacraments and\nodier rituals that Cromwell had oudawed.\n\nSensing his fall from grace, in 1540 Cromwell decided to regain\nHenry's favor with one throw of the dice: He would find the king a\nnew wife. Henry's third wife, Jane Seymour, had died a few years\nbefore, and he had been pining for a new young queen. It was\nCromwell who found him one: Anne of Cleves, a German princess\nand, most important to Cromwell, a Protestant. On Cromwell's\ncommission, the painter Holbein produced a flattering portrait of\n\nAnne; when Henry saw it, he fell in love, and agreed to marry her.\nCromwell seemed back in favor.\n\nUnfortunately, however, Holbein's painting was highly idealized,\nand when die king finally met die princess she did not please him in\ndie least. His anger against Cromwellfirst for the ill-conceived\nreforms, now for saddling him widi an unattractive and Protestant\nwifecould no longer be contained. In June of mat year, Cromwell was\narrested, charged as a Protestant extremist and a heretic, and sent to die\nTower. Six weeks later, before a large and enthusiastic crowd, the\npublic executioner cut off his head.\n\nInterpretation\n\nThomas Cromwell had a simple idea: He would break up die\npower and wealdi of the Church and lay die foundation for\nProtestantism in England. And he would do tfiis in a mercilessly short\ntime. He knew his speedy reforms would cause pain and resentment,\nbut he tiiought diese feelings would fade in a few years. More\nimportant, by identifying himself with change, he would become die\nleader of die new order, making die king dependent on him. But mere\nwas a problem in his strategy: Like a billiard ball hit too hard against\nthe cushion, his reforms had reactions and caroms he did not envision\nand could not control.\n\nThe man who initiates strong reforms often becomes the\nscapegoat for any kind of dissatisfaction. And eventually me reaction\nto his reforms may consume him, for change is upsetting to the human\nanimal, even when it is for die good. Because die world is and always\nhas been full of insecurity and mreat, we latch on to familiar faces and\ncreate habits and rituals to make the world more comfortable. Change\ncan be pleasant and even sometimes desirable in the abstract, but too\nmuch of it creates an anxiety that will stir and boil beneatii die surface\nand dien eventually erupt.\n\nNever underestimate die hidden conservatism of those around\nyou. It is powerful and entrenched. Never let die seductive charm of an\nidea cloud your reason: Just as you cannot make people see the world\nyour way, you cannot wrench diem into die future with painful\nchanges. They will rebel. If reform is necessary, anticipate die reaction\nagainst it and find ways to disguise the change and sweeten die poison.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nAs a young Communist in the 1920s, Mao Tse-tung understood\nbetter dian\n\nany of his colleagues die incredible odds against a Communist\nvictory in\n\nChina. With their small numbers, limited funds, lack of military\nexperience, and small arsenal of weapons, the Party had no hope of\nsuccess unless it won over China's immense peasant population. But\nwho in the world was more conservative, more rooted in tradition, than\nthe Chinese peasantry The oldest civilization on the planet had a\nhistory that would never loosen its power, no matter how violent the\nrevolution. The ideas of Confucius remained as alive in the 1920s as\nthey had been in the sixdi century B.C., when the philosopher was\nalive. Despite the oppressions of the current system, would the\npeasantry ever give up the deep-rooted values of die past for the great\nunknown of Communism\nThe solution, as Mao saw it, involved a simple deception: Cloak\nthe revolution in the clothing of the past, making it comforting and\nlegitimate in people's eyes. One of Mao's favorite books was the very\npopular medieval Chinese novel The Water Margin, which recounts\nthe exploits of a Chinese Robin Hood and his robber band as they\nstruggle against a corrupt and evil monarch. In China in Mao's time,\namily ties dominated over any other kind, for the Confucian hierarchy\nof father and oldest son remained firmly in place; but The Water\nMargin preached a superior value die fraternal ties of the band of\nrobbers, the nobility of the cause that unites people beyond blood. The\nnovel had great emotional resonance for Chinese people, who love to\nroot for the underdog. Time and again, then, Mao would present his\nrevolutionary army as an extension of the robber band in The Water\nMargin, likening his struggle to the timeless conflict between the\noppressed peasantry and an evil emperor. He made the past seem to\nenvelop and legitimize the Communist cause; the peasantry could feel\ncomfortable witii and even support a group with such roots in the past.\n\nEven once the Party came to power, Mao continued to associate it\nwith the past. He presented himself to the masses not as a Chinese\nLenin but as a modern Chuko Liang, the real-life third-century\nstrategist who figures prominently in the popular historical novel The\nRomance of the Three Kingdoms. Liang was more man a great\n\n\ngeneralhe was a poet, a philosopher, and a figure of stern moral\nrectitude. So Mao represented himself as a poet-warrior like Liang, a\nman who mixed strategy with philosophy and preached a new ethics.\nHe made himself appear like a hero from the great Chinese tradition of\nwarrior statesmen.\n\nSoon, everything in Mao's speeches and writings had a reference\nto an earlier period in Chinese history. He recalled, for example, the\ngreat Emperor Ch'in, who had unified the country in the third century\nB.C. Ch'in had burned the works of Confucius, consolidated and\ncompleted the building of the Great Wall, and given his name to China.\nLike Ch'in, Mao also had brought the country together, and had sought\nbold reforms against an oppressive past. Ch'in had traditionally been\nseen as a violent dictator whose reign was short; the brilliance of\nMao's strategy was to turn this around, simultaneously reinterpreting\nCh'in, justifying his rule in die eyes of present-day Chinese, and using\nhim to justify the violence of the new order that Mao himself was\ncreating.\n\nAfter the failed Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s, a power\nstruggle\n\nemerged in die Communist Party in which Mao's main foe was\nLin Rao, once a close friend of his. To make clear to die masses die\ndifference between his philosophy and Lin's, Mao once again exploited\ndie past: He cast his opponent as representing Confucius, a philosopher\nLin in fact would constantiy quote. And Confucius signified die\nconservatism of die past. Mao associated himself, on die odier hand,\nwidi die ancient philosophical movement known as Legalism,\nexemplified by die writings of Han-fei-tzu. The Legalists disdained\nConfucian ediics; tiiey believed in die need for violence to create a\nnew order. They worshiped power. To give himself weight in die\nstruggle, Mao unleashed a nationwide propaganda campaign against\nConfucius, using die issues of Confucianism versus Legalism to whip\ndie young into a kind of frenzied revolt against die older generation.\nThis grand context enveloped a ratiier banal power struggle, and Mao\nonce again won over die masses and triumphed over his enemies.\n\nInterpretation\n\nNo people had a more profound attachment to die past tiian die\nChinese. In die face of tiiis enormous obstacle to reform, Mao's\n\nstrategy was simple: Instead of struggling against die past, he turned it\nto his advantage, associating his radical Communists witii die romantic\n\u2018igures of Chinese history. Weaving the story of die War of die Three\nKingdoms into die struggle between die United States, die Soviet\nUnion, and China, he cast himself as Chuko Liang. As die emperors\nhad, he welcomed die cultiike adoration of the masses, understanding\ntiiat die Chinese could not function witiiout some kind of father figure\nto admire. And after he made a terrible blunder widi die Great Leap\nForward, trying to force modernization on die country and failing\nmiserably, he never repeated his mistake: From men on, radical change\nhad to be cloaked in die comfortable clotiies of die past.\nThe lesson is simple: The past is powerful. What has happened\nbefore seems greater; habit and history give any act weight. Use tiiis to\nyour advantage. When you destroy die familiar you create a void or\nvacuum; people fear die chaos tiiat will flood in to fill it. You must\navoid stirring up such fears at all cost. Borrow the weight and\nlegitimacy from die past, however remote, to create a comforting and\namiliar presence. This will give your actions romantic associations,\nadd to your presence, and cloak die nature of die changes you are\nattempting.\n\nIt must be considered that there is nothing more difficult to carry\nout,\n\nnor more doubtful of success, nor more dangerous to handle,\n\nthan to initiate a new order of things.\n\nNiccolb Machiavelli, 1469-1527\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nHuman psychology contains many dualities, one of diem being\ntiiat even while people understand die need for change, knowing how\nimportant it is for institutions and individuals to be occasionally\nrenewed, tiiey are also ir-\n\nritated and upset by changes that affect diem personally. They\nknow diat change is necessary, and that novelty provides relief from\nboredom, but deep inside they cling to the past. Change in die abstract,\nor superficial change, tiiey desire, but a change that upsets core habits\nand routines is deeply disturbing to diem.\n\nNo revolution has gone widiout a powerful later reaction against\nit, for in the long run die void it creates proves too unsettling to die\n\n\nhuman animal, who unconsciously associates such voids witii deatii\nand chaos. The opportunity for change and renewal seduces people to\nthe side of die revolution, but once dieir enthusiasm fades, which it\nwill, tiiey are left witii a certain emptiness. Yearning for die past, diey\ncreate an opening for it to creep back in.\n\nFor Machiavelli, die prophet who preaches and brings change can\nonly survive by taking up arms: When die masses inevitably yearn for\nthe past, he must be ready to use force. But me armed prophet cannot\nlast long unless he quickly creates a new set of values and rituals to\nreplace die old ones, and to soodie die anxieties of diose who dread\nchange. It is far easier, and less bloody, to play a kind of con game.\nPreach change as much as you like, and even enact your reforms, but\ngive diem die comforting appearance of older events and traditions.\n\nReigning from A.D. 8 to A.D. 23, die Chinese emperor Wang\nMang emerged from a period of great historical turbulence in which\ndie people yearned for order, an order represented for diem by\nConfucius. Some two hundred years earlier, however, Emperor Ch'in\nhad ordered die writings of Confucius burned. A few years later, word\nhad spread diat certain texts had miraculously survived, hidden under\ndie scholar's house. These texts may not have been genuine, but they\ngave Wang his opportunity: He first confiscated diem, dien had his\nscribes insert passages into them diat seemed to support me changes he\nhad been imposing on die country. When he released the texts, it\nseemed diat Confucius sanctioned Wang's reforms, and die people felt\ncomforted and accepted diem more easily.\n\nUnderstand: The fact diat die past is dead and buried gives you\ndie freedom to reinterpret it. To support your cause, tinker with die\n\u2018acts. The past is a text in which you can safely insert your own lines.\nA simple gesture like using an old title, or keeping die same\nnumber for a group, will tie you to die past and support you with die\nautiiority of history. As Machiavelli himself observed, die Romans\nused tiiis device when tiiey transformed dieir monarchy into a\nrepublic. They may have installed two consuls in place of die king, but\nsince die king had been served by twelve lictors, they retained die\nsame number to serve under the consuls. The king had personally\nperformed an annual sacrifice, in a great spectacle that stirred die\npublic; die republic retained diis practice, only transferring it to a\n\n\nspecial \u201cchief of die ceremony, whom tiiey called die King of die\nsacrifice.\u201d These and similar gestures satisfied die people and kept\ndiem from clamoring for the monarchy's return.\n\nAnodier strategy to disguise change is to make a loud and public\ndisplay of support for the values of die past. Seem to be a zealot for\ntradition\n\nand few will notice how unconventional you really are.\nRenaissance Florence had a centuries-old republic, and was suspicious\nof anyone who flouted its traditions. Cosimo de' Medici made a show\nof enthusiastic support for the republic, while in reality he worked to\nbring the city under the control of his wealthy family. In form, die\nMedicis retained the appearance of a republic; in substance, they\nrendered it powerless. They quietly enacted a radical change, while\nappearing to safeguard tradition.\n\nScience claims a search for truth that would seem to protect it\nfrom conservatism and the irrationality of habit: It is a culture of\ninnovation. Yet when Charles Darwin published his ideas of evolution,\nhe faced fiercer opposition from his fellow scientists than from\nreligious authorities. His theories challenged too many fixed ideas.\nJonas Salk ran into the same wall with his radical innovations in\nimmunology, as did Max Planck with his revolutionizing of physics.\nPlanck later wrote of the scientific opposition he faced, \u201cA new\nscientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and\nmaking them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually\ndie, and a new generation grows up that is familiar witii it.\u201d\n\nThe answer to this innate conservatism is to play die courtier's\ngame. Galileo did this at the beginning of his scientific career; he later\nbecame more confrontational, and paid for it. So pay lip service to\ntradition. Identify the elements in your revolution that can be made to\nseem to build on the past. Say the right things, make a show of\nconformity, and meanwhile let your theories do their radical work.\nPlay with appearances and respect past protocol. This is true in every\narenascience being no exception.\n\nFinally, powerful people pay attention to the Zeitgeist. If tiieir\nreform is too far ahead of its time, few will understand it, and it will\nstir up anxiety and be hopelessly misinterpreted. The changes you\nmake must seem less innovative than they are. England did eventually\n\nbecome a Protestant nation, as Cromwell wished, but it took over a\ncentury of gradual evolution.\n\nWatch the Zeitgeist. If you work in a tumultuous time, there is\npower to be gained by preaching a return to the past, to comfort,\ntradition, and ritual. During a period of stagnation, on the other hand,\nplay the card of reform and revolutionbut beware of what you stir up.\nThose who finish a revolution are rarely those who start it. You will\nnot succeed at this dangerous game unless you are willing to forestall\ndie inevitable reaction against it by playing with appearances and\nbuilding on die past.\n\nAuthority: He who desires or attempts to reform the government\nof a state, and wishes to have it accepted, must at least retain the\nsemblance of the old forms; so that it may seem to the people that\nthere has been no change in the institutions, even though in fact they\nare entirely different from the old ones. For the great majority of\nmankind are satisfied with appearances, as though they were realities.\n(Niccolo Machiavelli, 1469-1527)\n\nImage: The Cat.\n\nCreature of habit, it loves the\n\nwarmth of the familiar. Upset its\n\nroutines, disrupt its space, and it will\n\ngrow unmanageable and psychotic.\n\nPlacate it by supporting its rituals. If\n\nchange is necessary, deceive the cat by\n\nkeeping the smell of the past alive;\n\nplace objects familiar to it in\n\nstrategic locations.\n\nREVERSAL\n\nThe past is a corpse to be used as you see fit. If what happened in\nthe recent past was painful and harsh, it is self-destructive to associate\nyourself with it. When Napoleon came to power, the French\nRevolution was fresh in everyone's minds. If the court that he\nestablished had borne any resemblance to the lavish court of Louis\nXVI and Marie-Antoinette, his courtiers would have spent all their\ntime worrying about their own necks. Instead, Napoleon established a\ncourt remarkable for its sobriety and lack of ostentation. It was the\n\ncourt of a man who valued work and military virtues. This new form\nseemed appropriate and reassuring.\n\nIn other words, pay attention to the times. But understand: If you\nmake a bold change from the past, you must avoid at all costs the\nappearance of a void or vacuum, or you will create terror. Even an ugly\nrecent history will seem preferable to an empty space. Fill diat space\nimmediately with new rituals and forms. Soothing and growing\nfamiliar, these will secure your position among the masses.\n\nFinally, the arts, fashion, and technology would seem to be areas\nin which power would come from creating a radical rupture with the\npast and appearing cutting edge. Indeed, such a strategy can bring\ngreat power, but it has many dangers. It is inevitable that your\ninnovations will be outdone by someone else. You have little\ncontrolsomeone younger and fresher moves in a sudden new direction,\nmaking your bold innovation of yesterday seem tiresome and tame\ntoday. You are forever playing catch-up; your power is tenuous and\nshort-lived. You want a power built on something more solid. Using\nthe past, tinkering with tradition, playing with convention to subvert it\nwill give your creations something more than a momentary appeal.\nPeriods of dizzying change disguise the fact that a yearning for the\npast will inevitably creep back in. In the end, using the past for your\nown purposes will bring you more power than trying to cut it out\ncompletelya futile and self-destructive endeavor.\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

They soon became lovers and moved in together. Halliwell,\ntwenty-five at the time, was seven years older than Orton, and seemed\nthe more confident of the two; but neither had much talent as actors,\nand after graduating, having settled down together in a dank London\napartment, they decided to give up acting and collaborate as writers\ninstead. Halliwell's inheritance was enough to keep them from having\nto find work for a few years, and in the beginning, he was also the\ndriving force behind the stories and novels they wrote; he would\ndictate to Orton, who would type the manuscripts, occasionally\ninterjecting his own lines and ideas. Their first efforts attracted some\ninterest from literary agents, but it sputtered. The promise they had\nshown was leading nowhere.\n\nEventually the inheritance money ran out, and the pair had to look\nfor work. Their collaborations were less enthusiastic and less frequent.\nThe future looked bleak.\n\nIn 1957 Orton began to write on his own, but it wasn't until five\nyears later, when the lovers were jailed for six montfis for defacing\ndozens of library books, that he began to find his voice (perhaps not by\nchance: This was the first time he and HaJliwell had been separated in\nnine years). He came out of prison determined to express his contempt\n\nfor English society in uie form of theatrical farces. He and Halliwell\nmoved back in together, but now the roles were reversed: Orton did the\nwriting while Halliwell put in comments and ideas.\n\nIn 1964 Joe Orton completed his first full-length play,\nEntertaining Mr. Sloane. The play made it to London's West End,\nwhere it received brilliant reviews: A great new writer had emerged\nfrom nowhere. Now success followed s access, at a dizzying pace. In\n1966 Orton had a hit with his play Loot, and his popularity soared.\nSoon commissions came in from all sides, including from the Beatles,\nwho paid Orton handsomely to write them a film script.\n\nEverything was pointing upwards, everything except Orton's\nrelationship with Kenneth Halliwell. The pair still lived togedier, but\nas Orton grew successful, HaJliwell began to deteriorate. Watching his\nlover become the center of attention, he suffered die humiliation of\nbecoming a kind of personal assistant to the playwright, his role in\nwhat had once been a collaboration growing smaller and smaller. In\nthe 1950s he had supported Orton with his inheritance; now Orton\nsupported him.

The king said to\nthem, \u201cOne of you may ask something of me and 1 will give it to him,\nprovided I give twice as much to the other.\u201d The envious person did\nnot want to ask first for he was envious of his companion who would\nreceive twice as much, and the greedy man did not want to ask first\nsince he wanted everything that was to be had. Finally the greedy one\npressed the envious one to be the first to make the request. So the\nenvious person asked the king to pluck out one of his eyes.\n\nJewish parable, the seven deadly sins, Solomon Schimmel, 1992\n\nAn admirer who feels that he cannot be happy by surrendering\nhimself elects to become envious of that which he admires.

It is hidden away in the depths of\nthe valleys, where the sun never penetrates, where no wind blows\nthrough; a gloomy dwelling, permeated by numbing chill, ever fireless,\never shrouded in thick darkness. When Minerva reached this spot she\nstopped in front of the house ... and struck the doors with the tip of her\nspear, and at the blow they flew open and revealed Envy within, busy\nat a meal of snake's flesh, the food on which she nourished her\nwickedness. At the sight, Minerva turned her eyes away. But the other\nrose heavily from the ground, leaving the half-eaten corpses, and came\nout with dragging steps. When she saw the goddess in all the brilliance\nof her beauty, in her flashing armor, she groaned.... Envy's face was\nsickly pale, her whole body lean and wasted, and\n\nold friend and lover. He tried to help Halliwell launch a career as\nan artist, even arranging for a gallery to show his work, but the show\nwas a flop, and this only heightened HalliwelPs sense of inferiority. In\nMay of 1967, the pair went on a brief holiday together in Tangier,\nMorocco. During the trip, Orton wrote in his diary, \u201cWe sat talking of\nhow happy we felt. And how it couldn't, surely, last. We'd have to pay\nfor it. Or we'd be struck down from afar by disaster because we were,\nperhaps, too happy. To be young, good-looking, healthy, famous,\ncomparatively rich and happy is surely going against nature.\u201d\n\nHalliwell outwardly seemed as happy as Orton. Inwardly, though,\nhe was seething. And two months later, in the early morning of August\n10, 1967, just days after helping Orton put the finishing touches to the\nwicked fa' ce What the Butler Saw (undoubtedly his masterpiece),\nKenneth Halliwell bludgeoned Joe Orton to death with repeated blows\nof a hammer to the head. He then took twenty-one sleeping pills and\n\n\ndied himself, leaving behind a note that read, \u201cIf you read Orton's\ndiary all will be explained.\u201d\n\nInterpretation\n\nKenneth Halliwell had tried to cast his deterioration as mental\nillness, but what Joe Orton's diaries revealed to him was the truth: It\nwas envy, pure and simple, that lay at the heart of his sickness. The\ndiaries, which Halliwell read on the sly, recounted the couple's days as\nequals and their struggle for recognition. After Orton found success,\nthe diaries began to describe HalliwelPs brooding, his rude comments\nat parties, his growing sense of inferiority. All of this Orton narrated\nwith a distance that bordered on contempt.\n\nThe diaries made clear Halliwell's bitterness over Orton's success.\nEventually the only thing that would have satisfied him would have\nbeen for Orton to have a failure of his own, an unsuccessful play\nperhaps, so that they could have commiserated in their failure, as they\nhad done years before. When the opposite happenedas Orton grew\nonly more successful and popularHalliwell did the only thing that\nwould make them equals again: He made them equals in death. With\nOrton's murder, he became almost as famous as_ his\nfriendposthumously.\n\nJoe Orton only partly understood his lover's deterioration. His\nattempt to help Halliwell launch a career in art registered for what it\nwas: charity and guilt. Orton basically had two possible solutions to\nthe problem. He could have downplayed his own success, displaying\nsome faults, deflecting Halliwell's envy; or, once he realized the nature\nof the problem, he could have fled as if Halliwell were a viper, as in\nfact he wasa viper of envy. Once envy eats away at someone,\neverything you do only makes it grow, and day by day it festers inside\nhim. Eventually he will attack.\n\nOnly a minority can succeed at the game of life, and that minority\ninevitably arouses the envy of those around them. Once success\nhappens your way, however, the people to fear the most are those in\nyour own circle, the friends and acquaintances you have left behind.\nFeelings of inferi-\n\nority gnaw at them; the thought of your success only heightens\ntheir feelings of stagnation. Envy, which the philosopher Kierkegaard\ncalls \u201cunhappy admiration,\u201d takes hold. You may not see it but you\n\nwill feel it somedayunless, that is, you learn strategies of deflection,\nlittle sacrifices to the gods of success. Either dampen your brilliance\noccasionally, purposefully revealing a defect, weakness, or anxiety, or\nattributing your success to luck; or simply find yourself new friends.\nNever underestimate the power of envy.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nThe merchant class and the craft guilds to which medieval\nFlorence owed its prosperity had created a republic that protected them\nfrom oppression by the nobility. Since high office could only be held\nfor a few months, no one could gain lasting dominance, and although\nthis meant that the political factions struggled constantly for control,\nthe system kept out tyrants and petty dictators. The Medici family\nlived for several centuries under this system without making much of a\nmark. They had modest origins as apothecaries, and were typical\nmiddle-class citizens. Not until the late fourteenth century, when\nGiovanni de' Medici made a modest fortune in banking, did they\nemerge as a force to be reckoned with.\n\nUpon Giovanni's death, his son Cosimo took over the family\nbusiness, and quickly demonstrated his talent for it. The business\nprospered under his control and the Medicis emerged as one of the\npreeminent banking families of Europe. But they had a rival in\nFlorence: Despite the city's republican system, one family, the\nAlbizzis, had managed over the years to monopolize control of the\ngovernment, forging alliances that allowed them to constantiy fill\nimportant offices with their own men. Cosimo did not fight this, and in\nfact gave the Albizzis his tacit support. At the same time, while the\nAlbizzis were beginning to flaunt their power, Cosimo made a point of\nstaying in the background.\n\nEventually, however, the Medici wealth could not be ignored, and\nin 1433, feeling threatened by the family, the Albizzis used their\ngovernment muscle to have Cosimo arrested on charges of conspiring\nto overthrow the republic. Some in the Albizzi faction wanted Cosimo\nexecuted, others feared this would spark a civil war. In the end they\nexiled him from Florence. Cosimo did not fight the sentence; he left\nquietly. Sometimes, he knew, it is wiser to bide one's time and keep a\nlow profile.\n\n\nOver the next year, the Albizzis began to stir up fears that they\nwere Setting up a dictatorship. Meanwhile, Cosimo, using his wealth to\nadvantage, continued to exert influence on Florentine affairs, even\nfrom exile. A civil war broke out in the city, and in September of 1434\nthe Albizzis were toppled from power and sent into exile. Cosimo\nimmediately returned to Florence, his position restored. But he saw\nthat he now faced a delicate situation: If he seemed ambitious, as the\nAlbizzis had, he would stir up opposition and envy that would\nultimately threaten his business. If he stayed on\n\nshe squinted horribly; her teeth were discolored and decayed, her\npoisonous breast of a greenish hue, and her tongue dripped venom.\nOnly the sight of suffering could bring a smile to her lips. She never\nknew the comfort of sleep, but was kept constantly awake by care and\nanxiety, looked with dismay on men's good fortune, and grew thin at\nthe sight. Gnawing at others, and being gnawed, she was herself her\nown torment. Minerva, in spite of her loathing, yet addressed her\nbriefly: \u201cInstill your poison into one of Cecrop 's daughters her name is\nAglauros. This is what I require of you.\u201d Without another word she\npushed against the ground with her spear, left the earth, and soared\nupwards. From the corner of her eye the other watched the goddess out\nof sight, muttering and angry that Minerva \\s plan should be\nsuccessful. Then she took her staff, all encircled with thorny briars,\nwrapped herself in dark clouds, and set forth. Wherever she went she\ntrampled down the flowery fields, withered up the grass, seared the\ntreeto'ps, and with her breath tainted the peoples, their cities and their\nhomes, until at length she came to Athens, the home of wit and wealth,\npeaceful and prosperous. She could scarcely refrain from weeping\nwhen she saw no cause for tears.\n\nThen entering the chamber of Cecrop 's daughter, she carried out\nMinerva's orders. She touched the girl's breast with a hand dipped in\nmalice, filled her heart with spiky thorns, and breathing in a black and\nevil poison dispersed it through her very bones, instilling the venom\ndeep in her heart. That the reason for her distress might not be far to\nseek, she set before Aglauros' eyes a vision of her sister, of that sister's\nfortunate marriage [with the god Mercury I, and of the god in all his\nhandsomeness; and she exaggerated the glory of it all. So Aglauros\nwas tormented by such thoughts, and the jealous anger she concealed\n\nate into her heart. Day and night she sighed, unceasingly wretched, and\nin her utter misery wasted away in a slow decline, as when ice is\nmelted by the fitful sun. The fire that was kindled within her at the\nthought of her sister's luck and good fortune was like the burning of\nweeds which do not burst into flames, but are none the less consumed\nby smoldering fire.\n\nmetamorphosrs, Ovid, 43 b.c.-c. a.d. 18\n\nthe sidelines, on die other hand, he would leave an opening for\nanother faction to rise up as die Albizzis had, and to punish the\nMedicis for their success.\n\nCosimo solved me problem in two ways: He secretiy used his\nwealth to buy influence among key citizens, and he placed his own\nallies, all cleverly enlisted from the middle classes to disguise their\nallegiance to him, in top government positions. Those who complained\nof his growing political clout were taxed into submission, or dieir\nproperties were bought out from under them by Cosimo's banker allies.\nThe republic survived in name only. Cosimo held the strings.\n\nWhile he worked behind the scenes to gain control, however,\npublicly Cosimo presented anomer picture. When he walked through\nthe streets of Florence, he dressed modestly, was attended by no more\ndian one servant, and bowed deferentially to magistrates and elder\ncitizens. He rode a mule instead of a horse. He never spoke out on\nmatters of public import, even though he controlled Florence's foreign\naffairs for over thirty years. He gave money to charities and\nmaintained his ties to Florence's merchant class. He financed all kinds\nof public buildings that fed die Florentines' pride in dieir city. When he\nbuilt a palace for himself and his family in nearby Fiesole, he turned\ndown the ornate designs that Brunelleschi had drawn up for him and\ninstead chose a modest structure designed by Michelozzo, a man of\nhumble Florentine origins. The palace was a symbol of Cosimo's\nstrategyall simplicity on the outside, all elegance and opulence within.\nCosimo finally died in 1464, after ruling for thirty years. The\ncitizens of Florence wanted to build him a great tomb, and to celebrate\nhis memory with elaborate funeral ceremonies, but on his deathbed he\nhad asked to be buried without \u201cany pomp or demonstration.\u201d Some\nsixty years later, Machiavelli hailed Cosimo as the wisest of all\nprinces, \u201cfor he knew how extraordinary things that are seen and\n\n\nappear every hour make men much more envied than those that are\ndone in deed and are covered over with decency.\u201d\n\nInterpretation\n\nA close friend of Cosimo's, the bookseller Vespasiano da Bisticci,\nonce wrote of him, \u201cAnd whenever he wished to achieve something,\nhe saw to it, in order to escape envy as much as possible, that the\ninitiative appeared to come from others, and not from him.\u201d One of\nCosimo's favorite expressions was, \u201cEnvy is a weed that should not be\nwatered.\u201d Understanding the power envy has in a democratic\nenvironment, Cosimo avoided die appearance of greatness. This does\nnot mean tiiat greatness should be suffocated, or that only the mediocre\nshould survive; only tiiat a game of appearances must be played. The\ninsidious envy of the masses can actually be deflected quite easily:\nAppear as one of them in style and values. Make alliances with those\nbelow you, and elevate them to positions of power to secure their\nsupport in times of need. Never flaunt your wealth, and carefully\nconceal\n\nthe degree to which it has bought influence. Make a display of\ndeferring to others, as if they were more powerful than you. Cosimo\nde' Medici perfected this game; he was a consummate con artist of\nappearances. No one could gauge the extent of his powerhis modest\nexterior hid the truth.\n\nNever be so foolish as to believe that you are stirring up\nadmiration by flaunting the qualities that raise you above others. By\nmaking others aware of their inferior position, you are only stirring up\n\u201cunhappy admiration,\u201d or envy, which will gnaw away at them until\nthey undermine you in ways you cannot foresee. The fool dares the\ngods of envy by flaunting his victories. The master of power\nunderstands that die appearance of superiority over others is\ninconsequential next to the reality of it.\n\nOf all the disorders of the soul, envy is the only one no one\nconfesses to.\n\nPlutarch, c. A.D. 46-120\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nThe human animal has a hard time dealing with feelings of\ninferiority. In the face of superior skill, talent, or power, we are often\ndisturbed and ill at ease; this is because most of us have an inflated\n\nsense of ourselves, and when we meet people who surpass us they\nmake it clear to us mat we are in fact mediocre, or at least not as\nbrilliant as we had thought. This disturbance in our self-image cannot\nlast long wimout stirring up ugly emotions. At first we feel envy: If\nonly we had die quality or skill of the superior person, we would be\nhappy. But envy brings us neither comfort nor any closer to equality.\nNor can we admit to feeling it, for it is frowned upon socially to show\nenvy is to admit to feeling inferior. To close friends, we may confess\nour secret unrealized desires, but we will never confess to feeling envy.\nSo it goes underground. We disguise it in many ways, like finding\ngrounds to criticize the person who makes us feel it: He may be\nsmarter tiian I am, we say, but he has no morals or conscience. Or he\nmay have more power, but that's because he cheats. If we do not\nslander him, perhaps we praise him excessivelyanother of envy's\ndisguises.\n\nThere are several strategies for dealing widi the insidious,\ndestructive emotion of envy. First, accept the fact diat there will be\npeople who will surpass you in some way, and also tile fact that you\nmay envy them. But make that feeling a way of pushing yourself to\nequal or surpass them someday. Let envy turn inward and it poisons\nthe soul; expel it outward and it can move you to greater heights.\n\nSecond, understand that as you gain power, those below you will\nfeel envious of you. They may not show it but it is inevitable. Do not\nnaively accept the facade they show youread between the lines of their\ncriticisms, their little sarcastic remarks, the signs of backstabbing, the\nexcessive praise that is preparing you for a fall, the resentful look in\nthe eye. Half the problem with envy comes when we do not recognize\nit until it is too late.\n\nFinally, expect tiiat when people envy you they will work against\nyou\n\nThe envious hides as carefully as the secret, lustful sinner and\nbecomes the endless inventor of tricks and stratagems to hide and\nmask himself Thus he is able to pretend to ignore the superiority of\nothers which eats up his heart, as if he did not see them, nor hear them,\nnor were aware of them, nor had ever heard of them. lie is a master\nsimulator. On the other hand he tries with all his power to connive and\nthus prevent any form of superiority from appearing in any situation.\n\nAnd if they do, he casts on them obscurity, hypercriticism, sarcasm\nand calumny like the toad that spits poison from its hole. On the other\nhand he will raise endlessly insignificant men, mediocre people, and\neven the inferior in the same type of activities.\n\nArthur\n\nSchopenhauer,\n\n1788-1860\n\nFor not many men, the proverb says, can love a friend who\nfortune prospers without feeling envy; and about the envious brain,\ncold poison clings and doubles all the pain life brings him. His own\nwoundings he must nurse, and feels another's gladness like a curse.\n\nAeschylus, c. 525-456 B.C.\n\nJOSKI'II AM) IIIS C.O.VI'\n\nNow Israel loved\n\nJoseph more than all\n\nhis children, because he\n\nwas the son of his old\n\nage; and he made him a\n\ncoat of many colors...\n\nAnd his brothers\n\nenvied him.... And\n\nwhen they saw him afar\n\noff they conspired\n\nagainst him to slay\n\nhim. And now they said\n\nto one another,\n\n\"Behold, this dreamer\n\ncometh. Come now\n\ntherefore, and let us\n\nslay him, and cast him\n\ninto some pit, and we\n\nshall say, some evil\n\nbeast hath devoured\n\nhim; and we shall see\n\nwhat will become of his\n\ndreams. \"\n\nold testament, genesis 37:3-20\n\n[When Pope Julius first saw Michelangelo's\ndesign for his tomb] it\n\npleased him so much\n\nthat he at once sent him\n\nto Carrara to quarry\n\nthe necessary marbles,\n\ninstructing Alamanno\n\nSalviati, of Florence, to\n\npay him a thousand\n\nducats for this purpose.\n\nMichelangelo stayed in\n\nthese mountains more than eight months with\ntwo workmen and his horse, and without any\nother provision except food.... Enough\nmarbles quarried and chosen, he took them to\nthe sea-coast, and left\n\ninsidiously. They will put obstacles in your path that you will not\nforesee, or that you cannot trace to their source. It is hard to defend\nyourself against this kind of attack. And by the time you realize that\nenvy is at the root of a person's feelings about you, it is often too late:\nYour excuses, your false humility, your defensive actions, only\nexacerbate the problem. Since it is far easier to avoid creating envy in\nthe first place than to get rid of it once it is there, you should strategize\nto forestall it before it grows. It is often your own actions that stir up\nenvy, your own unawareness. By becoming conscious of those actions\nand qualities that create envy, you can take the teeth out of it before it\nnibbles you to death.\n\nKierkegaard believed that there are types of people who create\nenvy, and are as guilty when it arises as those who feel it. The most\nobvious type we all know: The moment something good happens to\nthem, whetiier by luck or design, they crow about it. In fact they get\npleasure out of making people feel inferior. This type is obvious and\nbeyond hope. There are others, however, who stir up envy in more\nsubtle and unconscious ways, and are partly to blame for their troubles.\nEnvy is often a problem, for example, for people with great natural\ntalent.\n\n\nSir Walter Raleigh was one of the most brilliant men at the court\nof Queen Elizabeth of England. He had skills as a scientist, wrote\npoetry still recognized as among the most beautiful writing of the time,\nwas a proven leader of men, an enterprising entrepreneur, a great sea\ncaptain, and on top of all this was a handsome, dashing courtier who\ncharmed his way into becoming one of the queen's favorites. Wherever\nhe went, however, people blocked his path. Eventually he suffered a\nterrific fall from grace, leading even to prison and finally the\nexecutioner's axe.\n\nRaleigh could not understand the stubborn opposition he faced\nfrom the other courtiers. He did not see that he had not only made no\nattempt to disguise the degree of his skills and qualities, he had\nimposed them on one and all, making a show of his versatility,\nthinking it impressed people and won him friends. In fact it made him\nsilent enemies, people who felt inferior to him and did all they could to\nruin him the moment he tripped up or made the slightest mistake. In\nthe end, the reason he was executed was treason, but envy will use any\ncover it finds to mask its destructiveness.\n\nThe envy elicited by Sir Walter Raleigh is the worst kind: It was\ninspired by his natural talent and grace, which he felt was best\ndisplayed in its full flower. Money others can attain; power as well.\nBut superior intelligence, good looks, charmthese are qualities no one\ncan acquire. The naturally perfect have to work the most to disguise\ntheir brilliance, displaying a defect or two to deflect envy before it\ntakes root. It is a common and naive mistake to think you are charming\npeople with your natural talents when in fact they are coming to hate\nyou.\n\nA great danger in the realm of power is the sudden improvement\nin fortunean unexpected promotion, a victory or success mat seems to\ncome out of nowhere. This is sure to stir up envy among your former\npeers.\n\nWhen Archbishop de Retz was promoted to the rank of cardinal,\nin 1651, he knew full well that many of his former colleagues envied\nhim.\n\nUnderstanding die foolishness of alienating those below him, de\nRetz did everything he could to downplay his merit and emphasize the\nrole of luck in his success. To put people at ease, he acted humbly and\n\ndeferentially, as if nothing had changed. (In reality, of course, he now\nhad much more power than before.) He wrote that these wise policies\n\u201cproduced a good effect, by lessening the envy which was conceived\nagainst me, which is the greatest of all secrets.\u201d Follow de Retz's\nexample. Subtly emphasize how lucky you have been, to make your\nhappiness seem more attainable to other people, and die need for envy\nless acute. But be careful not to affect a false modesty diat people can\neasily see through. This will only make mem more envious. The act\nhas to be good; your humility, and your openness to those you have\nleft behind, have to seem genuine. Any hint of insincerity will only\nmake your new status more oppressive. Remember: Despite your\nelevated position, it will do you no good to alienate your former peers.\nPower requires a wide and solid support base, which envy can silendy\ndestroy.\n\nPolitical power of any kind creates envy, and one of the best ways\nto deflect it before it takes root is to seem unambitious. When Ivan the\nTerrible died, Boris Godunov knew he was the only one on the scene\nwho could lead Russia. But if he sought the position eagerly, he would\nstir up envy and suspicion among the boyars, so he refused die crown,\nnot once but several times. He made people insist mat he take die\nthrone. George Washington used the same strategy to great effect, first\nin refusing to keep the position of Commander in Chief of the\nAmerican army, second in resisting the presidency. In both cases he\nmade himself more popular than ever. People cannot envy the power\nthat tiiey themselves have given a person who does not seem to desire\nit.\n\nAccording to me Elizabeman statesman and writer Sir Francis\nBacon, the wisest policy of the powerful is to create a kind of pity for\nthemselves, as if their responsibilities were a burden and a sacrifice.\nHow can one envy a man who has taken on a heavy load for the public\ninterest Disguise your power as a kind of self-sacrifice rather than a\nsource of happiness and you make it seem less enviable. Emphasize\nyour troubles and you turn a potential danger (envy) into a source of\nmoral support (pity). A similar ploy is to hint that your good fortune\nwill benefit those around you. To do this you may need to open your\npurse strings, like Cimon, a wealdiy general in ancient Athens who\ngave lavishly in all kinds of ways to prevent people from resenting the\n\ninfluence he had bought in Atiienian politics. He paid a high price to\ndeflect dieir envy, but in the end it saved him from ostracism and\nbanishment from the city.\n\nThe painter J. M. W. Turner devised another way of giving to\ndeflect the envy of his fellow artists, which he recognized as his\ngreatest obstacle to his success. Noticing diat his incomparable color\nskills made them afraid to hang their paintings next to his in\nexhibitions, he realized that their fear would turn to envy, and would\neventually make it harder for him to find galleries to show in. On\noccasion, dien, Turner is known to have temporarily dampened the\ncolors in his paintings with soot to earn him the goodwill of his\ncolleagues.\n\none of his men to have them embarked. He himself returned to\nRome.\n\n... The quantity of marbles was immense, so that, spread over the\npiazza, they were the admiration of all and a joy to the pope, who\nheaped immeasurable favors upon Michelangelo; and when he began\nto work upon them again and again went to see him at his house, and\ntalked to him about the tomb and other things as with his own brother.\nAnd in order that he might more easily go to him, the pope ordered\nthat a drawbridge should be thrown across from the Corri-dore to the\nrooms of Michelangelo, by which he might visit him in private.\n\nThese many and frequent favors were the cause (as often is the\ncase at court) of much envy, and, after the envy, of endless persecution,\nsince Bramante, the architect, who was loved by the pope, made him\nchange his mind as to the monument by telling him, as is said by the\nvulgar, that it is unlucky to build one's tomb in one's lifetime, and other\ntales. Fear as well as envy stimulated Bramante, for the judgment of\nMichelangelo had exposed many of his errors.... Now because he had\nno doubt that Michelangelo knew these errors of his, he always sought\nto remove him from Rome, or, at least, to deprive him of the\n\nfavor of the pope, and of the glory and usefulness that he might\nhave acquired by his industry. He succeeded in the matter of the tomb.\nThere is no doubt that if Michelangelo had been allowed to finish it,\naccording to his first design, having so large afield in which to show\nhis worth, no other artist, however celebrated (be it said without envy)\ncould have wrested from him the high place he would have held.\n\nDid ever anybody seriously confess to envy Something there is in\nit universally felt to be more shameful than even felonious crime. And\nnot only does everybody disown it, but the better sort are inclined to\nincredulity when it is in earnest imputed to an intelligent man. But\nsince lodgment is in the heart not the brain, no degree of intellect\nsupplies a guarantee against it.\n\nbilly budd,\n\nHerman Melville,\n\n1819-1891\n\nTo deflect envy, Gracian recommends that the powerful display a\nweakness, a minor social indiscretion, a harmless vice. Give those who\nenvy you someming to feed on, distracting them from your more\nimportant sins. Remember: It is the reality that matters. You may have\nto play games with appearances, but in the end you will have what\ncounts: true power. In some Arab countries, a man will avoid arousing\nenvy by doing as Cosimo de Medici did by showing his wealth only on\nthe inside of his house. Apply this wisdom to your own character.\n\nBeware of some of envy's disguises. Excessive praise is an almost\nsure sign that die person praising you envies you; they are either\nsetting you up for a fallit will be impossible for you to live up to their\npraiseor they are sharpening their blades behind your back. At the\nsame time, those who are hypercritical of you, or who slander you\npublicly, probably envy you as well. Recognize their behavior as\ndisguised envy and you keep out of the trap of mutual mud-slinging, or\nof taking their criticisms to heart. Win your revenge by ignoring tiieir\nmeasly presence.\n\nDo not try to help or do favors for those who envy you; they will\nthink you are condescending to them. Joe Orton's attempt to help\nHalliwell find a gallery for his work only intensified his lover's\nfeelings of inferiority and envy. Once envy reveals itself for what it is,\nthe only solution is often to flee the presence of the enviers, leaving\nthem to stew in a hell of their own creation.\n\nFinally, be aware that some environments are more conducive to\nenvy than others. The effects of envy are more serious among\ncolleagues and peers, where there is a veneer of equality. Envy is also\ndestructive in democratic environments where overt displays of power\nare looked down upon. Be extrasensitive in such environments. The\n\nfilmmaker Ingmar Bergman was hounded by Swedish tax authorities\nbecause he stood out in a country where standing out from the crowd is\nfrowned on. It is almost impossible to avoid envy in such cases, and\nthere is little you can do but accept it graciously and take none of it\npersonally. As Thoreau once said, \u201cEnvy is die tax which all\ndistinction must pay.\u201d\n\nImage: A Garden of Weeds. You may not feed them but they\nspread as you water the garden. You may not see how, but they take\nover, tall and ugly, preventing anything beautiful from flourishing.\nBefore it is too late, do not water indiscriminately. Destroy the weeds\nof envy by giving them\n\nnothing to feed on.\n\nAuthority: Upon occasion, reveal a harmless defect in your\ncharacter. For the envious accuse the most perfect of sinning by having\nno sins. They become an Argus, all eyes for finding fault with\nexcellenceit is their only consolation. Do not let envy burst with its\nown venomaffect some lapse in valor or intellect, so as to disarm it\nbeforehand. You thus wave your red cape before the Horns of Envy, in\norder to save your immortality. (Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nThe reason for being careful with the envious is that they are so\nindirect, and will find innumerable ways to undermine you. But\ntreading carefully around them will often only make their envy worse.\nThey sense that you are being cautious, and it registers as yet another\nsign of your superiority. That is why you must act before envy takes\nroot.\n\nOnce envy is there, however, whether through your fault or not, it\nis sometimes best to affect the opposite approach: Display the utmost\ndisdain for those who envy you. Instead of hiding your perfection,\nmake it obvious. Make every new triumph an opportunity to make the\nenvious squirm. Your good fortune and power become their living hell.\nIf you attain a position of unimpeachable power, their envy will have\nno effect on you, and you will have the best revenge of all: They are\ntrapped in envy while you are free in your power.\n\nThis is how Michelangelo triumphed over die venomous architect\nBramante, who turned Pope Julius against Michelangelo's design for\nhis tomb. Bramante envied Michelangelo's godlike skills, and to this\n\none triumphthe aborted tomb projecthe thought to add another, by\npushing the pope to commission Michelangelo to paint the murals in\nthe Sistine Chapel. The project would take years, during which\nMichelangelo would accomplish no more of his brilliant sculptures.\nFurthermore, Bramante considered Michelangelo not nearly as skilled\nin painting as in sculpture. The chapel would spoil his image as the\nperfect artist.\n\nMichelangelo saw the trap and wanted to turn down the\ncommission, but he could not refuse the pope, so he accepted it\nwithout complaint. Then, however, he used Bramante's envy to spur\nhim to greater heights, making the Sistine Chapel his most perfect\nwork of all. Every time Bramante heard of it or saw it, he felt more\noppressed by his own envydie sweetest and most lasting revenge you\ncan exact on die envious.\n\nKnow how to triumph over envy and malice. Here contempt,\nalthough prudent, counts, indeed, for little; magnanimity is better. A\ngood word concerning one who speaks evil of you cannot be praised\ntoo highly: there is no revenge more heroic than that brought about by\nthose merits and attainments which frustrate and torment the envious.\nEvery stroke of good fortune is a further twist of the rope round the\nneck of the ill-disposed and the heaven of the envied is hell for the\nenvious. To convert your good fortune into poison for your enemies is\nheld to be the most severe punishment you can inflict on them. The\nenvious man dies not only once but as many times as the person he\nenvies lives to hear the voice of praise; the eternity of the latter's fame\nis the measure of the former's punishment: the one is immortal in his\nglory, the latter in his misery.

They soon became lovers and moved in together. Halliwell,\ntwenty-five at the time, was seven years older than Orton, and seemed\nthe more confident of the two; but neither had much talent as actors,\nand after graduating, having settled down together in a dank London\napartment, they decided to give up acting and collaborate as writers\ninstead. Halliwell's inheritance was enough to keep them from having\nto find work for a few years, and in the beginning, he was also the\ndriving force behind the stories and novels they wrote; he would\ndictate to Orton, who would type the manuscripts, occasionally\ninterjecting his own lines and ideas. Their first efforts attracted some\ninterest from literary agents, but it sputtered. The promise they had\nshown was leading nowhere.\n\nEventually the inheritance money ran out, and the pair had to look\nfor work. Their collaborations were less enthusiastic and less frequent.\nThe future looked bleak.\n\nIn 1957 Orton began to write on his own, but it wasn't until five\nyears later, when the lovers were jailed for six montfis for defacing\ndozens of library books, that he began to find his voice (perhaps not by\nchance: This was the first time he and HaJliwell had been separated in\nnine years). He came out of prison determined to express his contempt\n\nfor English society in uie form of theatrical farces. He and Halliwell\nmoved back in together, but now the roles were reversed: Orton did the\nwriting while Halliwell put in comments and ideas.\n\nIn 1964 Joe Orton completed his first full-length play,\nEntertaining Mr. Sloane. The play made it to London's West End,\nwhere it received brilliant reviews: A great new writer had emerged\nfrom nowhere. Now success followed s access, at a dizzying pace. In\n1966 Orton had a hit with his play Loot, and his popularity soared.\nSoon commissions came in from all sides, including from the Beatles,\nwho paid Orton handsomely to write them a film script.\n\nEverything was pointing upwards, everything except Orton's\nrelationship with Kenneth Halliwell. The pair still lived togedier, but\nas Orton grew successful, HaJliwell began to deteriorate. Watching his\nlover become the center of attention, he suffered die humiliation of\nbecoming a kind of personal assistant to the playwright, his role in\nwhat had once been a collaboration growing smaller and smaller. In\nthe 1950s he had supported Orton with his inheritance; now Orton\nsupported him. At a party or among friends, people would naturally\ngravitate towards Ortonhe was charming, and his mood was almost\nalways buoyant. Unlike the handsome Orton, Halliwell was bald and\nawkward; his defensiveness made people want to avoid him.\n\nWith Orton's success the couple's problems only worsened.\nHalliwell's moods made their life together impossible. Orton claimed\nto want to leave him, and had numerous affairs, but would always end\nup returning to his\n\nA greedy man and an envious man met a king. The king said to\nthem, \u201cOne of you may ask something of me and 1 will give it to him,\nprovided I give twice as much to the other.\u201d The envious person did\nnot want to ask first for he was envious of his companion who would\nreceive twice as much, and the greedy man did not want to ask first\nsince he wanted everything that was to be had. Finally the greedy one\npressed the envious one to be the first to make the request. So the\nenvious person asked the king to pluck out one of his eyes.\n\nJewish parable, the seven deadly sins, Solomon Schimmel, 1992\n\nAn admirer who feels that he cannot be happy by surrendering\nhimself elects to become envious of that which he admires.

It is hidden away in the depths of\nthe valleys, where the sun never penetrates, where no wind blows\nthrough; a gloomy dwelling, permeated by numbing chill, ever fireless,\never shrouded in thick darkness. When Minerva reached this spot she\nstopped in front of the house ... and struck the doors with the tip of her\nspear, and at the blow they flew open and revealed Envy within, busy\nat a meal of snake's flesh, the food on which she nourished her\nwickedness. At the sight, Minerva turned her eyes away. But the other\nrose heavily from the ground, leaving the half-eaten corpses, and came\nout with dragging steps. When she saw the goddess in all the brilliance\nof her beauty, in her flashing armor, she groaned.... Envy's face was\nsickly pale, her whole body lean and wasted, and\n\nold friend and lover. He tried to help Halliwell launch a career as\nan artist, even arranging for a gallery to show his work, but the show\nwas a flop, and this only heightened HalliwelPs sense of inferiority. In\nMay of 1967, the pair went on a brief holiday together in Tangier,\nMorocco. During the trip, Orton wrote in his diary, \u201cWe sat talking of\nhow happy we felt. And how it couldn't, surely, last. We'd have to pay\nfor it. Or we'd be struck down from afar by disaster because we were,\nperhaps, too happy. To be young, good-looking, healthy, famous,\ncomparatively rich and happy is surely going against nature.\u201d\n\nHalliwell outwardly seemed as happy as Orton. Inwardly, though,\nhe was seething. And two months later, in the early morning of August\n10, 1967, just days after helping Orton put the finishing touches to the\nwicked fa' ce What the Butler Saw (undoubtedly his masterpiece),\nKenneth Halliwell bludgeoned Joe Orton to death with repeated blows\nof a hammer to the head. He then took twenty-one sleeping pills and\n\n\ndied himself, leaving behind a note that read, \u201cIf you read Orton's\ndiary all will be explained.\u201d\n\nInterpretation\n\nKenneth Halliwell had tried to cast his deterioration as mental\nillness, but what Joe Orton's diaries revealed to him was the truth: It\nwas envy, pure and simple, that lay at the heart of his sickness. The\ndiaries, which Halliwell read on the sly, recounted the couple's days as\nequals and their struggle for recognition. After Orton found success,\nthe diaries began to describe HalliwelPs brooding, his rude comments\nat parties, his growing sense of inferiority. All of this Orton narrated\nwith a distance that bordered on contempt.\n\nThe diaries made clear Halliwell's bitterness over Orton's success.\nEventually the only thing that would have satisfied him would have\nbeen for Orton to have a failure of his own, an unsuccessful play\nperhaps, so that they could have commiserated in their failure, as they\nhad done years before. When the opposite happenedas Orton grew\nonly more successful and popularHalliwell did the only thing that\nwould make them equals again: He made them equals in death. With\nOrton's murder, he became almost as famous as_ his\nfriendposthumously.\n\nJoe Orton only partly understood his lover's deterioration. His\nattempt to help Halliwell launch a career in art registered for what it\nwas: charity and guilt. Orton basically had two possible solutions to\nthe problem. He could have downplayed his own success, displaying\nsome faults, deflecting Halliwell's envy; or, once he realized the nature\nof the problem, he could have fled as if Halliwell were a viper, as in\nfact he wasa viper of envy. Once envy eats away at someone,\neverything you do only makes it grow, and day by day it festers inside\nhim. Eventually he will attack.\n\nOnly a minority can succeed at the game of life, and that minority\ninevitably arouses the envy of those around them. Once success\nhappens your way, however, the people to fear the most are those in\nyour own circle, the friends and acquaintances you have left behind.\nFeelings of inferi-\n\nority gnaw at them; the thought of your success only heightens\ntheir feelings of stagnation. Envy, which the philosopher Kierkegaard\ncalls \u201cunhappy admiration,\u201d takes hold. You may not see it but you\n\nwill feel it somedayunless, that is, you learn strategies of deflection,\nlittle sacrifices to the gods of success. Either dampen your brilliance\noccasionally, purposefully revealing a defect, weakness, or anxiety, or\nattributing your success to luck; or simply find yourself new friends.\nNever underestimate the power of envy.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nThe merchant class and the craft guilds to which medieval\nFlorence owed its prosperity had created a republic that protected them\nfrom oppression by the nobility. Since high office could only be held\nfor a few months, no one could gain lasting dominance, and although\nthis meant that the political factions struggled constantly for control,\nthe system kept out tyrants and petty dictators. The Medici family\nlived for several centuries under this system without making much of a\nmark. They had modest origins as apothecaries, and were typical\nmiddle-class citizens. Not until the late fourteenth century, when\nGiovanni de' Medici made a modest fortune in banking, did they\nemerge as a force to be reckoned with.\n\nUpon Giovanni's death, his son Cosimo took over the family\nbusiness, and quickly demonstrated his talent for it. The business\nprospered under his control and the Medicis emerged as one of the\npreeminent banking families of Europe. But they had a rival in\nFlorence: Despite the city's republican system, one family, the\nAlbizzis, had managed over the years to monopolize control of the\ngovernment, forging alliances that allowed them to constantiy fill\nimportant offices with their own men. Cosimo did not fight this, and in\nfact gave the Albizzis his tacit support. At the same time, while the\nAlbizzis were beginning to flaunt their power, Cosimo made a point of\nstaying in the background.\n\nEventually, however, the Medici wealth could not be ignored, and\nin 1433, feeling threatened by the family, the Albizzis used their\ngovernment muscle to have Cosimo arrested on charges of conspiring\nto overthrow the republic. Some in the Albizzi faction wanted Cosimo\nexecuted, others feared this would spark a civil war. In the end they\nexiled him from Florence. Cosimo did not fight the sentence; he left\nquietly. Sometimes, he knew, it is wiser to bide one's time and keep a\nlow profile.\n\n\nOver the next year, the Albizzis began to stir up fears that they\nwere Setting up a dictatorship. Meanwhile, Cosimo, using his wealth to\nadvantage, continued to exert influence on Florentine affairs, even\nfrom exile. A civil war broke out in the city, and in September of 1434\nthe Albizzis were toppled from power and sent into exile. Cosimo\nimmediately returned to Florence, his position restored. But he saw\nthat he now faced a delicate situation: If he seemed ambitious, as the\nAlbizzis had, he would stir up opposition and envy that would\nultimately threaten his business. If he stayed on\n\nshe squinted horribly; her teeth were discolored and decayed, her\npoisonous breast of a greenish hue, and her tongue dripped venom.\nOnly the sight of suffering could bring a smile to her lips. She never\nknew the comfort of sleep, but was kept constantly awake by care and\nanxiety, looked with dismay on men's good fortune, and grew thin at\nthe sight. Gnawing at others, and being gnawed, she was herself her\nown torment. Minerva, in spite of her loathing, yet addressed her\nbriefly: \u201cInstill your poison into one of Cecrop 's daughters her name is\nAglauros. This is what I require of you.\u201d Without another word she\npushed against the ground with her spear, left the earth, and soared\nupwards. From the corner of her eye the other watched the goddess out\nof sight, muttering and angry that Minerva \\s plan should be\nsuccessful. Then she took her staff, all encircled with thorny briars,\nwrapped herself in dark clouds, and set forth. Wherever she went she\ntrampled down the flowery fields, withered up the grass, seared the\ntreeto'ps, and with her breath tainted the peoples, their cities and their\nhomes, until at length she came to Athens, the home of wit and wealth,\npeaceful and prosperous. She could scarcely refrain from weeping\nwhen she saw no cause for tears.\n\nThen entering the chamber of Cecrop 's daughter, she carried out\nMinerva's orders. She touched the girl's breast with a hand dipped in\nmalice, filled her heart with spiky thorns, and breathing in a black and\nevil poison dispersed it through her very bones, instilling the venom\ndeep in her heart. That the reason for her distress might not be far to\nseek, she set before Aglauros' eyes a vision of her sister, of that sister's\nfortunate marriage [with the god Mercury I, and of the god in all his\nhandsomeness; and she exaggerated the glory of it all. So Aglauros\nwas tormented by such thoughts, and the jealous anger she concealed\n\nate into her heart. Day and night she sighed, unceasingly wretched, and\nin her utter misery wasted away in a slow decline, as when ice is\nmelted by the fitful sun. The fire that was kindled within her at the\nthought of her sister's luck and good fortune was like the burning of\nweeds which do not burst into flames, but are none the less consumed\nby smoldering fire.\n\nmetamorphosrs, Ovid, 43 b.c.-c. a.d. 18\n\nthe sidelines, on die other hand, he would leave an opening for\nanother faction to rise up as die Albizzis had, and to punish the\nMedicis for their success.\n\nCosimo solved me problem in two ways: He secretiy used his\nwealth to buy influence among key citizens, and he placed his own\nallies, all cleverly enlisted from the middle classes to disguise their\nallegiance to him, in top government positions. Those who complained\nof his growing political clout were taxed into submission, or dieir\nproperties were bought out from under them by Cosimo's banker allies.\nThe republic survived in name only. Cosimo held the strings.\n\nWhile he worked behind the scenes to gain control, however,\npublicly Cosimo presented anomer picture. When he walked through\nthe streets of Florence, he dressed modestly, was attended by no more\ndian one servant, and bowed deferentially to magistrates and elder\ncitizens. He rode a mule instead of a horse. He never spoke out on\nmatters of public import, even though he controlled Florence's foreign\naffairs for over thirty years. He gave money to charities and\nmaintained his ties to Florence's merchant class. He financed all kinds\nof public buildings that fed die Florentines' pride in dieir city. When he\nbuilt a palace for himself and his family in nearby Fiesole, he turned\ndown the ornate designs that Brunelleschi had drawn up for him and\ninstead chose a modest structure designed by Michelozzo, a man of\nhumble Florentine origins. The palace was a symbol of Cosimo's\nstrategyall simplicity on the outside, all elegance and opulence within.\nCosimo finally died in 1464, after ruling for thirty years. The\ncitizens of Florence wanted to build him a great tomb, and to celebrate\nhis memory with elaborate funeral ceremonies, but on his deathbed he\nhad asked to be buried without \u201cany pomp or demonstration.\u201d Some\nsixty years later, Machiavelli hailed Cosimo as the wisest of all\nprinces, \u201cfor he knew how extraordinary things that are seen and\n\n\nappear every hour make men much more envied than those that are\ndone in deed and are covered over with decency.\u201d\n\nInterpretation\n\nA close friend of Cosimo's, the bookseller Vespasiano da Bisticci,\nonce wrote of him, \u201cAnd whenever he wished to achieve something,\nhe saw to it, in order to escape envy as much as possible, that the\ninitiative appeared to come from others, and not from him.\u201d One of\nCosimo's favorite expressions was, \u201cEnvy is a weed that should not be\nwatered.\u201d Understanding the power envy has in a democratic\nenvironment, Cosimo avoided die appearance of greatness. This does\nnot mean tiiat greatness should be suffocated, or that only the mediocre\nshould survive; only tiiat a game of appearances must be played. The\ninsidious envy of the masses can actually be deflected quite easily:\nAppear as one of them in style and values. Make alliances with those\nbelow you, and elevate them to positions of power to secure their\nsupport in times of need. Never flaunt your wealth, and carefully\nconceal\n\nthe degree to which it has bought influence. Make a display of\ndeferring to others, as if they were more powerful than you. Cosimo\nde' Medici perfected this game; he was a consummate con artist of\nappearances. No one could gauge the extent of his powerhis modest\nexterior hid the truth.\n\nNever be so foolish as to believe that you are stirring up\nadmiration by flaunting the qualities that raise you above others. By\nmaking others aware of their inferior position, you are only stirring up\n\u201cunhappy admiration,\u201d or envy, which will gnaw away at them until\nthey undermine you in ways you cannot foresee. The fool dares the\ngods of envy by flaunting his victories. The master of power\nunderstands that die appearance of superiority over others is\ninconsequential next to the reality of it.\n\nOf all the disorders of the soul, envy is the only one no one\nconfesses to.\n\nPlutarch, c. A.D. 46-120\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nThe human animal has a hard time dealing with feelings of\ninferiority. In the face of superior skill, talent, or power, we are often\ndisturbed and ill at ease; this is because most of us have an inflated\n\nsense of ourselves, and when we meet people who surpass us they\nmake it clear to us mat we are in fact mediocre, or at least not as\nbrilliant as we had thought. This disturbance in our self-image cannot\nlast long wimout stirring up ugly emotions. At first we feel envy: If\nonly we had die quality or skill of the superior person, we would be\nhappy. But envy brings us neither comfort nor any closer to equality.\nNor can we admit to feeling it, for it is frowned upon socially to show\nenvy is to admit to feeling inferior. To close friends, we may confess\nour secret unrealized desires, but we will never confess to feeling envy.\nSo it goes underground. We disguise it in many ways, like finding\ngrounds to criticize the person who makes us feel it: He may be\nsmarter tiian I am, we say, but he has no morals or conscience. Or he\nmay have more power, but that's because he cheats. If we do not\nslander him, perhaps we praise him excessivelyanother of envy's\ndisguises.\n\nThere are several strategies for dealing widi the insidious,\ndestructive emotion of envy. First, accept the fact diat there will be\npeople who will surpass you in some way, and also tile fact that you\nmay envy them. But make that feeling a way of pushing yourself to\nequal or surpass them someday. Let envy turn inward and it poisons\nthe soul; expel it outward and it can move you to greater heights.\n\nSecond, understand that as you gain power, those below you will\nfeel envious of you. They may not show it but it is inevitable. Do not\nnaively accept the facade they show youread between the lines of their\ncriticisms, their little sarcastic remarks, the signs of backstabbing, the\nexcessive praise that is preparing you for a fall, the resentful look in\nthe eye. Half the problem with envy comes when we do not recognize\nit until it is too late.\n\nFinally, expect tiiat when people envy you they will work against\nyou\n\nThe envious hides as carefully as the secret, lustful sinner and\nbecomes the endless inventor of tricks and stratagems to hide and\nmask himself Thus he is able to pretend to ignore the superiority of\nothers which eats up his heart, as if he did not see them, nor hear them,\nnor were aware of them, nor had ever heard of them. lie is a master\nsimulator. On the other hand he tries with all his power to connive and\nthus prevent any form of superiority from appearing in any situation.\n\nAnd if they do, he casts on them obscurity, hypercriticism, sarcasm\nand calumny like the toad that spits poison from its hole. On the other\nhand he will raise endlessly insignificant men, mediocre people, and\neven the inferior in the same type of activities.\n\nArthur\n\nSchopenhauer,\n\n1788-1860\n\nFor not many men, the proverb says, can love a friend who\nfortune prospers without feeling envy; and about the envious brain,\ncold poison clings and doubles all the pain life brings him. His own\nwoundings he must nurse, and feels another's gladness like a curse.\n\nAeschylus, c. 525-456 B.C.\n\nJOSKI'II AM) IIIS C.O.VI'\n\nNow Israel loved\n\nJoseph more than all\n\nhis children, because he\n\nwas the son of his old\n\nage; and he made him a\n\ncoat of many colors...\n\nAnd his brothers\n\nenvied him.... And\n\nwhen they saw him afar\n\noff they conspired\n\nagainst him to slay\n\nhim. And now they said\n\nto one another,\n\n\"Behold, this dreamer\n\ncometh. Come now\n\ntherefore, and let us\n\nslay him, and cast him\n\ninto some pit, and we\n\nshall say, some evil\n\nbeast hath devoured\n\nhim; and we shall see\n\nwhat will become of his\n\ndreams. \"\n\nold testament, genesis 37:3-20\n\n[When Pope Julius first saw Michelangelo's\ndesign for his tomb] it\n\npleased him so much\n\nthat he at once sent him\n\nto Carrara to quarry\n\nthe necessary marbles,\n\ninstructing Alamanno\n\nSalviati, of Florence, to\n\npay him a thousand\n\nducats for this purpose.\n\nMichelangelo stayed in\n\nthese mountains more than eight months with\ntwo workmen and his horse, and without any\nother provision except food.... Enough\nmarbles quarried and chosen, he took them to\nthe sea-coast, and left\n\ninsidiously. They will put obstacles in your path that you will not\nforesee, or that you cannot trace to their source. It is hard to defend\nyourself against this kind of attack. And by the time you realize that\nenvy is at the root of a person's feelings about you, it is often too late:\nYour excuses, your false humility, your defensive actions, only\nexacerbate the problem. Since it is far easier to avoid creating envy in\nthe first place than to get rid of it once it is there, you should strategize\nto forestall it before it grows. It is often your own actions that stir up\nenvy, your own unawareness. By becoming conscious of those actions\nand qualities that create envy, you can take the teeth out of it before it\nnibbles you to death.\n\nKierkegaard believed that there are types of people who create\nenvy, and are as guilty when it arises as those who feel it. The most\nobvious type we all know: The moment something good happens to\nthem, whetiier by luck or design, they crow about it. In fact they get\npleasure out of making people feel inferior. This type is obvious and\nbeyond hope. There are others, however, who stir up envy in more\nsubtle and unconscious ways, and are partly to blame for their troubles.\nEnvy is often a problem, for example, for people with great natural\ntalent.\n\n\nSir Walter Raleigh was one of the most brilliant men at the court\nof Queen Elizabeth of England. He had skills as a scientist, wrote\npoetry still recognized as among the most beautiful writing of the time,\nwas a proven leader of men, an enterprising entrepreneur, a great sea\ncaptain, and on top of all this was a handsome, dashing courtier who\ncharmed his way into becoming one of the queen's favorites. Wherever\nhe went, however, people blocked his path. Eventually he suffered a\nterrific fall from grace, leading even to prison and finally the\nexecutioner's axe.\n\nRaleigh could not understand the stubborn opposition he faced\nfrom the other courtiers. He did not see that he had not only made no\nattempt to disguise the degree of his skills and qualities, he had\nimposed them on one and all, making a show of his versatility,\nthinking it impressed people and won him friends. In fact it made him\nsilent enemies, people who felt inferior to him and did all they could to\nruin him the moment he tripped up or made the slightest mistake. In\nthe end, the reason he was executed was treason, but envy will use any\ncover it finds to mask its destructiveness.\n\nThe envy elicited by Sir Walter Raleigh is the worst kind: It was\ninspired by his natural talent and grace, which he felt was best\ndisplayed in its full flower. Money others can attain; power as well.\nBut superior intelligence, good looks, charmthese are qualities no one\ncan acquire. The naturally perfect have to work the most to disguise\ntheir brilliance, displaying a defect or two to deflect envy before it\ntakes root. It is a common and naive mistake to think you are charming\npeople with your natural talents when in fact they are coming to hate\nyou.\n\nA great danger in the realm of power is the sudden improvement\nin fortunean unexpected promotion, a victory or success mat seems to\ncome out of nowhere. This is sure to stir up envy among your former\npeers.\n\nWhen Archbishop de Retz was promoted to the rank of cardinal,\nin 1651, he knew full well that many of his former colleagues envied\nhim.\n\nUnderstanding die foolishness of alienating those below him, de\nRetz did everything he could to downplay his merit and emphasize the\nrole of luck in his success. To put people at ease, he acted humbly and\n\ndeferentially, as if nothing had changed. (In reality, of course, he now\nhad much more power than before.) He wrote that these wise policies\n\u201cproduced a good effect, by lessening the envy which was conceived\nagainst me, which is the greatest of all secrets.\u201d Follow de Retz's\nexample. Subtly emphasize how lucky you have been, to make your\nhappiness seem more attainable to other people, and die need for envy\nless acute. But be careful not to affect a false modesty diat people can\neasily see through. This will only make mem more envious. The act\nhas to be good; your humility, and your openness to those you have\nleft behind, have to seem genuine. Any hint of insincerity will only\nmake your new status more oppressive. Remember: Despite your\nelevated position, it will do you no good to alienate your former peers.\nPower requires a wide and solid support base, which envy can silendy\ndestroy.\n\nPolitical power of any kind creates envy, and one of the best ways\nto deflect it before it takes root is to seem unambitious. When Ivan the\nTerrible died, Boris Godunov knew he was the only one on the scene\nwho could lead Russia. But if he sought the position eagerly, he would\nstir up envy and suspicion among the boyars, so he refused die crown,\nnot once but several times. He made people insist mat he take die\nthrone. George Washington used the same strategy to great effect, first\nin refusing to keep the position of Commander in Chief of the\nAmerican army, second in resisting the presidency. In both cases he\nmade himself more popular than ever. People cannot envy the power\nthat tiiey themselves have given a person who does not seem to desire\nit.\n\nAccording to me Elizabeman statesman and writer Sir Francis\nBacon, the wisest policy of the powerful is to create a kind of pity for\nthemselves, as if their responsibilities were a burden and a sacrifice.\nHow can one envy a man who has taken on a heavy load for the public\ninterest Disguise your power as a kind of self-sacrifice rather than a\nsource of happiness and you make it seem less enviable. Emphasize\nyour troubles and you turn a potential danger (envy) into a source of\nmoral support (pity). A similar ploy is to hint that your good fortune\nwill benefit those around you. To do this you may need to open your\npurse strings, like Cimon, a wealdiy general in ancient Athens who\ngave lavishly in all kinds of ways to prevent people from resenting the\n\ninfluence he had bought in Atiienian politics. He paid a high price to\ndeflect dieir envy, but in the end it saved him from ostracism and\nbanishment from the city.\n\nThe painter J. M. W. Turner devised another way of giving to\ndeflect the envy of his fellow artists, which he recognized as his\ngreatest obstacle to his success. Noticing diat his incomparable color\nskills made them afraid to hang their paintings next to his in\nexhibitions, he realized that their fear would turn to envy, and would\neventually make it harder for him to find galleries to show in. On\noccasion, dien, Turner is known to have temporarily dampened the\ncolors in his paintings with soot to earn him the goodwill of his\ncolleagues.\n\none of his men to have them embarked. He himself returned to\nRome.\n\n... The quantity of marbles was immense, so that, spread over the\npiazza, they were the admiration of all and a joy to the pope, who\nheaped immeasurable favors upon Michelangelo; and when he began\nto work upon them again and again went to see him at his house, and\ntalked to him about the tomb and other things as with his own brother.\nAnd in order that he might more easily go to him, the pope ordered\nthat a drawbridge should be thrown across from the Corri-dore to the\nrooms of Michelangelo, by which he might visit him in private.\n\nThese many and frequent favors were the cause (as often is the\ncase at court) of much envy, and, after the envy, of endless persecution,\nsince Bramante, the architect, who was loved by the pope, made him\nchange his mind as to the monument by telling him, as is said by the\nvulgar, that it is unlucky to build one's tomb in one's lifetime, and other\ntales. Fear as well as envy stimulated Bramante, for the judgment of\nMichelangelo had exposed many of his errors.... Now because he had\nno doubt that Michelangelo knew these errors of his, he always sought\nto remove him from Rome, or, at least, to deprive him of the\n\nfavor of the pope, and of the glory and usefulness that he might\nhave acquired by his industry. He succeeded in the matter of the tomb.\nThere is no doubt that if Michelangelo had been allowed to finish it,\naccording to his first design, having so large afield in which to show\nhis worth, no other artist, however celebrated (be it said without envy)\ncould have wrested from him the high place he would have held.\n\nDid ever anybody seriously confess to envy Something there is in\nit universally felt to be more shameful than even felonious crime. And\nnot only does everybody disown it, but the better sort are inclined to\nincredulity when it is in earnest imputed to an intelligent man. But\nsince lodgment is in the heart not the brain, no degree of intellect\nsupplies a guarantee against it.\n\nbilly budd,\n\nHerman Melville,\n\n1819-1891\n\nTo deflect envy, Gracian recommends that the powerful display a\nweakness, a minor social indiscretion, a harmless vice. Give those who\nenvy you someming to feed on, distracting them from your more\nimportant sins. Remember: It is the reality that matters. You may have\nto play games with appearances, but in the end you will have what\ncounts: true power. In some Arab countries, a man will avoid arousing\nenvy by doing as Cosimo de Medici did by showing his wealth only on\nthe inside of his house. Apply this wisdom to your own character.\n\nBeware of some of envy's disguises. Excessive praise is an almost\nsure sign that die person praising you envies you; they are either\nsetting you up for a fallit will be impossible for you to live up to their\npraiseor they are sharpening their blades behind your back. At the\nsame time, those who are hypercritical of you, or who slander you\npublicly, probably envy you as well. Recognize their behavior as\ndisguised envy and you keep out of the trap of mutual mud-slinging, or\nof taking their criticisms to heart. Win your revenge by ignoring tiieir\nmeasly presence.\n\nDo not try to help or do favors for those who envy you; they will\nthink you are condescending to them. Joe Orton's attempt to help\nHalliwell find a gallery for his work only intensified his lover's\nfeelings of inferiority and envy. Once envy reveals itself for what it is,\nthe only solution is often to flee the presence of the enviers, leaving\nthem to stew in a hell of their own creation.\n\nFinally, be aware that some environments are more conducive to\nenvy than others. The effects of envy are more serious among\ncolleagues and peers, where there is a veneer of equality. Envy is also\ndestructive in democratic environments where overt displays of power\nare looked down upon. Be extrasensitive in such environments. The\n\nfilmmaker Ingmar Bergman was hounded by Swedish tax authorities\nbecause he stood out in a country where standing out from the crowd is\nfrowned on. It is almost impossible to avoid envy in such cases, and\nthere is little you can do but accept it graciously and take none of it\npersonally. As Thoreau once said, \u201cEnvy is die tax which all\ndistinction must pay.\u201d\n\nImage: A Garden of Weeds. You may not feed them but they\nspread as you water the garden. You may not see how, but they take\nover, tall and ugly, preventing anything beautiful from flourishing.\nBefore it is too late, do not water indiscriminately. Destroy the weeds\nof envy by giving them\n\nnothing to feed on.\n\nAuthority: Upon occasion, reveal a harmless defect in your\ncharacter. For the envious accuse the most perfect of sinning by having\nno sins. They become an Argus, all eyes for finding fault with\nexcellenceit is their only consolation. Do not let envy burst with its\nown venomaffect some lapse in valor or intellect, so as to disarm it\nbeforehand. You thus wave your red cape before the Horns of Envy, in\norder to save your immortality. (Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nThe reason for being careful with the envious is that they are so\nindirect, and will find innumerable ways to undermine you. But\ntreading carefully around them will often only make their envy worse.\nThey sense that you are being cautious, and it registers as yet another\nsign of your superiority. That is why you must act before envy takes\nroot.\n\nOnce envy is there, however, whether through your fault or not, it\nis sometimes best to affect the opposite approach: Display the utmost\ndisdain for those who envy you. Instead of hiding your perfection,\nmake it obvious. Make every new triumph an opportunity to make the\nenvious squirm. Your good fortune and power become their living hell.\nIf you attain a position of unimpeachable power, their envy will have\nno effect on you, and you will have the best revenge of all: They are\ntrapped in envy while you are free in your power.\n\nThis is how Michelangelo triumphed over die venomous architect\nBramante, who turned Pope Julius against Michelangelo's design for\nhis tomb. Bramante envied Michelangelo's godlike skills, and to this\n\none triumphthe aborted tomb projecthe thought to add another, by\npushing the pope to commission Michelangelo to paint the murals in\nthe Sistine Chapel. The project would take years, during which\nMichelangelo would accomplish no more of his brilliant sculptures.\nFurthermore, Bramante considered Michelangelo not nearly as skilled\nin painting as in sculpture. The chapel would spoil his image as the\nperfect artist.\n\nMichelangelo saw the trap and wanted to turn down the\ncommission, but he could not refuse the pope, so he accepted it\nwithout complaint. Then, however, he used Bramante's envy to spur\nhim to greater heights, making the Sistine Chapel his most perfect\nwork of all. Every time Bramante heard of it or saw it, he felt more\noppressed by his own envydie sweetest and most lasting revenge you\ncan exact on die envious.\n\nKnow how to triumph over envy and malice. Here contempt,\nalthough prudent, counts, indeed, for little; magnanimity is better. A\ngood word concerning one who speaks evil of you cannot be praised\ntoo highly: there is no revenge more heroic than that brought about by\nthose merits and attainments which frustrate and torment the envious.\nEvery stroke of good fortune is a further twist of the rope round the\nneck of the ill-disposed and the heaven of the envied is hell for the\nenvious. To convert your good fortune into poison for your enemies is\nheld to be the most severe punishment you can inflict on them. The\nenvious man dies not only once but as many times as the person he\nenvies lives to hear the voice of praise; the eternity of the latter's fame\nis the measure of the former's punishment: the one is immortal in his\nglory, the latter in his misery. The trumpet of fame which sounds\nimmortality for the one heralds death for the other, who is sentenced to\nbe choked to death on his own envy.\n\nBaltasar Gracian, 1601-1658\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Below is an excerpt from my book titled '48 Laws of Power', specifically from Chapter '48 Laws of Power', Section 'LAW 47'. The original text is: 'DO NOT GO PAST THE MARK YOU AIMED FOR;\n\nIN VICTORY, LEARN WHEN TO STOP\n\nJUDGMENT\n\nThe moment of victory is often the moment of greatest peril. In\nthe heat of victory, arrogance and overconfi-dence can push you past\nthe goal you had aimed for, and by going too far, you make more\nenemies than you defeat. Do not allow success to go to your head.\nThere is no substitute for strategy and careful planning. Set a goal, and\nwhen you reach it, stop.\n\nTRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW\n\nIn 559 B.C., a young man named Cyrus gathered an immense\narmy from die scattered tribes of Persia and marched against his\ngrandfadier Astyages, king of the Medes. He defeated Astyages with\nease, had himself crowned king of Medea and Persia, and began to\nforge the Persian Empire. Victory followed victory in quick\nsuccession. Cyrus defeated Croesus, ruler of Lydia, then conquered the\nIonian islands and odier smaller kingdoms; he marched on Babylon\nand crushed it. Now he was known as Cyrus the Great, King of the\nWorld.\n\nAfter capturing the riches of Babylon, Cyrus set his sights on the\neast, on the half-barbaric tribes of the Massagetai, a vast realm on the\nCaspian Sea. A fierce warrior race led by Queen Tomyris, the\nMassagetai lacked the riches of Babylon, but Cyrus decided to attack\nthem anyway, believing himself superhuman and incapable of defeat.\nThe Massagetai would fall easily to his vast armies, making his empire\nimmense.\n\nIn 529 B.C., then, Cyrus marched to the wide river Araxes,\ngateway to the kingdom of the Massagetai. As he set up camp on die\nwestern bank, he received a message from Queen Tomyris: \u201cKing of\nthe Medes,\u201d she told him, \u201cI advise you to abandon this enterprise, for\nyou cannot know if in the end it will do you any good. Rule your own\n\npeople, and try to bear the sight of me ruling mine. But of course you\nwill refuse my advice, as the last diing you wish for is to live in\npeace.\u201d Tomyris, confident of her army's strength and not wishing to\ndelay the inevitable batde, offered to withdraw die troops on her side\nof the river, allowing Cyrus to cross its waters safely and fight her\narmy on the eastern side, if diat was his desire.\n\nCyrus agreed, but instead of engaging the enemy directly he\ndecided to play a trick. The Massagetai knew few luxuries. Once\nCyrus had crossed the river and made his camp on the eastern side, he\nset the table for an elaborate banquet, full of meat, delicacies, and\nstrong wine. Then he left his weakest troops in the camp and withdrew\ndie rest of the army to the river. A large Massagetai detachment soon\nattacked the camp and killed all of the Persian soldiers in a fierce\nbatde. Then, overwhelmed by die fabulous feast that had been left\nbehind, they ate and drank to dieir hearts' content. Later, inevitably,\nthey fell asleep. The Persian army returned to the camp that night,\nkilling many of die sleeping soldiers and capturing die rest. Among the\nprisoners was dieir general, a youth named Spargapises, son of Queen\nTomyris.\n\nWhen die queen learned what had happened, she sent a message\nto Cyrus, chiding him for using tricks to defeat her army. \u201cNow listen\nto me,\u201d she wrote, \u201cand I will advise you for your own good: Give me\nback my son and leave my country with your forces intact, and be\ncontent with your triumph over a third part of the Massagetai. If you\nrefuse, I swear by the sun our master to give you more blood dian you\ncan drink, for all your gluttony.\u201d Cyrus scoffed at her: He would not\nrelease her son. He would crush these barbarians.\n\nThe queen's son, seeing he would not be released, could not stand\nthe\n\nTill-. VMMM.OHIOI'S COCKI'.KKI.\n\nTwo cockerels fought on a dungheap. One cockerel was the\nstronger: he vanquished the other and drove him from the dungheap.\nAll the hens gathered around the cockerel, and began to laud him. The\ncockerel wanted his strength and glory to be known in the next yard.\nHe flew on lop of the barn, flapped his wings, and crowed in a loud\nvoice: \u201cLook at me, all of you. I am a victorious cockerel. No other\ncockerel in the world has such strength as I.\u201d The cockerel had not\n\nfinished, when an eagle killed him, seized him in his claws, and carried\nhim to his nest.\n\nTABLES,\n\nLeo Tolstoy, 1828-1910\n\nIn all your cross-examinations .... most important of all, let me\nrepeal the injunction to be ever on the alert for a good place to stop.\nNothing can be more important than to cU)se your examination with a\ntriumph. So many lawyers succeed in catching a witness in a serious\ncontradiction; but, not satisfied with this, go on asking questions, and\ntaper off their examination until the effect upon the jury of their former\nadvantage is lost altogether.\n\nthe art 04 cross-examination, Francis L.Wfi.lman, 1913\n\nWe read of many instances of this kind; for the general who by\nhis valor has conquered a state for his master, and won great glory for\nhimself by his victory over the enemy, and has loaded his soldiers with\nrich booty, acquires necessarily with his own soldiers, as well as with\nthose of the enemy and with the subjects of the prince, so high a\nreputation, that his very victory may become distasteful, and a cause\nfor apprehension to his prince. For as the\n\nhumiliation, and so he killed himself. The news of her son's death\noverwhelmed Tomyris. She gathered all the forces that she could\nmuster in her kingdom, and whipping them into a vengeful frenzy,\nengaged Cyrus's troops in a violent and bloody battle. Finally, the\nMassagetai prevailed. In their anger they decimated the Persian army,\nkilling Cyrus himself.\n\nAfter the battle, Tomyris and her soldiers searched the battlefield\nfor Cyrus's corpse. When she found it she cut off his head and shoved\nit into a wineskin full of human blood, crying out, \u201cThough I have\nconquered you and live, yet you have ruined me by treacherously\ntaking my son. See now! fulfill my tiireat: You have your fill of\nblood.\u201d After Cyrus's death, the Persian Empire quickly unraveled.\nOne act of arrogance undid all of Cyrus's good work.\n\nInterpretation\n\nThere is nothing more intoxicating man victory, and nothing more\ndangerous.\n\nCyrus had built his great empire on the ruins of a previous one. A\nhundred years earlier, the powerful Assyrian Empire had been totally\n\ndestroyed, its once splendid capital of Nineveh but ruins in the sand.\nThe Assyrians had suffered this fate because they had pushed too far,\ndestroying one city-state after another until mey lost sight of the\npurposes of their victories, and also of the costs. They overextended\nthemselves and made many enemies who were finally able to band\ntogether and destroy them.\n\nCyrus ignored the lesson of Assyria. He paid no heed to the\nwarnings of oracles and advisers. He did not worry about offending a\nqueen. His many victories had gone to his head, clouding his reason.\nInstead of consolidating his already vast empire, he pushed forward.\nInstead of recognizing each situation as different, he thought each new\nwar would bring the same result as the one before as long as he used\nthe methods he knew: ruthless force and cunning.\n\nUnderstand: In the realm of power, you must be guided by reason.\nTo let a momentary thrill or an emotional victory influence or guide\nyour moves will prove fatal. When you attain success, step back. Be\ncautious. When you gain victory, understand the part played by the\nparticular circumstances of a situation, and never simply repeat the\nsame actions again and again. History is littered with the ruins of\nvictorious empires and die corpses of leaders who could not learn to\nstop and consolidate their gains.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nNo single person in history has occupied a more delicate and\nprecarious position than the king's mistress. She had no real or\nlegitimate power base to fall back on in times of trouble; she was\nsurrounded by packs of envious courtiers eagerly anticipating her fall\nfrom grace; and finally, since die source of her power was usually her\nphysical beauty, for most royal mistresses mat fall was inevitable and\nunpleasant.\n\nKing Louis XV of France began to keep official mistresses in the\nearly days of his reign, each woman's good fortune rarely lasting more\nthan a few years. But men came Madame de Pompadour, who, when\nshe was a middle-class child of nine named Jeanne Poisson, had been\ntold by a fortune-teller that she would someday be the king's favorite.\nThis seemed an absurd dream, since die royal mistress almost always\ncame from the aristocracy. Jeanne nevertheless believed herself\ndestined to seduce the king, and doing so became her obsession. She\n\napplied herself to the talents the king's favorite had to havemusic,\ndancing, acting, horseback riding and she excelled in every one of\nthem. As a young woman, she married a man of the lower nobility,\nwhich gave her an entree to the best salons in Paris. Word quickly\nspread of her beauty, talent, charm, and intelligence.\n\nJeanne Poisson became close friends with Voltaire, Montesquieu,\nand other great minds of the time, but she never lost sight of the goal\nshe had set herself as a girl: to capture the heart of the king. Her\nhusband had a chateau in a forest where the king would often go\nhunting, and she began to spend a lot of time there. Studying his\nmovements like a hawk, she would make sure he would \u201chappen\u201d to\ncome upon her while she was out walking in her most alluring dress,\nor riding in her splendid coach. The king began to take note of her,\nmaking her gifts of die game he caught in the hunt.\n\nIn 1744 Louis's current mistress, the Duchesse de Chateauroux,\ndied. Jeanne went on the offensive. She placed herself everywhere he\nwould be: at masked balls at Versailles, at the opera, wherever their\npaths would cross, and wherever she could display her many talents:\ndancing, singing, riding, coquetry. The king finally succumbed to her\ncharms, and in a ceremony at Versailles in September of 1745, diis\ntwenty-four-year-old daughter of a middle-class banking agent was\nofficially inaugurated as the king's mistress. She was given her own\nroom in the palace, a room the king could enter at any time via a\nhidden stairway and back door. And because some of the courtiers\nwere angry that he had chosen a woman of low origins, he made her a\nmarquise. From now on she would be known as Madame de\nPompadour.\n\nThe king was a man whom die slightest feeling of boredom would\noppress out of proportion. Madame de Pompadour knew that keeping\nhim under her spell meant keeping him amused. To that end she put on\nconstant theatrical productions at Versailles, in which she starred. She\norganized elaborate hunting parties, masked balls, and whatever else it\nwould take to keep him diverted outside the bedroom. She became a\npatroness of the arts, and the arbiter of taste and fashion for all of\nFrance. Her enemies at the court only grew in number with each new\nsuccess, but Madame de Pompadour thwarted diem in a totally novel\nway for a king's mistress: with extreme politeness. Snobs who resented\n\nher for her low birth she won over with charm and grace. Most unusual\nof all, she befriended die queen, and insisted mat Louis XV pay more\nattention to his wife, and treat her more kindly. Even the royal family\nbegrudgingly gave her their support. To\n\nnature of men is ambitious as well as suspicious, and puts no\nlimits to one's good fortune, it is not impossible that the suspicion that\nmay suddenly be aroused in the mind of the prince by the victory of\nthe general may have been aggravated by some haughty expressions or\ninsolent acts on his part; so that the prince will naturally be made to\nthink of securing himself against the ambition of his general. And to\ndo this, the means that suggest themselves to him are either to have the\ngeneral killed, or to deprive him of that reputation which he has\nacquired with the prince's army and the people, by using every means\nto prove that the general's victory was not due to his skill and courage,\nbut to chance and the cowardice of the enemy, or to the sagacity of the\nother captains who were with him in that action.\n\nNiccolO Machiavelli, 1469-1527\n\nA man who was famous as a tree climber was guiding someone in\nclimbing a tall tree. He ordered the man to cut the top branches, and,\nduring this time, when the man seemed to be in great danger, the\nexpert said nothing. Only when the man was coming down and had\nreached the height of the eaves did the expert call out, \u201cBe careful!\nWatch your step coming down!\u201d I asked him, \u201cWhy did you say that\nAt that height he could jump the rest of the way if he chose. \u201d \u201cThat's\nthe point, \u201d said the expert. \u201cAs long as the man was up at a dizzy\nheight and the branches were threatening to break, he himself was so\nafraid I said nothing. Mistakes are always made when people get to the\neasy places. \u201d This man belonged to the lowest class, but his words\nwere in perfect accord with the precepts of the sages. In football too,\nthey say that after you have kicked out of a difficult place and you\nthink the next one will be easier you are sure to miss the ball.\n\nessays in idleness,\n\nKenko,\n\nJapan,\n\nfourteenthcentury\n\ncrown her glory, die king made her a duchess. Her sway was felt\neven in politics: Indeed she became the untided minister of foreign\n\n\naffairs.\n\nIn 1751, when Madame de Pompadour was at the height of her\npower, she experienced her worst crisis. Physically weakened by die\nresponsibilities of her position, she found it increasingly difficult to\nmeet die king's demands in bed. This was usually the point at which\ndie mistress would meet her end, struggling to maintain her position as\nher beauty faded. But Madame de Pompadour had a strategy: She\nencouraged the king to set up a kind of brothel, Pare aux Cerfs, on the\ngrounds of Versailles. There die middle-aged king could have liaisons\nwidi die most beautiful young girls in the realm.\n\nMadame de Pompadour knew tiiat her charm and her political\nacumen had made her indispensable to the king. What did she have to\nfear from a sixteen-year-old who had none of her power and presence\nWhat did it matter if she lost her position in the bedroom, as long as\nshe remained the most powerful woman in France To secure tiiat\nposition she became still closer friends with the queen, with whom she\nstarted attending church. Although her enemies at the court conspired\nto have her toppled from her official position as king's mistress, die\nking kept her on, for he needed her calming effect. It was only when\nher part in the disastrous Seven Years' War drew much criticism on her\nthat she slowly wididrew from public affairs.\n\nMadame de Pompadour's healdi had always been delicate, and\nshe died at the age of forty-three, in 1764. Her reign as mistress had\nlasted an unprecedented twenty years. \u201cShe was regretted by all,\u201d\nwrote the Due de Croy, \u201cfor she was kindly and helpful to everyone\nwho approached her.\u201d\n\nInterpretation\n\nAware of die temporariness of her power, die king's mistress\nwould often go into a kind of frenzy after capturing die king: She\nwould try to accumulate as much money as possible to protect her after\nher inevitable fall. And to extend her reign as long as possible, she\nwould be rutiiless widi her enemies in the court. Her situation, in odier\nwords, seemed to demand from her a greed and vindictiveness diat\nwould often be her undoing. Madame de Pompadour succeeded where\nall others had failed because she never pressed her good fortune.\nInstead of bullying die courtiers from her powerful position as die\nking's mistress, she tried to win their support. She never revealed die\n\nslightest hint of greed or arrogance. When she could no longer perform\nher physical duties as mistress, she did not fret at the tiiought of\nsomeone replacing her in bed. She simply applied some strategyshe\nencouraged the king to take young lovers, knowing that the younger\nand prettier they were, the less of a direat they posed, since diey could\nnot compare to her in charm and sophistication and would soon bore\ndie monarch.\n\nSuccess plays strange tricks on die mind. It makes you feel\ninvulnerable, while also making you more hostile and emotional when\npeople chal-\n\nlenge your power. It makes you less able to adapt to circumstance.\nYou come to believe your character is more responsible for your\nsuccess than your strategizing and planning. Like Madame de\nPompadour, you need to realize that your moment of triumph is also a\nmoment when you have to rely on cunning and strategy all the more,\nconsolidating your power base, recognizing the role of luck and\ncircumstance in your success, and remaining vigilant against changes\nin your good fortune. It is the moment of victory when you need to\nplay the courtier's game and pay more attention dian ever to the laws\nof power.\n\nThe greatest danger occurs at the moment of victory. Napoleon\nBonaparte, 1769-1821\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nPower has its own rhythms and patterns. Those who succeed at\nthe game are the ones who control the patterns and vary them at will,\nkeeping people off balance while they set the tempo. The essence of\nstrategy is controlling what comes next, and the elation of victory can\nupset your ability to control what comes next in two ways. First, you\nowe your success to a pattern that you are apt to try to repeat. You will\ntry to keep moving in the same direction without stopping to see\nwhether this is still die direction that is best for you. Second, success\ntends to go to your head and make you emotional. Feeling\ninvulnerable, you make aggressive moves diat ultimately undo die\nvictory you have gained.\n\nThe lesson is simple: The powerful vary dieir rhythms and\npatterns, change course, adapt to circumstance, and learn to improvise.\nRadier than letting their dancing feet impel them forward, they step\n\nback and look where they are going. It is as if dieir bloodstream bore a\nkind of antidote to the intoxication of victory, letting them control their\nemotions and come to a kind of mental halt when they have attained\nsuccess. They steady tiiem-selves, give themselves the space to reflect\non what has happened, examine the role of circumstance and luck in\ntiieir success. As they say in riding school, you have to be able to\ncontrol yourself before you can control the horse.\n\nLuck and circumstance always play a role in power. This is\ninevitable, and actually makes die game more interesting. But despite\nwhat you may think, good luck is more dangerous tiian bad luck. Bad\nluck teaches valuable lessons about patience, timing, and the need to\nbe prepared for the worst; good luck deludes you into die opposite\nlesson, making you mink your brilliance will carry you dirough. Your\nortune will inevitably turn, and when it does you will be completely\nunprepared.\n\nAccording to Machiavelli, this is what undid Cesare Borgia. He\nhad many triumphs, was actually a clever strategist, but had the bad\nluck to have good luck: He had a pope for a fatiier. Then, when he had\nbad luck for realhis father's deamhe was unprepared for it, and the\nmany ene-\n\nmies he had made devoured him. The good luck diat elevates you\nor seals your success brings the moment for you to open your eyes:\nThe wheel of fortune will hurtle you down as easily as up. If you\nprepare for the fall, it is less likely to ruin you when it happens.\n\nPeople who have a run of success can catch a kind of fever, and\neven when they themselves try to stay calm, the people below diem\noften pressure diem to go past their mark and into dangerous waters.\nYou have to have a strategy for dealing with these people. Simply\npreaching moderation will make you look weak and small-minded;\nseeming to fail to follow up on a victory can lessen your power.\n\nWhen the Athenian general and statesman Pericles led a series of\nnaval campaigns around the Black Sea in 436 B.C., his easy triumphs\nen-flamed die Adienians' desire for more. They dreamed of conquering\nEgypt, overrunning Persia, sailing for Sicily. On the one hand Pericles\nreined in these dangerous emotions by warning of the perils of hubris.\nOn the other hand he fed them by fighting small battles that he knew\nhe could win, creating the appearance that he was preserving the\n\n\nmomentum of success. The skill with which Pericles played this game\nis revealed by what happened when he died: The demagogues took\nover, pushed Adiens into invading Sicily, and in one rash move\ndestroyed an empire.\n\nThe rhydim of power often requires an alternation of force and\ncunning. Too much force creates a counterreaction; too much cunning,\nno matter how cunning it is, becomes predictable. Working on behalf\nof his master, die shogun Oda Nobunaga, the great sixteenth-century\nJapanese general (and future emperor) Hideyoshi once engineered a\nstunning victory over the army of the formidable General Yoshimoto.\nThe shogun wanted to go further, to take on and crush yet another\npowerful enemy, but Hideyoshi reminded him of the old Japanese\nsaying: \u201cWhen you have won a victory, tighten the strings of your\nhelmet.\u201d For Hideyoshi this was die moment for the shogun to switch\nfrom force to cunning and indirection, setting his enemies against one\nanother through a series of deceptive alliances. In diis way he would\navoid stirring up needless opposition by appearing overly aggressive.\nWhen you are victorious, tiien, lie low, and lull the enemy into\ninaction. These changes of rhydim are immensely powerful.\n\nPeople who go past the mark are often motivated by a desire to\nplease a master by proving their dedication. But an excess of effort\nexposes you to die risk of making the master suspicious of you. On\nseveral occasions, generals under Philip of Macedon were disgraced\nand demoted immediately after leading dieir troops to a great victory;\none more such victory, Philip thought, and the man might become a\nrival instead of an underling. When you serve a master, it is often wise\nto measure your victories carefully, letting him get die glory and never\nmaking him uneasy. It is also wise to establish a pattern of strict\nobedience to earn his trust.

He defeated Astyages with\nease, had himself crowned king of Medea and Persia, and began to\nforge the Persian Empire. Victory followed victory in quick\nsuccession. Cyrus defeated Croesus, ruler of Lydia, then conquered the\nIonian islands and odier smaller kingdoms; he marched on Babylon\nand crushed it. Now he was known as Cyrus the Great, King of the\nWorld.\n\nAfter capturing the riches of Babylon, Cyrus set his sights on the\neast, on the half-barbaric tribes of the Massagetai, a vast realm on the\nCaspian Sea. A fierce warrior race led by Queen Tomyris, the\nMassagetai lacked the riches of Babylon, but Cyrus decided to attack\nthem anyway, believing himself superhuman and incapable of defeat.\nThe Massagetai would fall easily to his vast armies, making his empire\nimmense.\n\nIn 529 B.C., then, Cyrus marched to the wide river Araxes,\ngateway to the kingdom of the Massagetai. As he set up camp on die\nwestern bank, he received a message from Queen Tomyris: \u201cKing of\nthe Medes,\u201d she told him, \u201cI advise you to abandon this enterprise, for\nyou cannot know if in the end it will do you any good. Rule your own\n\npeople, and try to bear the sight of me ruling mine. But of course you\nwill refuse my advice, as the last diing you wish for is to live in\npeace.\u201d Tomyris, confident of her army's strength and not wishing to\ndelay the inevitable batde, offered to withdraw die troops on her side\nof the river, allowing Cyrus to cross its waters safely and fight her\narmy on the eastern side, if diat was his desire.\n\nCyrus agreed, but instead of engaging the enemy directly he\ndecided to play a trick. The Massagetai knew few luxuries. Once\nCyrus had crossed the river and made his camp on the eastern side, he\nset the table for an elaborate banquet, full of meat, delicacies, and\nstrong wine. Then he left his weakest troops in the camp and withdrew\ndie rest of the army to the river. A large Massagetai detachment soon\nattacked the camp and killed all of the Persian soldiers in a fierce\nbatde. Then, overwhelmed by die fabulous feast that had been left\nbehind, they ate and drank to dieir hearts' content. Later, inevitably,\nthey fell asleep. The Persian army returned to the camp that night,\nkilling many of die sleeping soldiers and capturing die rest. Among the\nprisoners was dieir general, a youth named Spargapises, son of Queen\nTomyris.\n\nWhen die queen learned what had happened, she sent a message\nto Cyrus, chiding him for using tricks to defeat her army. \u201cNow listen\nto me,\u201d she wrote, \u201cand I will advise you for your own good: Give me\nback my son and leave my country with your forces intact, and be\ncontent with your triumph over a third part of the Massagetai. If you\nrefuse, I swear by the sun our master to give you more blood dian you\ncan drink, for all your gluttony.\u201d Cyrus scoffed at her: He would not\nrelease her son. He would crush these barbarians.\n\nThe queen's son, seeing he would not be released, could not stand\nthe\n\nTill-. VMMM.OHIOI'S COCKI'.KKI.\n\nTwo cockerels fought on a dungheap. One cockerel was the\nstronger: he vanquished the other and drove him from the dungheap.\nAll the hens gathered around the cockerel, and began to laud him. The\ncockerel wanted his strength and glory to be known in the next yard.\nHe flew on lop of the barn, flapped his wings, and crowed in a loud\nvoice: \u201cLook at me, all of you. I am a victorious cockerel. No other\ncockerel in the world has such strength as I.\u201d The cockerel had not\n\nfinished, when an eagle killed him, seized him in his claws, and carried\nhim to his nest.\n\nTABLES,\n\nLeo Tolstoy, 1828-1910\n\nIn all your cross-examinations .... most important of all, let me\nrepeal the injunction to be ever on the alert for a good place to stop.\nNothing can be more important than to cU)se your examination with a\ntriumph. So many lawyers succeed in catching a witness in a serious\ncontradiction; but, not satisfied with this, go on asking questions, and\ntaper off their examination until the effect upon the jury of their former\nadvantage is lost altogether.\n\nthe art 04 cross-examination, Francis L.Wfi.lman, 1913\n\nWe read of many instances of this kind; for the general who by\nhis valor has conquered a state for his master, and won great glory for\nhimself by his victory over the enemy, and has loaded his soldiers with\nrich booty, acquires necessarily with his own soldiers, as well as with\nthose of the enemy and with the subjects of the prince, so high a\nreputation, that his very victory may become distasteful, and a cause\nfor apprehension to his prince. For as the\n\nhumiliation, and so he killed himself. The news of her son's death\noverwhelmed Tomyris. She gathered all the forces that she could\nmuster in her kingdom, and whipping them into a vengeful frenzy,\nengaged Cyrus's troops in a violent and bloody battle. Finally, the\nMassagetai prevailed. In their anger they decimated the Persian army,\nkilling Cyrus himself.\n\nAfter the battle, Tomyris and her soldiers searched the battlefield\nfor Cyrus's corpse. When she found it she cut off his head and shoved\nit into a wineskin full of human blood, crying out, \u201cThough I have\nconquered you and live, yet you have ruined me by treacherously\ntaking my son. See now! fulfill my tiireat: You have your fill of\nblood.\u201d After Cyrus's death, the Persian Empire quickly unraveled.\nOne act of arrogance undid all of Cyrus's good work.\n\nInterpretation\n\nThere is nothing more intoxicating man victory, and nothing more\ndangerous.\n\nCyrus had built his great empire on the ruins of a previous one. A\nhundred years earlier, the powerful Assyrian Empire had been totally\n\ndestroyed, its once splendid capital of Nineveh but ruins in the sand.\nThe Assyrians had suffered this fate because they had pushed too far,\ndestroying one city-state after another until mey lost sight of the\npurposes of their victories, and also of the costs. They overextended\nthemselves and made many enemies who were finally able to band\ntogether and destroy them.\n\nCyrus ignored the lesson of Assyria. He paid no heed to the\nwarnings of oracles and advisers. He did not worry about offending a\nqueen. His many victories had gone to his head, clouding his reason.\nInstead of consolidating his already vast empire, he pushed forward.\nInstead of recognizing each situation as different, he thought each new\nwar would bring the same result as the one before as long as he used\nthe methods he knew: ruthless force and cunning.\n\nUnderstand: In the realm of power, you must be guided by reason.\nTo let a momentary thrill or an emotional victory influence or guide\nyour moves will prove fatal. When you attain success, step back. Be\ncautious. When you gain victory, understand the part played by the\nparticular circumstances of a situation, and never simply repeat the\nsame actions again and again. History is littered with the ruins of\nvictorious empires and die corpses of leaders who could not learn to\nstop and consolidate their gains.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nNo single person in history has occupied a more delicate and\nprecarious position than the king's mistress. She had no real or\nlegitimate power base to fall back on in times of trouble; she was\nsurrounded by packs of envious courtiers eagerly anticipating her fall\nfrom grace; and finally, since die source of her power was usually her\nphysical beauty, for most royal mistresses mat fall was inevitable and\nunpleasant.\n\nKing Louis XV of France began to keep official mistresses in the\nearly days of his reign, each woman's good fortune rarely lasting more\nthan a few years. But men came Madame de Pompadour, who, when\nshe was a middle-class child of nine named Jeanne Poisson, had been\ntold by a fortune-teller that she would someday be the king's favorite.\nThis seemed an absurd dream, since die royal mistress almost always\ncame from the aristocracy. Jeanne nevertheless believed herself\ndestined to seduce the king, and doing so became her obsession. She\n\napplied herself to the talents the king's favorite had to havemusic,\ndancing, acting, horseback riding and she excelled in every one of\nthem. As a young woman, she married a man of the lower nobility,\nwhich gave her an entree to the best salons in Paris. Word quickly\nspread of her beauty, talent, charm, and intelligence.\n\nJeanne Poisson became close friends with Voltaire, Montesquieu,\nand other great minds of the time, but she never lost sight of the goal\nshe had set herself as a girl: to capture the heart of the king. Her\nhusband had a chateau in a forest where the king would often go\nhunting, and she began to spend a lot of time there. Studying his\nmovements like a hawk, she would make sure he would \u201chappen\u201d to\ncome upon her while she was out walking in her most alluring dress,\nor riding in her splendid coach. The king began to take note of her,\nmaking her gifts of die game he caught in the hunt.\n\nIn 1744 Louis's current mistress, the Duchesse de Chateauroux,\ndied. Jeanne went on the offensive. She placed herself everywhere he\nwould be: at masked balls at Versailles, at the opera, wherever their\npaths would cross, and wherever she could display her many talents:\ndancing, singing, riding, coquetry. The king finally succumbed to her\ncharms, and in a ceremony at Versailles in September of 1745, diis\ntwenty-four-year-old daughter of a middle-class banking agent was\nofficially inaugurated as the king's mistress. She was given her own\nroom in the palace, a room the king could enter at any time via a\nhidden stairway and back door. And because some of the courtiers\nwere angry that he had chosen a woman of low origins, he made her a\nmarquise. From now on she would be known as Madame de\nPompadour.\n\nThe king was a man whom die slightest feeling of boredom would\noppress out of proportion. Madame de Pompadour knew that keeping\nhim under her spell meant keeping him amused. To that end she put on\nconstant theatrical productions at Versailles, in which she starred. She\norganized elaborate hunting parties, masked balls, and whatever else it\nwould take to keep him diverted outside the bedroom. She became a\npatroness of the arts, and the arbiter of taste and fashion for all of\nFrance. Her enemies at the court only grew in number with each new\nsuccess, but Madame de Pompadour thwarted diem in a totally novel\nway for a king's mistress: with extreme politeness. Snobs who resented\n\nher for her low birth she won over with charm and grace. Most unusual\nof all, she befriended die queen, and insisted mat Louis XV pay more\nattention to his wife, and treat her more kindly. Even the royal family\nbegrudgingly gave her their support. To\n\nnature of men is ambitious as well as suspicious, and puts no\nlimits to one's good fortune, it is not impossible that the suspicion that\nmay suddenly be aroused in the mind of the prince by the victory of\nthe general may have been aggravated by some haughty expressions or\ninsolent acts on his part; so that the prince will naturally be made to\nthink of securing himself against the ambition of his general. And to\ndo this, the means that suggest themselves to him are either to have the\ngeneral killed, or to deprive him of that reputation which he has\nacquired with the prince's army and the people, by using every means\nto prove that the general's victory was not due to his skill and courage,\nbut to chance and the cowardice of the enemy, or to the sagacity of the\nother captains who were with him in that action.\n\nNiccolO Machiavelli, 1469-1527\n\nA man who was famous as a tree climber was guiding someone in\nclimbing a tall tree. He ordered the man to cut the top branches, and,\nduring this time, when the man seemed to be in great danger, the\nexpert said nothing. Only when the man was coming down and had\nreached the height of the eaves did the expert call out, \u201cBe careful!\nWatch your step coming down!\u201d I asked him, \u201cWhy did you say that\nAt that height he could jump the rest of the way if he chose. \u201d \u201cThat's\nthe point, \u201d said the expert. \u201cAs long as the man was up at a dizzy\nheight and the branches were threatening to break, he himself was so\nafraid I said nothing. Mistakes are always made when people get to the\neasy places. \u201d This man belonged to the lowest class, but his words\nwere in perfect accord with the precepts of the sages. In football too,\nthey say that after you have kicked out of a difficult place and you\nthink the next one will be easier you are sure to miss the ball.\n\nessays in idleness,\n\nKenko,\n\nJapan,\n\nfourteenthcentury\n\ncrown her glory, die king made her a duchess. Her sway was felt\neven in politics: Indeed she became the untided minister of foreign\n\n\naffairs.\n\nIn 1751, when Madame de Pompadour was at the height of her\npower, she experienced her worst crisis. Physically weakened by die\nresponsibilities of her position, she found it increasingly difficult to\nmeet die king's demands in bed. This was usually the point at which\ndie mistress would meet her end, struggling to maintain her position as\nher beauty faded. But Madame de Pompadour had a strategy: She\nencouraged the king to set up a kind of brothel, Pare aux Cerfs, on the\ngrounds of Versailles. There die middle-aged king could have liaisons\nwidi die most beautiful young girls in the realm.\n\nMadame de Pompadour knew tiiat her charm and her political\nacumen had made her indispensable to the king. What did she have to\nfear from a sixteen-year-old who had none of her power and presence\nWhat did it matter if she lost her position in the bedroom, as long as\nshe remained the most powerful woman in France To secure tiiat\nposition she became still closer friends with the queen, with whom she\nstarted attending church. Although her enemies at the court conspired\nto have her toppled from her official position as king's mistress, die\nking kept her on, for he needed her calming effect. It was only when\nher part in the disastrous Seven Years' War drew much criticism on her\nthat she slowly wididrew from public affairs.\n\nMadame de Pompadour's healdi had always been delicate, and\nshe died at the age of forty-three, in 1764. Her reign as mistress had\nlasted an unprecedented twenty years. \u201cShe was regretted by all,\u201d\nwrote the Due de Croy, \u201cfor she was kindly and helpful to everyone\nwho approached her.\u201d\n\nInterpretation\n\nAware of die temporariness of her power, die king's mistress\nwould often go into a kind of frenzy after capturing die king: She\nwould try to accumulate as much money as possible to protect her after\nher inevitable fall. And to extend her reign as long as possible, she\nwould be rutiiless widi her enemies in the court. Her situation, in odier\nwords, seemed to demand from her a greed and vindictiveness diat\nwould often be her undoing. Madame de Pompadour succeeded where\nall others had failed because she never pressed her good fortune.\nInstead of bullying die courtiers from her powerful position as die\nking's mistress, she tried to win their support. She never revealed die\n\nslightest hint of greed or arrogance. When she could no longer perform\nher physical duties as mistress, she did not fret at the tiiought of\nsomeone replacing her in bed. She simply applied some strategyshe\nencouraged the king to take young lovers, knowing that the younger\nand prettier they were, the less of a direat they posed, since diey could\nnot compare to her in charm and sophistication and would soon bore\ndie monarch.\n\nSuccess plays strange tricks on die mind. It makes you feel\ninvulnerable, while also making you more hostile and emotional when\npeople chal-\n\nlenge your power. It makes you less able to adapt to circumstance.\nYou come to believe your character is more responsible for your\nsuccess than your strategizing and planning. Like Madame de\nPompadour, you need to realize that your moment of triumph is also a\nmoment when you have to rely on cunning and strategy all the more,\nconsolidating your power base, recognizing the role of luck and\ncircumstance in your success, and remaining vigilant against changes\nin your good fortune. It is the moment of victory when you need to\nplay the courtier's game and pay more attention dian ever to the laws\nof power.\n\nThe greatest danger occurs at the moment of victory. Napoleon\nBonaparte, 1769-1821\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nPower has its own rhythms and patterns. Those who succeed at\nthe game are the ones who control the patterns and vary them at will,\nkeeping people off balance while they set the tempo. The essence of\nstrategy is controlling what comes next, and the elation of victory can\nupset your ability to control what comes next in two ways. First, you\nowe your success to a pattern that you are apt to try to repeat. You will\ntry to keep moving in the same direction without stopping to see\nwhether this is still die direction that is best for you. Second, success\ntends to go to your head and make you emotional. Feeling\ninvulnerable, you make aggressive moves diat ultimately undo die\nvictory you have gained.\n\nThe lesson is simple: The powerful vary dieir rhythms and\npatterns, change course, adapt to circumstance, and learn to improvise.\nRadier than letting their dancing feet impel them forward, they step\n\nback and look where they are going. It is as if dieir bloodstream bore a\nkind of antidote to the intoxication of victory, letting them control their\nemotions and come to a kind of mental halt when they have attained\nsuccess. They steady tiiem-selves, give themselves the space to reflect\non what has happened, examine the role of circumstance and luck in\ntiieir success. As they say in riding school, you have to be able to\ncontrol yourself before you can control the horse.\n\nLuck and circumstance always play a role in power. This is\ninevitable, and actually makes die game more interesting. But despite\nwhat you may think, good luck is more dangerous tiian bad luck. Bad\nluck teaches valuable lessons about patience, timing, and the need to\nbe prepared for the worst; good luck deludes you into die opposite\nlesson, making you mink your brilliance will carry you dirough. Your\nortune will inevitably turn, and when it does you will be completely\nunprepared.\n\nAccording to Machiavelli, this is what undid Cesare Borgia. He\nhad many triumphs, was actually a clever strategist, but had the bad\nluck to have good luck: He had a pope for a fatiier. Then, when he had\nbad luck for realhis father's deamhe was unprepared for it, and the\nmany ene-\n\nmies he had made devoured him. The good luck diat elevates you\nor seals your success brings the moment for you to open your eyes:\nThe wheel of fortune will hurtle you down as easily as up. If you\nprepare for the fall, it is less likely to ruin you when it happens.\n\nPeople who have a run of success can catch a kind of fever, and\neven when they themselves try to stay calm, the people below diem\noften pressure diem to go past their mark and into dangerous waters.\nYou have to have a strategy for dealing with these people. Simply\npreaching moderation will make you look weak and small-minded;\nseeming to fail to follow up on a victory can lessen your power.\n\nWhen the Athenian general and statesman Pericles led a series of\nnaval campaigns around the Black Sea in 436 B.C., his easy triumphs\nen-flamed die Adienians' desire for more. They dreamed of conquering\nEgypt, overrunning Persia, sailing for Sicily. On the one hand Pericles\nreined in these dangerous emotions by warning of the perils of hubris.\nOn the other hand he fed them by fighting small battles that he knew\nhe could win, creating the appearance that he was preserving the\n\n\nmomentum of success. The skill with which Pericles played this game\nis revealed by what happened when he died: The demagogues took\nover, pushed Adiens into invading Sicily, and in one rash move\ndestroyed an empire.\n\nThe rhydim of power often requires an alternation of force and\ncunning. Too much force creates a counterreaction; too much cunning,\nno matter how cunning it is, becomes predictable. Working on behalf\nof his master, die shogun Oda Nobunaga, the great sixteenth-century\nJapanese general (and future emperor) Hideyoshi once engineered a\nstunning victory over the army of the formidable General Yoshimoto.\nThe shogun wanted to go further, to take on and crush yet another\npowerful enemy, but Hideyoshi reminded him of the old Japanese\nsaying: \u201cWhen you have won a victory, tighten the strings of your\nhelmet.\u201d For Hideyoshi this was die moment for the shogun to switch\nfrom force to cunning and indirection, setting his enemies against one\nanother through a series of deceptive alliances. In diis way he would\navoid stirring up needless opposition by appearing overly aggressive.\nWhen you are victorious, tiien, lie low, and lull the enemy into\ninaction. These changes of rhydim are immensely powerful.\n\nPeople who go past the mark are often motivated by a desire to\nplease a master by proving their dedication. But an excess of effort\nexposes you to die risk of making the master suspicious of you. On\nseveral occasions, generals under Philip of Macedon were disgraced\nand demoted immediately after leading dieir troops to a great victory;\none more such victory, Philip thought, and the man might become a\nrival instead of an underling. When you serve a master, it is often wise\nto measure your victories carefully, letting him get die glory and never\nmaking him uneasy. It is also wise to establish a pattern of strict\nobedience to earn his trust. In the fourth century B.C., a captain under\ndie notoriously severe Chinese general Wu Ch'i charged ahead before a\nbatde had begun and came back with several\n\nenemy heads. He tiiought he had shown his fiery enthusiasm, but\nWu Ch'i was unimpressed. \u201cA talented officer,\u201d die general said with a\nsigh as he ordered the man beheaded, \u201cbut a disobedient one.\u201d\n\nAnother moment when a small success can spoil the chances for a\nlarger one may come if a master or superior grants you a favor: It is a\ndangerous mistake to ask for more. You will seem insecureperhaps you\n\nfeel you did not deserve this favor, and have to grab as much as you\ncan when you have the chance, which may not come again. The proper\nresponse is to accept the favor graciously and withdraw.

The city-state\nof Sparta, however, was landlocked and surrounded by mountains.\nLacking access to the Mediterranean, the Spartans never became a\n\nseafaring people; instead they turned on the cities around diem, and, in\na series of brutal, violent conflicts lasting more than a hundred years,\nmanaged to conquer an immense area diat would provide enough land\nfor dieir citizens. This solution to dieir problem, however, brought a\nnew, more formidable one: How could diey maintain and police dieir\nconquered territories The subordinate peoples diey ruled now\noutnumbered diem ten to one. Surely Uiis horde would take a horrible\nrevenge on diem.\n\nSparta's solution was to create a society dedicated to die art of\nwar. Spartans would be tougher, stronger, and fiercer dian dieir\nneighbors. This was die only way diey could ensure dieir stability and\nsurvival.\n\nWhen a Spartan boy reached the age of seven, he was taken from\nhis mother and placed in a military club where he was trained to fight\nand underwent the strictest discipline. The boys slept on beds of reeds;\ndiey were allotted only one outer garment to wear for an entire year.\nThey studied none of die arts; indeed, the Spartans banned music, and\npermitted only slaves to practice die crafts diat were necessary to\nsustain diem. The only skills die Spartans taught were diose of\nwarfare. Children seen as weaklings were left to die in a cavern in die\nmountains. No system of money or trading was allowed in Sparta;\nacquired wealtii, diey believed, would sow selfishness and dissension,\nweakening dieir warrior discipline. The only way a Spartan could earn\na living was tiirough agriculture, mosdy on state-owned lands, which\nslaves, called helots, would work for him.\n\nThe Spartans\u2019 single-mindedness allowed tiiem to forge die most\npowerful infantry in the world. They marched in perfect order and\nfought widi incomparable bravery. Their tight-knit phalanxes could\nvanquish an army ten times dieir size, as diey proved in defeating die\nPersians at Thermopylae. A Spartan column on die march would strike\nterror in die enemy; it seemed to have no weaknesses. Yet although die\nSpartans proved tiiem-selves mighty warriors, tiiey had no interest in\ncreating an empire. They only wanted to keep what diey had already\nconquered and to defend it against invaders. Decades would pass\nwitiiout a single change in the system diat had succeeded so well in\npreserving Sparta's status quo.\n\nAt die same time tiiat die Spartans were evolving dieir warlike\nculture, anotiier city-state was rising to equal prominence: Atiiens.\nUnlike Sparta, Adiens had taken to die sea, not so much to create\ncolonies as for purposes of trade. The Adienians became great\nmerchants; dieir currency, me famous \u201cowl coins,\u201d spread mroughout\ndie Mediterranean. Unlike die rigid Spartans, die Adienians responded\nto every problem with consummate creativity, adapting to die occasion\nand creating new social forms and new\n\narts at an incredible pace. Their society was in constant flux. And\nas their power grew, they came to pose a threat to the defense-minded\nSpartans.\n\nIn 431 B.C., the war that had been brewing between Athens and\nSparta for so long finally erupted. It lasted twenty-seven years, but\nafter many twists of fortune, the Spartan war machine finally emerged\nvictorious. The Spartans now commanded an empire, and this time\nuiey could not stay in their shell. If they gave up what they had gained,\nthe beaten Athenians would regroup and rise against them, and the\nlong war would have been fought for naught.\n\nAfter the war, Athenian money poured into Sparta. The Spartans\nhad been trained in warfare, not politics or economics; because they\nwere so unaccustomed to it, wealth and its accompanying ways of life\nseduced and overwhelmed them. Spartan governors were sent to rule\nwhat had been Athenian lands; far from home, they succumbed to the\nworst forms of corruption. Sparta had defeated Athens, but the fluid\nAthenian way of life was slowly breaking down its discipline and\nloosening its rigid order. And Athens, meanwhile, was adapting to\nlosing its empire, managing to thrive as a cultural and economic center.\n\nConfused by a change in its status quo, Sparta grew weaker and\nweaker. Some thirty years after defeating Athens, it lost an important\nbatde with the city-state of Thebes. Almost overnight, this once mighty\nnation collapsed, never to recover.\n\nInterpretation\n\nIn the evolution of species, protective armor has almost always\nspelled disaster. Although there are a few exceptions, the shell most\noften becomes a dead end for the animal encased in it; it slows the\ncreature down, making it hard for it to forage for food and making it a\ntarget for fast-moving predators. Animals that take to the sea or sky,\n\nand that move swiftly and unpredictably, are infinitely more powerful\nand secure.\n\nIn facing a serious problemcontrolling superior numbersSparta\nreacted like an animal that develops a shell to protect itself from the\nenvironment. But like a turtle, the Spartans sacrificed mobility for\nsafety. They managed to preserve stability for three hundred years, but\nat what cost They had no culture beyond warfare, no arts to relieve the\ntension, a constant anxiety about the status quo. While their neighbors\ntook to the sea, learning to adapt to a world of constant motion, the\nSpartans entombed themselves in their own system. Victory would\nmean new lands to govern, which tfiey did not want; defeat would\nmean the end of their military machine, which they did not want,\neither. Only stasis allowed them to survive. But nothing in the world\ncan remain stable forever, and the shell or system you evolve for your\nprotection will someday prove your undoing.\n\nIn the case of Sparta, it was not the armies of Athens that defeated\nit, but the Athenian money. Money flows everywhere it has the\nopportunity to go; it cannot be controlled, or made to fit a prescribed\npattern. It is inherently chaotic. And in the long run, money made\nAthens the conqueror,\n\nbarbarously cut off his long pendent ears. Jowler expected\nnothing less than to give up the ghost. As he advanced in years, he\nperceived that he gained more than he had lost by his mutilation; for,\nbeing naturally inclined to fight with others, he would often have\nreturned home with this part disfigured in a hundred places. A\nquarrelsome dog always has his ears lacerated. The less we leave\nothers to lay hold of the better. When one has but one point to defend,\nit should be protected for fear of accident. Take for example Master\nJowler, who, being armed with a spiked collar, and having about as\nmuch ear as a bird, a wolf would be puzzled to know where to tackle\nhim.\n\nFABLES,\n\nJean de La Fontaine, 1621-1695\n\nOne seductive and ultimately always fatal path has been the\ndevelopment of protective armor. An organism can protect itself by\nconcealment, by swiftness in flight, by effective counterattack, by\nuniting for attack and defense with other individuals of its species and\n\n\nalso by encasing itself within bony plates and spines.... Almost always\nthe experiment of armor failed. Creatures adopting it tended to become\nunwieldy. They had to move relatively slowly. Hence they were forced\nto live mainly on vegetable food; and thus in general they were at a\ndisadvantage as compared with foes living on more rapidly \u201cprofitable\n\u201d animal food: The repeated failure of protective armor shows that,\neven at a somewhat low evolutionary level, mind triumphed over mere\nmatter. It is this sort of triumph which has been supremely exemplified\nin Man.\n\nSCIENTIFIC THEORY AND RELIGION,\n\nE. W. Barnes, 1933\n\nby infiltrating the Spartan system and corroding its protective\narmor. In the battle between the two systems, Adiens was fluid and\ncreative enough to take new forms, while Sparta could grow only more\nrigid until it cracked.\n\nThis is the way the world works, whether for animals, cultures, or\nindividuals. In the face of the world's harshness and danger, organisms\nof any kind develop protectiona coat of armor, a rigid system, a\ncomforting ritual. For the short term it may work, but for the long term\nit spells disaster. People weighed down by a system and inflexible\nways of doing things cannot move fast, cannot sense or adapt to\nchange. They lumber around more and more slowly until they go the\nway of the brontosaurus. Learn to move fast and adapt or you will be\neaten.\n\nThe best way to avoid diis fate is to assume formlessness. No\npredator alive can attack what it cannot see.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nWhen World War II ended and the Japanese, who had invaded\nChina in 1937, had finally been thrown out, the Chinese Nationalists,\nlead by Chiang Kai-shek, decided the time had come to annihilate the\nChinese Communists, their hated rivals, once and for all. They had\nalmost succeeded in 1935, forcing the Communists into the Long\nMarch, the grueling retreat mat had gready diminished their numbers.\nAlthough the Communists had recovered somewhat during the war\nagainst Japan, it would not be difficult to defeat them now. They\ncontrolled only isolated areas in the countryside, had unsophisticated\nweaponry, lacked any military experience or training beyond mountain\n\nfighting, and controlled no important parts of China, except areas of\nManchuria, which they had managed to take after die Japanese retreat.\nChiang decided to commit his best forces in Manchuria. He would take\nover its major cities and from those bases would spread through this\nnorthern industrial region, sweeping the Communists away. Once\nManchuria had fallen the Communists would collapse.\n\nIn 1945 and '46 the plan worked perfectly: The Nationalists easily\ntook the major Manchurian cities. Puzzlingly, though, in the face of\nthis critical campaign, the Communist strategy made no sense. When\nthe Nationalists began their push, the Communists dispersed to\nManchuria's most out-of-the-way corners. Their small units harassed\nthe Nationalist armies, ambushing them here, retreating unexpectedly\ntiiere, but tiiese dispersed units never linked up, making them hard to\nattack. They would seize a town only to give it up a few weeks later.\nForming neither rear guards nor vanguards, they moved like mercury,\nnever staying in one place, elusive and formless.\n\nThe Nationalists ascribed this to two things: cowardice in die face\nof superior forces and inexperience in strategy. Mao Tse-tung, die\nCommunist leader, was more a poet and philosopher than a general,\nwhereas Chiang had studied warfare in die West and was a follower of\ndie German military writer Carl von Clausewitz, among others.\n\nYet a pattern did eventually emerge in Mao's attacks. After the\nNationalists had taken the cities, leaving the Communists to occupy\nwhat was generally considered Manchuria's useless space, the\nCommunists started using that large space to surround the cities. If\nChiang sent an army from one city to reinforce anotiier, die\nCommunists would encircle the rescuing army. Chiang's forces were\nslowly broken into smaller and smaller units, isolated from one\nanother, their lines of supply and communication cut. The Nationalists\nstill had superior firepower, but if diey could not move, what good was\nit\n\nA kind of terror overcame the Nationalist soldiers. Commanders\ncomfortably remote from the front lines might laugh at Mao, but the\nsoldiers had fought the Communists in die mountains, and had come to\nfear their elusiveness. Now these soldiers sat in their cities and\nwatched as their fast-moving enemies, as fluid as water, poured in on\nthem from all sides. There seemed to be millions of them. The\n\nCommunists also encircled the soldiers\u2019 spirits, bombarding diem with\npropaganda to lower their morale and pressure them to desert.\n\nThe Nationalists began to surrender in their minds. Their\nencircled and isolated cities started collapsing even before being\ndirectly attacked; one after another fell in quick succession. In\nNovember of 1948, the Nationalists surrendered Manchuria to the\nCommunistsa humiliating blow to the technically superior Nationalist\narmy, and one that proved decisive in the war. By the following year\nthe Communists controlled all of China.\n\nInterpretation\n\nThe two board games that best approximate tile strategies of war\nare chess and the Asian game of go. In chess the board is small. In\ncomparison to go, the attack comes relatively quickly, forcing a\ndecisive batde. It rarely pays to withdraw, or to sacrifice your pieces,\nwhich must be concentrated at key areas. Go is much less formal. It is\nplayed on a large grid, with 361 intersectionsnearly six times as many\npositions as in chess. Black and white stones (one color for each side)\nare placed on the board's intersections, one at a time, wherever you\nlike. Once all your stones (52 for each side) are on the board, the\nobject is to isolate die stones of your opponent by encircling diem.\n\nA game of gocalled wei-chi in Chinacan last up to three hundred\nmoves. The strategy is more subtie and fluid than chess, developing\nslowly; the more complex the pattern your stones initially create on die\nboard, the harder it is for your opponent to understand your strategy.\nFighting to control a particular area is not worth the trouble: You have\nto think in larger terms, to be prepared to sacrifice an area in order\neventually to dominate the board. What you are after is not an\nentrenched position but mobility. With mobility you can isolate the\nopponent in small areas and men encircle them. The aim is not to kill\noff the opponent's pieces directiy, as in chess, but to induce a kind of\nparalysis and collapse. Chess is linear, position oriented, and\naggressive; go is nonlinear and fluid. Aggression is indi-\n\nThe sage neither seeks to follow the ways of the ancients nor\nestablishes any fixed standard for all times but examines the things of\nhis age and then prepares to deal with them. There was in Sung a man,\nwho tilled a field in which there stood the trunk of a tree. Once a hare,\nwhile running fast, rushed against the trunk, broke its neck, and died.\n\nThereupon the man cast his plough aside and watched that tree, hoping\nthat he would get another hare. Yet he never caught another hare and\nwas himself ridiculed by the people of Sung. Now supposing\nsomebody wanted to govern the people of the present age with the\npolicies of the early kings, he would be doing exactly the same thing\nas that man who watched the tree.\n\nHan-fei-tzu, Chinese philosopher, third century b.c.\n\nGeneral Rommel surpassed Patton as a creative intellect...\nRommel shunned military formalism. He made no fixed plans beyond\nthose intended for the initial clash; thereafter, he tailored his tactics to\nmeet specific situations as they arose. He was a lightning-fast\ndecisionmaker, physically maintaining a pace that matched his active\nmentality. In a forbidding sea of sand, he operated in a free\nenvironment. Once Rommel ruptured the British lines in Africa, he\nhad the whole northern part of the continent opened to him.\nComparatively free from the hamstringing authority of Berlin,\ndisregarding orders even from Hitler himself on occasion, Rommel\nimplemented one successful operation after another until he had most\nof North Africa under his control and Cairo trembling at his feet.\n\nTHE ART OF WINNING WARS,\n\nJames Mrazek, 1968\n\nrect until the end of the game, when the winner can surround the\nopponent's stones at an accelerated pace.\n\nChinese military strategists have been influenced by go for\ncenturies. Its proverbs have been applied to war time and again; Mao\nTse-tung was an addict of wei-chi, and its precepts were ingrained in\nhis strategies. A key wei-chi concept, for example, is to use the size of\nthe board to your advantage, spreading out in every direction so mat\nyour opponent cannot fadiom your movements in a simple linear way.\n\n\u201cEvery Chinese,\u201d Mao once wrote, \u201cshould consciously throw\nhimself into this war of a jigsaw pattern\u201d against the Nationalists.\nPlace your men in a jigsaw pattern in go, and your opponent loses\nhimself trying to figure out what you are up to. Either he wastes time\npursuing you or, like Chiang Kai-shek, he assumes you are\nincompetent and fails to protect himself. And if he concentrates on\nsingle areas, as Western strategy advises, he becomes a sitting duck for\nencirclement. In die wei-chi way of war, you encircle the enemy's\n\nbrain, using mind games, propaganda, and irritation tactics to confuse\nand dishearten. This was the strategy of the Communistsan apparent\nformlessness mat disoriented and terrified their enemy.\n\nWhere chess is linear and direct, the ancient game of go is closer\nto the kind of strategy that will prove relevant in a world where battles\nare fought indirectiy, in vast, loosely connected areas. Its strategies are\nabstract and multidimensional, inhabiting a plane beyond time and\nspace: die strategist's mind. In this fluid form of warfare, you value\nmovement over position. Your speed and mobility make it impossible\nto predict your moves; unable to understand you, your enemy can form\nno strategy to defeat you. Instead of fixing on particular spots, diis\nindirect form of warfare spreads out, just as you can use the large and\ndisconnected nature of die real world to your advantage. Be like a\nvapor. Do not give your opponents anything solid to attack; watch as\ndiey exhaust themselves pursuing you, trying to cope with your\nelusiveness. Only formlessness allows you to truly surprise your\nenemiesby die time they figure out where you are and what you are up\nto, it is too late.\n\nWhen you want to fight us, we don't let you and you can't find us.\nBut when\n\nwe want to fight you, we make sure that you can't get away and\nwe hit you\n\nsquarely . . . and wipe you out. . . . The enemy advances, we\nretreat; the enemy\n\ncamps, we harass; the enemy tires, we attack; the enemy retreats,\nwe pursue.\n\nMao Tse-tung, 1893-1976\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nThe human animal is distinguished by its constant creation of\nforms. Rarely expressing its emotions directiy, it gives them form\nthrough language, or dirough socially acceptable rituals. We cannot\ncommunicate our emotions widiout a form.\n\nThe forms that we create, however, change constantiyin fashion,\nin\n\nstyle, in all those human phenomena representing the mood of the\nmoment. We are constantly altering the forms we have inherited from\nprevious generations, and these changes are signs of life and vitality.\n\nIndeed, the tilings that don't change, the forms that rigidify, come to\nlook to us like death, and we destroy them. The young show this most\nclearly: Uncomfortable with the forms that society imposes upon them,\nhaving no set identity, they play with their own characters, trying on a\nvariety of masks and poses to express themselves. This is the vitality\nthat drives the motor of form, creating constant changes in style.\n\nThe powerful are often people who in their youth have shown\nimmense creativity in expressing something new through a new form.\nSociety grants them power because it hungers for and rewards this sort\nof newness. The problem comes later, when they often grow\nconservative and possessive. They no longer dream of creating new\nforms; their identities are set, their habits congeal, and their rigidity\nmakes them easy targets. Everyone knows their next move. Instead of\ndemanding respect they elicit boredom: Get off the stage! we say, let\nsomeone else, someone younger, entertain us. When locked in the past,\nthe powerful look comicalthey are overripe fruit, waiting to fall from\nthe tree.\n\nPower can only thrive if it is flexible in its forms. To be formless\nis not to be amorphous; everything has a formit is impossible to avoid.\nThe formlessness of power is more like that of water, or mercury,\ntaking the form of whatever is around it. Changing constantly, it is\nnever predictable. The powerful are constantly creating form, and their\npower comes from the rapidity with which they can change. Their\nformlessness is in the eye of the enemy who cannot see what they are\nup to and so has nothing solid to attack. This is the premier pose of\npower: ungraspable, as elusive and swift as the god Mercury, who\ncould take any form he pleased and used this ability to wreak havoc on\nMount Olympus.\n\nHuman creations evolve toward abstraction, toward being more\nmental and less material. This evolution is clear in art, which, in this\ncentury, made the great discovery of abstraction and conceptualism; it\ncan also be seen in politics, which over time have become less overtly\nviolent, more complicated, indirect and cerebral. Warfare and strategy\ntoo have followed this pattern. Strategy began in the manipulation of\narmies on land, positioning them in ordered formations; on land,\nstrategy is relatively two dimensional, and controlled by topography.\nBut all the great powers have eventually taken to the sea, for\n\ncommerce and colonization. And to protect their trading lanes they\nhave had to learn how to fight at sea. Maritime warfare requires\ntremendous creativity and abstract thinking, since the lines are\nconstantly shifting. Naval captains distinguish themselves by their\nability to adapt to the literal fluidity of the terrain and to confuse the\nenemy with an abstract, hard-to-anticipate form. They are operating in\na third dimension: the mind.\n\nBack on land, guerrilla warfare too demonstrates this evolution\ntoward abstraction. T. E. Lawrence was perhaps the first modern\nstrategist to de-\n\nCHAHACTKH\n\nTo carry out the instinctual inhibition demanded by the modern\nworld and to be able to cope with the energy stasis which results from\nthis inhibition, the ego has to undergo a change. The ego, i.e., that part\nof the person that is exposed to danger, becomes rigid, as we say, when\nit is continually subjected to the same or similar conflicts between\nneed and a fear-inducing outer world. It acquires in this process a\nchronic, automatically functioning mode of reaction, i., its\n\u201ccharacter. \u201d ft is as if the affective personality armored itself, as if the\nhard shell it develops were intended to deflect and weaken the blows\nof the outer world as-well as the clamoring of the inner needs. This\narmoring makes the person less sensitive to unpleasure, but also\nrestricts his libidinal and aggressive motility and thus reduces his\ncapacity for achievement and pleasure. We say the ego has become\nless flexible and more rigid, and that the ability to regulate the energy\neconomy depends on the extent of the armoring.\n\nWiihelm Reich, 1897-1957\n\nvelop the theory behind this kind of warfare, and to put it into\npractice. His ideas influenced Mao, who found in his writings an\nuncanny Western equivalent to wei-chi. Lawrence was working with\nArabs fighting for tiieir territory against the Turks. His idea was to\nmake the Arabs blend into die vast desert, never providing a target,\nnever collecting together in one place. As the Turks scrambled to fight\nthis vaporous army, diey spread themselves thin, wasting energy in\nmoving from place to place. They had the superior firepower but die\nArabs kept the initiative by playing cat and mouse, giving die Turks\nnothing to hold on to, destroying their morale. \u201cMost wars were wars\n\nof contact.... Ours should be a war of detachment,\u201d Lawrence wrote.\n\u201cWe were to contain the enemy by die silent tiireat of a vast unknown\ndesert, not disclosing ourselves till we attacked.\u201d\n\nThis is the ultimate form of strategy. The war of engagement has\nbecome far too dangerous and cosdy; indirection and elusiveness yield\nfar better results at a much lower cost. The main cost, in fact, is\nmentalthe dunking it takes to align your forces in scattered patterns,\nand to undermine the minds and psychology of your opponents. And\nnothing will infuriate and disorient them more tiian formlessness. In a\nworld where wars of detachment are the order of die day, formlessness\nis crucial.\n\nThe first psychological requirement of formlessness is to train\nyourself to take nothing personally. Never show any defensiveness.\nWhen you act defensive, you show your emotions, revealing a clear\nform. Your opponents will realize they have hit a nerve, an Achilles\u2019\nheel. And diey will hit it again and again. So train yourself to take\nnothing personally. Never let anyone get your back up. Be like a\nslippery ball tilat cannot be held: Let no one know what gets to you, or\nwhere your weaknesses he. Make your face a formless mask and you\nwill infuriate and disorient your scheming colleagues and opponents.\n\nOne man who used diis technique was Baron James Rothschild. A\nGerman Jew in Paris, in a culture decidedly unfriendly to foreigners,\nRothschild never took any attack on him personally or showed he had\nbeen hurt in any way. He furthermore adapted himself to the political\nclimate, whatever it wasthe stiffly formal Restoration monarchy of\nLouis XVIII, die bourgeois reign of Louis-Philippe, die democratic\nrevolution of 1848, tiie upstart Louis-Napoleon crowned emperor in\n1852. Rotiischild accepted them one and all, and blended in. He could\nafford to appear hypocritical or opportunistic because he was valued\nfor his money, not his politics; his money was die currency of power.\nWhile he adapted and thrived, outwardly never showing a form, all die\notiier great families tilat had begun die century immensely wealthy\nwere ruined in the period's complicated shifts and turns of fortune.\nAttaching tiiemselves to the past, they revealed their embrace of a\nform.\n\nThroughout history, the formless style of ruling has been most\nadeptiy practiced by die queen who reigns alone. A queen is in a\n\n\nradically different position from a king; because she is a woman, her\nsubjects and courtiers are likely to doubt her ability to rule, her\nstrengdi of character. If she favors\n\none side in some ideological struggle, she is said to be acting out\nof emotional attachment. Yet if she represses her emotions and plays\ndie authoritarian, in the male fashion, she arouses worse criticism still.\nEither by nature or by experience, then, queens tend to adopt a flexible\nstyle of governing that in die end often proves more powerful than the\nmore direct, male form.\n\nTwo female leaders exemplifying die formless style of rule are\nQueen Elizabeth of England and Empress Catherine the Great of\nRussia. In die violent wars between Catholics and Protestants,\nElizabeth steered a middle course. She avoided alliances that would\ncommit her to one side, and that over time would harm the country.\nShe managed to keep her country at peace until it was strong enough\nfor war. Her reign was one of the most glorious in history because of\nher incredible capacity to adapt and her flexible ideology.\n\nCaUierine die Great too evolved an improvisatory style of\ngoverning. After she deposed her husband, Emperor Peter II, taking\nsole control of Russia in 1762, no one thought she would survive. But\nshe had no preconceived ideas, no philosophy or theory to dictate her\npolicies. Although a foreigner (she came from Germany), she\nunderstood Russia's moods, and how it was changing over the years.\n\u201cOne must govern in such a way that one's people think they\nthemselves want to do what one commands them to do,\u201d she said, and\nto do this she had to be always a step ahead of their desires and to\nadapt to their resistance. By never forcing die issue, she reformed\nRussia in a strikingly short period of time.\n\nThis feminine, formless style of ruling may have emerged as a\nway of prospering under difficult circumstances, but it has proved\nimmensely seductive to those who have served under it. Being fluid, it\nis relatively easy for its subjects to obey, for they feel less coerced, less\nbent to their ruler's ideology. It also opens up options where an\nadherence to a doctrine closes them off. Without committing to one\nside, it allows the ruler to play one enemy off anodier. Rigid rulers\nmay seem strong, but with time their inflexibility wears on the nerves,\nand their subjects find ways to push them from the stage. Flexible,\n\nformless rulers will be much criticized, but they will endure, and\npeople will eventually come to identify witii them, since diey are as\ntiieir subjects arechanging widi die wind, open to circumstance.\n\nDespite upsets and delays, die permeable style of power generally\ntriumphs in the end, just as Athens eventually won victory over Sparta\ntiirough its money and its culture. When you find yourself in conflict\nwith someone stronger and more rigid, allow diem a momentary\nvictory. Seem to bow to tiieir superiority. Then, by being formless and\nadaptable, slowly insinuate yourself into their soul. This way you will\ncatch them off guard, for rigid people are always ready to ward off\ndirect blows but are helpless against the subde and insinuating. To\nsucceed at such a strategy you must play die chameleonconform on die\nsurface, while breaking down your enemy from the inside.\n\nFor centuries the Japanese would accept foreigners graciously,\nand appeared susceptible to foreign cultures and influences. Joao\nRodriguez, a Portuguese priest who arrived in Japan in 1577 and lived\nthere for many years, wrote, \u201cI am flabbergasted by the Japanese\nwillingness to try and accept everything Portuguese.\u201d He saw Japanese\nin die streets wearing Portuguese clothing, with rosary beads at their\nnecks and crosses at their hips. This might seem like a weak, mutable\nculture, but Japan's adaptability actually protected the country from\nhaving an alien culture imposed by military invasion. It seduced the\nPortuguese and other Westerners into believing the Japanese were\nyielding to a superior culture when actually the foreign culture's ways\nwere merely a fashion to be donned and doffed. Under the surface,\nJapanese culture thrived. Had the Japanese been rigid about foreign\ninfluences and tried to fight them off, they might have suffered the\ninjuries that the West inflicted on China. That is the power of\nformlessnessit gives the aggressor nothing to react against, nothing to\nhit.\n\nIn evolution, largeness is often the first step toward extinction.\nWhat is immense and bloated has no mobility, but must constantly\nfeed itself. The unintelligent are often seduced into believing that size\nconnotes power, die bigger the better.\n\nIn 483 B.C., King Xerxes of Persia invaded Greece, believing he\ncould conquer the country in one easy campaign. After all, he had the\nlargest army ever assembled for one invasionthe historian Herodotus\n\nestimated it at over more than five million. The Persians planned to\nbuild a bridge across the Hellespont to overrun Greece from the land,\nwhile tiieir equally immense navy would pin the Greek ships in harbor,\npreventing their forces from escaping to sea. The plan seemed sure, yet\nas Xerxes prepared the invasion, his adviser Artabanus warmed his\nmaster of grave misgivings: \u201cThe two mightiest powers in the world\nare against you,\u201d he said. Xerxes laughedwhat powers could match his\ngigantic army \u201cI will tell you what they are,\u201d answered Artabanus.\n\u201cThe land and the sea.\u201d There were no safe harbors large enough to\nreceive Xerxes' fleet. And die more land die Persians conquered, and\ndie longer their supply lines stretched, the more ruinous the cost of\nfeeding tiiis immense army would prove.\n\nThinking his adviser a coward, Xerxes proceeded with the\ninvasion. Yet as Artabanus predicted, bad weadier at sea decimated the\nPersian fleet, which was too large to take shelter in any harbor. On\nland, meanwhile, the Persian army destroyed everything in its path,\nwhich only made it impossible to feed, since the destruction included\ncrops and stores of food. It was also an easy and slow-moving target.\nThe Greeks practiced all kinds of deceptive maneuvers to disorient the\nPersians. Xerxes' eventual defeat at the hands of die Greek allies was\nan immense disaster. The story is emblematic of all Uiose who\nsacrifice mobility for size: The flexible and fleet of foot will almost\nalways win, for they have more strategic options. The more gigantic\nthe enemy, the easier it is to induce collapse.\n\nThe need for formlessness becomes greater the older we get, as\nwe grow more likely to become set in our ways and assume too rigid a\nform.\n\nWe become predictable, always the first sign of decrepitude. And\npredictability makes us appear comical. Although ridicule and disdain\nmight seem mild forms of attack, they are actually potent weapons,\nand will eventually erode a foundation of power. An enemy who does\nnot respect you will grow bold, and boldness makes even the smallest\nanimal dangerous.\n\nThe late-eighteenth-century court of France, as exemplified by\nMarie-Antoinette, had become so hopelessly tied to a rigid formality\nthat the average Frenchman thought it a silly relic. This depreciation of\na centuries-old institution was the first sign of a terminal disease, for it\n\n\nrepresented a symbolic loosening of the people's ties to monarchy. As\nthe situation worsened, Marie-Antoinette and King Louis XVI grew\nonly more rigid in their adherence to the pastand quickened their path\nto the guillotine. King Charles I of England reacted similarly to the\ntide of democratic change brewing in England in the 1630s: He\ndisbanded Parliament, and his court rituals grew increasingly formal\nand distant. He wanted to return to an older style of ruling, with\nadherence to all kinds of petty protocol. His rigidity only heightened\nthe desire for change. Soon, of course, he was swept up in a\ndevastating civil war, and eventually he lost his head to the\nexecutioner's axe.\n\nAs you get older, you must rely even less on the past. Be vigilant\nlest the form your character has taken makes you seem a relic. It is not\na matter of mimicking the fashions of youththat is equally worthy of\nlaughter. Rather your mind must constantly adapt to each\ncircumstance, even the inevitable change that the time has come to\nmove over and let those of younger age prepare for their ascendancy.\nRigidity will only make you look uncannily like a cadaver.\n\nNever forget, though, that formlessness is a strategic pose. It\ngives you room to create tactical surprises; as your enemies struggle to\nguess your next move, they reveal their own strategy, putting them at a\ndecided disadvantage. It keeps the initiative on your side, putting your\nenemies in the position of never acting, constantly reacting. It foils\ntheir spying and intelligence. Remember: Formlessness is a tool. Never\nconfuse it with a go-with-the-flow style, or with a religious resignation\nto the twists of fortune. You use formlessness, not because it creates\ninner harmony and peace, but because it will increase your power.\n\nFinally, learning to adapt to each new circumstance means seeing\nevents through your own eyes, and often ignoring the advice that\npeople constantly peddle your way. It means that ultimately you must\nthrow out the laws that others preach, and the books they write to tell\nyou what to do, and the sage advice of the elder. \u201cThe laws that govern\ncircumstances are abolished by new circumstances,\u201d Napoleon wrote,\nwhich means diat it is up to you to gauge each new situation. Rely too\nmuch on other people's ideas and you end up taking a form not of your\nown making. Too much respect for other people's wisdom will make\nyou depreciate your own. Be brutal with the past, especially your own,\n\nand have no respect for the philosophies that are foisted on you from\noutside.\n\nImage: Mercury.

So they turned to the sea, establishing colonies\nin Asia Minor, Sicily, the Italian peninsula, even Africa. The city-state\nof Sparta, however, was landlocked and surrounded by mountains.\nLacking access to the Mediterranean, the Spartans never became a\n\nseafaring people; instead they turned on the cities around diem, and, in\na series of brutal, violent conflicts lasting more than a hundred years,\nmanaged to conquer an immense area diat would provide enough land\nfor dieir citizens. This solution to dieir problem, however, brought a\nnew, more formidable one: How could diey maintain and police dieir\nconquered territories The subordinate peoples diey ruled now\noutnumbered diem ten to one. Surely Uiis horde would take a horrible\nrevenge on diem.\n\nSparta's solution was to create a society dedicated to die art of\nwar. Spartans would be tougher, stronger, and fiercer dian dieir\nneighbors. This was die only way diey could ensure dieir stability and\nsurvival.\n\nWhen a Spartan boy reached the age of seven, he was taken from\nhis mother and placed in a military club where he was trained to fight\nand underwent the strictest discipline. The boys slept on beds of reeds;\ndiey were allotted only one outer garment to wear for an entire year.\nThey studied none of die arts; indeed, the Spartans banned music, and\npermitted only slaves to practice die crafts diat were necessary to\nsustain diem. The only skills die Spartans taught were diose of\nwarfare. Children seen as weaklings were left to die in a cavern in die\nmountains. No system of money or trading was allowed in Sparta;\nacquired wealtii, diey believed, would sow selfishness and dissension,\nweakening dieir warrior discipline. The only way a Spartan could earn\na living was tiirough agriculture, mosdy on state-owned lands, which\nslaves, called helots, would work for him.\n\nThe Spartans\u2019 single-mindedness allowed tiiem to forge die most\npowerful infantry in the world. They marched in perfect order and\nfought widi incomparable bravery. Their tight-knit phalanxes could\nvanquish an army ten times dieir size, as diey proved in defeating die\nPersians at Thermopylae. A Spartan column on die march would strike\nterror in die enemy; it seemed to have no weaknesses. Yet although die\nSpartans proved tiiem-selves mighty warriors, tiiey had no interest in\ncreating an empire. They only wanted to keep what diey had already\nconquered and to defend it against invaders. Decades would pass\nwitiiout a single change in the system diat had succeeded so well in\npreserving Sparta's status quo.\n\nAt die same time tiiat die Spartans were evolving dieir warlike\nculture, anotiier city-state was rising to equal prominence: Atiiens.\nUnlike Sparta, Adiens had taken to die sea, not so much to create\ncolonies as for purposes of trade. The Adienians became great\nmerchants; dieir currency, me famous \u201cowl coins,\u201d spread mroughout\ndie Mediterranean. Unlike die rigid Spartans, die Adienians responded\nto every problem with consummate creativity, adapting to die occasion\nand creating new social forms and new\n\narts at an incredible pace. Their society was in constant flux. And\nas their power grew, they came to pose a threat to the defense-minded\nSpartans.\n\nIn 431 B.C., the war that had been brewing between Athens and\nSparta for so long finally erupted. It lasted twenty-seven years, but\nafter many twists of fortune, the Spartan war machine finally emerged\nvictorious. The Spartans now commanded an empire, and this time\nuiey could not stay in their shell. If they gave up what they had gained,\nthe beaten Athenians would regroup and rise against them, and the\nlong war would have been fought for naught.\n\nAfter the war, Athenian money poured into Sparta. The Spartans\nhad been trained in warfare, not politics or economics; because they\nwere so unaccustomed to it, wealth and its accompanying ways of life\nseduced and overwhelmed them. Spartan governors were sent to rule\nwhat had been Athenian lands; far from home, they succumbed to the\nworst forms of corruption. Sparta had defeated Athens, but the fluid\nAthenian way of life was slowly breaking down its discipline and\nloosening its rigid order. And Athens, meanwhile, was adapting to\nlosing its empire, managing to thrive as a cultural and economic center.\n\nConfused by a change in its status quo, Sparta grew weaker and\nweaker. Some thirty years after defeating Athens, it lost an important\nbatde with the city-state of Thebes. Almost overnight, this once mighty\nnation collapsed, never to recover.\n\nInterpretation\n\nIn the evolution of species, protective armor has almost always\nspelled disaster. Although there are a few exceptions, the shell most\noften becomes a dead end for the animal encased in it; it slows the\ncreature down, making it hard for it to forage for food and making it a\ntarget for fast-moving predators. Animals that take to the sea or sky,\n\nand that move swiftly and unpredictably, are infinitely more powerful\nand secure.\n\nIn facing a serious problemcontrolling superior numbersSparta\nreacted like an animal that develops a shell to protect itself from the\nenvironment. But like a turtle, the Spartans sacrificed mobility for\nsafety. They managed to preserve stability for three hundred years, but\nat what cost They had no culture beyond warfare, no arts to relieve the\ntension, a constant anxiety about the status quo. While their neighbors\ntook to the sea, learning to adapt to a world of constant motion, the\nSpartans entombed themselves in their own system. Victory would\nmean new lands to govern, which tfiey did not want; defeat would\nmean the end of their military machine, which they did not want,\neither. Only stasis allowed them to survive. But nothing in the world\ncan remain stable forever, and the shell or system you evolve for your\nprotection will someday prove your undoing.\n\nIn the case of Sparta, it was not the armies of Athens that defeated\nit, but the Athenian money. Money flows everywhere it has the\nopportunity to go; it cannot be controlled, or made to fit a prescribed\npattern. It is inherently chaotic. And in the long run, money made\nAthens the conqueror,\n\nbarbarously cut off his long pendent ears. Jowler expected\nnothing less than to give up the ghost. As he advanced in years, he\nperceived that he gained more than he had lost by his mutilation; for,\nbeing naturally inclined to fight with others, he would often have\nreturned home with this part disfigured in a hundred places. A\nquarrelsome dog always has his ears lacerated. The less we leave\nothers to lay hold of the better. When one has but one point to defend,\nit should be protected for fear of accident. Take for example Master\nJowler, who, being armed with a spiked collar, and having about as\nmuch ear as a bird, a wolf would be puzzled to know where to tackle\nhim.\n\nFABLES,\n\nJean de La Fontaine, 1621-1695\n\nOne seductive and ultimately always fatal path has been the\ndevelopment of protective armor. An organism can protect itself by\nconcealment, by swiftness in flight, by effective counterattack, by\nuniting for attack and defense with other individuals of its species and\n\n\nalso by encasing itself within bony plates and spines.... Almost always\nthe experiment of armor failed. Creatures adopting it tended to become\nunwieldy. They had to move relatively slowly. Hence they were forced\nto live mainly on vegetable food; and thus in general they were at a\ndisadvantage as compared with foes living on more rapidly \u201cprofitable\n\u201d animal food: The repeated failure of protective armor shows that,\neven at a somewhat low evolutionary level, mind triumphed over mere\nmatter. It is this sort of triumph which has been supremely exemplified\nin Man.\n\nSCIENTIFIC THEORY AND RELIGION,\n\nE. W. Barnes, 1933\n\nby infiltrating the Spartan system and corroding its protective\narmor. In the battle between the two systems, Adiens was fluid and\ncreative enough to take new forms, while Sparta could grow only more\nrigid until it cracked.\n\nThis is the way the world works, whether for animals, cultures, or\nindividuals. In the face of the world's harshness and danger, organisms\nof any kind develop protectiona coat of armor, a rigid system, a\ncomforting ritual. For the short term it may work, but for the long term\nit spells disaster. People weighed down by a system and inflexible\nways of doing things cannot move fast, cannot sense or adapt to\nchange. They lumber around more and more slowly until they go the\nway of the brontosaurus. Learn to move fast and adapt or you will be\neaten.\n\nThe best way to avoid diis fate is to assume formlessness. No\npredator alive can attack what it cannot see.\n\nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW\n\nWhen World War II ended and the Japanese, who had invaded\nChina in 1937, had finally been thrown out, the Chinese Nationalists,\nlead by Chiang Kai-shek, decided the time had come to annihilate the\nChinese Communists, their hated rivals, once and for all. They had\nalmost succeeded in 1935, forcing the Communists into the Long\nMarch, the grueling retreat mat had gready diminished their numbers.\nAlthough the Communists had recovered somewhat during the war\nagainst Japan, it would not be difficult to defeat them now. They\ncontrolled only isolated areas in the countryside, had unsophisticated\nweaponry, lacked any military experience or training beyond mountain\n\nfighting, and controlled no important parts of China, except areas of\nManchuria, which they had managed to take after die Japanese retreat.\nChiang decided to commit his best forces in Manchuria. He would take\nover its major cities and from those bases would spread through this\nnorthern industrial region, sweeping the Communists away. Once\nManchuria had fallen the Communists would collapse.\n\nIn 1945 and '46 the plan worked perfectly: The Nationalists easily\ntook the major Manchurian cities. Puzzlingly, though, in the face of\nthis critical campaign, the Communist strategy made no sense. When\nthe Nationalists began their push, the Communists dispersed to\nManchuria's most out-of-the-way corners. Their small units harassed\nthe Nationalist armies, ambushing them here, retreating unexpectedly\ntiiere, but tiiese dispersed units never linked up, making them hard to\nattack. They would seize a town only to give it up a few weeks later.\nForming neither rear guards nor vanguards, they moved like mercury,\nnever staying in one place, elusive and formless.\n\nThe Nationalists ascribed this to two things: cowardice in die face\nof superior forces and inexperience in strategy. Mao Tse-tung, die\nCommunist leader, was more a poet and philosopher than a general,\nwhereas Chiang had studied warfare in die West and was a follower of\ndie German military writer Carl von Clausewitz, among others.\n\nYet a pattern did eventually emerge in Mao's attacks. After the\nNationalists had taken the cities, leaving the Communists to occupy\nwhat was generally considered Manchuria's useless space, the\nCommunists started using that large space to surround the cities. If\nChiang sent an army from one city to reinforce anotiier, die\nCommunists would encircle the rescuing army. Chiang's forces were\nslowly broken into smaller and smaller units, isolated from one\nanother, their lines of supply and communication cut. The Nationalists\nstill had superior firepower, but if diey could not move, what good was\nit\n\nA kind of terror overcame the Nationalist soldiers. Commanders\ncomfortably remote from the front lines might laugh at Mao, but the\nsoldiers had fought the Communists in die mountains, and had come to\nfear their elusiveness. Now these soldiers sat in their cities and\nwatched as their fast-moving enemies, as fluid as water, poured in on\nthem from all sides. There seemed to be millions of them. The\n\nCommunists also encircled the soldiers\u2019 spirits, bombarding diem with\npropaganda to lower their morale and pressure them to desert.\n\nThe Nationalists began to surrender in their minds. Their\nencircled and isolated cities started collapsing even before being\ndirectly attacked; one after another fell in quick succession. In\nNovember of 1948, the Nationalists surrendered Manchuria to the\nCommunistsa humiliating blow to the technically superior Nationalist\narmy, and one that proved decisive in the war. By the following year\nthe Communists controlled all of China.\n\nInterpretation\n\nThe two board games that best approximate tile strategies of war\nare chess and the Asian game of go. In chess the board is small. In\ncomparison to go, the attack comes relatively quickly, forcing a\ndecisive batde. It rarely pays to withdraw, or to sacrifice your pieces,\nwhich must be concentrated at key areas. Go is much less formal. It is\nplayed on a large grid, with 361 intersectionsnearly six times as many\npositions as in chess. Black and white stones (one color for each side)\nare placed on the board's intersections, one at a time, wherever you\nlike. Once all your stones (52 for each side) are on the board, the\nobject is to isolate die stones of your opponent by encircling diem.\n\nA game of gocalled wei-chi in Chinacan last up to three hundred\nmoves. The strategy is more subtie and fluid than chess, developing\nslowly; the more complex the pattern your stones initially create on die\nboard, the harder it is for your opponent to understand your strategy.\nFighting to control a particular area is not worth the trouble: You have\nto think in larger terms, to be prepared to sacrifice an area in order\neventually to dominate the board. What you are after is not an\nentrenched position but mobility. With mobility you can isolate the\nopponent in small areas and men encircle them. The aim is not to kill\noff the opponent's pieces directiy, as in chess, but to induce a kind of\nparalysis and collapse. Chess is linear, position oriented, and\naggressive; go is nonlinear and fluid. Aggression is indi-\n\nThe sage neither seeks to follow the ways of the ancients nor\nestablishes any fixed standard for all times but examines the things of\nhis age and then prepares to deal with them. There was in Sung a man,\nwho tilled a field in which there stood the trunk of a tree. Once a hare,\nwhile running fast, rushed against the trunk, broke its neck, and died.\n\nThereupon the man cast his plough aside and watched that tree, hoping\nthat he would get another hare. Yet he never caught another hare and\nwas himself ridiculed by the people of Sung. Now supposing\nsomebody wanted to govern the people of the present age with the\npolicies of the early kings, he would be doing exactly the same thing\nas that man who watched the tree.\n\nHan-fei-tzu, Chinese philosopher, third century b.c.\n\nGeneral Rommel surpassed Patton as a creative intellect...\nRommel shunned military formalism. He made no fixed plans beyond\nthose intended for the initial clash; thereafter, he tailored his tactics to\nmeet specific situations as they arose. He was a lightning-fast\ndecisionmaker, physically maintaining a pace that matched his active\nmentality. In a forbidding sea of sand, he operated in a free\nenvironment. Once Rommel ruptured the British lines in Africa, he\nhad the whole northern part of the continent opened to him.\nComparatively free from the hamstringing authority of Berlin,\ndisregarding orders even from Hitler himself on occasion, Rommel\nimplemented one successful operation after another until he had most\nof North Africa under his control and Cairo trembling at his feet.\n\nTHE ART OF WINNING WARS,\n\nJames Mrazek, 1968\n\nrect until the end of the game, when the winner can surround the\nopponent's stones at an accelerated pace.\n\nChinese military strategists have been influenced by go for\ncenturies. Its proverbs have been applied to war time and again; Mao\nTse-tung was an addict of wei-chi, and its precepts were ingrained in\nhis strategies. A key wei-chi concept, for example, is to use the size of\nthe board to your advantage, spreading out in every direction so mat\nyour opponent cannot fadiom your movements in a simple linear way.\n\n\u201cEvery Chinese,\u201d Mao once wrote, \u201cshould consciously throw\nhimself into this war of a jigsaw pattern\u201d against the Nationalists.\nPlace your men in a jigsaw pattern in go, and your opponent loses\nhimself trying to figure out what you are up to. Either he wastes time\npursuing you or, like Chiang Kai-shek, he assumes you are\nincompetent and fails to protect himself. And if he concentrates on\nsingle areas, as Western strategy advises, he becomes a sitting duck for\nencirclement. In die wei-chi way of war, you encircle the enemy's\n\nbrain, using mind games, propaganda, and irritation tactics to confuse\nand dishearten. This was the strategy of the Communistsan apparent\nformlessness mat disoriented and terrified their enemy.\n\nWhere chess is linear and direct, the ancient game of go is closer\nto the kind of strategy that will prove relevant in a world where battles\nare fought indirectiy, in vast, loosely connected areas. Its strategies are\nabstract and multidimensional, inhabiting a plane beyond time and\nspace: die strategist's mind. In this fluid form of warfare, you value\nmovement over position. Your speed and mobility make it impossible\nto predict your moves; unable to understand you, your enemy can form\nno strategy to defeat you. Instead of fixing on particular spots, diis\nindirect form of warfare spreads out, just as you can use the large and\ndisconnected nature of die real world to your advantage. Be like a\nvapor. Do not give your opponents anything solid to attack; watch as\ndiey exhaust themselves pursuing you, trying to cope with your\nelusiveness. Only formlessness allows you to truly surprise your\nenemiesby die time they figure out where you are and what you are up\nto, it is too late.\n\nWhen you want to fight us, we don't let you and you can't find us.\nBut when\n\nwe want to fight you, we make sure that you can't get away and\nwe hit you\n\nsquarely . . . and wipe you out. . . . The enemy advances, we\nretreat; the enemy\n\ncamps, we harass; the enemy tires, we attack; the enemy retreats,\nwe pursue.\n\nMao Tse-tung, 1893-1976\n\nKEYS TO POWER\n\nThe human animal is distinguished by its constant creation of\nforms. Rarely expressing its emotions directiy, it gives them form\nthrough language, or dirough socially acceptable rituals. We cannot\ncommunicate our emotions widiout a form.\n\nThe forms that we create, however, change constantiyin fashion,\nin\n\nstyle, in all those human phenomena representing the mood of the\nmoment. We are constantly altering the forms we have inherited from\nprevious generations, and these changes are signs of life and vitality.\n\nIndeed, the tilings that don't change, the forms that rigidify, come to\nlook to us like death, and we destroy them. The young show this most\nclearly: Uncomfortable with the forms that society imposes upon them,\nhaving no set identity, they play with their own characters, trying on a\nvariety of masks and poses to express themselves. This is the vitality\nthat drives the motor of form, creating constant changes in style.\n\nThe powerful are often people who in their youth have shown\nimmense creativity in expressing something new through a new form.\nSociety grants them power because it hungers for and rewards this sort\nof newness. The problem comes later, when they often grow\nconservative and possessive. They no longer dream of creating new\nforms; their identities are set, their habits congeal, and their rigidity\nmakes them easy targets. Everyone knows their next move. Instead of\ndemanding respect they elicit boredom: Get off the stage! we say, let\nsomeone else, someone younger, entertain us. When locked in the past,\nthe powerful look comicalthey are overripe fruit, waiting to fall from\nthe tree.\n\nPower can only thrive if it is flexible in its forms. To be formless\nis not to be amorphous; everything has a formit is impossible to avoid.\nThe formlessness of power is more like that of water, or mercury,\ntaking the form of whatever is around it. Changing constantly, it is\nnever predictable. The powerful are constantly creating form, and their\npower comes from the rapidity with which they can change. Their\nformlessness is in the eye of the enemy who cannot see what they are\nup to and so has nothing solid to attack. This is the premier pose of\npower: ungraspable, as elusive and swift as the god Mercury, who\ncould take any form he pleased and used this ability to wreak havoc on\nMount Olympus.\n\nHuman creations evolve toward abstraction, toward being more\nmental and less material. This evolution is clear in art, which, in this\ncentury, made the great discovery of abstraction and conceptualism; it\ncan also be seen in politics, which over time have become less overtly\nviolent, more complicated, indirect and cerebral. Warfare and strategy\ntoo have followed this pattern. Strategy began in the manipulation of\narmies on land, positioning them in ordered formations; on land,\nstrategy is relatively two dimensional, and controlled by topography.\nBut all the great powers have eventually taken to the sea, for\n\ncommerce and colonization. And to protect their trading lanes they\nhave had to learn how to fight at sea. Maritime warfare requires\ntremendous creativity and abstract thinking, since the lines are\nconstantly shifting. Naval captains distinguish themselves by their\nability to adapt to the literal fluidity of the terrain and to confuse the\nenemy with an abstract, hard-to-anticipate form. They are operating in\na third dimension: the mind.\n\nBack on land, guerrilla warfare too demonstrates this evolution\ntoward abstraction. T. E. Lawrence was perhaps the first modern\nstrategist to de-\n\nCHAHACTKH\n\nTo carry out the instinctual inhibition demanded by the modern\nworld and to be able to cope with the energy stasis which results from\nthis inhibition, the ego has to undergo a change. The ego, i.e., that part\nof the person that is exposed to danger, becomes rigid, as we say, when\nit is continually subjected to the same or similar conflicts between\nneed and a fear-inducing outer world. It acquires in this process a\nchronic, automatically functioning mode of reaction, i., its\n\u201ccharacter. \u201d ft is as if the affective personality armored itself, as if the\nhard shell it develops were intended to deflect and weaken the blows\nof the outer world as-well as the clamoring of the inner needs. This\narmoring makes the person less sensitive to unpleasure, but also\nrestricts his libidinal and aggressive motility and thus reduces his\ncapacity for achievement and pleasure. We say the ego has become\nless flexible and more rigid, and that the ability to regulate the energy\neconomy depends on the extent of the armoring.\n\nWiihelm Reich, 1897-1957\n\nvelop the theory behind this kind of warfare, and to put it into\npractice. His ideas influenced Mao, who found in his writings an\nuncanny Western equivalent to wei-chi. Lawrence was working with\nArabs fighting for tiieir territory against the Turks. His idea was to\nmake the Arabs blend into die vast desert, never providing a target,\nnever collecting together in one place. As the Turks scrambled to fight\nthis vaporous army, diey spread themselves thin, wasting energy in\nmoving from place to place. They had the superior firepower but die\nArabs kept the initiative by playing cat and mouse, giving die Turks\nnothing to hold on to, destroying their morale. \u201cMost wars were wars\n\nof contact.... Ours should be a war of detachment,\u201d Lawrence wrote.\n\u201cWe were to contain the enemy by die silent tiireat of a vast unknown\ndesert, not disclosing ourselves till we attacked.\u201d\n\nThis is the ultimate form of strategy. The war of engagement has\nbecome far too dangerous and cosdy; indirection and elusiveness yield\nfar better results at a much lower cost. The main cost, in fact, is\nmentalthe dunking it takes to align your forces in scattered patterns,\nand to undermine the minds and psychology of your opponents. And\nnothing will infuriate and disorient them more tiian formlessness. In a\nworld where wars of detachment are the order of die day, formlessness\nis crucial.\n\nThe first psychological requirement of formlessness is to train\nyourself to take nothing personally. Never show any defensiveness.\nWhen you act defensive, you show your emotions, revealing a clear\nform. Your opponents will realize they have hit a nerve, an Achilles\u2019\nheel. And diey will hit it again and again. So train yourself to take\nnothing personally. Never let anyone get your back up. Be like a\nslippery ball tilat cannot be held: Let no one know what gets to you, or\nwhere your weaknesses he. Make your face a formless mask and you\nwill infuriate and disorient your scheming colleagues and opponents.\n\nOne man who used diis technique was Baron James Rothschild. A\nGerman Jew in Paris, in a culture decidedly unfriendly to foreigners,\nRothschild never took any attack on him personally or showed he had\nbeen hurt in any way. He furthermore adapted himself to the political\nclimate, whatever it wasthe stiffly formal Restoration monarchy of\nLouis XVIII, die bourgeois reign of Louis-Philippe, die democratic\nrevolution of 1848, tiie upstart Louis-Napoleon crowned emperor in\n1852. Rotiischild accepted them one and all, and blended in. He could\nafford to appear hypocritical or opportunistic because he was valued\nfor his money, not his politics; his money was die currency of power.\nWhile he adapted and thrived, outwardly never showing a form, all die\notiier great families tilat had begun die century immensely wealthy\nwere ruined in the period's complicated shifts and turns of fortune.\nAttaching tiiemselves to the past, they revealed their embrace of a\nform.\n\nThroughout history, the formless style of ruling has been most\nadeptiy practiced by die queen who reigns alone. A queen is in a\n\n\nradically different position from a king; because she is a woman, her\nsubjects and courtiers are likely to doubt her ability to rule, her\nstrengdi of character. If she favors\n\none side in some ideological struggle, she is said to be acting out\nof emotional attachment. Yet if she represses her emotions and plays\ndie authoritarian, in the male fashion, she arouses worse criticism still.\nEither by nature or by experience, then, queens tend to adopt a flexible\nstyle of governing that in die end often proves more powerful than the\nmore direct, male form.\n\nTwo female leaders exemplifying die formless style of rule are\nQueen Elizabeth of England and Empress Catherine the Great of\nRussia. In die violent wars between Catholics and Protestants,\nElizabeth steered a middle course. She avoided alliances that would\ncommit her to one side, and that over time would harm the country.\nShe managed to keep her country at peace until it was strong enough\nfor war. Her reign was one of the most glorious in history because of\nher incredible capacity to adapt and her flexible ideology.\n\nCaUierine die Great too evolved an improvisatory style of\ngoverning. After she deposed her husband, Emperor Peter II, taking\nsole control of Russia in 1762, no one thought she would survive. But\nshe had no preconceived ideas, no philosophy or theory to dictate her\npolicies. Although a foreigner (she came from Germany), she\nunderstood Russia's moods, and how it was changing over the years.\n\u201cOne must govern in such a way that one's people think they\nthemselves want to do what one commands them to do,\u201d she said, and\nto do this she had to be always a step ahead of their desires and to\nadapt to their resistance. By never forcing die issue, she reformed\nRussia in a strikingly short period of time.\n\nThis feminine, formless style of ruling may have emerged as a\nway of prospering under difficult circumstances, but it has proved\nimmensely seductive to those who have served under it. Being fluid, it\nis relatively easy for its subjects to obey, for they feel less coerced, less\nbent to their ruler's ideology. It also opens up options where an\nadherence to a doctrine closes them off. Without committing to one\nside, it allows the ruler to play one enemy off anodier. Rigid rulers\nmay seem strong, but with time their inflexibility wears on the nerves,\nand their subjects find ways to push them from the stage. Flexible,\n\nformless rulers will be much criticized, but they will endure, and\npeople will eventually come to identify witii them, since diey are as\ntiieir subjects arechanging widi die wind, open to circumstance.\n\nDespite upsets and delays, die permeable style of power generally\ntriumphs in the end, just as Athens eventually won victory over Sparta\ntiirough its money and its culture. When you find yourself in conflict\nwith someone stronger and more rigid, allow diem a momentary\nvictory. Seem to bow to tiieir superiority. Then, by being formless and\nadaptable, slowly insinuate yourself into their soul. This way you will\ncatch them off guard, for rigid people are always ready to ward off\ndirect blows but are helpless against the subde and insinuating. To\nsucceed at such a strategy you must play die chameleonconform on die\nsurface, while breaking down your enemy from the inside.\n\nFor centuries the Japanese would accept foreigners graciously,\nand appeared susceptible to foreign cultures and influences. Joao\nRodriguez, a Portuguese priest who arrived in Japan in 1577 and lived\nthere for many years, wrote, \u201cI am flabbergasted by the Japanese\nwillingness to try and accept everything Portuguese.\u201d He saw Japanese\nin die streets wearing Portuguese clothing, with rosary beads at their\nnecks and crosses at their hips. This might seem like a weak, mutable\nculture, but Japan's adaptability actually protected the country from\nhaving an alien culture imposed by military invasion. It seduced the\nPortuguese and other Westerners into believing the Japanese were\nyielding to a superior culture when actually the foreign culture's ways\nwere merely a fashion to be donned and doffed. Under the surface,\nJapanese culture thrived. Had the Japanese been rigid about foreign\ninfluences and tried to fight them off, they might have suffered the\ninjuries that the West inflicted on China. That is the power of\nformlessnessit gives the aggressor nothing to react against, nothing to\nhit.\n\nIn evolution, largeness is often the first step toward extinction.\nWhat is immense and bloated has no mobility, but must constantly\nfeed itself. The unintelligent are often seduced into believing that size\nconnotes power, die bigger the better.\n\nIn 483 B.C., King Xerxes of Persia invaded Greece, believing he\ncould conquer the country in one easy campaign. After all, he had the\nlargest army ever assembled for one invasionthe historian Herodotus\n\nestimated it at over more than five million. The Persians planned to\nbuild a bridge across the Hellespont to overrun Greece from the land,\nwhile tiieir equally immense navy would pin the Greek ships in harbor,\npreventing their forces from escaping to sea. The plan seemed sure, yet\nas Xerxes prepared the invasion, his adviser Artabanus warmed his\nmaster of grave misgivings: \u201cThe two mightiest powers in the world\nare against you,\u201d he said. Xerxes laughedwhat powers could match his\ngigantic army \u201cI will tell you what they are,\u201d answered Artabanus.\n\u201cThe land and the sea.\u201d There were no safe harbors large enough to\nreceive Xerxes' fleet. And die more land die Persians conquered, and\ndie longer their supply lines stretched, the more ruinous the cost of\nfeeding tiiis immense army would prove.\n\nThinking his adviser a coward, Xerxes proceeded with the\ninvasion. Yet as Artabanus predicted, bad weadier at sea decimated the\nPersian fleet, which was too large to take shelter in any harbor. On\nland, meanwhile, the Persian army destroyed everything in its path,\nwhich only made it impossible to feed, since the destruction included\ncrops and stores of food. It was also an easy and slow-moving target.\nThe Greeks practiced all kinds of deceptive maneuvers to disorient the\nPersians. Xerxes' eventual defeat at the hands of die Greek allies was\nan immense disaster. The story is emblematic of all Uiose who\nsacrifice mobility for size: The flexible and fleet of foot will almost\nalways win, for they have more strategic options. The more gigantic\nthe enemy, the easier it is to induce collapse.\n\nThe need for formlessness becomes greater the older we get, as\nwe grow more likely to become set in our ways and assume too rigid a\nform.\n\nWe become predictable, always the first sign of decrepitude. And\npredictability makes us appear comical. Although ridicule and disdain\nmight seem mild forms of attack, they are actually potent weapons,\nand will eventually erode a foundation of power. An enemy who does\nnot respect you will grow bold, and boldness makes even the smallest\nanimal dangerous.\n\nThe late-eighteenth-century court of France, as exemplified by\nMarie-Antoinette, had become so hopelessly tied to a rigid formality\nthat the average Frenchman thought it a silly relic. This depreciation of\na centuries-old institution was the first sign of a terminal disease, for it\n\n\nrepresented a symbolic loosening of the people's ties to monarchy. As\nthe situation worsened, Marie-Antoinette and King Louis XVI grew\nonly more rigid in their adherence to the pastand quickened their path\nto the guillotine. King Charles I of England reacted similarly to the\ntide of democratic change brewing in England in the 1630s: He\ndisbanded Parliament, and his court rituals grew increasingly formal\nand distant. He wanted to return to an older style of ruling, with\nadherence to all kinds of petty protocol. His rigidity only heightened\nthe desire for change. Soon, of course, he was swept up in a\ndevastating civil war, and eventually he lost his head to the\nexecutioner's axe.\n\nAs you get older, you must rely even less on the past. Be vigilant\nlest the form your character has taken makes you seem a relic. It is not\na matter of mimicking the fashions of youththat is equally worthy of\nlaughter. Rather your mind must constantly adapt to each\ncircumstance, even the inevitable change that the time has come to\nmove over and let those of younger age prepare for their ascendancy.\nRigidity will only make you look uncannily like a cadaver.\n\nNever forget, though, that formlessness is a strategic pose. It\ngives you room to create tactical surprises; as your enemies struggle to\nguess your next move, they reveal their own strategy, putting them at a\ndecided disadvantage. It keeps the initiative on your side, putting your\nenemies in the position of never acting, constantly reacting. It foils\ntheir spying and intelligence. Remember: Formlessness is a tool. Never\nconfuse it with a go-with-the-flow style, or with a religious resignation\nto the twists of fortune. You use formlessness, not because it creates\ninner harmony and peace, but because it will increase your power.\n\nFinally, learning to adapt to each new circumstance means seeing\nevents through your own eyes, and often ignoring the advice that\npeople constantly peddle your way. It means that ultimately you must\nthrow out the laws that others preach, and the books they write to tell\nyou what to do, and the sage advice of the elder. \u201cThe laws that govern\ncircumstances are abolished by new circumstances,\u201d Napoleon wrote,\nwhich means diat it is up to you to gauge each new situation. Rely too\nmuch on other people's ideas and you end up taking a form not of your\nown making. Too much respect for other people's wisdom will make\nyou depreciate your own. Be brutal with the past, especially your own,\n\nand have no respect for the philosophies that are foisted on you from\noutside.\n\nImage: Mercury. The winged messenger,\n\ngod of commerce, patron saint of thieves, gamblers, and all those\nwho deceive through\n\nswiftness. The day Mercury was born he invented die lyre; by that\nevening he had stolen the cattle of Apollo. He would scour the world,\nassuming\n\nwhatever form he desired. Like the liquid metal\n\nnamed after him, he embodies the elusive, the ungraspablethe\npower of formlessness.\n\nAuthority: Therefore the consummation of forming an army is to\narrive at formlessness. Victory in war is not repetitious, but adapts its\nform endlessly. ... A military force has no constant formation, water\nhas no constant shape: The ability to gain victory by changing and\nadapting according to the opponent is called genius. (Sun-tzu, fourth\ncentury B.C.)\n\nREVERSAL\n\nUsing space to disperse and create an abstract pattern should not\nmean forsaking the concentration of your power when it is valuable to\nyou. Formlessness makes your enemies hunt all over for you,\nscattering their own forces, mental as well as physical. When you\nfinally engage them, though, hit them with a powerful, concentrated\nblow. That is how Mao succeeded against the Nationalists: He broke\ntheir forces into small, isolated units, which he then could easily\noverwhelm with a strong attack. The law of concentration prevailed.\n\nWhen you play with formlessness, keep on top of the process, and\nkeep your long-term strategy in mind. When you assume a form and\ngo on the attack, use concentration, speed, and power. As Mao said, \u201c\nWhen we fight you, we make sure you can't get away.\u201d\n"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}
