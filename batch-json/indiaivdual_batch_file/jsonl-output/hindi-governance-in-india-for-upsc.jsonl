They derive from the inherent\ndignity of human beings. They are essential for human survival and human development.\n\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights\n\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1948. This\ndeclaration represents the first international expression of human rights to which all human beings are\nentitled. It is described as the “International Magna Carta”.\n\nThe declaration consists of 30 articles which can be divided into four parts. These are explained\nbelow.\n\nThe first two articles contain the basic principles underlying all human rights. Thus, they state as\nfollows:\n\nArticle 1: All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.\n\nArticle 2: Everyone is entitled to all the human rights and freedoms, without distinction of any\nkind such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national\nor social origin, property, birth or other status.\n\nArticles 3 to 21 consist of civil and political rights. They are as under:\n\nArticle 3: Right to life, liberty and security\n\nArticle 4: Freedom from slavery and servitude\n\nArticle 5: Freedom from torture and inhuman punishment\nArticle 6: Right to recognition as a person before the law\nArticle 7: Right to equality before the law\n\nArticle 8: Right to judicial remedy\n\nArticle 9: Freedom from arbitrary arrest or exile\n\nArticle 10: Right to a fair trial and public hearing\n\nArticle 11: Right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty\nArticle 12: Right to privacy and reputation\n\nArticle 13: Right to freedom of movement\n\n\nArticle 14: Right to seek asylum\n\nArticle 15: Right to a nationality\n\nArticle 16: Right to marriage and family protection\n\nArticle 17: — Right to own property\n\nArticle 18: | Freedom of thought, conscience and religion\n\nArticle 19: | Freedom of opinion, expression and information\n\nArticle 20: | Freedom of peaceful assembly and association\n\nArticle 21: Right to participate in government and equal access to public service\n\nArticles 22 to 27 contain economic, social and cultural rights. They are mentioned below:\n\nArticle 22: Right to social security\n\nArticle 23: Right to work and equal pay for equal work\n\nArticle 24: — Right to rest and leisure\n\nArticle 25: Right to adequate standard of living for health and well-being including food,\nclothing, housing, medical care, social services and security.\n\nArticle 26: Right to education\n\nArticle 27: Right to participate in cultural life of community\n\nThe last three articles specify the context within which all the human rights are to be enjoyed. Thus,\nthey state as under:\n\nArticle 28: Everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which the above rights and\nfreedoms can be fully realised.\n\nArticle 29: The exercise of the above rights and freedoms shall be limited for the purpose of\nsecuring recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and for meeting\nthe requirements of morality, public order and general welfare.\n\nArticle 30: No state, group or person has any right to engage in any activity aimed at the\ndestruction of the above rights and freedoms.\n\nInternational Bill of Human Rights\n\nLater on, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was bifurcated into two separate covenants,\nnamely, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on\nEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights. The human rights and freedoms contained in the Universal\nDeclaration have been further developed and elaborated upon in these two covenants. Both the\ncovenants were adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1966 and came into force in 1976.\n\nIn addition to the above two detailed covenants, two Optional Protocols to the International\nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights were also adopted by the UN General Assembly. The First\nOptional Protocol was adopted in 1966 itself while the Second Optional Protocol was adopted in\n1989. The First Optional Protocol provides for the submission of complaints by individuals whose\nhuman rights have been violated by a State party. The Second Optional Protocol, on the other hand,\nadvocates the abolition of the death penalty.\n\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political\nRights and its two Optional Protocols, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and\n\n\nCultural Rights constitute what is now widely regarded as the “International Bill of Human Rights”.\n\nOther International Conventions\n\nThe International Bill of Human Rights has been further supplemented by various other international\ntreaties, conventions and declarations. They are usually regarded as “human rights instruments”. They\nare specialised in nature and related to either a particular human right or to a specific vulnerable\ngroup. The important among them are as follows:\n\n1. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (1966)\n\n2. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (1979)\n\n3. Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment\n(1984)\n\n4. Declaration on the Right to Development (1986)\n\nConvention on the Rights of the Child (1989)\n\n6. Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their\nFamilies (1990)\n\n7. Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2006)\n\nw\n\nHuman Rights in India\n\nThe Constitution of India has a rich content of human rights. The Preamble, the Fundamental Rights\nand the Directive Principles of State Policy reflect the principles and provisions of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights (1948).\nThe four ideals of the Preamble are aimed at the promotion of human rights. They are as under:\n1. Justice in social, economic and political spheres\n2. Liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship\n3. Equality of status and opportunity\n4. Fraternity assuring the dignity of the individual\nThe Fundamental Rights under Part-II of the Constitution contain an elaborate list of civil and\npolitical rights divided into six categories:\n1. Right to equality\nRight to freedom\nRight against exploitation\nRight to freedom of religion\nCultural and educational rights\n6. Right to constitutional remedies\n\nwPwhnd\n\nThe Directive Principles of State Policy in Part-IV of the Constitution comprise economic, social\nand cultural rights. They can be classified into three broad categories, viz.,\n\n1. Socialistic Principles\n2. Gandhian Principles\n\n\n3. Liberal-Intellectual Principles\n\nBesides the Fundamental Rights included in Part-II, there are certain other rights contained in\nother parts of the Constitution—for example, the right to property in Part-XII of the Constitution.\n\nIn the course of time, the Supreme Court has also expanded the scope of human rights contained in\nthe Fundamental Rights. It declared a number of human rights as integral part of fundamental rights,\nthough they have not been specifically mentioned in Part-II of the Constitution. The examples of such\nun-enumerated fundamental rights are right to health, right to speedy trial, right against torture, right to\nprivacy, right to travel abroad, right to free legal aid, and so on.\n\nIn addition to these, the various laws enacted by the Parliament and the State Legislatures contain a\nnumber of human rights, particularly for the vulnerable sections of the society. Some such laws are\nthe Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, the Protection of Civil Rights Act, the Persons with\nDisabilities Act, the Minimum Wages Act, and so on.\n\nFinally, the Protection of Human Rights Act (1993) defines human rights in India as the rights\nrelating to life, liberty, equality and dignity of the individual guaranteed by the Constitution or\nembodied in the International Covenants and enforceable by courts in India. Further, it also defined\nthe International Covenants as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the\nInternational Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights adopted by the General Assembly of\nthe United Nations on 16th December, 1996 and such other Covenant or Convention adopted by the\nGeneral Assembly of the United Nations as the Central Government may, by notifications, specify.\nThe Indian Government acceded to these two International Covenants on April 10, 1979.\n\nThe Constitution of India and the laws of Parliament as well as state legislatures not only consist of\nseveral human rights but also provide for the establishment of national and state commissions for the\nprotection and promotion of those rights. They are mentioned below in Tables 1.1 and 1.2.\n\nNational Commissions Related to Human Rights\n\nSl.No. Name of the Commission Established Under\n\n1.

The President should set up a National Commission for the STs to investigate and monitor all\nmatters relating to the constitutional and legal rights and safeguards for the STs and to report\nto him (Article 338-A).\n\nLegal Rights\n\nThe legislations which contain the rights and safeguards for the SCs and STs are as follows:\n\n1. Protection of Civil Rights Act (1955) prescribes punishment for the preaching and practice of\n“untouchability”and for the enforcement of any disability arising therefrom. It provides\npenalties for preventing a person, on the ground of untouchability, from enjoying civil rights\ni.e., rights accruing to a person on account of the abolition of untouchability.\n\n2. Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act (1989) prevents the\ncommission of offences of atrocities against the SCs and STs by persons other than the SCs\nand STs. It also provides for the establishment of special courts for speedy trial of such\noffences. Further, it makes provision for the relief and rehabilitation of the victims of such\noffences.\n\n3. Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act (1976) freed unilaterally all the bonded labourers\nfrom bondage with simultaneous liquidation of their debts. It provides for the identification\nand release of bonded labourers and rehabilitation of freed bonded labourers.\n\n4. Minimum Wages Act (1948) provides for fixation, review, revision and enforcement of\nminimum wage in respect of notified employments.\n\n5. Legal Services Authorities Act (1987) provides for free legal services to the SCs and STs.\n\n6. Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act (2013) seeks\nto prohibit employment of individuals as manual scavengers by prescribing stringent\npunishment, including imprisonment upto five years. It also has provisions for rehabilitation\nof manual scavengers and their families. This new law overrides the old Employment of\nManual Scavengers and Construction of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act (1993). This means\n\n\nooo\nthat the 1993 Act would become practically infructuous.\n\n7. Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Act (2006) provides for\nreservation of 15% for the students belonging to the SCs and 7.5% for STs in central\neducational institutions (other than those exempted under the Act).\n\n8. Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act\n(2006) seeks to recognise and vest the forest rights and occupation in forest land in forest\ndwelling STs and other traditional forest dwellers who have been residing in such forests for\ngenerations but whose rights could not be recorded.\n\n9. Provisions of the Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act (1996) (PESA) is aimed at\nthe preservation of the customs, practices and resources of the STs. It provides for reservation\nto the STs in the Panchayats.\n\n10. The following other legislations contain certain rights and safeguards for the STs:\n\n(i) Indian Forest Act (1927)\n\n(ii) Forest (Conservation) Act (1980)\n\n(iii) State Acts relating to the prevention of alienation and restoration of land belonging to the\nSTs. In some states, such provisions exist in the Land Revenue Code.\n\n(iv) State Acts regulating money-lending to the STs."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

However, the term ‘minority’ has not been defined anywhere in the Constitution.\n\nIn 1993, the Central Government notified five communities, viz., Muslims, Christians, Sikhs,\nBuddhists and Zoroastrians (Parsis) as religious minorities at the national level. In January 2014, the\nJain community was added to this list.\n\nA linguistic minority is a group of people whose mother tongue is different from that of the majority\nin the state or part of a state. This means that linguistic minorities are determined on a state-wise\nbasis.\n\nThe Constitution contains special provisions to safeguard the social, educational and economic\ninterests of the minorities. Some of these are common to both religious minorities and linguistic\nminorities while some others are meant exclusively for linguistic minorities. Hence, these provisions\nare mentioned here under two headings.\n\nReligious and Linguistic Minorities\n\n1. Any section of citizens having a distinct language, script or culture of its own has the right to\nconserve the same (Article 29(1)).\n\n2. No citizen is to be denied admission into any educational institution maintained by the state or\naided by the state on grounds of religion, race, caste or language (Article 29(2)).\n\n3.

This means that a representation cannot be rejected\non the ground that it is not in the official language (Article 350).\nEvery state and a local authority in the state should provide adequate facilities for instruction\nin the mother tongue at the primary stage of education to children belonging to linguistic\nminority groups.

The Act provided for the establishment of a Central\nWaqaf Council for the purpose of advising the Government of India on matters pertaining to\nworking of the State Waqf Boards and proper administration of the Waqfs in the country. A\nWadf is a permanent dedication of movable or immovable properties for purposes recognised\nby the Muslim Law as religious, pious or charitable. Apart from these religious aspects, the\nWadfs are also instruments of social and economic upliftment.\nThe National Commission for Minorities Act (1992) accorded statutory status to the\n\n\na minority educational institution should not restrict or abrogate the right guaranteed to the\nminorities, whether based on religion or language (Article 30(1-A)).\n\n5. In granting aid to educational institutions, the state should not discriminate against any\neducational institution on the ground that it is under the management of a minority, whether\nbased on religion or language (Article 30(2)).\n\n6. The wearing and carrying of kirpans shall be deemed to be included in the profession of the\nSikh religion. In other words, Sikhs have the right to wear and carry kirpans (Article 25(2)).\n\nLinguistic Minorities\n\n1. When the President (on a demand being made) is satisfied that a substantial proportion of the\npopulation of a state desire the use of any language spoken by them to be recognised by that\nstate, then he may direct that such language should also be officially recognised in that state\n(Article 347).\n\n2.

National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions Act (2004) provides additional\nsafeguards to the minority educational institutions. It contains provisions for the following:\n(i) Establishment of a National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions\n(ii) Right to establish a minority educational institution\n(iii) Right of a minority educational institution to seek affiliation to any university of its choice\n2.

The Commission monitors the working of the\nsafeguards provided to the minorities in the constitution and laws. It also looks into specific\ncomplaints regarding deprivation of rights and safeguards of the minorities.\n\nConsensual Safeguards\n\nIn addition to the above constitutional safeguards, the linguistic minorities are also provided with\nsome consensual safeguards. These have been arrived at by consensus by the Central and the state\ngovernments through series of meetings. They are as follows:\n\n1.\n2.\n\nInstruction through minority languages at the secondary stage of education\nTranslation and publication of important rules, regulations, notices, etc., into all languages,\nwhich are spoken by at least 15% of the total population at district or sub-district level\n\nNo insistence upon knowledge of State’s Official Language at the time of recruitment; test of\nproficiency in the State’s Official Language to be held before completion of probation\n\nThe constitutional and the consensual safeguards together with practical ways to implement them\nhas led to the combined scheme of safeguards.

It\nimplies that the citizens and non-governmental organisations should enjoy a reasonably free access to\nall files and documents pertaining to government operations, decisions, and performance. In other\nwords, it means openness and transparency in the functioning of government. Thus, it is antithetical to\nsecrecy in public administration.\n\nIn 1992, the World Bank released a document entitled “Governance and Development’. The\ndocument has mentioned seven aspects or elements of governance—one of them being transparency\n\n\nand information.\nThe Right to Information is necessary due to the following reasons:\n\nIt makes administration more accountable to people.\n\nIt reduces the gap between administration and people.\n\nIt makes people aware of administrative decision-making.\n\nIt facilitates better delivery of goods and services to people by civil servants.\n\nIt facilitates intelligent and constructive criticism of administration.\n\nIt increases people’s participation in administration.\n\nIt promotes public interest by discouraging arbitrariness in administrative decision-making.\n\nIt reduces the scope for corruption in public administration.\n\nIt upholds the democratic ideology by promoting openness and transparency in administration.\n. It makes administration more responsive to the requirements of people.\n. It reduces the chances of abuse of authority by the public servants.\n\nHBSS PNaANPWN SE\n\nRight to Information Act (2005)\n\nThe Constitution of India has no direct provision expressly conferring right to information to the\ncitizens. However, the Supreme Court has been stating since 1975 that the right to information is an\nintrinsic part of the following two fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution of India:\n(i) Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression (Article 19).\n(ii) Right to Life and Personal Liberty (Article 21).\nIn India, various laws and rules restrict the disclosure of official information to the people and thus\nfavour secrecy in administration. These are:\n(i) Official Secrets Act, 1923\n(ii) Indian Evidence Act, 1872\n(iii) Commission of Enquiry Act, 1952\n(iv) All-India Services (Conduct) Rules, 1954\n(v) Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1955\n(vi) Railway Services (Conduct) Rules, 1956\n\nRecognising the need for setting out a practical regime for securing of information by citizens from\nthe public authorities, and to promote transparency and accountability in the working of all public\nauthorities, the Parliament enacted the Right to Information Act in 2005.\n\nThe law is comprehensive and covers disclosure of information on almost all matters of\ngovernance. It is applicable to Government at all levels—Central, State and Local (both rural and\nurban) and also to the bodies owned, controlled or substantially financed by the government, as well\nas to the non-governmental organisations receiving government grants. It covers the legislature, the\njudiciary, the executive and all constitutional bodies.\n\nThe salient features (or provisions) of the Act are mentioned below:\n\n1.

Thus, this provision makes\nonly elementary education a Fundamental Right and not higher or professional education.\n\nThis provision was added by the 86th Constitutional Amendment Act of 2002. This amendment is a\nmajor milestone in the country’s aim to achieve ‘education for all’. The government described this\nstep as ‘the dawn of the second revolution in the chapter of rights of citizens’.\n\nEven before this amendment, the Constitution contained a provision for free and compulsory\neducation for children under Article 45 in Part IV. However, being a directive principle, it was not\n\n\nenforceable by the courts. Now, there is scope for judicial intervention in this regard.\n\nThis amendment changed the subject matter of Article 45 in directive principles. It now reads\n—‘The state shall endeavour to provide early childhood care and education for all children until they\ncomplete the age of six years.’ It also added a new fundamental duty under Article 51-A that reads\n—‘It shall be the duty of every citizen of India who is a parent or guardian to provide opportunities\nfor education to his child or ward between the age of six and fourteen years’.\n\nIn 1993 itself, the Supreme Court recognised a Fundamental Right to primary education in the right\nto life under Article 21. It held that every child or citizen of this country has a right to free education\nuntil he completes the age of 14 years. Thereafter, his right to education is subject to the limits of\neconomic capacity and development of the state. In this judgement, the Court overruled its earlier\njudgement (1992) which declared that there was a fundamental right to education up to any level\nincluding professional education like medicine and engineering.\n\nRight to Education Act (2009)\n\nThe Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 was enacted to implement\nthe constitutional provision under Article 21-A. The Act provides for free and compulsory education\nto all children of the age of six to fourteen years. The Central Government affixed 1st April, 2010 as\nthe date of enforcement of the Act.\n\nThe Act provides children in the 6-14 age group the legal entitlement to free and compulsory\neducation. It provides the legislative framework for Universalisation of Elementary Education.\n\nThe salient features (or provisions) of the Act are mentioned below:\n\n1. It provides for the right of children to free and compulsory education till completion of\nelementary education in a neighbourhood school\n\n2. It clarifies that ‘compulsory education’ means obligation of the appropriate government to\nprovide free elementary education and ensure compulsory admission, attendance and\ncompletion of elementary education to every child in the six to fourteen age group. ‘Free’\nmeans that no child shall be liable to pay any kind of fee or charges or expenses which may\nprevent him or her from pursuing and completing elementary education.\n\n3. It makes provisions for a non-admitted child to be admitted to an age appropriate class.\n\n4. It specifies the duties and responsibilities of appropriate governments, local authorities,\nparents, schools and teachers in providing free and compulsory education.\n\n5. It specifies the sharing of financial and other responsibilities between the Central and State\nGovernments.\n\n6. It lays down the norms and standards relating inter alia to Pupil Teacher Ratios (PTRs),\nbuildings and infrastructure, school working days, teacher working hours.\n\n7. It provides for rational deployment of teachers by ensuring that the specified pupil teacher\nratio is maintained for each school, rather than just as an average for the State or District or\nBlock, thus ensuring that there is no urban-rural imbalance in teacher postings.\n\n8. It provides for prohibition of deployment of teachers for non-educational work, other than\ndecennial census, elections to local authority, state legislatures and Parliament, and disaster\nrelief.\n\n9. It provides for appointment of appropriately trained teachers, i.e., teachers with the requisite\n\n\nentry and academic qualifications.\n\n10. It prohibits (i) physical punishment and mental harassment, (ii) screening procedures for\nadmission of children, (iii) capitation fees, (iv) private tuition by teachers, and (v) running of\nschools without recognition.\n\n11. It provides for the following penalties:\n\n(i) For charging capitation fee: Fine upto 10 times the capitation fee charged\n\n(ii) For resorting to screening during admission: Rs. 25,000 for first contravention; Rs. 50,000\nfor each subsequent contravention\n\n(iii) For running a school without recognition: Fine upto one lakh rupees, and in case of\ncontinuing contravention Rs.10,000 for each day during which the contravention continues\n\n12. It provides for the establishment of a School Management Committee in all schools other than\nunaided ones. It should consist of the elected representatives of the local authority, parents or\nguardians of children admitted in the school and teachers. It shall perform the following\nfunctions:\n\n(i) monitor the working of the school\n\n(ii) prepare and recommend school development plan\n\n(iii) monitor the utilisation of the grants received from the government or local authority or any\nother source; and\n\n(iv) any other prescribed function\n\n13. It provides for development of a curriculum in consonance with the values enshrined in the\nConstitution, and which would ensure the all-round development of the child, building on the\nchild’s knowledge, potentiality and talent, and making the child free of fear, trauma and\nanxiety through a system of child friendly and child centred learning.\n\n14. It provides for protection and monitoring of the child’s right to free and compulsory education\nand redressal of grievances by the National and State Commissions for Protection of Child\nRights, which shall have the powers of a civil court.\n\n15. It provides for the establishment of a National Advisory Council and a State Advisory\nCouncil in each state to advise the respective governments on implementation of the\nprovisions of the Act in an effective manner.\n\nThe duties and responsibilities of the Central Government, State Governments and Local\nAuthorities specified in the Act are mentioned below in Table 1.4.\n\nDuties of Governments under the Right to Education Act (2009)\n\nSl.No. Governments Duties and Responsibilities\n1.

The amendment included children with disabilities under the RTE Act. More specifically, the\n\namendment expanded the definition of “child belonging to disadvantaged group” to include “a\n\nchild with disability”.\n\n2. The amendment provided that a child with “multiple disabilities” or “severe disability” may\nalso have the right to opt for home-based education.\n\n3. The amendment provided that the School Management Committees in respect of minority\neducational institutions shall function only in an advisory capacity.\n\n4. The amendment declares that the provisions of RTE Act shall not apply to Madrasas, Vedic\nPathsalas and educational institutions primarily imparting religious instruction."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Ecological needs of the river should be determined, through scientific study, recognising that\n\nthe natural river flows are characterized by low or no flows, small floods (freshets), large\nfloods, etc., and should accommodate developmental needs.\n\n.

A system to evolve benchmarks for water uses for different purposes, i.e., water footprints,\n\nand water auditing should be developed to promote and incentivise efficient use of water.\n\n. Pricing of water should ensure its efficient use and reward conservation. Equitable access to\n\nwater for all and its fair pricing, for drinking and other uses such as sanitation, agricultural\nand industrial, should be arrived at through independent statutory Water Regulatory Authority,\nset up by each state.\n\n.

Its aim is to transform Government\ninto an “Efficient and Responsible” litigant. This policy is also based on the recognition that it\nis the responsibility of the Government to protect the rights of citizens, to respect fundamental\nrights and those in charge of the conduct of Government litigation should never forget this\nbasic principle.\n\nAccording to the policy, “Efficient Litigant” means:\n\n(a) Focusing on the core issues involved in the litigation and addressing them squarely.\n\n(b) Managing and conducting litigation in a cohesive, coordinated and time-bound manner.\n\n(c) Ensuring that good cases are won and bad cases are not needlessly persevered with.\n\n(d) A litigant who is represented by competent and sensitive legal persons: competent in their\nskills and sensitive to the facts that Government is not an ordinary litigant and that a\nlitigation does not have to be won at any cost.\n\nSimilarly, as per the policy, “Responsible Litigant” means:\n\n(a) That litigation will not be resorted to for the sake of litigating.\n\n(b) That false pleas and technical points will not be taken and shall be discouraged.\n\n(c) Ensuring that the correct facts and all relevant documents will be placed before the court.\n\n(d) That nothing will be suppressed from the court and there will be no attempt to mislead any\ncourt or Tribunal.\n\nGovernment must cease to be a compulsive litigant. The philosophy that matters should be left\nto the courts for ultimate decision has to be discarded. The easy approach, “Let the court\ndecide,” must be eschewed and condemned.\n\nThe purpose underlying this policy is also to reduce Government litigation in courts so that\nvaluable court time would be spent in resolving other pending cases so as to achieve the goal\nin the National Legal Mission to reduce average pendency time from fifteen years to three\nyears. Litigators on behalf of Government have to keep in mind the principles incorporated in\nthe National mission for judicial reforms which includes identifying bottlenecks which the\nGovernment and its agencies may be concerned with and also removing unnecessary\nGovernment cases. Prioritisation in litigation has to be achieved with particular emphasis on\nwelfare legislation, social reform, weaker sections and senior citizens and other categories\nrequiring assistance must be given utmost priority.\n\nGiven that Tribunalisation is meant to remove the loads from Courts, challenge to orders of\nTribunals should be an exception and not a matter of routine.\n\nIn Service Matters, no appeal will be filed in cases where:\n\n(a) the matter pertains to an individual grievance without any major repercussion;\n\n(b) the matter pertains to a case of pension or retirement benefits without involving any\nprinciple and without setting any precedent or financial implications.\n\nFurther, proceedings will not be filed in service matters merely because the order of the\nAdministrative Tribunal affects a number of employees. Appeals will not be filed to espouse\nthe cause of one section of employees against another.\n\nProceedings will be filed challenging orders of Administrative Tribunals only if:\n\n\n(a) there is a clear error of record and the finding has been entered against the Government.\n(b) the judgement of the Tribunal is contrary to a service rule or its interpretation by a High\nCourt or the Supreme Court.\n(c) the judgement would impact the working of the administration in terms of morale of the\nservice, the Government is compelled to file a petition; or\n(d) if the judgement will have recurring implications upon other cadres or if the judgement\ninvolves huge financial claims being made.\nAppeals in Revenue matters will not be filed:\n(a) if the stakes are not high and are less than that amount to be fixed by the Revenue\nAuthorities;\n(b) if the matter is covered by a series of judgements of the Tribunal or of the High Courts\nwhich have held the field and which have not been challenged in the Supreme Court;\n(c) where the assessee has acted in accordance with long-standing industry practice;\n(d) merely because of change of opinion on the part of jurisdictional officers.\nAll pending cases involving Government will be reviewed. This Due Diligence process shall\ninvolve drawing upon statistics of all pending matters which shall be provided for by all\nGovernment departments (including PSUs). The Office of the Attorney General and the\nSolicitor General shall also be responsible for reviewing all pending cases and filtering\nfrivolous and vexatious matters from the meritorious ones.\n\n. Cases will be grouped and categorised. The practice of grouping should be introduced\n\nwhereby cases should be assigned a particular number of identity according to the subject and\nstatute involved. In fact, further sub-grouping will also be attempted. To facilitate this\nprocess, standard forms must be devised which lawyers have to fill up at the time of filing of\ncases. Panels will be set up to implement categorisation, review such cases to identify cases\nwhich can be withdrawn. These include cases which are covered by decisions of courts and\ncases which are found without merit withdrawn. This must be done in a time bound fashion."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

It is designed so as to apply to all sharable non-sensitive\ndata available either in digital or analog forms.\n\nThe policy will apply to all data and information created, generated, collected and achieved using\npublic funds provided by Government of India directly or through authorised agencies by various\nMinistries/ Departments/Organisations/Agencies and Autonomous bodies.\n\nThe principles on which data sharing and accessibility need to be based include: Openness,\nFlexibility, Transparency, Quality, Security and machine-readable.\n\n\nAs per the policy, every department has to identify datasets by the following categories:\n\n(i) Negative List : The datasets, which are confidential in nature and would compromise to the\ncounty’s security if made public, are put into this list.\n\n(ii) Open List: This list comprises of datasets which don’t fall under negative list. These datasets\nshall be prioritised into high value datasets and non-high values datasets.\n\nDifferent types of datasets generated both in geospatial and non-spatial form by\nMinistries/Departments shall be classified as shareable data and non-shareable data. The derived\nstatistics like national accounts statistics, indicators like price index, databases from census and\nsurveys are the types of data produced by a statistical mechanism. However, the geospatial data\nconsists primarily of satellite data, maps, etc. In such a mechanism, it becomes important to maintain\nstandards in respect of metadata, data layout and data access policy.\n\nThe benefits of the data sharing policy are as follows:\n\n1. Maximising use: Ready access to government owned data will enable more extensive use of a\nvaluable public resource for the benefit of the community.\n\n2. Avoiding duplication: By sharing data the need or separate bodies to collect the same data\nwill be avoided resulting in significant cost savings in data collection.\n\n3. Maximised integration: By adopting common standards for the collection and transfer of data,\nintegration of individual data sets may be feasible.\n\n4. Ownership information: The identification of owners for the principal data sets provide\ninformation to users to identify those responsible for implementation of prioritised data\ncollection programs and development of data standards.\n\n5. Better decision-making: Data and information facilitates making important decisions without\nincurring repetitive costs. Ready access to existing valuable data is essential for many\ndecision-making tasks such as protecting the environment, development planning, managing\nassets, improving living conditions, national security and controlling disasters.\n\n6. Equity of access: A more open data transfer policy ensures better access to all bonafide users."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The implementation of the provisions of the policy will lead to\nreduction of crime, improvement in public health and uplifting of the social milieu.\n\nThe policy will serve as a guide to various Ministries and organisations and re-assert India’s\ncommitment to combat the drug menace in a holistic manner.\n\nThe salient features of the policy are as follows:\n\n1. The policy recommends production of Concentrate of Poppy Straw (CPS) in India by a\ncompany or body corporate. This would enable India to retain its status of a traditional\nsupplier of Opiate Raw Material (ORM) to the rest of world, while remaining competitive.\n\n2. The consumption of poppy straw by addicts will be gradually reduced and finally stopped ina\n\n\ntime frame decided by the States.\n\n3. On the illicit cultivation of poppy and cannabis, the policy emphasizes use of satellite\nimageries for detection of illicit crop and its subsequent eradication and development of\nalternate means of livelihood in respect of cultivators in pockets of traditional illicit\ncultivation.\n\n4. The private sector may be allowed production of alkaloids from opium. At present alkaloids\nfrom opium are produced only in Government Opium and Alkaloid Factories (GOAFs).\n\n5. Non-intrusive methods of regulating the manufacture, trade and use of such psychotropic\nsubstances will be introduced.\n\n6. Emphasis will be laid on adequate access to morphine and other opioids necessary for\npalliative care, a strategy to address street peddlers of drugs, periodic surveys of drug abuse\nto gauge the extent, pattern and nature of drug abuse in the country, recognition of de-addiction\ncenters.\n\n7. There will be a time bound plan of action, detailing the steps to be taken by different\nMinistries/ Departments/agencies, in response to the recommendations of the International\nNarcotics Control Board.\n\nNarcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances have several medical and scientific uses. However,\nthey can be and are also abused and trafficked. India’s approach towards Narcotic Drugs and\nPsychotropic Substances is enshrined in Article 47 of the Constitution of India which mandates that\nthe ‘State shall endeavour to bring about prohibition of the consumption except for medicinal\npurposes of intoxicating drinks and of drugs which are injurious to health’. The same principle of\npreventing use of drugs except for medicinal use was also adopted in the three international\nconventions on drug related matters, viz., Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961, Convention on\nPsychotropic Substances, 1971 and the UN Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and\nPsychotropic Substances, 1988. India has signed and ratified these three conventions. India’s\ncommitment to prevention of drug abuse and trafficking predates the coming into force of the three\nconventions.\n\nThe Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985 was framed taking into\naccount India’s obligations under the three UN drug conventions as well as Article 47 of the\nConstitution mentioned above. This Act prohibits, except for medical or scientific purposes, the\nmanufacture, production, trade, use, etc. of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.\n\nThe Government’s policy has thus been to promote their use for medical and scientific purposes\nwhile preventing their diversion from licit sources, and prohibiting illicit traffic and abuse. Unlike the\nearlier Opium Acts and the Dangerous Drugs Act which it replaced, the NDPS Act has given the\npower of enforcement to various central and state law enforcement agencies, thus spreading the net of\nlaw enforcement far and wide.\n\n400 National Policies and Related Ministries\n\nName of the Policy Related Ministry / Department\n1.

Translate the following text into Hindi accurately, preserving the original meaning and context."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Meaning\n\nThe Central Secretariat comprises of all the ministers and departments of the Central Government. In\nother words, Central Government, for the purpose of administration, is divided into various\nministries and departments. The Central Secretariat is a totality of such ministries and departments. A\nministry generally consists of two to four departments. However, there can be a ministry without\nbeing divided into departments, like Ministry of External Affairs. Similarly, there can be a\ndepartment without being placed under a ministry, like Department of Atomic Energy. The ministries\nand departments are headed politically by ministers and administratively by Secretaries.\n\nArticle 77 of the Constitution of India authorises the President of India to make rules for more\nconvenient transaction of business of Central Government and for allocation of such business among\nthe ministers. This is the basis of portfolio system, the essence of which is that a minister is made\nincharge of ministry/department and he is to issue orders on behalf of the President. Therefore, the\nconcept of a ministry/department originate from portfolio system. The ministries/departments\nenumerated in the Allocation of Business Rules are collectively known as the Central Secretariat. At\npresent, the ministries/departments of Central Government are governed by the Government of India\n(Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961.\n\nHistorical Perspective\n\nThe institution of Central Secretariat originated and developed in modern India during the period of\nBritish rule. The following points can be noted in this regard:\n\n(i) In 1843, the Governor-General of India separated the Secretariat of the Government of India\nfrom that of the government of Bengal. Accordingly, four departments, namely, home, finance,\nmilitary and foreign were set up in the Central Secretariat.\n\n(ii) In 1859, the portfolio system was introduced by Lord Canning. Consequently, a member of the\nGovernor-General’s Council was made incharge of one or more departments of the Central\nSecretariat and was authorised to issue orders on behalf of the Council.\n\n(iii) In 1905, the tenure system of secretariat staffing was introduced by Lord Curzon.\n\n(iv) In 1905, the Railway Board was set up by a resolution of the Government of India.\nConsequently, the control of railways was transferred to it from the Public Works Department.\n\n\n(v) In 1947, the departments of the Government of India were renamed ‘ministries’. In all, there\nwere 18 such ministries in the Central Secretariat at that time.\n\nStructure of a Ministry\n\nA typical Ministry of the Central Government has a three-tier structure consisting of (i) a political\nhead, that is, a Cabinet minister, who is assisted by minister of state and deputy minister. But\nsometimes a minister of state may also be the political head of a ministry/department holding an\nindependent charge; (ii) secretariat organisation headed by a Secretary who is a career civil servant.\nHe is assisted by Joint-Secretaries, Deputy Secretaries, Under Secretaries and the office\nestablishment. Thus, a secretariat organisation has two distinct components—the officers and the\noffice, corresponding to the directing and controlling staff, and to the executive and clerical staff\nrespectively; and (iii) executive organisation under a head of the department who is known by various\ndesignations like Director, Director-General, Commissioner, Inspector-General, Chief Controller,\nand so on.\n\nSecretariat Organisation\n\nThe following chart indicates the structure and the hierarchy of officials of the Secretariat\norganisation of a ministry.\n\nar Officer in-Charge\n\nDepa ——— sin or Additional Secretary or Special Secretary\nWing — Additional Secretary or Joint Secretary\n\nDivision ———— Director or Deputy Secretary\n\nBranch c—_— ae\n\nSection -_ Section Officer\n\nA ministry is primarily divided into departments. Each department is divided into wings. Each\nwing is in turn divided into divisions which are further divided into branches. And Finally, each\nbranch is divided into sections. A section (also known as office) is the lowest as well as the smallest\norganisational unit of a ministry/department.\n\nThe Split System\n\nThe Secretariat system in India is based on the principle of separation of policy-making function from\nthat of policy execution. Under this scheme of separation, that is, the split system, the Secretariat\nshould be concerned only with policy-making and hence, should not indulge itself in process of policy\nexecution. The task of policy-execution should be left to executive agencies which are located outside\nthe Secretariat organisation.\n\nThe advantages of the split system are:\n\n(i) It helps Secretariat officials (i.e. policy makers) plan keeping in view aggregate national\n\n\ninterests, goals and requirements. This is because they are freed from the responsibilities of\nday-to-day administration.\n\n(ii) It enables the Secretary to examine objectively proposals emanating from executive agencies\nkeeping in view broader point of view of the government as a whole. This is because, the\nSecretary is secretary to the government as a whole, not to his minister alone.\n\n(iii) It provides operational freedom to executive agencies in the execution of policies. This is\nbecause Secretariat, under the split system, is not supposed to interfere in the task of policy-\nimplementation and has to be solely concerned with policy making. Hence, it encourages\nspecialisation and delegation of authority and avoids over-centralisation.\n\n(iv) It results in keeping the Secretariat smaller and manageable in size due to division of work\nbetween two separate agencies.\n\n(v) Programme implementation in the field can be evaluated objectively by Secretariat officials.\nThis responsibility cannot be assigned to executive agencies which implement programmes.\n\nIn this respect, the Indian Secretariat model differs from the British Whitehall model. In Britain, a\nministry is responsible for both, policy-making as well as policy execution. In the words of Avasthi\nand Avasthi, “The Secretariat in India may be said to be sui generis. While it may have adopted\nWhitehall in Britain as its model, it never became a real counterpart of the British Secretariat. While\nin India there obtain two sets of parallel hierarchies, one in the Secretariat and the other under the\nheads of executive departments, no such distinction is found in Britain where a ministry is an\nintegrated agency including within itself both policy formulating and executing agencies.” On the\nother hand, Indian Secretariat System is similar to the Swedish system In the words of\nS.R.Maheshwari, “In this respect India and Sweden might be held to be comparable: Sweden has two\nseparate and quite distinct sets of organisations, one for policy-making and another charged with the\nresponsibility for implementation of the policies”.\n\nRole and Functions\n\nThe Secretariat is a staff agency. Its function is to aid and assist the Government of India in fulfilment\nof its responsibilities and duties. It enables the Government to examine its present activities,\nemerging problems and future policies in the light of past activities and precedents by acting as an\ninstitutionalised memory, that is, a think-tank and treasure house of information. It also carries out a\ndetailed, in-depth and comprehensive examination and verification of an issue before the ministerial\n(governmental) decisions.\nAccording to official handbooks, Secretariat performs following functions with regard to the\nministries/departments.\n(i) Assisting the minister in policy-making and in modifying policies from time to time, as and\nwhen necessary;\n\n(ii) Framing legislation and rules and regulations;\n\n(iii) Sectoral planning and programme formulation;\n\n(iv) (a) Budgeting and control of expenditure in respect of activities of the ministry/department;\nand (b) according or securing administrative and financial approval to operational\nprogrammes and plans and their subsequent modifications;\n\n(v) Supervision and control over the execution of policies and programmes by executive\n\n\na\ndepartments or semi-autonomous field agencies, and evaluation of the results;\n(vi) Coordination and interpretation of policies, assisting other branches of government and\nmaintaining contact with state administrations;\n(vii) Initiating measures to develop greater personnel and organisational competence both in the\nministry/department and its executive agencies; and\n(viii) Assisting a minister in discharging his parliamentary responsibilities.\n\nTenure System\n\nAs defined by S.R. Maheshwari, “the superior positions in the Secretariat are as a rule managed by\nofficers who come from the states (and also from certain Central services) for a specified period and\nwho, after serving their ‘tenure’ would (or should), revert to their respective states or services. In\nofficial parlance, this arrangement is known as the tenure system.” Thus, under tenure system of\nstaffing, every official so deputed has to work in the Central Secretariat for a fixed period, which\ndiffers from one grade to another in the Secretariat hierarchy as mentioned below.\n\n(i) Secretary and Joint-Secretary 5 years\n(ii) Deputy Secretary 4 years\n(iii) Under Secretary 3 years\n\nThe tenure system was introduced in India in 1905 by Lord Curzon, the then Governor-Gerneral of\nIndia. He believed that “India may be governed from Simla or Calcutta; but is administered from the\nplains.” The tenure system originated from such a belief of Lord Curzon who came to be regarded as\nthe “father of tenure system.”\n\nThe following committees and commissions appointed during the British rule supported the tenure\nsystem.\n\n(i) Llewellyn Smith Committee (1919)—Report of the Government of India Secretariat Procedure\nCommittee.\n\n(ii) Simon Commission (1930)—Report of the Indian Statutory Commission.\n\n(iii) Wheeler Committee (1936)—Report of the Government of India Secretariat Committee\n\n(iv) Maxwell Committee (1937)-Report on organisation and procedure.\n\n(v) Rowlands Committee (1944—45)-Report of the Bengal Administration Enquiry Committee.\n\nThe ARC Study Team on personnel administration (1967) also supported the tenure system of\nstaffing in Central Secretariat (as well as in state secretariats).\n\nThe following arguments are put forward in favour of the tenure system.\n\n(i) It facilitates administrative coordination between the Centre and states. Thus, it strengthens\n\nthe functioning of Indian federal polity.\n\n(ii) It facilitates appointment in the Central Secretariat of officers who have first hand experience\n\nin field administration (or district administration).\n\n(iii) It provides state governments officers having national perspective and rich experience.\n\n(iv) It provides equal opportunities to all the officers who are entitled to a spell of stay at the\n\nSecretariat.\n\n\na\n\n(v) It secures administrative unity of the nation as well as independence of civil service.\n\n(vi) It facilitates the formulation of realistic national policies, which will have less difficulties in\nthe implementation in the field. This is because, it keeps the secretariat officials in touch with\nthe actual facts of administration.\n\n(vii) It removes the possibility of officers becoming stale due to their long stay at the secretariat. It\nprovides them with an opportunity of working in a different atmosphere which can bring\nfreshness to their outlook.\n\n(viii) It enables all the officers to enjoy the special benefits of secretariat posting and thereby\nimproves the morale in the civil service.\n\n(ix) It provides the required flexibility in the personnel management of the secretariat by enabling\nit to get rid of inefficient and incompetent officials in an easy manner.\n\nHowever, the critics have put forth the following arguments against the tenure system:\n\n(i) It results in ‘office-dominated administration’ and ‘over-bureaucratisation’ of the secretariat.\nA new officer posted at the secretariat depends too much on permanent office establishment to\nget things done.\n\n(ii) It does not ensure specialisation as it is essentially based on the myth of the higher caliber of\nthe generalist administrator. On the other hand, the work in the ministries and departments is\nfastly becoming specialized.\n\n(iii) Its main thrust—district or field experience—is not necessary and relevant in many areas of\nsecretariat work.\n\nNotably, the tenure system was never prevalent in all the ministries and departments of the Central\ngovernment. Even during the British era, the following four departments were excluded from the\npurview of the tenure system: (a) Indian Audit and Accounts Department; (b) Customs and Income-\nTax Department; (c) Foreign and Political Department; and (d) Posts and Telegraphs Department.\n\nToday, the tenure system is not as strong as it used to be before Independence. The following\nfactors have contributed to the weakening and breaking down of the tenure system.\n\n(i) A large number of posts of Under and Deputy Secretaries are today manned by members of the\nCentral Secretariat Service. Thus, the creation of this service in 1948 gave rise to a separate\ncadre of permanent Secretariat officers. At present, the Central Secretariat Service comprises\nof the following five grades: (a) Senior Selection Grade (Director); (b) Selection Grade\n(Deputy Secretary); (c) Grade-I (Under Secretary); (d) Section Officer’s Grade; and (e)\nAssistant’s Grade. The Department of Personnel and Training of the Ministry of Personnel is\nthe cadre controlling authority in respect of this service.\n\n(ii) The specialist members of the Indian Economic Service and the Indian Statistical Service\n(Created in 1961 as the specialist Central services—Class I) who are posted in large numbers\nin the Central Secretariat are not subject to tenure system, that is, rotation between the field\nand headquarter (Secretariat).\n\n(iii) The creation of the Finance-Commerce pool in 1938 (discontinued in 1946) and the Central\nadministrative pool in 1957 have modified the tenure system. The latter consists of officers\ndrawn from (a) the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), (b) Central Services-Class I, (c)\nCentral Secretariat Service—Class I and (d) State Services—Class I. It was established as a\nreserve for manning posts of and above the grade of Deputy Secretary in Central Secretariat.\n\n\nIt has both, general purpose and specialised categories of posts in it. The pool is managed and\ncontrolled by the Ministry of Personnel.\n\n(iv) The officers who come to Central Secretariat on deputation under tenure system do not go\nback to their parent departments or state governments due to the advantages of Secretariat\npostings like high salary, capital city amenities, nearness to power centre and so on.\n\n(v) The states are not always enthusiastic about sharing their best officers with Central\nGovernment. Such reluctance on the part of state governments has affected the even flow of\nofficers between the Secretariat and the field.\n\n(vi) The tenure system came into existence when India was a unitary state. But after the\nIndependence, unitary system was replaced by a federal system. As rightly observed by\nAvasthi and Avasthi, “The tenure system does not fit quite well in a federal polity with\nautonomous states. Amateur ministers at both, the Central and the state levels need services of\npermanent advisors in the Secretariat; mere ‘birds of passage’ will not do.”\n\nSecretariat Officials\n\nThe present grading of Secretariat officials is as follows.\n\" Secretary\n\nAdditional Secretary\n\nJoint Secretary\n\nDirector\n\nDeputy Secretary\n\nUnder Secretary\n\nThe first three grades constitute the ‘top management,’ while the last three grades constitute the\n“middle management’. All these officials function on the principle of ‘filter,’ that is, each officer\ndisposes of work at his level and submits important cases to the higher level. Moreover, all these\ngrades of officials perform their duties keeping in view the interest of the Government of India as a\nwhole. That is why a Secretary is designated as the Secretary to the Government of India, and not to\nhis minister/ministry alone.\n\nSecretary A Secretary has following roles.\n(i) He is administrative head of the Ministry/Department. His responsibility in this regard is\ncomplete and undivided.\n(ii) He is chief advisor to the minister on all aspects of policy and administrative affairs.\n(iii) He represents his ministry/department before the Public Accounts Committee of the\nParliament.\n\nAdditional/Joint Secretary An Additional Secretary is in charge of either a department or a wing\nof a department. A Joint Secretary, on the other hand, is always in charge of a wing of a department.\nThe rank and pay of a Joint Secretary is lower than that of an Additional Secretary who is senior to\nthe former. However there is not much distinction in their functions except when an Additional\nSecretary is in charge of a department. Richard Tottenham Report on the Reorganisation of Central\nGovernment (1945) stated that, “Additional and Joint Secretaries should not be either cheap\n\n\nSecretaries or expensive Deputy Secretaries.”\n\nDirector/Deputy Secretary The post of Director was created in 1960. As observed by S.R.\nMaheshwari, “There is not much Difference between the responsibilities of a Director and a Deputy\nsecretary, nor is a Deputy Secretary placed under a director.” But the rank and pay of a Director is\nhigher than that of a Deputy Secretary.\n\nA Deputy Secretary acts on behalf of the Secretary and is in charge of a division. He himself\nusually disposes of maximum cases and seeks instructions from Joint/Additional Secretaries or\nSecretary of the department only on important cases.\n\nUnder Secretary He is in charge of a branch and hence, is also called a ‘Branch Officer.’ He\nusually initiates action on all inward communications. He disposes minor cases on his own and\nsubmits only important cases to the Deputy Secretary.\n\nBefore Independence, there was another grade called Assistant Secretary below an Under\nSecretary. This post was abolished on the recommendation of the Maxwell Committee Report of\n1937.\n\nOfficer on Special Duty (OSD) An Officer on Special Duty is usually appointed from among the\nexisting officials to handle work which is urgent and which needs full concentration. It is basically a\ntemporary post, created to meet a specific exigency, and the duties and functions performed by an\nOSD are ofa special nature. However, the status of an OSD is not fixed and it may vary from that of a\nSecretary to an Under Secretary. In some cases, a section officer is also appointed as an OSD.\n\nThe post of OSD in India is a British legacy. It has the following merits:\n\n(i) It permits better co-ordination of the work.\n(ii) It facilitates expeditious execution of the decision and completion of the work.\n\nThe bodies (agencies) which make the selection of the officers of different grades in the Central\nSecretariat are mentioned below in Table 3.1.\n\n40S Me Selection of Secretariat Officials\n\nPosts Selection Made By\n(i) | Secretary/Additional Secretary Cabinet Secretary\n(ii) Joint Secretary Senior Selection Board (Presided over by the\nCabinet Secretary).\n(iii) | Director/Deputy Secretary/Under Central Establishment Board (presided over by\nSecretary the Secretary of the Ministry of Personnel).\n\nThe final decision in all the three cases is taken by the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet\nwhich is headed by the Prime Minister.\n\nOffice Staff\n\nIn addition to the officers component, the Secretariat has an office component. The office component\nof Secretariat consists of the following personnel.\n\n\" — Section Officer (Superintendent)\n\n\nAssistant Section Officers\n\"Upper Division Clerks\n\n\" Lower Division Clerks\n\n\"  Steno-typists and Typists\n\"Manual Workers.\n\nA Section Officer is the head of office (or a section) and acts as a link between the Under\nSecretary and the entire staff of the Section. His major job is to supervise the work of staff in his\nsection. He is the first line supervisor in the hierarchy of Secretariat personnel.\n\nThe staff of the office component of Secretariat is drawn from the following two services.\n\n1. The Central Secretariat Stenographers Service, which consists of the five grades, namely (i)\nSenior Principal Private Secretary Grade, (ii) Private Secretary Grade (Principal Private\nSecretary), (iii) Grade A and B (Merged) (Private Secretary), (iv) Grade C (Personal\nAssistant) and Grade D (Stenographer).\n\n2. The Central Secretariat Clerical Service, which consists of the two grades, namely (i) Upper\nDivision Grade (UDC), and (ii) Lower Division Grade (LDC).\n\nThe Department of Personnel and Training of the Ministry of Personnel is the cadre controlling\nauthority in respect of these two services.\n\nSince 1976, the Staff Selection Commission has been organising competitive examinations to\ndirectly recruit lower division clerks. The posts of Upper Division Clerks are filled by indirect\nrecruitment, that is, by promoting Lower Division Clerks. The posts of Assistant Section Officers and\nSection Officers are filled partly by direct recruitment through a competitive examination and partly\nthrough promotion of respective subordinate personnel.\n\nDesk Officer System\n\nIn 1973, the procedure of work in ministries/departments of Central Government was changed due to\nthe introduction of desk officer system. This was done on the recommendation of Deshmukh Study\nTeam of the Administrative Reforms Commission. This system was adopted from the British\nWhitehall system.\n\nIn this innovative system, work of a ministry at the lowest level is organised into distinct functional\ndesks. Each desk is manned by a team of two functionaries—an Under Secretary and a Section\nOfficer, or a Section Officer and an Assistant Section Officer, or two Section Officers. Each\nfunctionary is known as a desk officer and is provided with clerical/stenographic assistance. The\ndesk officer disposes of the cases himself and submits important cases related to policy matters to the\nhigher level for disposal.\n\nThe advantages of desk officer system are:\n\n(i) It facilitates speedy disposal of cases in general, as well as due to level jumping.\n\n(ii) It avoids examination of a case at the clerical level.\n\n(iii) It eliminates dilatoriness in the Secretariat functioning.\n\n(iv) It reduces expenditure.\n\n(v) It makes the work qualitative as the initial examination of cases is done at the officer’s level."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

These executive\norganisations are engaged in the implementation of policies formulated by the Secretariat\norganisation. They work below and under the Secretariat and are headed by an executive head (head\nof the department) known by various designations like Director, Director-General, Controller, Chief-\nController, Inspector-General, Commissioner, Registrar-General, and so on.\n\nTottenham in his Report on the Reorganisation of the Central Government (1945-46) stated: “The\nfunction of the member (minister) is to decide policy, of the Secretary to provide the material on\nwhich to reach such decisions, and of the executive head to carry the decisions into effect. On the\nanalogy of the human machine, the member (minister) would represent the will, the Secretary the\nbrain and the executive head the hands.”\n\nFunctions\n\nThe two popular forms of executive agencies are Attached Office and Subordinate Office. The\nmanual of office procedure defines these offices as follows: “Where the execution of the policies of\nGovernment requires decentralisation of executive direction and the establishment of field agencies, a\nministry has under it subsidiary offices. The Attached Offices are responsible for providing executive\ndirection required in the implementation of policies laid down by the ministry to which they are\nattached. They also serve as repository of technical information and advice to the ministry on\ntechnical aspects of questions dealt with by them The subordinate offices function as field\nestablishments or as agencies responsible for the detailed execution of decisions of government. They\ngenerally function under the direction of an Attached Office, or in cases where the volume of the\nexecution direction involved is not considerable, directly under a ministry.”\n\nHowever, the Tottenham Committee (1945-46) and the First Pay Commission (Vardhachariar—\n1946-47) found the distinction between the Attached Office and the Subordinate Office as\nunsatisfactory and artificial and hence suggested the abolition of distinction between the two\ncategories of offices.\n\nPatterns of Relationship\n\nA proper relationship between secretariat and executive agencies is very essential for the effective\nformulation and implementation of policies and programmes. To smoothen the relationship between\nthese two entities, six principal types of arrangements have been made. These are explained below:\n\n1. Complete Separation Pattern Under this pattern, there is a complete separation between the\nsecretariat and its executive agencies. Both have distinct and separate offices and files of their own.\nThis is the most prevalent pattern and is based on the policy-administration separation (split system),\nstaff-line dichotomy and generalist-specialist dichotomy.\n\n\n2. Complete Merger Pattern Under this pattern, there is a cent-percent merger between the\nsecretariat and its executive agencies. This total integration model is used only in special cases.\n\n3. Link Officer Pattern Under this pattern, a Senior Secretariat Officer is concurrently appointed\nas head of the executive agency. Thus, the link officer will have a dual role, that is, policy\nformulation as well as policy implementation.\n\n4. Ex-Officio Secretariat Status Pattern Under this pattern, the head of the executive agency is\naccorded with an appropriate ex-officio secretariat status. He is given authority to take decisions on\ncertain matters independently. He will have closer involvement in policy-formulation.\n\n5. Common Office Pattern Under this pattern, the secretariat and the executive agency have a\ncommon office, common files, and a common file bureau. This common office serves both, the\nofficers of the secretariat as well as those of the executive agency. The Estimates Committee and the\nSecond Pay Commission recommended this pattern.\n\n6. Common File Pattern Under this system, the Secretariat and the executive agency have separate\noffices but common files and a single file bureau. The Rowlands Committee (Bengal Administration\nEnquiry Committee) of 1944-45 recommended this pattern."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The Cabinet headed by the Prime Minister is responsible for the entire administration of\nthe Government of India (i.e. Central administration). In this task, the Cabinet is assisted by the\nCabinet Secretariat.\n\nThus, the Cabinet Secretariat is a staff agency to the Union Cabinet. It operates under the direction\nand leadership of the Prime Minister of India. It has an important coordinating role in the process of\npolicy-making at the highest level in the Central Government.\n\nThe Cabinet Secretariat enjoys the status of a department of the Government of India under the\nAllocation of Business Rules, 1961. It is headed politically, by the Prime Minister and\nadministratively, by the Cabinet Secretary.\n\nThe Cabinet Secretariat came into existance in 1947 by replacing the Secretariat of the Governor-\nGeneral’s Executive Council.\n\nOrganisation\n\nThe Cabinet Secretariat has three wings—Civil Wing, Military Wing and Intelligence Wing. The civil\nwing is the main wing and provides aid, advise and assistance to the Union Cabinet. The military\nwing provides secretarial assistance to the Defence Committee of the Cabinet, the Military Affairs\nCommittee, the National Defence Council and other committees dealing with defence matters. The\nintelligence wing deals with matters pertaining to the Joint Intelligence Committee of the Union\nCabinet.\n\nBesides the main secretariat, the cabinet secretariat comprises of the following organisations:\n\n(i) Research and Analysis Wing (RAW)\n\n(ii) Director General of Security\n\n(iii) Special Protection Group\n\n(iv) Joint Intelligence Committee\n\n(v) Directorate of Public Grievances\n\nIn 1997, the National Authority, Chemical Weapons Convention was set up by a resolution of the\ncabinet secretariat. It is under the administrative control of the cabinet secretariat.\n\nIn 1988, the Directorate of Public Grievances was set up as an organ of the Cabinet Secretariat. It\nis headed by a Director having the rank of a Secretary to the Government of India.\n\nBelow and under the Cabinet Secretary, there are a large number of other secretaries to assist him\nin the discharge of his functions and responsibilities. These secretaries belong to various ranks\nranging from Secretary to an Under Secretary. In addition, the Cabinet Secretariat has subject related\nadvisors to the Prime Minister.\n\n\nFunctions\n\nThe following functions are performed by the Cabinet Secretariat.\n\n(i) It prepares agenda for meetings of the Cabinet and provides necessary information and\nmaterial for its deliberations.\n\n(ii) It keeps a record of the discussions and decisions of the Cabinet and Cabinet Committees and\ncirculates them to all the concerned ministries.\n\n(iii) It provides secretarial assistance to the Cabinet Committees.\n\n(iv) It keeps the President, Vice-President and all the Central Ministries informed of the main\nactivities of the Central Government.\n\n(v) It prepares and finalises the rules of business of the government and allots the business of the\nGovernment among Ministries/departments of the Union Government with the President’s\napproval.\n\n(vi) It functions as the chief coordinating agency in the Central Government. In this respect, it\nsettles disputes between the ministries.\n\n(vii) It watches the implementation of Cabinet decisions by the concerned ministries/departments\nand other executive agencies.\n\n(viii) It handles the work pertaining to appointment and resignation of ministers, allotment of\nportfolios to the ministers, and organisation and re-organisation of ministries.\n\nRole\n\nThe Cabinet Secretariat is under the direct charge of the Prime Minister. The administrative head\nof the Secretariat is the Cabinet Secretary who is also the ex-officio Chairman of the Civil Services\nBoard.\n\nIn the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961 “Cabinet Secretariat” finds a\nplace in the First Schedule to the Rules. The subjects allotted to this Secretariat are:\n\n(i) Secretarial assistance to Cabinet and Cabinet Committees\n\n(ii) Rules of Business\n\nThe Cabinet Secretariat is responsible for the administration of the Government of India\n(Transaction of Business) Rules, 1961 and the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules\n1961, facilitating smooth transaction of business in Ministries/Departments of the Government by\nensuring adherence to these rules. The Secretariat assists in decision-making in Government by\nensuring inter-ministerial coordination, ironing out differences amongst Ministries/Departments and\nevolving consensus through the instrumentality of the standing/adhoc Committees of Secretaries.\nThrough this mechanism new policy initiatives are also promoted.\n\nThe Cabinet Secretariat ensures that the President, the Vice President and Ministers are kept\ninformed of the major activities of all Ministries/Departments by means of monthly summary of their\nactivities. Management of major crises situations in the country and coordinating activities of various\nministries in such a situation is also one of the functions of the Cabinet Secretariat.\n\nThe secretarial assistance provided by Cabinet Secretariat to the Cabinet and Cabinet Committees\nincludes:\n\n\n(i) Convening of the meetings of the Cabinet on the orders of the Prime Minister.\n\n(ii) Preparation and circulation of the agenda.\n\n(iii) Circulating papers related to the cases on the agenda.\n\n(iv) Preparing a record of discussions taken.\n\n(v) Circulation of the record after obtaining the approval of the Prime Minister.\n\n(vi) Watching implementation of the decisions taken by the Cabinet.\n\nThe Cabinet Secretariat is the custodian of the papers of the Cabinet meetings.\n\nAmong the inter-ministerial matters, coordination is required for:\n\n(i) removing difficulties;\n\n(ii) removing differences;\n\n(iii) overcoming delays;\n\n(iv) coordination in administrative action; and\n\n(v) coordination of policies.\n\nWhile each Ministry is responsible for acting on its own for expeditious implementation of\nGovernment policies, plans and programmes, where inter-ministerial cooperation is involved, they\noften seek the assistance of the Cabinet Secretariat. The inter-ministerial problems are dealt with in\nthe meetings of the Committees of Secretaries (COS). The Committees are constituted for discussing\nspecific matters and proposals emanating from various Secretaries to the Government and meetings\nare held under the chairmanship of the Cabinet Secretary. These committees have been able to break\nbottlenecks or secure mutually supporting inter-ministerial action.\n\nThe discussions of the COS takes place on the basis of a paper formulated by the principal\ndepartment concerned and the department with a different point of view, if any, providing a\nsupplementary note. The decisions or recommendations of the COS are unanimous. These\nproceedings are also circulated to and are followed up by the departments. There are other important\nfunctions which it discharges, viz.,\n\n(i) Monitoring\n(ii) Coordination\n(iii) Promoting new policy initiatives\n\nThe Cabinet Secretariat is seen as a useful mechanism by the departments for promoting inter-\nministerial coordination since the Cabinet Secretary is also the head of the civil services. The\nSecretaries feel it necessary to keep the Cabinet Secretary informed of developments from time to\ntime. The Transaction of Business Rules also requires them to keep the Cabinet Secretary informed of\ndevelopments from time to time, specially if there are any departures from these rules.\n\nCabinet Secretary\n\nThe office of Cabinet Secretary was created in India in 1950. Its first occupant was N.R. Pillai.\n\nA Cabinet Secretary is the head of the Cabinet Secretariat. He succeeded the Secretary to the\nGovernor-General’s Executive Council.\n\nHe is given a top place among the civil servants in the official warrant of precedence. Thus, he is\nthe senior most civil servant in India. Such a status to a Cabinet Secretary was recommended by the\n\n\nGopalaswamy Ayyangar Report on Reorganisation of the Machinery of Government (1949).\nHowever, his tenure of office is not fixed.\nThe following points highlight the role, powers and functions of a Cabinet Secretary.\n(i) He is the chief coordinator of Central administration. But, he has no supervisory function over\nministries/departments.\n(ii) He is a Chairman of the Senior Selection Board which selects officers for the post of Joint\nSecretary in the Central Secretariat.\n(iii) He himself selects the officers for the posts of Secretary and Additional Secretary in the\nCentral Secretariat.\n(iv) He is the Chairman of the Committee of Secretaries on Administration which is set up to\nresolve inter-ministerial disputes.\n(v) He presides over the Conference of Chief Secretaries which is held annually.\n(vi) He acts as a chief advisor to the Prime Minister on all aspects of administration and policy.\n(vii) His sanction should be obtained by a minister before launching prosecution against the\npublisher or editor of newspaper in cases of defamation.\n(viii) He serves on occasions as a factotum when the Prime Minister deems necessary and calls him\nto be so.\n(ix) He acts as an advisor and conscience-keeper to all the civil servants. He advises and guides\nthem on cases of inter-departmental difficulties.\n(x) He acts as a link between the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) and various administrative\nagencies and also between the civil service and the political system.\n\nOn the role of a Cabinet Secretary, S.S. Khera, a former Cabinet Secretary, in his book, The\nCentral Executive, observed that, “The Cabinet Secretary provides the eyes and ears for the Prime\nMinister to keep in touch with the process of official business in the Central Government. But he is in\nno sense a watchdog or an invigilator on behalf of the Prime Minister... A Cabinet Secretary’s is a\nvery general staff function, not a line function in relation to the ministries. His business is to help, not\nto oversee.”"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

In the fulfilment of his\nonerous responsibilities, the Prime Minister is assisted by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).\n\nThus, the PMO is a staff agency meant for providing secretarial assistance and crucial advice to the\nPrime Minister. It plays an important role in the process of decision-making at the top level in the\nGovernment of India. However, it is an extra-constitutional body.\n\nThe PMO enjoys the status of a department of the Government of India under the Allocation of\nBusiness Rules, 1961. It has no attached and subordinate office under it.\n\nThe PMO came into existence in 1947 by replacing the Secretary to the Governor-General\n\n\n(Personal). Till June 1977, it was called as the Prime Minister’s Secretariat (PMS).\n\nComposition\n\nThe PMO is headed politically, by the Prime Minister and administratively, by the Principal\nSecretary.\n\nAdditionally, it consists of one or two additional secretaries, three to five joint secretaries and a\nnumber of directors/deputy secretaries and under-secretaries. There are also other officers like\nprivate secretaries, officer on special duty (OSD), Social Secretary, Research Officer, Hindi Officer\nand so on. These officers are supported by the regular office establishment consisting of section\nofficers, UDCs, LDCs, stenographers and so forth.\n\nThese personnel are generally drawn from the Civil Service and posted for varying periods. Their\nstatus is equivalent to the status of officers of different ministries/departments in the Central\nGovernment.\n\nThe Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, as the administrative head of the PMO, plays an\nimportant role and performs the following functions:\n\n(i) Deals with all governmental files in the office.\n\n(ii) Puts before the Prime Minister all important documents for orders and instructions.\n\n(iii) Prepares notes on matters to be discussed by the Prime Minister with important dignitaries.\n\n(iv) Looks after the affairs of different ministries and departments which are handed over by the\n\nPrime Minister.\n(v) Coordinates the activities of various personnel in the office.\n(vi) Tenders advice to the Prime Minister on various foreign and domestic matters.\n\nFunctions\n\nThe PMO performs several functions:\n\n(i) Assisting the Prime Minister in respect of his overall responsibilities as head of the\ngovernment like maintaining liaison with central ministries/departments and the state\ngovernments.\n\n(ii) Helping the Prime Minister in respect of his reponsibilites as chairman of the Planning\nCommission, and the National Development Council.\n\n(iii) Looking after the public relations of the Prime Minister like contact with the press and general\npublic.\n\n(iv) Dealing with all references which under the Rules of Business have to come to the Prime\nMinister.\n\n(v) Providing assistance to the Prime Minister in the examination of cases submitted to him for\norders under prescribed rules.\n\n(vi) Maintaining liaison with the President, Governors, and Foreign Representatives in the\ncountry.\n\n(vii) Acting as the ‘think-tank’ of the Prime Minister.\n\nTwo more things should be noted with regard to the functions of PMO. One, it acts as the residual\n\n\nlegatee of the Central Government, that is, it deals with all such subjects which are not alloted to any\nministry/department. Two, it is not concerned with the responsibilities of Prime Minister as the\nchairman of the Union Cabinet. The cabinet cases are directly dealt by the Cabinet Secretariat, which\nalso functions under the direction of the Prime Minister.\n\nChanging Role\n\nThe role of PMO varied from Prime Minister to Prime Minister. Over the years, it has grown very big\nand powerful and started functioning on a scale that was not anticipated at the time of its inception in\n1947.\n\nDuring the prime ministership of Jawaharlal Nehru, the PMO was small in the size and played a\nlimited role, but Lal Bahadur Shastri, who succeeded Nehru, strengthened the PMO and made it a\npowerful organ. The same trend was continued by Indira Gandhi also. In 1977, the Janata Government\ntook measures to de-emphasise its dominant role, including the change of its nomenclature (i.e., from\nPrime Minister’s secretariat to Prime Minister’s Office). However, when Indira Gandhi returned to\npower after the collapse of the short-lived Janata Government, she again strengthened the PMO. This\ntrend continued during Rajiv Gandhi’s time and continues till today.\n\nAt present, the PMO has over 350 people under its roof. This large establishment runs a ‘parallel’\nadministration, that is, every ministry/department of the Central Government is duplicated here. This\ntrend has damaged the prestige of ministers and the authority of departmental bureaucracy.\n\nThus, the PMO emerged as a rival centre of power at the official level and to that extent the\n‘legitimate’ role, significance, authority and position of the Cabinet Secretariat and Cabinet Secretary\nin the Indian Cabinet System of government have gone down. As rightly said by Ajay K. Mehra,\n“Constitutional practice recognises the Cabinet Secretariat, not the PMO, as the supporting institution\nfor the apex executive body. The controversy over the PMO, therefore, is not merely with regard to\nits enjoying power disproportionate to its political location, the issue is that it has completely\neclipsed the Cabinet Secretariat.”\n\nTherefore, the critics have described the PMO variously as ‘Super Cabinet’, ‘Micro Cabinet’,\n“Super Ministry’, Super Secretariat’, ‘Supra-authority’, ‘the Government of India’, ‘the Government\nof the Government of India’ and so on."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Besides, there\nare various other forms viz. Commissions, Control Boards, Cooperative Societies, Public Trusts, and\nCommodity Boards.\n\nDepartmental Undertaking\n\nIt is the traditional and the oldest form of public enterprise. The Railways and the Posts and\nTelegraphs are the two major departmental undertakings. Besides, All-India Radio, Doordarshan,\n\n\nDefence Production Units, Atomic Power Projects, Government Printing Press are also organised as\ndepartmental undertakings. This pattern is usually used when the principle objective of an enterprise\nis to provide revenue.\n\nThe characteristics of a departmental undertaking form of organisation are:\n\n(i) Its aggregate investment is wholly made by the Government. A private party is debarred from\ninvesting in it.\n\n(ii) It is financed by annual appropriations from the treasury. Also, all its revenues or a major part\nof it are paid into the treasury.\n\n(iii) It is subject to budget, accounting and audit controls, which are applicable to other\ngovernment departments.\n\n(iv) Its parmanent staff consists of civil servants. Also, their methods of recruitment and service\nconditions are ordinarily the same as other civil servants (i.e. government staff).\n\n(v) Itis generally organised as a major sub-division of one of the departments of the Government\nand is subject to direct control of the head of the department.\n\n(vi) It possesses sovereign immunity of the state and cannot be sued without the consent of the\ngovernment.\n\n(vii) Itis accountable to the Parliament through the concerned minister.\n\n(viii) It is created by an executive resolution, prior approval of the Parliament is not required to\ncreate it.\n\nThe advantages of a departmental undertaking form of organisation are:\n\n(i) It provides for a maximum degree of control by a minister who is politically responsible to\nthe Parliament.\n\n(ii) It facilitates a clear relationship with other parts of the governmental structure.\n\n(iii) It enables the Government to have better control over its funds. Thus it prevents the public\nmoney from being misappropriated and misused.\n\n(iv) It is a well-known form of organisation, having fixed rules and standard patterns.\n\n(v) It is most suitable for those enterprises which are set up for special reasons like defence,\nstrategic importance, national security, economic control, financial control, safeguarding\npublic interest, and so on.\n\nThe disadvantages of a departmental undertaking form of organisation are:\n\n(i) It directly negates the requirements of autonomy due to excessive control.\n\n(ii) It militates against initiative and flexibility of the enterprise.\n\n(iii) It leads to rigid financial and budgetary control.\n\n(iv) It has rigidity of rules and regulations and red tape leading to delays.\n\n(v) It does not facilitate sufficient delegation of authority due to over centralisation.\n\nTherefore, this form of organisation is not used for economic and financial enterprises in recent\ntimes because of its inherent characteristics of rigidity and delays.\n\nPublic Corporation\n\n\nA public corporation as a form of public enterprise developed in the second half of 20th century.\nW.A. Robson said, “Public Corporation is the most important invention of the twentieth century in the\nsphere of government institutions.”\n\nSome important public corporations of Central Government are:\n\n(i) Reserve Bank of India (1935)\n\n(ii) Damodar Valley Corporation (1948)\n\n(iii) Industrial Finance Corporation of India (1948)\n\n(iv) Indian Airlines Corporation (1953)\n\n(v) Air India International (1953)\n\n(vi) State Bank of India (1955)\n\n(vii) Life Insurance Corporation of India (1956)\n(viii) Central Warehousing Corporation (1957)\n\n(ix) Oil and Natural Gas Commission (1959)\n\n(x) Food Corporation of India (1964)\n\nSome important public corporations of state governments are:\n(i) State Road Transport Corporations\n\n(ii) State Financial Corporations\n\n(iii) State Electricity Boards\n\n(iv) State Land Mortgage Banks\n\nThe characteristics of a public corporation form of organisation are:\n\n(i) It is wholly owned by state, that is, its entire capital is provided by the government.\n\n(ii) It is created by (or pursuant to) a special law of legislature (either Central or state). This\nspecial statute defines its objectives, powers, duties and privileges and also prescribes the\nform of management and its relationship to the government departments.\n\n(iii) It (as a corporate body) has a separate entity for legal purposes and can sue and be sued, enter\ninto contracts and acquire property in its name.\n\n(iv) It is usually independently financed except for appropriations to provide capital or to cover\nlosses. It obtains its funds from borrowing (either from the treasury or the public) and from\nrevenues derived from the sale of its goods and services. It is authorised to use and reuse its\nrevenues.\n\n(v) It is generally exempted from most regulatory and prohibitory statutes applicable to the\nexpenditure of public funds.\n\n(vi) It is ordinarily not subject to budget, accounting and audit laws and procedures which are\napplicable to non-corporate agencies (government departments).\n\n(vii) Its employees (in the majority of cases) are not civil servants and are recruited and\nremunerated under terms and conditions which are determined by the corporation itself.\n\n(viii) It enjoys functional autonomy and is not subject to direct control of the head of the department\n(the minister) in its normal operations. Except for the formal policy directions issued to it by a\nminister, it is guided (in its functioning) by the statute which created it. It is managed by a\nBoard of Directors appointed by the Government. One of the directors is appointed as the\n\n\nChairman of the Board.\n\nThe advantages of a public corporation form of organisation are:\n\n(i) It facilitates autonomy in its day-to-day administration\n\n(ii) It provides freedom from political influences and partisan considerations.\n\n(iii) It provides for a healthy synthesis of commercial efficiency of a private enterprise with public\naccountability of a government department.\n\n(iv) It provides freedom from unsuitable rules, regulations and controls of the government.\n\n(v) It facilitates a high degree of financial flexibility and personnel autonomy.\n\n(vi) It is a valuable instrument for social control of economic life.\n\nThe disadvantages of a public corporation form of organisation are:\n\n(i) It is inherently rigid and ill-suited to meet the requirements of changing times. This means that\na change in its structure or procedure or other aspects can be effected only by a statutory\n\namendment (by the legislature).\n\n(ii) It gives rise to the problems of reconciling administrative autonomy with public\naccountability.\n\n(iii) It does not facilitate clear distinction between the “matters of policy” and “matters of day-to-\nday administration.”\n\n(iv) It places significant political power in the hands of a small unrepresentative, and in extreme\ncases, a self-perpetuating group which controls and manages it.\n\n(v) It, in practice, does not facilitate flexibility and autonomy in both financial and administrative\naspects. The ministries look upon the corporations as their wings or branches and issue orders\nand directions in a similar way.\n\nGovernment Company\n\nA government company is the most popular and extensively used form of organisation for management\nof public enterprises (both industrial as well as commercial) in India. It is registered under the Indian\nCompanies Act of 1956. This Act defines a government company as one in which not less than 51%\nof the share capital is held either by the Central Government or the state government(s) or partly by\nthe Central Government and partly by the state government(s). A government company can be wholly\nowned by the Government (i.e. the total share capital is invested by the Government) or can be\npartially owned by the Government (i.e. 51 per cent of the share capital is invested by the\nGovernment and the remaining capital furnished by private enterprises). Thus, the latter type of\ngovernment company is also known as a mixed-ownership company as it comprises a joint enterprise\nin which the share capital is shared between the Government and the private interests, which can be\neither national or foreign. By acquiring 51 per cent or above of the share capital, the Government\nbecomes the de facto (real) controller of the affairs of the mixed ownership company. This is why it\nis called a government company.\n\nThe Indian Companies Act of 1956 recognises two forms of companies—private limited company\nand public limited company. The differences between these two forms are mentioned below in Table\n3.2.\n\n\nO(a Private Limited vs Public Limited Companies\n\nPrivate Limited Company Public Limited Company\n\n1. Its formation requires a minimum of two 1. _ Its formation requires a minimum of seven\nshareholders. shareholders.\n\n2. Its shareholder’s right to transfer his shares 2. Its shareholder’s right to transfer his shares\nis restricted. is not restricted.\n\n3. Its maximum number of shareholders cannot 3. Its maximum number of shareholders is not\nbe more than fifty. restricted.\n\nThe above points of distinction makes it very clear that a private limited company is more suitable\nthan the public limited company for organising a public enterprise. Hence, the governments in India\nhave preferred the private limited company.\n\nSome important Government companies are:\n\n(i) Bharat Heavy Electricals (Private) Limited\n(ii) Hindustan Antibiotics Limited\n(iii) Bharat Electronics (Private) Limited\n(iv) Rashtriya Fertilizers and Chemicals (Private) Limited\n(v) Hindustan Machine Tools (Private) Limited\n(vi) Hindustan Cable (Private) Limited\n(vii) Hindustan Housing Factory (Private) Limited\n(viii) Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited\n(ix) Hindustan Insecticides (Private) Limited\n(x) Shipping Corporation of India Limited\n(xi) Hindustan Shipyard Limited\n(xii) Maruti Udyog Limited\n(xiii) Indian Telephone Industries Limited\n(xiv) National Coal Development Corporation\n(xv) Heavy Engineering Corporation\n(xvi) India Tourism Development Corporation\n(xvii) Indian Oil Corporation\nIt should be noted here that some of the Government companies use the word ‘corporation,’ but\nthey are actually organised as Government companies. For example, Fertilizer Corporation of India,\nIndian Oil Corporation.\nThe characteristics of a Government company form of organisation are:\n(i) It has most of the features of a private limited company.\n(ii) It is either wholly owned by the government or 51 per cent (or above) of the capital stock is\nowned by the Government.\n(iii) It is created by an executive resolution under the general law, that is, the Indian Companies\nAct of 1956. The executive need not seek the approval of legislature.\n(iv) It is a body corporate and has a separate entity for legal purposes and can sue and be sued,\n\n\nenter into contracts and acquire property in its name.\n\n(v) Its Articles of Association (which lays down the rules of internal management) are drawn up\nand revisable by the Government.\n\n(vi) Its funds are obtained from the Government and, in some cases, from private shareholders,\nand through revenues derived from the sale of its goods and services.\n\n(vii) It is ordinarily not subject to budget, accounting and audit laws and procedures which are\napplicable to Government departments.\n\n(viii) Its employees (excluding the deputationists) are not civil servants and are recruited and\nremunerated under terms and conditions which are determined by the company itself.\n\n(ix) All the directors or a majority of them are appointed by the Government depending upon the\nextent to which private capital is participating in the enterprises.\n\nThe advantages of a government company form of organisation or the reasons for its popularity in\n\nIndia are:\n\n(i) It facilitates ease and convenience in forming an enterprise. This is so because it can be\ncreated by an executive decision without Parliamentary approval. This is the principal reason\nfor its popularity.\n\n(ii) It provides for sufficient government control.\n\n(iii) It enables association with private enterprise.\n\n(iv) It facilitates autonomy in day-to-day administration.\n\n(v) It provides for a high degree of financial flexibility and personnel autonomy.\n\n(vi) It provides for easy expansion and extension.\n\nThe disadvantages of a government company form of organisation are:\n\n(i) It evades constitutional responsibilities which a state-controlled enterprise has in a\ndemocratic society towards the government and to the Parliament. This is the reason why it\nwas described by a former Comptroller and Auditor General of India as “a fraud on the\nCompany’s Act and on the Constitution of India.” Lanka Sundaram described it as “an\nimperium in imperio” (a small kingdom within a kingdom).\n\n(ii) The use of the company form and of the law regulating commercial companies, usually\nbecomes a mere fiction because all or most of the functions normally vested in the\nshareholders and in the management, are reserved to the government by the statute setting up\nthe company.\n\n(iii) It, in practice, does not facilitate flexibility and autonomy in both financial and administrative\naspects. The Estimates Committee of Lok Sabha said, “the companies are more or less\nextensions of departments ... and are run almost on the same pattern, with minor changes here\nand there.”\n\nThe question of suitability of the forms of public enterprise was examined by various committees\nand commissions. The following points can be noted in this regard.\n\n(i) A.D. Gorwala in his Report on the Efficient Conduct of State Enterprises (1951) considered\ngovernment company form superior to public corporation form because of its flexibility.\n\n(ii) The First Five-Year Plan document supported the adoption of Government Company form.\n(iii) The Estimates Committee of Lok Sabha (1960) recommended in favour of public corporation\n\n\nform for organising public enterprises.\n\n(iv) The Krishna Menon Committee suggested the adoption of public corporation form.\n\n(v) The Administrative Reforms Commission favoured the adoption of public corporation form in\ngeneral in organising public enterprises.\n\nHolding Company\n\nA holding company form of organisation involves integration of all the companies which are\noperating in the same field or which have strong technical and commercial affinities with each other\nunder a common management. Thus, such companies called as subsidiaries are brought under the\ncommon management of a holding company. A holding company is one which has acquired a majority\nshare in the ownership capital and which, by virtue of its share ownership, is able to control the\nmanagement of subsidiary companies. Some examples of holding companies are:\n\n(i) Steel Authority of India Limited (1973)\n\n(ii) Coal Authority of India Limited\n\n(iii) Ashoka Group of Hotels\n\n(iv) State Trading Corporation of India\n\n(v) General Insurance Corporation of India\n\n(vi) Gas Authority of India Limited\n\nA ‘sector corporation’ form of organisation recommended in 1967 by the Administrative Reforms\nCommission is similar to the holding company form of organisations. In 1986, the Arjun Sengupta\nCommittee recommended the establishment of holding companies or sector corporations in main\nareas of the economy.\n\nOther Forms\n\nIn addition to the above mentioned four major forms, there are other forms of public enterprises. They\nare:\n\nControl Board These are established for the management of multi-purpose river valley projects.\nThey are created by an executive resolution of either Central Government or a state government.\nThere are various control boards in the country like Nagarjunsagar Control Board, Kosi Control\nBoard, Bhakra—Beas Management Board and so on.\n\nPublic Trust These are established for managing service enterprises or for regulating those\nactivities which affect the society in general. They are created by special acts of Parliament. The\nexamples of such enterprises are Port Trusts, Unit Trust of India and so on.\n\nCommission These are established to undertake development work in their fields. They are created\nby special acts of Parliament. The examples of such enterprises are Tariff Commission, Khadi and\nVillage Industries Commission, Forward Markets Commission and so on.\n\nCommodity Board These are established to promote industrial development. They are created by\nspecial acts of Parliament. The examples of such enterprises are Small-Scale Industries Board,\n\n\nCoffee Board, Rubber Board, and so on.\n\nCooperative Society These are established to undertake developmental and promotional activities.\nThey are registered under the Societies Registration Act. The examples of such enterprises are Indian\nNational Research Development Corporation, Trade Fair Authority of India, Indian Dairy\nDevelopment Corporation."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Translate the following text into Hindi accurately, preserving the original meaning and context."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Position\n\nThe office of a Chief Secretary had its origin in the Central Government during the British rule. It was\ncreated in 1799 by Lord Wellesly, the then Governer-General of India. G.H. Barlow was the first\noccupant of this office. However, in course of time, this office disappeared from the Central\nGovernment and was adopted by state governments much before the attainment of Independence.\n\nThe Chief Secretary is the executive head of the State Secretariat. He is the administrative head of\nthe state administration and stands at the apex of the state administrative hierarchy. His position vis-\na-vis other secretaries is more than primus inter pares (first among equals). He is, in fact, chief of\nthe secretaries and his control extends to all the Secretariat departments. He leads, guides and\ncontrols the entire state administration. He holds a pivotal, pre-eminent and coveted position and\nassumes different roles in the administrative system of the state.\n\nSince 1973, a Chief Secretary is the senior-most civil servant in all the states. Before that, for\ninstance, he was considered junior to the Financial Commissioner in Punjab and members of the\nBoard of Revenue in UP. In Tamil Nadu, on the other hand, he was the senior-most civil servant.\nHowever, this office was standardised in 1973 on the recommendation of the Administrative Reforms\nCommission of India, and this post was equated with that of the Secretary to the Government of India,\nboth in status and emoluments.\n\nThe chief secretary is chosen by the Chief Minister from the senior IAS officers of the state cadre.\nGenerally, the Chief Minister takes into account three factors in this regard: seniority of the officer;\nservice record, performance and merit of the officer; and his trust and confidence in the officer.\n\nFurther, the office of Chief Secretary has been excluded from the operation of the tenure system. In\nother words, there is no fixed tenure for this post.\n\nPowers and Functions\n\nThe powers and functions of the Chief Secretary are mentioned in the ‘Rules of Business’ framed by a\nstate government. He also derives some of his powers and functions from conventions. These are\nexplained below.\n\nAs an Advisor to the Chief Minister The Chief Secretary acts as the principal advisor to the Chief\n\n\nMinister on all matters of state administration. The Chief Minister consults the Chief Secretary on all\n\npolicy issues related to the governance of state. He explains to the Chief Minister about the\nadministrative implications of the proposals forwarded by the state ministers. He also acts as a link\nbetween the Chief Minister and other secretaries of the state government.\n\nAs Secretary to the Cabinet The Chief Secretary acts as a Secretary to the State Cabinet. He is the\nadministrative head of the Cabinet Secretariat and attends the meeting of the Cabinet and its sub-\ncommittee, if necessary. He prepares the agenda for Cabinet meetings and keeps records of its\nproceedings. He takes steps for the implementation of the decision taken in such meetings.\n\nAs the Head of Civil Service The Chief Secretary acts as the head of the state civil service. He\ndeals with all cases related to appointment, transfers and promotion of senior state civil servants. He\nplays an important role in maintaining the morale of the state civil service. He is the conscience-\nkeeper to all state civil servants.\n\nAs Chief Coordinator The Chief Secretary is the chief-coordinator of state administration. At the\nsecretarial level, he works towards ensuring inter-departmental coordination. He advises the\nsecretaries on inter-departments difficulties. He is the Chairman of coordination committees set up\nfor resolving inter-departmental disputes. He presides over the meetings of the departments’\nsecretaries. Below the Secretariat level, he presides over the conferences attended by Divisional\nCommissioners, District Collectors and the heads of departments of district administration to effect\ncoordination.\n\nAs the Head of Certain Departments The Chief Secretary also acts as the administrative head of\nsome Secretariat departments. However, there is no uniformity throughout the country in this regard\nand his position varies from state to state. In most cases the General Administration Department,\nPersonnel Department, Planning Department and Administrative Reforms Department are directly\nunder the charge of the Chief Secretary. The General Administration Department is the most important\ndepartment in the State Secretariat and its political head is the Chief Minister himself. It is concerned\nwith various matters affecting the entire business of the state government.\n\nAs Crisis Administrator In times of crisis like flood, drought, communal disturbances, and other,\nthe Chief Secretary plays a very significant role. He provides guidance and leads the officers and\nagencies engaged in relief operations. He is generally a chairman or an important member of\ncommittees set up to take high level policy decisions during a crisis situation. In fact, he acts as the\ncrisis administrator-in-chief and virtually represents the state government for all the officers\nconcerned with relief operations.\n\nOther Functions and Roles The Chief Secretary also performs the following functions and roles.\n\n(a) He acts as the residual legatee, that is, he looks after all those matters which do not fall\nwithin the purview of other secretaries.\n\n(b) He acts as the secretary, by rotation, of the Zonal Council of which the state concerned is a\nmember.\n\n(c) He exercises general supervision and control over the entire State Secretariat.\n\n(d) He has administrative control over the Secretariat building, the staff attached to the ministers,\nthe central record branch, the Secretariat library, the conservancy and watch and ward staff of\nthe Secretariat departments.\n\n\n(e) He is the principal channel of communication between his government and the Central\nGovernment and other state governments.\n\n(f) He plays a significant role in the administration of law and order and planning.\n\n(g) He attends the annually held chief secretaries conference presided over by the cabinet\nsecretary of the Union Government.\n\n(h) He acts as a spokesman of the state government.\n\n(i) He acts as the chief advisor to the Governor when President’s rule is imposed in the state, and\nif the Central advisors are not appointed.\n\n(j) He attends the meetings of the National Development Council.\n\n(k) He acts as the chief public relations officer of the state government.\n\nChief Secretary Vs. Cabinet Secretary\n\nThere is no office in the Union Government which can be equated to that of Chief Secretary in the\nstate. To some extent, the Cabinet Secretary, at the Central level can be called as the counterpart of\nchief secretary. However the functions performed and the roles assumed by the chief secretary in the\nstate administration are so vast, varied and wide that they are shared at the central level, by the\nCabinet Secretary, the Personnel Secretary, the Home Secretary and the Finance Secretary.\n\nThe similarities between the Chief Secretary and the Cabinet Secretary are:\n\n(i) Both are chief advisors to their respective chief executives.\n\n(ii) Both are chief coordinators of their respective administrations.\n(iii) Both are secretaries to their respective cabinets.\n(iv) Both are administrative heads of their respective cabinet secretariats.\n\n(v) Both the offices originated at the Central level.\n\n(vi) Both supervise the implementation of the decisions of their respective cabinets.\n(vii) Both are heads of their respective civil services.\n\nThe differences between the Chief Secretary and the Cabinet Secretary are:\n\n(i) The powers and functions of Chief Secretary are much more than that of the Cabinet Secretary.\n(ii) The Chief Secretary is the administrative head of the State Secretariat, while the Cabinet\nSecretary is not the administrative head of the Central Secretariat.\n\n(iii) The Chief Secretary is the chief of state secretaries, while the Cabinet Secretary is not the\nchief of Central secretaries but only primus inter pares (first among equals).\n\n(iv) The Chief Secretary is the Residual Legatee at the state level, while the Cabinet Secretary is\nnot the Residual Legatee at the Central level. This function at the Central level is performed\nby the Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister who is the administrative head of the PMO.\n\n(v) Some departments of the State Secretariat are directly under the charge of chief secretary\nwhile no department of the Central Secretariat is under the direct charge of the Cabinet\nSecretary except, of course, the Cabinet Secretariat."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The office of a\nDistrict Collector is called as the Collectorate.\n\nA District Collector is the head of district administration and the official agent of the state\ngovernment in the district. The office of a District Collector is a unique as it has no parallels in the\nadministrative systems of other countries except the office of Prefect in France. In France, the Prefect\nis the head of the department (i.e. the largest territorial unit of administration in France) and an\nofficial agent of the Central Government. The office of Prefect is called as the Prefectorate. Hence the\nFrench Prefect is considered as the nearest analogue of the District Collector in India.\n\nThe Revenue and General Administration Department and the Registration Department of the\ndistrict administration are directly under the charge of District Collector. But his control, supervision\nand influence extend to all the other departments of district administration. He is a multi-purpose\nfunctionary around whom revolves the entire administration of the district.\n\nThe District Collector belongs to the General Administration Department of the state government\n(i.e. the State Secretariat) which is headed politically by the Chief Minister and administratively by\nthe Chief Secretary. The collector is controlled and supervised by Divisional Commissioner. The\nplace of Collector in the administrative system of a state can be illustrated by the following diagram.\n\nState Government Chief Minister\n\nrt 1\n\nState Secretariat Chief Secretary\n\n1 J\n\nDivision Divisional Commissioner\n1 1\n\nDistrict District Collector\n\nEvolution\n\nDistrict is the basic geographical (i.e. territorial) unit of administration in India. The term ‘District’ is\ndefined by the Oxford Dictionary as “‘a territory marked off for special administrative purposes.”\n\n\nOriginally, the Constitution of India made no mention of the term ‘district’ except in Article 233,\nwhich mentioned the term ‘district judges.’ But the 73rd and 74th Amendment Acts of 1992 included\nthe term district in the constitution at many places under Part IX and [XA which dealt with Panchayats\nand municipalities respectively.\n\n“District Administration,” in the words of S.S. Khera, “is the total management of public affairs\nwithin this unit.... District Administration is that portion of public administration which functions\nwithin the territorial limits of a district.”\n\nDistrict as a territorial unit of administration in India has a long history beginning with the Mauryan\nEra. During the Mughal rule, a district was called Sarkar and it was headed by Karori-Faujdar, a\nmilitary officer who functioned under the direct control of a Subedar.\n\nThe present day district administration and the office of District Collector came into existance in\nIndia under the British East India Company. This office was created in 1772 by Warren Hastings, the\nthan Governor-General of India. In 1787, the Collector was made responsible for civil justice and\nmagistracy in addition to revenue collection. He was a very powerful functionary and was described\nas a ‘Little Napoleon’.\n\nThe Indian Statutory Commission (the Simon Commission-1930) remarked that the district\ncollector “is in the eyes of most of its inhabitants, the government” while Ramsay MacDonald\ncompared the District Collector to a tortoise on whose back stood the elephant of the Government of\nIndia. Lord Wavel said that the English would be remembered not by this institution or that, but by the\nideals left behind in the form of the office of the District Collector.\n\nAfter Independence, the office of District Collector suffered in terms of status and authority due to\nthe following factors.\n\n(i) Expansion in the sphere of governmental activities and functions due to the replacement of\n‘police state’ by ‘welfare state’.\n(ii) Change in the form of government, that is, adoption of parliamentary government both at the\nCentre and in states.\n(iii) Change in the ends and objectives of the government, that is, welfare-orientation replaced\ncolonial exploitation.\n(iv) The emergence of Panchayati Raj as a unit of local administration.\n(v) Separation of judiciary from the executive.\n(vi) Increasing political consciousness among people.\n(vii) The emergence and growth of a large number of departments in the district.\n(viii) Replacement of ICS by IAS.\n(ix) Role and influence of pressure groups and political parties.\n(x) Rise of Commissionerate system of law and order administration in big cities.\n\nRole and Functions\n\nThe role played and the functions performed by the District Collector in district administration can be\nstudied under the following heads.\n\nRevenue Administration Historically, collection of revenue has been the first charge (function) of\nthe District Collector as the very title Collector signifies. He is still the head of revenue\nadministration in the district. He is responsible for the collection of revenue to the state government\nthrough the Board of Revenue or Revenue Tribunal in Maharashtra and Gujarat or Financial\n\n\nCommissioner in Punjab, Haryana and Jammu & Kashmir. As the head of revenue administration in\ndistrict, the Collector is responsible for the following functions.\n\n(i) To collect land revenue.\n(ii) To collect other government dues.\n(iii) To distribute and recover taccavi loans.\n(iv) To maintain land records.\n(v) To collect rural statistics.\n(vi) To exercise the power of land acquisition officer, that is, acquiring land for the purpose of\ncolonisation, industry, slum clearance, capital construction and so on.\n(vii) To implement land reforms.\n(viii) To look after the welfare of the agriculturists.\n(ix) To make an assessment of losses of crops and recommend relief during natural calamities like\nfire, drought and flood.\n(x) To supervise treasury and sub-treasury.\n(ix) To enforce Stamp Act.\n(xii) To pay rehabilitation grant.\n(xiii) To manage government estates.\n(xiv) To hear revenue appeals against the orders of lower authorities.\n(xv) To pay Zamindari abolition compensation.\n\nLaw and Order Administration The maintenance of law and order in district is the principal duty\nof the District Collector. Before Independence, the District Collector acted as both, the Executive\nMagistrate and the Judicial Magistrate. As an Executive Magistrate, he was responsible for the\nmaintenance of law and order and as a Judicial Magistrate, he was responsible for the trial of\ncriminal and civil cases by interpreting the laws. After Independence, the judiciary has been\nseparated from the executive in accordance with Article 50 of the Directive Principles of State Policy\nof the Indian Constitution. As a consequence, the role of Collector as a judicial magistrate came to an\nend. This function has been handed over to a new functionary called the district judge who works\nunder the direct control of the State High Court.\n\nThe District Collector in his capacity as the district magistrate (i.e. executive magistrate) is\nultimately responsible for the maintenance of law and order in the district. For this purpose, the\ndistrict police force headed by the District Superintendent of Police is kept under the control,\nsupervision and direction of the district magistrate. The Indian Police Act of 1861 vests the police\nadminstration of the district in the District Superintendent of Police under the control of the district\nmagistrate. Thus there is a system of dual control of law and order administration in the district, that\nis, control by the district magistrate and control by the departmental line headed by the Director-\nGeneral of Police.\n\nThe District Collector in his capacity as the district magistrate performs the following functions.\n\n(i) To control and supervise the subordinate magistracy.\n(ii) To issue orders when there is threat to public peace and order under section 144 of the\nCriminal Procedure Code.\n(iii) To dispose all the petitions received from the government and others.\n(iv) To release prisoners on parole.\n(v) To inspect the jails.\n(vi) To submit an annual criminal report to the government.\n\n\n(vii) To grant, suspend or cancel many kinds of licenses like arms, hotel, explosives, petroleum\nand others.\n(viii) To grant superior classes to prisoners.\n(ix) To supervise and control local bodies.\n(x) To control and direct the action of district police.\n(xi) To enforce Entertainment Tax Act, and Press Act.\n(xii) To call the armed forces to aid and assist the civil administration to deal with any abnormal\nsituation in the district.\n(xiii) To prosecute offenders under the Factories Act and Trademark Act.\n(xiv) To order disposal of unclaimed property.\n(xv) To recommend schemes for the development of forests.\n\nDevelopment Administration Before Independence, the developmental role of a Collector was, not\nthat important as British India was a ‘police state’ concerned mainly with the regulatory\nadministration. After Independence and with the initiation of development planning strategy, the\ndevelopmental role of a Collector became significant. He has become a pivotal figure in the\nimplementation of development programmes. However, the position in this regard is not same in all\nthe states. Broadly, there have emerged two distinct patterns of development administration in the\ndistrict. One is the Tamilnadu, Rajasthan and other states’ pattern and the other is the Maharashtra and\nGujarat Pattern.\n\nIn the first pattern the Collector is made responsible both for regulatory and development\nadministration. As such, he looks after revenue, magisterial and developmental activities in these\nstates. All the district level officers engaged in the implementation of development programmes\nfunction under the supervision, guidance and leadership of the Collector. Even though, in technical\nmatters they function under the control and supervision of their respective departments, in the actual\nimplementation of their development programmes they are placed under the administrative control of\nthe District Collector. In many states, the Collector is also designated as the District Development\nOfficer and is authorised to write the Annual Confidential Report of the District level officers\nengaged in the development administration.\n\nIn the second pattern found in Maharashtra and Gujarat, the Collector is made responsible only for\nregulatory administration. The development administration in these states is made the responsibility\nof the Zila Parishad. All the District level officers engaged in the implementation of development\nprogrammes function under the administrative control and supervision of the Zila Parishad. For this\npourpose, the Zila Parishad has appointed the District Development Officer (or chief executive\nofficer) who also belongs to the IAS. By this arrangement, the Collector is relieved of his\nresponsibility in the developmental field.\n\nAn important dimension of the role of the Collector in the developmental field is his association\nwith the District Rural Development Agency (DRDA). It should be noted here that the chief role of a\nCollectorin the field of development administration is that of coordination—coordinating the activities\nof district level officers engaged in the implementation of development programmes.\n\nHowever, the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1992 and the consequent Panchayati Raj Acts\nof 1993 and 1994 of various states have reduced the role of Collector in development administration.\n\nOther Powers and Functions In addition to the above, the Collector also performs the following\nfunctions.\n(i) He acts as the Returning Officer for elections to parliamentary and state asssembly\n\n\nconstituencies. Hence, he coordinates the election work at the district level.\n(ii) He acts as the District Census officer. Hence, he conducts the census operations once in ten\n\nyears.\n(iii) He acts as the Chief Protocol Officer in a district.\n\n(iv) He presides over the District Plan Implementation Committee.\n(v) He acts as the official representative of the state government during ceremonial functions in\nthe district.\n(vi) He acts as a kind of buffer between citizens and administration in the district.\n(vii) He supervises the municipal administration in the district.\n(viii) He acts as the Public Relations Officer of the government.\n(ix) He acts as the crisis administrator-in-chief during natural calamities and other emergencies.\n(x) As a head of district administration, he deals with personnel matters of the district staff.\n(ix) He is responsible for civil supplies—food and other essential commodities.\n(xii) He handles work pertaining to civil defence.\n(xiii) He maintains liaison with military authorities and looks after the welfare of both serving and\nretired members of the armed forces.\n\nThe Collectorate\n\nA Collectorate is the office of District Collector located in the headquarter of the district. It is\ndivided into various sections. Each section helps the Collector in the performance of his functions\nand fulfilment of his administrative responsibilities. The following are some of the sections of a\ntypical Collectorate.\n\nLl\n\nAccounts Section\n\nCivil Supplies Section\nDevelopment Section\nElection Section\nEstablishment Section\nGeneral Section\nHousing Section\nIntelligence Section\nJudicial Section\n\nLand Acquisition Section\nLand Record Section\nLand Reforms Section\nPanchayat Section\nProtocol Section\n\nPublic Relations Section\nRevenue Section\nRehabilitation Section\nRegistration Section\n\n\nStatistical Section\nTransport Section"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Like the District\nCollector, he is a territorial officer, generalist administrator and a multipurpose functionary. He is\nvested with revenue, magisterial and executive powers. As the chief executive officer and the official\nrepresentative of the state government he has to keep in touch with the activities of all departments of\nthe government in the sub-division. He acts, on the one hand, as a link between the District Collector\nand the tehsildar in revenue matters and, on the other hand, between the district magistrate and the\nstation police officer in matters pertaining to law and order. Thus he is the principal assistant and\nvaluable field aide to the District Collector and is responsible to him for all aspects of administration\nin the sub-division.\n\nThe sub-divisions are of two types—the office type and the touring type. In the first type, which is\nprevalent in most states, the SDO has a permanent office located within the sub-division itself. In the\nsecond type, which is prevalent in few states like UP, the SDO does not maintain an office and\n\n\nperforms his functions as a touring officer.

It is described as a ‘Miniature district’ as the offices of various field\ndepartments are located within it. However, certain states like Bihar and West Bengal have no tehsils\nand a sub-division is the unit below the district.\n\nThe Tehsildar belongs to the state civil service and is an officer of gazetted rank. Like Collector\nand SDO, he is a territorial officer, a generalist-administrator and a multi-purpose functionary. He is\nvested with revenue, megisterial and executive powers. He is responsible for collection of revenue\nas well as maintenance of law and order in the tehsil.

However, keeping in view the need for an\neffective agency at the district level to coordinate the anti-poverty programmes, a new centrally\nsponsored scheme for strengthening the DRDAs was introduced in 1999.\n\nThe primary objective of the scheme of DRDA administration is to strengthen and professionalise\nthe DRDAs so that they are able to effectively enhance the quality of implementation of anti-poverty\nprogrammes of the Union Ministry of Rural Development.\n\nThe DRDAs are also expected to coordinate effectively with the line departments, Panchayati Raj\ninstitutions, banks and other financial institutions, the NGOs as well as technical institutions with a\nview to gathering support and resources required for poverty reduction effort in the district.\n\nThe role of DRDAs will be to facilitate the implementation of programmes, to supervise/oversee\nand monitor progress, to receive and send progress reports and maintain accounts of funds received\nfor various rural development programmes.\n\nThe DRDAs are expected to deal only with the anti-poverty programmes of the Union Ministry of\nRural Development. If DRDAs are entrusted with programmes of other ministries or those of the state\ngovernments, it should be ensured that these have a definite anti-poverty focus.\n\nOrganisation\n\nEach district will have its own DRDA.

In respect of such states where DRDAs do\nnot have a separate identity, a cell will be created in the zilla parishad to maintain separate accounts\nso that these are capable of being audited separately.\n\nThe chairman of zilla parishad would be the chairman of the governing body of the DRDA. The\nDRDA shall also have an executive committee.\n\nThe staffing structure of the DRDAs includes positions for planning for poverty alleviation, project\nformulation, social organisation and capacity building, gender concerns, engineering supervision and\nquality control, project monitoring, accounting and audit functions as well as evaluation and impact\nstudies.\n\nEach DRDA should have the following wings:\n\n(i) Self-employment Wing\n\n(ii) Women’s Wing\n\n(iii) Wage Employment Wing\n\n(iv) Watershed Wing\n\n\n(v) Engineering Wing\n\n(vi) Accounts Wing\n(vii) Monitoring and Evaluation Wing, and\n(viii) General Administration Wing.\n\nThe DRDA should not have any permanent staff and should not resort to direct recruitment.

Translate the following text into Hindi accurately, preserving the original meaning and context."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The term ‘civil service’ and the system called ‘civil service system’ were introduced in India for the\nfirst time by the Britishers during the East India Company rule (in 17th century). In the beginning, the\nservants of the Company who were engaged in its commercial affairs were called as ‘civil servants’\nto distinguish them from the military and naval personnel of the Company. In 1675, the Company\ncreated a regular gradation of posts in the following manner (mentioned in the ascending manner).\n\n(i) Apprentice\n\n(ii) Writer\n\n(iii) Factor\n\n(iv) Junior Merchant\n\n(v) Senior Merchant\n\nLater on, when the Company acquired control over territories, the civil servants also assumed\nadministrative tasks. By 1765, the term ‘civil servant’ came to be used in the company’s official\nrecords.\n\nThe efforts of Lord Warren Hastings and Lord Cornwallis led to the rise of civil service. Hastings\nlaid the foundations of civil service and Cornwallis reformed, modernised and rationalised it. Hence,\nhe (Cornwallis) came to be known as the ‘Father of Civil Service’ in India. He introduced the\n“Covenanted civil services’ (higher civil services) which were different from the ‘Uncovenanted\ncivil services’ (lower civil services). The former was created by a law of the company, while the\nlatter was created otherwise. However, he reserved all the covenanted services for the Europeans\n(i.e. English personnel) and thus excluded Indians from superior posts. This policy of Cornwallis was\nbased on the following reasons.\n\n(i) He was doubtful about the integrity and ability of Indians.\n\n(ii) He thought that the task of establishing and consolidating the British rule in India could not be\n\nleft to the natives.\n\n(iii) He believed that an administration based on the British model could be strongly established in\n\nIndia only by the Englishmen and not by the natives.\n\n(iv) He wanted to preserve the lucrative posts in civil services for the influential class of British\n\nsociety.\n\nIn 1800, Lord Wellesly (the then Governor-General) established a college at Fort William in\nCalcutta (presently Kolkata) to provide training to the civil servants of the Company. As this move of\nWellesley was not favoured by the Court of Directors, (i.e. the governing body of the East India\n\n\nCompany) they established the East India College at Haileybury in England in 1806 for the same\npurpose.\n\nThe Charter Act of 1833 attempted to introduce a system of open competition as the basis of\nselection of civil servants of the Company, and stated that the Indians should not be debarred from\nholding any place, office and employment under the Company. However, this provision of the Act\nwas negated due to the opposition of the Court of Directors which wanted to continue the patronage\nsystem.\n\nMacauley Committee The Charter Act of 1853 abolished the patronage system and introduced an\nopen Competition system as a basis of selection and recruitment of civil servants of the Company.\nThus, the Court of Directors was deprived of its patronage power and the covenanted civil service\nwas thrown open to competition to the Indians also under the rules to be framed by the Board of\nControl. Accordingly, the Macauley Committee (the committee on the Indian civil service) was\nappointed in 1854 to suggest measures to give effect to the above provisions of the Act.\n\nThe committee made the following recommendations in its report submitted in 1854.\n\n(i) An open competition system should be adopted for recruitment to the civil services.\n\n(ii) The age of candidates for admission to the tests should be 18 to 23 years.\n\n(iii) The competitive examinations should be held in London.\n\n(iv) There should be a probationary period for the candidates before they are finally appointed.\n\n(v) The East India College at Hailleybury should be abolished.\n\n(vi) The competitive examination should be of a high standard and should ensure the selection of\n\ncandidates with thorough knowledge.\n\nAll the above recommendations were accepted and implemented by the Board of Control. The first\ncompetitive examination was held in London in 1855 under the Board of Control. Later on in 1858,\nthis responsibility was transferred to the British Civil Service Commission (set up in 1855).\nSimilarly, the East India College was abolished in 1858 and training to the civil servants was\nimparted in British universities. However, the first Indian (Satyendranath Tagore) could enter into the\ncovenanted civil service only in 1864.\n\nThe Indian Civil Service Act of 1861 provided for the reservation of certain principal posts for\nmembers of the covenanted service. The next statutory Civil Service Act of 1870 remedied the\ndefects of 1861 Act and provided for the Indianisation of services. However, it could be\nimplemented only in 1879 by Lord Lytton, the then Viceroy.\n\nAitchison Commission In 1886, Public Service Commission under the chairmanship of Charles\nAitchison was appointed to devise a scheme to do full justice to the claims of Indians to higher and\nmore extensive employment in public service. The Aitchison Commission made the following\nrecommendations in its report submitted in 1887.\n(i) The two-tier classification of civil services into covenanted and uncovenanted should be\nreplaced by a three-tier classification viz. imperial, provincial and subordinate civil services.\n(ii) The maximum age for entry into civil services should be fixed at 23 years.\n(iii) The statutory civil service system of recruitment should be abolished.\n(iv) The competitive examination should not be held simultaneously in England and India.\n(v) Certain percentage of the posts in the imperial civil service should be filled by promotion of\nthe members of the provincial civil service.\n\nThe above recommendations of the Commission were largely accepted and implemented. The\n\n\nstatutory civil service was abolished in 1892.\n\nIslington Commission Again in 1912, Royal Commission on public services in India under the\nchairmanship of Lord Islington was appointed. The Islington Commission made the following\nrecommendations in its report submitted in 1915:\n(i) Recruitment to the superior posts should be made partly in England and partly in India. But, it\ndid not favour the idea of holding the competitive examinations simultaneously in England and\nIndia.\n(ii) 25 per cent of the superior posts should be filled by Indians partly by direct recruitment and\npartly by promotion.\n(iii) The services under the Government of India should be categorised into Class I and Class II.\n(iv) The principle of maintenance of efficiency should be adopted while fixing the salaries of civil\nservants.\n(v) There should be a probationary period of two years for direct recruits. For the ICS, it should\nbe three years.\n\nThe report of the commission could be published only in 1917, when the recommendations\ncontained in it became out-dated due to the first World War and the August Declaration of 1917.\nHence, no serious consideration was given to them.\n\nMontford Report The next milestone in the evolution of civil service was the Montague—\nChelmsford Report (or Montford Report or Report on Indian Constitutional Reforms) of 1918 which\nmade the following recommendations:\n(i) 33 percent of the superior posts should be recruited in India and this percentage should be\nincreased by 1.5 per cent annually.\n(ii) The competitive examinations should be held simultaneously in England and India.\n(iii) The members of the ICS should be given fair salary, pension benefits and allowances.\n\nThe above recommendations were accepted and implemented by enacting the Government of India\nAct of 1919. On the eve of this Act, the following nine All-India Services existed:\n\n(i) Indian Civil Service\n\n(ii) Indian Police Service\n\n(iii) Indian Forest Service\n\n(iv) Indian Forest Engineering Service\n(v) Indian Service of Engineers\n\n(vi) Indian Civil Veterinary Service\n\n(vii) Indian Medical Service\n\n(viii) Indian Educational Service\n(ix) Indian Agricultural Service\n\nThe last to be added to the list of All-India Services was the Indian Agricultural Service in 1906—\n1907. The members of these services were recruited and controlled by the Secretary of State for\nIndia. Hence, these services were also known as the Secretary of State’s Services. Notably, the term\n‘All-India Service’ was first coined in 1918 by the Committee on Division of Functions (Chairman —\nME Gauntlett).\n\nAs a result of the reforms of 1918 and 1919, the first competitive examination (the ICS\nexamination) was held in India (at Allahabad) in 1922 under the supervision of the British Civil\n\n\nService Commission. By this time, five methods of entry into the Superior Civil Services came into\nexistence. They were:\n\n(i) By open competitive examinations held in England;\n(ii) By separate competitive examinations held in India;\n(iii) By appointments from the Bar (in case of judicial positions);\n(iv) By promotion from the provincial civil services; and\n(v) By nomination (in India) to facilitate communal and provincial representation.\n\nIn 1922, a Staff Selection Board was set up by the Government of India for the recruitment to the\nlower services. It functioned till 1926, when its functions were taken over by the newly established\npublic service commission.\n\nLee Commission In 1923, the Royal Commission on superior civil services in India under the\nchairmanship of Lord Viscount Lee was appointed. The Commission made the following\nrecommendations in its report submitted in 1924.\n\n(i) The Indian Civil Service, Indian Police Service, Indian Medical Service, Indian Service of\nEngineers (irrigation branch) and Indian Forest Service (except in the Bombay province)\nshould be retained. The members of these services were continued to be appointed as well as\ncontrolled by the Secretary of State for India.\n\n(ii) No further recruitment should be made to other all-India services viz., the Indian Agricultural\nService, Indian Veterinary Service, Indian Educational Service, Indian Service of Engineers\n(roads and building branch) and Indian Forest service (only in Bombay province). The\nmembers of these services should in future be appointed and controlled by the provincial\ngovernments.\n\n(iii) For effecting Indianisation of services, twenty per cent of the superior posts should be filled\nby promotion from the provincial civil service. Direct recruitments should be in equal\nproportions for Indians and Englishmen so that a ratio of 50 : 50 is produced in about 15\nyears.\n\n(iv) The British officers should be allowed to retire on proportionate pensions if they are not\nwilling to work under Indian ministers.\n\n(v) A public service commission, as provided by the Government of India Act of 1919, should be\nestablished.\n\nThe above recommendations were accepted and implemented by the British Government, as result\nof which a Central Public Service Commission was set up in 1926 and entrusted with the task of\nrecruiting civil servants. The commission was composed of a chairman and four other members. Sir\nRoss Barker, a senior member of the British Home Civil Service, was the first chairman. In 1937\n(when the 1935 Act became operative), the commission was replaced by the Federal Public Service\nCommission which was finally replaced by the UPSC on January 26, 1950 (when the Constitution of\nIndia came into force).\n\nThe Government of India Act of 1935 provided for the protection of the rights and privileges of the\nmembers of civil services. It also provided for the establishment of not only a Federal Public Service\nCommission but also a Provincial Public Service Commission and Joint Public Service Commission\nfor two or more provinces.\n\nIn 1947, there were only two all-India services—the Indian Civil Service and the Indian Police\nService. In addition, there were various Central and state services. The Central services were\n\n\nclassified into four categories—Class I, Class II, Subordinate, and Inferior services."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

It\nmust be mentioned here that the Central and state governments have their separate services called the\nCentral Services and the State Services respectively. Thus, the All-India Services are in addition to\nthe Central and State Services.\n\nAt present, there are three All-India Services. They are:\n\n\" Indian Administrative Service (IAS)\n\n\" Indian Police Service (IPS)\n\n\" Indian Forest Service (IFS)\n\nIn 1947, Indian Civil Service (ICS) was replaced by IAS, and the Indian Police (IP) was replaced\nby IPS and were recognised by the Constitution as All-India Services. In 1963, three more All-India\nServices were created. They are:\n\nIndian Forest Service\n\" Indian Medical and Health Service\n\" Indian Service of Engineers\n\nHowever, out of these three, only the Indian Forest Service came into existence in 1966. At\npresent, there are only three All-India Services— IAS, IPS and IFS.\n\nArticle 312 of the Constitution authorises the Parliament of India to create new All-India Services\non the basis of a resolution passed by Rajya Sabha to that effect. Thus, a new All-India Service can\nbe created only by an Act of Parliament and not by a resolution of Rajya Sabha. However, the\nParliament cannot do so without the recommendation of Rajya Sabha. This power is given to the\nRajya Sabha to protect the interests of states in the Indian federal system.\n\nInterestingly, the Drafting Committee of the Constituent Assembly did not provide a constitutional\nstatus to the All-India Services. Accordingly, the Draft Constitution did not make any mention of the\nAll-India Services. However, the Constituent Assembly included provisions with respect to the All-\nIndia Services which were approved. These provisions (under Article 312) not only gave a\nconstitutional status to the All-India Services but also provided for the creation of new All-India\nServices. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was the chief protagonist of All-India Services in the Constituent\nAssembly. Hence, he came to be regarded as the ‘Father of All-India Services’.\n\nThe All-India Services Act of 1951 authorised the Central Government to make rules in\nconsultation with the state governments for the regulation of recruitment and service conditions of the\nmembers of All-India Services. The members of these Services are recruited and trained by the\nCentral Government but are assigned to different states for work. They are borne on different state\ncadres; the Centre having no cadre of its own in this regard. They serve the Central Government on\ndeputation and after completing their fixed tenure they go back to their respective states. The Central\nGovernment obtains the services of these officers on deputation under the well-known tenure system.\nIt must be mentioned here that irrespective of their division among different states, each of these All-\nIndia Services form a single service with common rights and status and uniform scales of pay\n\nthroughout the country. All the three All-India Services are Class-I (Group-A) Services.\nThe All-India Services have three categories. They are:\n\" Super time scale\n\nSenior scale\n\nJunior scale\n\nIn the beginning, the officers are appointed in the junior scale. In the course of time, they are placed\nin the senior scale and the super time scale.\n\nThe three All-India Services are managed and controlled by three different Ministries of the\nCentral Government. They are:\n\n\" IAS by the Ministry of Personnel\n\n\" IPS by the Ministry of Home\n\n\" _ IFS by the Ministry of Environment and Forests\n\nIt must be mentioned here that the All-India Services are controlled jointly by the Central and state\ngovernments. The ultimate control lies with the Central Government while the immediate control\nvests with the state governments. Their salaries and pensions are met by the states. But the\ndisciplinary action (imposition of penalities) against these officers can only be taken by the Central\nGovernment.\n\nPresently, there are 24 state cadres in all for the All-India Services. This includes three joint\ncadres— (i) Assam and Meghalaya, (ii) Manipur and Tripura, and (iii) Arunachal Pradesh, Goa,\nMizoram and the Union Territories (AGMUT). The authorised cadre strength of the three All-India\nServices in all the states is mentioned in Table 7.1.\n\nAuthorised Strength of All-India Services\n\nSI. No. Name 1971 1984 1996 2001 2013\n1.

Most of them are controlled and managed by their respective ministries/departments,\nwhile a few of them are controlled and managed by the Ministry of Personnel. It (Ministry of\nPersonnel) also determines the general policies pertaining to all the Central Services. In fact, the\nMinistry of Personnel is the central personnel agency in the Government of India.\n\nThe Central Services consists of the Central Civil Services and the General Central Service. The\nCentral Civil Services are the established Services while the General Central Service comprise the\nCentral civil posts which are created outside the established services, that is, not included in any\nCentral Civil Service.\n\nBefore Independence, the Central Services were classified into Class I, Class II, Subordinate and\nInferior services. The nomenclature of Subordinate and Inferior Services was replaced by Class III\n\nand Class IV Services on the recommendation of the First Pay Commission (1946-1947). Again in\n1974, the classification of Central Services into Class I, Class II, Class III and Class [V was changed\nto Group A, Group B, Group C and Group D, respectively. This was done on the recommendation of\nthe Third Pay Commission (1970-1973). Thus, as of now, the Central Services (i.e. both established\nas well as general) are classified into four categories.

Translate the following text into Hindi accurately, preserving the original meaning and context."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Rationale\nThe arguments put forward in favour of the All-India Services are:\n\nNational Integration They promote national integration as the members of these services possess an\nall-India outlook. As they are usually posted in states other than their own, they can function beyond\nthe regional, linguistic and communal interests.\n\nEfficiency They help in maintaining high standard of administration in terms of administrative\n\n\nefficiency in the Centre as well as in states. During the British period, they were called the ‘Steel-\nframe of administrative structure’.\n\nUniformity They help to ensure uniformity of the administrative system throughout the nation. The\nmembers of these services are rotated between the Centre and the states.\n\nCo-operative Federalism They facilitate liaison, cooperation, coordination and joint action on the\nissues and problems of common interest, between the Centre and the states.\n\nRepository of Talent They attract the best talent in the country due to the wide field of recruitment,\nhigh remuneration, status and prestige.\n\nPresident’s Rule When the President’s Rule is in operation in any state, he can depend on the\nloyalty and cooperation of these offices for efficient administration. This is because, they are\nappointed and removed only by the President of India.\n\nIndependence They promote independence and impartiality of civil service at the highest level. As\nmembers of these services enjoy the constitutional safeguards, they are free from regional and local\npressures and influences. Hence, they can afford to give free and frank advice to the state ministers.\n\nRich Experience They facilitate the interchange of rich experience among different states. It must be\nmentioned here that the officers of all-India Services serve not only the state governments and Central\nGovernment but the union territories and local governments as well (both urban and rural). Thus their\nrich experience can be used for the benefit of the whole country.\n\nBeneficial to States The talent mobilised through national recruitment to these services is\ndistributed among the states. Hence, the states which are deficient in their manpower supply to fill the\nhigh and strategic positions will be benefitted.\n\nContinuity They are the continuation of the old administrative arrangement developed during the\nBritish period. The members of these services during the British rule constituted the highest rung of\nthe administrative hierarchy. The IAS, the only multi-purpose All-India Service, is the direct\ndescendent of the erstwhile ICS which was called as the ‘Heaven-born Service’.\n\nCriticism\nThe arguments put forward against the All-India Services are:\n\nHang-over of the Past These services were created during the period of British rule in India. At\nthat time, the structure of government was unitary and nature of state was authoritarian. After\nindependence, the structure of government and the nature of state underwent a radical transformation.\nIn this changed scenario, the All-India Services have no place.\n\nAgainst Federation These Services are against the federal system of government provided by the\nConstitution. They restrict the autonomy and patronage of the states. Since 1950, they have been an\npoint of dispute and problem area between the Centre and states. The states have not supported the\ncreation of more All-India Services inspite of a constitutional provision in this regard. In fact, the\nRajamannar Committee (constituted by the Tamil Government in 1969) in its report of 1971\n\n\nrecommended for the abolition of IAS and IPS.\n\nViolates Ministerial Responsibility These Services violates the principle of ministerial\nresponsibility at the state level. The ministers in the states have to work with the aid and advise of\nthose civil servants (Secretaries) who are appointed and trained by the Central Government, which\nalso enjoys the ultimate control over them.\n\nUnequal Representation The states of Indian Union are not equally represented in these Services.\nThe states of the Punjab, UP, Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh are represented more than others.\nThus they lack the national character due to regional loyalties.\n\nFinancial Burden These Services involve larger expenditure on state governments due to high\nsalary scales. This is done to attract the best talent from all over the country and to maintain their\nefficiency.\n\nDemoralises State Services The service conditions of All-India Services including pay and\npromotional avenues are very favourable compared to the State Services. Also, the members of State\nServices are made to work under the officers of All-India Services. All this demoralises the State\nServices.\n\nNo Familiarity The members of the All-India Services who come from outside the state may not be\nfamiliar with the local language, culture and general environment. Hence, they cannot understand the\nproblems of the people properly.\n\nDisadvantageous to Sons of the Soil The continuation and creation of new All-India Services\nhampers the effective spread of State Services. They reduce employment opportunities for the local\npeople, that is, ‘Sons of the Soil’. This theory of the ‘Sons of the Soil’ is an offshoot of growing\nregionalism in our country.\n\nLacks Specialisation The All-India Services, especially IAS, do not facilitate specialisation which\nis so essential in the modern age. It is said that the LAS officers are ‘Jack of all trades but master of\nnone’. This point is also recognised by the Administrative Reforms Commission (1966-1970) of\nIndia which recommended that a functional field should be carved out for the LAS."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The most important aspects of this\npolicy were the system of open competition and the scholastic nature of the examination.\n\nThe present scheme of examination to test the merit and suitability of candidates for direct\nrecruitment to the All-India Services and higher Central Services is laid down by the Kothari\nCommittee and the Satish Chandra Committee. However, the basic policy laid down, and the\nphilosophy of recruitment advocated by the Macaulay Committee continues to influence the system.\n\nThe Committee on Recruitment Policy and Selection Methods under the Chairmanship of D.S.\nKothari was appointed by the UPSC in 1974. It submitted its report in 1976. The Government\naccepted most of its recommendations in 1978 and implemented them in 1979. Thus the new system\nof competitive examination came into existence in 1979. Only in 1993, some changes were introduced\nin this system on the recommendations of the Satish Chandra Committee.\n\nThe Committee on the Recruitment Policy and Selection Methods for All-India and Central\nServices under the Chairmanship of Satish Chandra was appointed by UPSC in 1988. It submitted its\nreport in 1989. The Government implemented some of its recommendations in 1993. The main\nchanges effected are the introduction of an essay paper carrying 200 marks and increase in the marks\nfor the interview test from 250 to 300.\n\nIn 2011, the UPSC changed the pattern and syllabus of the Civil Services Preliminary Examination.\nIn the old scheme (before 2011), there was one paper of General Studies which carried 150 marks\nand a second paper where the candidate had the option to choose from 23 optional papers, carrying\n300 marks. Under the new and revised pattern, there are two common and compulsory papers of 200\nmarks each. In other words, the optional paper has been replaced with another General Studies paper.\nThese changes were made on the basis of the recommendations of a Committee headed by S.K.\nKhanna, Ex- Vice Chairman of UGC. This Committee was constituted in 2010 to review the scheme of\nCivil Services Preliminary Examination and suggest necessary changes.\n\nSubsequently, the UPSC formed another Committee (in 2011) under the Chairmanship of Arun S.\nNigavekar, Ex-Chairman of UGC, to review the scheme of Civil Services Main Examination and\nsuggest necessary changes. The terms of reference of the Committee were as follows:\n\n1. To identify the desired profile including the skill sets for the Civil Servants to enable them to\ndeliver good governance in the fast changing domestic and global socio-economic and\ntechnological scenario.\n\n2. To study the various selection methods currently in vogue globally for selection of Civil\nServants.\n\n3. To propose appropriate mechanisms and methodologies for selecting candidates with desired\nprofile and skill sets indicated in (i) above suited to Indian context for the next decade.\n\n4. To recommend a system for evaluation of the effectiveness of selection methodology adopted\nby the Commission and the periodicity in which corrective action, if any, may be made in the\nselection methodology; for ensuring that it keeps pace with the changing requirements of the\nServices.\n\n5. To recommend the role of the Commission in the assessment of performance of the candidates\nrecommended by it during and at the end of the mandatory training period and in particular,\nwhere such assessments have the effect of altering the initial merit order recommended by the\n\n\nCommission as also where it is proposed to extend or terminate the probation of a direct\nrecruit on the basis of unsuitability for Civil Service.\n\n6. Any other issue which the Committee may feel relevant to the process of selection of Civil\nServants for the country or which may be referred to the Committee by the Commission.\n\nThe Nigavekar Committee submitted its report in 2012. Based on these recommendations, the\nUPSC introduced changes in the scheme of Civil Services Main Examination from the year 2013. In\nthe new and revised format, the weightage of General Studies has been increased and one optional\nsubject (consisting of two papers) has been dropped. In effect, there are now four General Studies\npapers and only one optional subject (with two papers).\n\nScheme of Examination\n\nThe Competitive examination conducted by the UPSC for direct recruitment to All India Services\nand higher Central Services is known as the ‘Civil Services Examination’. Its salient features are:\n\nSingle Examination The civil services examination is a single and combined examination for\nrecruitment to the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Police Service (IPS), Indian Foreign\nService (IFS) and the other higher Central Services (i.e. Group A and Group B). Before 1979, there\nused to be three separate examinations, one for the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and the\nIndian Foreign Service (IFS), another for the Indian Police Service (IPS) and the Class II Police\nServices of the Union Territories and a third one for the Central Services.\n\nNationality For both, IAS and IPS, a candidate must be a citizen of India.\n\nFor other services, a candidate must be either a citizen of India or a subject of Nepal or a subject\nof Bhutan or a Tibetan refugee who came to India before 1962 with the intention of permanently\nsettling in India or a person of Indian origin who has migrated from Pakistan, Burma, Sri Lanka,\nKenya, Uganda,Tanzania, Zambia, Malawi, Zaire, Ethiopia and Vietnam with the intention of\npermanently settling in India. However, candidates belonging to these categories except the first one\n(i.e. a citizen of India) and the last one (i.e. migration) are not eligible for appointment to the Indian\nForeign Service.\n\nAge Limits A candidate must be a minimum of 21 years and a maximum of 32 years of age.\nHowever, the upper age limit is relaxable for the SC/ST candidates by five years and for the OBC\ncandidates by three years. It must also be mentioned here that the age limit recommended by the\nKothari Committee was 21—26 years.\n\nEducational Qualifications A candidate must hold a degree from any of the universities\nincorporated by an Act of the central or state Legislature in India or other educational institutions\nestablished by an Act of Parliament or declared to be deemed as a university under the University\nGrants Commission Act of 1956 or must possess an equivalent qualification (i.e. professional or\ntechnical degree).\n\nNumber of Attempts Every candidate is permitted six attempts at the examination. But the number\nof attempts permitted to OBC candidates is nine. Further, the restriction on the number of attempts is\nnot applicable to the SC/ST candidates. Thus, the SC/ST candidates can have any number of attempts\nwithin the prescribed age limits, that is, 21 to 37 years. It must also be noted here that the Kothari\n\n\nCommittee had recommended only two attempts for both, the General and the SC/ST candidates.\n\nPlan of Examination The Civil Services Examination consists of two successive stages called the\nPreliminary Examination and the Main Examination. The Preliminary Examination is meant for the\nselection of candidates for the Main Examination, while the Main Examination is meant for the\nselection of candidates for various services and posts.\n\nPreliminary Examination It consists of two papers. They are:\n\nPaper I General Studies 200 Marks\nPaper II General Studies 200 Marks\nTotal 400 Marks\n\nBoth the question papers are of objective type (i.e. multiple choice questions). The question papers\nare set both in Hindi and English. Each paper is of two hours’ duration. However, the marks secured\nin this examination are not counted for the final ranking of the candidate. It is meant to serve as a\nscreening test only.\n\nMain Examination It consists of two parts—written examination and interview test. The written\nexamination consists of the following papers:\n\nPaper —A Indian Language 300 Marks\nPaper —B English 300 Marks\nPaper —I Essay 250 Marks\nPaper — II General Studies-I 250 Marks\nPaper — III General Studies-II 250 Marks\nPaper —IV General Studies-III 250 Marks\nPaper — V General Studies-IV 250 Marks\nPaper — VI Optional Subject (Paper-1) 250 Marks\nPaper — VII Optional Subject (Paper-2) 250 Marks\nSub-Total (written test) 2350 Marks\nInterview Test (Personality Test) 275 Marks\nGrand Total 2625 Marks\n\nThe marks obtained in Indian Language and English papers are not counted for ranking. Also,\nIndian Language paper is not compulsory for the candidates hailing from the state of Sikkim and the\nnorth eastern states of Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Nagaland. The question\npapers for all the subjects for written examination are of conventional (essay) type. Each paper is of\nthree hours’ duration. The candidates can answer all the question papers except the language papers\n(i.e. Paper-A and Paper-B) in any one of the languages mentioned in the Eight Schedule of the\nConstitution of India, or in English. However, all the question papers (other than language papers) are\nset only in Hindi and English.\n\nInterview Test It aims at assessing personal suitability of the applicant for a career in civil\nservices. The qualities judged by an interview test includes mental alertness, critical powers of\nassimilation, clear and logical exposition, balance of judgement, variety and depth of interest, ability\nfor social cohesion and leadership, and intellectual and moral integrity.\n\n\nIt should be noted here that A.D. Gorwala (in his Report on Public Administration—1951)\nadvocated the need for psychological tests in the method of recruitment to the higher civil services in\nIndia.\n\nSelection of Candidates The marks secured by candidates in the written examination (i.e. essay,\ngeneral studies and optional subject, totalling to 1750 marks) and the interview test (275 marks)\nwould determine their final ranking. The candidates are alloted various services keeping in view\ntheir ranks in the Main Examination. Of course, the preferences expressed by the candidates for\nvarious services are also considered.\n\nIn addition to the Preliminary and Main Examinations, the Kothari Commission had also\nrecommended another level (i.e. a third level) of examination called Post-Training Test. It suggested\nthat there should be a post-training test on completion of training at the LBS National Academy of\nAdministration, Mussorie. The allocation of candidates to various services should be made on the\nbasis of marks obtained by them in both the Main Examination and the Post-Training Test. However,\nthe government rejected this recommendation on the ground that this would involve reorganisation of\nthe LBS National Academy of Administration.\n\nThe UPSC submits the list of the successful candidates arranged in the order of merit to the\nMinistry of Personnel. The Ministry of External Affairs gets the first choice to choose the required\nquota for the Indian Foreign Service (IFS). After that, the Ministry of Personnel selects the candidates\nfor the IAS. Then, the candidates for the IPS are choosen by the Ministry of Home Affairs. This is\nfollowed by other ministries/departments in a fixed order.\n\nIt is important to mention here that the combined competitive examination described above does\nnot cover the Indian Forest Service (IFS), which is also an All-India Service. For this, the UPSC\nconducts a separate examination which consists of a written test and an interview test.\n\nApart from this direct recruitment, a method of recruitment by promotion is also followed. The All-\nIndia Services Act of 1951 specifies that senior duty posts not exceeding 33!/, per cent in the Indian\nAdministrative Services (IAS), Indian Police Service (IPS) and Indian Forest Service (IFS), are\nrequired to be filled in by promotion of officers employed in the State Services. Such promotions are\nmade on the recommendations of the Selection Committee constituted for this purpose in each state.\nEach such Committee is presided over by the Chairman or a member of UPSC.\n\nTherefore, the IAS—the top most All-India Service—consists of officers recruited by the\nfollowing three methods:\n\n(i) By direct recruitment through a combined, open, competitive Civil Services examination.\n(ii) By indirect recruitment, that is, promotion of officers of State Civil Services.\n\n(iii) By special selections from those holding gazetted posts under state governments but who are\n\nnot members of the State Administrative Services."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

It provided one year multi-purpose training to the IAS\nprobationers. In 1957, the IAS Staff College was established at Simla to provide a refresher training\ncourse for senior IAS officers of six to ten years’ service. Both these training institutions of Delhi and\nSimla were merged in 1959 to set up the National Academy of Administration at Mussoorie. Since\nthen, this academy has been imparting training to the IAS probationers.\n\nThe various components of the induction training programme for IAS are:\n\n(i) Foundational training 4 Months\n(ii) Professional training (first spell) 5 Months\n(iii) District training in the state 12 Months\n(iv) Professional training (second spell) 3 Months\n\nTotal 24 Months\n\nThe foundational training course organised by the National Academy is a combined training course\nfor the new entrants (called probationers) of All India Services, that is, IAS, IPS and IFS (Indian\nForest Service) and Central Services Group A (including Indian Foreign Service), except the Central\nSecretariat Service. This combined course under a comon roof is imparted with the following\nobjectives.\n\n(i) To develop a feeling of belongingness (esprit de corps) and a broad common outlook among\nthe members of the higher civil services.\n\n(ii) To provide an understanding of the constitutional, economic, social, political, legal,\nadministrative, historical and cultural context within which the administrators have to function\nand make their contributions.\n\n(iii) To inculcate professional, administrative and human values among the probationers.\n\nAfter the completion of the foundational course, the probationers of other services are sent to their\nrespective training institutes for professional training, while the IAS probationers continue to stay at\nthe Academy for their professional training (also called institutional training). In 1969, professional\ntraining programme for the IAS probationers underwent a change with the introduction of a\n‘sandwich’ course on the recommendation of the ARC. Since then, the IAS probationers are required\nto undergo two spells of professional (institutional) training at the Academy with a gap of one year\nbetween them. This gap is utilised for district training (i.e. field training or practical training) in the\nstates.\n\nDuring the first spell of institutional training, the IAS probationers study in more detail the\nproblems of Indian administration, district administration, Indian Penal Code, Criminal Procedure\nCode, constitutional and legal system, economic planning, and others. After this, they are sent to their\nallotted state for field training. The posting of an IAS probationer in the state is decited by the Chief\nSecretary of the state government. The components of this training are mentioned below.\n\n(i) Institutional training at the state training school\n(ii) Practical training in the district under the supervision of a Collector\n(iii) Training at the State Secretariat\n\nAt the end of this one year field training in the state, the probationers return to the National\nAcademy to undergo a second spell of the professional training. At this stage, the probationers focus\non the discussion of administrative problems and issues they were confronted with or they observed\n\n\nduring the course of their practical training in the state. The training at this stage is more problem-\noriented. At the end of this training, the probationer has to pass an examination conducted by the\nUPSC. He now becomes an officer and is sent to the allotted state.\n\nTraining of IPS\nThe various components of the induction training programme for IPS are:\n(i) Foundational training 4 Months\n(ii) Professional training (first spell) 12 Months\n(iii) District training in the States 8 Months\n(iv) Professional training (second spell) 3 Months\nTotal 27. Months\n\nThe foundational training to the IPS probationers is imparted at the LBS National Academy of\nAdministration (Mussoorie), alongwith the probationers of other All-India and Central Services.\n\nAfter the completion of the combined foundational course, the IPS probationers are sent to the\nSardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy (Hyderabad) for professional training (i.e.\ninstitutional training). In 1986, the professional training programme for the IPS probationers\nunderwent a change with the introduction of a ‘sandwich’ course on the recommendations of the Gore\nCommittee on Police Training of 1974. It is patterned on the lines of sandwich course for IAS\nprobationers. Therefore since 1986, the IPS probationers are also required to undergo two spells of\ninstitutional (professional) training at the National Police Academy (Hyderabad) with a gap of eight\nmonths (35 weeks) between them. This gap is utilised for district training (i.e. field training or\npractical training) in the states.\n\nTraining of IFS (Forest)\n\nThe Indian Forest Service (IFS) probationers are given the induction training for a period of three\nyears. The various components of this training programme along with the respective durations are\nmentioned below:\n\n(i) Foundational training 4 months\n(ii) Professional training 24 months\n(iii) On-the-job training in cadre states 8 months\n\nTotal 36 months\n\nThe foundational training to the IFS probationers is imparted at the LBS National Academy of\nAdministration (Mussoorie), along with the probationers of other All-India and Central Services.\nAfter this, they are sent to the Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy (Dehradun) for professional\ntraining.\n\nTraining of IFS (Foreign)\n\nThe duration of training imparted for the Indian Foreign Service (IFS) probationers is three years.\nThe various components of their training programme alongwith the respective durations are\n\n\nmentioned as follows.\n\n(i) Foundational course imparted at National Academy of 4 months\nAdministration, Mussoorie (alongwith other probationers of\nAll-India and Central Services)\n\n(ii) Professional Course at the Foreign Service Institute in New 12 months\nDelhi (including an Attachment with the Armed Forces and\n\nBharat Darshan tour)\n(iii) Attachment with the Ministry of External Affairs 6 months\n(iv) Languages training at an Indian mission abroad 14 months\nTotal 36 Months\n\nThe above system of induction training for IFS Probationers has been in force since 1987. Before\nthat, the training system consisted of seven stages with an element of district training for six months\nduration. The probationers were given institutional training at Indian School of International Studies\nin New Delhi. This institute was replaced by the Foreign Service Institute.\n\nTraining of Other Higher Services\n\nAfter completion of 4 months’ combined foundational course at Mussoorie, the probationers of\nvarious higher civil services are sent to their respective training institutes for professional\n(institutional) training. The following points can be noted in this regard.\n(i) The Indian Audit and Accounts Service probationers are imparted professional training at the\nIndian Audit and Accounts Service Staff Training College, Simla.\n(ii) The Income Tax Service probationers are given professional training at the Indian Revenue\nService (Direct Taxes) Training Institute, Nagpur.\n(iii) Railway Services probationers are trained at the Railway Staff College, Baroda.\n(iv) The Central Secretariat Service probationers are imparted foundational training course as\nwell as professional training at the Institute of Secretariat Training and Management, New\nDelhi. It must be emphasised here that the probationers of the Central Secretariat Service do\nnot attend the four month’s combined foundational course at Mussoorie.\n(v) The Indian Postal Service probationers are given professional training at the Postal Staff\nCollege, Ghaziabad (UP).\n(vi) The Indian Customs Service as well as Central Excise Service probationers are trained at the\nCustoms and Central Excise Training School, New Delhi.\n(vii) Indian Information Service probationers are given professional training at the Indian Institute\nof Mass Communication, New Delhi.\n\nThe long-term professional training imparted to the probationers of various higher civil services\nconsists of two components:\n(i) Theoretical instructions at the respective training institutes.\n(ii) Practical training in the fields under the guidance of senior officers.\n\nTraining Institutions\n\nNational Academy of Administration It is the premier training institution in our country. It was\n\n\nestablished in 1959 at Mussoorie, a famous hill station in Uttaranchal. In 1972, it was renamed as the\nLal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration. Presently, it is under the Ministry of\nPersonnel. It provides the following training courses.\n(i) A combined four months foundational course for all the probationers of All India Services\nand Group-A Central Services (except the Central Secretariat Service).\n(ii) Professional training for the IAS probationers (in two spells).\n(iii) In-service training courses for officers of All-India and Central Services (Group-A). These\nare of two types—\n(a) Management Development Programme of 4 weeks duration for officers of 11 to 16 years\nof service.\n(b) Executive Development Programme of 6 weeks duration for officers of 6 to 10 years of\nservice.\n(iv) Short courses of one week to one month duration for senior officers.\n\nNational Police Academy In 1948, the Central Police Training College was set up at Mount Abu in\nRajasthan. During the internal emergency (1975-1977), it was shifted to Hyderabad and renamed as\nSardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy on the recommendation of the Kohli Committee\nof 1966. It provides the following training courses.\n(i) Professional (Institutional) Training for the IPS probationers.\n\n(ii) Refresher courses for senior IPS officers.\n\n(iii) Induction training for State Police Service Officers on their promotion to IPS.\n\n(iv) Special courses to train the trainers/instructors of police training institutions of the state\n\npolice as well as paramilitary forces.\n\nThe academy is under the administrative control of the Ministry of Home Affairs.

Below is an excerpt from my book titled 'Understanding governance in india for upsc', specifically from Chapter 'PAY AND SERVICE CONDITIONS', Section 'PAY AND SERVICE CONDITIONS'. Translate the following text into Hindi accurately, preserving the original meaning and context."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The conditions of service of a government servant includes pay, allowances, periodical increments,\nleave, promotion, tenure or termination of service, transfer, deputation, various types of rights,\ndisciplinary action, holidays, hours of work, and retirement benefits like pension, provident fund,\ngratuity, and so on. Thus, it includes the whole gamut of personnel administration except\nclassification, recruitment and training.\n\nPay (Compensation)\n\nPay is also known as salary or compensation or remuneration. A sound and adequate compensation\nplan is very essential for the efficient functioning of the civil service in the modern state. However,\nthere is no single principle which determines the fixation of the pay scales of civil servants. In fact,\nvarious principles are considered while fixing the salary scales.\n\nEqual Pay for Equal Work This is the most important principle involved in the determination of\n\n\nsalary scales for civil servants. There should be uniform pay rates without any individual variations\nbased on favouritism. In other words, the pay scale should compensate the positions (jobs) and not\nthe individuals. Hence, higher kind of work should be paid a higher rate than the lower kind of work.\n\nParity with Outside Employment The pay scales of the government servants should be fairly\ncomparable to the pay scales in the private sector. In other words, the government employees should\nbe paid at a rate which corresponds to the comparable situation in outside employment. Otherwise,\nthe talent in society will join the private sector.\n\nCost of Living The salaries paid to the government employees must be both adequate and just. They\nshould have relationship with the cost of living. However, the cost of living is not the same\nthroughout the country and varies from region to region. Such regional variations should be taken into\nconsideration while fixing the pay scale of the employees. Further, the pay scales should be revised\nand adjusted to the changes in the cost of living.\n\nEconomic Position of the Country The compensation plan of the government for its employees\nshould bear relationship with the per capita income of the country. This is because, the financial\nposition of the government depends on the economic situation of the country. In developed countries\nlike USA, UK, France and Germany, the tax paying capacity of people is much higher when compared\nto those of the developing countries like India, Brazil, and so on. Obviously the pay scales of public\nservants in developed countries are much higher when compared to the pay scales in the developing\ncountries.\n\nState as the Model Employer Another principle which should be taken into account while\ndetermining the pay scales of government employees is that the state should act as the model\nemployer. The Tomlin Royal Commission (1929-31) on the civil service in Britain has mentioned the\nfollowing three different interpretations of the term model employer.\n\n(i) An employer who is ahead of other employers in the society in the matters of pay and other\nconditions of service.\n(ii) The State should be one of the front rank employers in the society, it need not march ahead of\nthem.\n(iii) It only emphasises the responsibility of the state towards its employees and nothing beyond\nthat.\n\nThe general interpretation of the term is the first one. Therefore, the State should have such pay\nscales for its employees which might serve as the model for the private sector employers.\n\nMaintenance of Efficiency The pay scales of the government should be so designed as to attract\nand retain efficient staff with requisite qualifications and abilities. Anderson Committee (1923) on\nthe pay and service conditions of state servants in Britain emphasised this principle. It propounded\nthe theory that “the government should pay what is necessary to recruit and retain an efficient staff.”\nIslington Commission (1912) in India also justified this principle.\n\nOther Principles Apart from the above principles, the following factors are also taken into\nconsideration while fixing the pay scales.\n(i) Social considerations, that is, the disparities between the highest and the lowest salaries\nshould be minimum.\n\n\n(ii) The policy of the Government which is based on the political ideology professed and\npractised by it.\n\n(iii) Legislations like Minimum Wages Act.\n\n(iv) The risky and hazardous nature of job.\n\n(v) The employees union which pressurise the Government through their principle of collective\n\nbargaining.\n41\\)(ea Pay Commissions Appointed so far in India\nSI.

These are\nexplained below.\n\nDearness Allowance (DA) It is granted to compensate the increase in prices and the cost of living.\nHouse Rent Allowance (HRA) It is granted to compensate for the rising rent of the house in cities.\n\nCompensatory City Allowance It is granted to meet the necessities of everyday life in big cities\nwhich cost more when compared to the smaller cities/towns.\n\nTravelling Allowance (TA) _ It is granted to meet the expenses incurred on travel undertaken on\nofficial duty.\n\nDaily Allowance (DA) It is granted to meet the daily expenses incurred on boarding, lodging and\nsundry items while on tour.\n\nConveyance Allowance (CA) It is provided to an employee who is required to travel extensively at\nor within a short distance from his headquarters but cannot claim travelling allowance.\n\nLeave Travel Concession (LTC) It is granted to an employee to enable him or his family members\nto visit his or their home town once in a block of two calendar years.\n\nMedical Aid The government employee and his family members are entitled for free of charge\nmedical attendance and treatment.\n\n\nChildren’s Educational Assistance The benefits extended to government employees under this\ncategory includes:\n\n(a) Children’s educational allowance,\n\n(b) Reimbursement of tuition fees, and\n\n(c) Hostel subsidy.\n\nUniform Allowance Certain categories of employees like police, peons have to wear special\nuniforms while performing their official duties. They are granted special uniform allowance.\n\nCompensatory Allowances This includes the composite hill compensatory allowance, bad climate\nallowance, tribal area allowance and remote locality/border area/difficult area/disturbed area\nallowance.\n\nOther Allowances Apart from the above-mentioned allowances and perks, government employees\nalso enjoy other allowances like project construction allowance, risk allowance, cyclone allowance,\nwashing allowance, overtime allowance, and others.\n\nLeave Benefits\n\nThe government employees also enjoy the benefit of various kinds of leave. However, leave cannot\nbe claimed as a matter of right. In other words, the leave sanctioning authority can refuse or revoke\nleave of any kind. But it is not open to him (i.e. the leave sanctioning authority) to alter the kind of\nleave due and applied for except at the request of the employee. Further, no leave of any kind can be\ngranted for a continuous period exceeding five years except with the sanction of the President. The\nvarious kinds of leave are explained below:\n\nCasual Leave It is essentially intended for short periods to meet unexpected contingencies. An\nemployee on casual leave is not treated as absent from duty. His pay is not intermitted.\n\nEarned Leave It is also known as privilege leave. It is intended to enable the employee to take rest\nfor a certain period. The earned leave can be accumulated and encashed at the time of retirement.\n\nHalf-Pay Leave This leave is granted on option even when earned leave is at credit. It is granted\neither on medical certificate or on private affairs. Thus, this leave is also called as sick leave and\nleave on private affairs.\n\nStudy Leave It is granted to an employee for undergoing a special course consisting of higher\nstudies or specialised training in a professional or technical subject having a direct and close\nrelationship with the sphere of his duties.\n\nMaternity Leave This leave is granted to married or unmarried female employees with less than\ntwo surviving children. It carries full pay.\n\nPaternity Leave This is granted to male government servants with less than two surviving children\nfor a period of 15 days during the confinement of his wife. It carries full pay.\n\nExtraordinary Leave This is granted when no other leave is admissible or when other leave is\nadmissible but the employee applies specifically for the grant of this leave. It cannot be granted for\n\n\nmore than five years in case of permanent officials. However, he will not be entitled to any leave\nsalary.\n\nOther Leaves Apart from the leaves mentioned above, government servants are also entitled for\ncommuted leave, special disability leave, hospital leave, special casual leave and others.\n\nPromotion\n\nThe following points can be noted with regard to the promotion system in our country.\n(i) The seniority-cum-merit is the governing principle.\n\n(ii) Head of the department concerned is the promotion making authority. However, promotions to\nhigher posts are made in consultation with the public service commissions.\n\n(iii) Departmental Promotion Committees (or Boards) are set up for the purpose of selecting the\ncandidates for promotion at the departmental levels.\n\n(iv) The All-India Services Act of 1951 specifies that the senior posts not exceeding per cent in\nthe Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Police Service (IPS) and Indian Forest\nService (IFS) are required to be filled in by promotion of officers employed in the State\nServices. Such promotions are made on the recommendation of selection committees\nconstituted for this purpose in each state. Such a committee is presided over by the Chairman\nor a member of UPSC.\n\n(v) The employees are rated under the following five categories for the purpose of promotion:\n\"Outstanding\n\nVery good\n\nSatisfactory\n\nIndifferent\n\nPoor\n\n(vi) An employee who is appointed through promotion cannot be removed or dismissed by any\nauthority which is subordinate to the authority by which he was appointed or promoted\n(Article 311 of the Constitution).\n\n(vii) The principle of seniority was accepted first in India by the East India Company in 1669. The\nCharter Act of 1793 sanctified it. The ICS Act of 1861 made allowance for merit principle\nalso.\n\nRetirement Benefits\n\nThere are three methods of raising the funds out of which the retirement benefits are paid. These are\ngiven below.\n(i) Contributory system, in which the employee makes total contribution (by way of salary\ndeductions).\n(ii) Partly contributory system in which both, the employee and the government share the cost of\nretirement benefits.\n(iii) Non-contributory system in which the government alone bears the cost of retirement benefits.\n\nThe following forms of retirement benefits are in vogue in India.\n\n\nPension It is a recurring monthly payment granted to the retired government servants so long as they\nlive. The various kinds of pension are as follows.\n\n(i) Superannuation pension, granted to a public servant who retires after attaining the age of\nsuperannuation, that is, 58 years or 60 years.\n\n(ii) Retiring pension, granted to a public servant who retires after completing the fixed period of\nservice but before attaining the age of superannuation (i.e. voluntary retirement or premature\nretirement).\n\n(iii) Invalid pension, granted to a public servant who retires on account of any bodily or mental\ninfirmity which permanently incapacitates him for any further service.\n\n(iv) Compensation pension, granted to a public servant whose permanent post is abolished and the\nprovision of alternate employment of equal status is not possible, or offer of a lower post is\nnot accepted.\n\n(v) Compulsory retirement pension, granted to a public servant who is compulsorily retired from\nservice as a measure of penalty.\n\n(vi) Compassionate allowance, granted to a public servant who is removed or dismissed from\nservice for misconduct. This is also considered as pension but the amount should not exceed\ntwo-thirds of pension which would have been admissible to him if he had retired on\ncompensation pension.\n\n(vii) Injury Pension, granted to a public servant for injury sustained in the course of discharging his\nofficial duties. It is also known as disability pension.\n\n(viii) Family Pension, granted to the family of a public servant on his death in service or after\nretirement.\n\nProvident Fund It is another form of retirement benefit which is paid to the employee in a lumpsum\nat one instance. It is a partly contributory system of retirement benefit in the sense that the contribution\nto the fund is made both by the employee and the Government.\n\nGratuity It is paid to a public servant at the time of retirement in a lumpsum at one time. It is of\nvarious kinds, viz. service gratuity, retirement gratuity, death gratuity, and so on.\n\nLeave Encashment The retired employee can encash his accumulated earned leave at the time of\nretirment. Thus the employee is granted a lumpsum cash equivalent to the leave salary.\n\nInsurance Benefits | The Central Government Employees’ Group Insurance Scheme of 1980\nprovides, at a low cost and on contributory and self-financing basis, the twin benefits of an insurance\ncover in the event of the employee’s death during his service, and a lumpsum payment to augment\ntheir resources on retirement.\n\nRights of Civil Servants\nThe rights of civil servants in India are:\n\nRight to Organise The Constitution of India (Article 19) gave all the citizens the fundamental right\nto freedom of speech, expression, assembly and association. However, it authorised the state to\nimpose reasonable restrictions on the exercise of these rights in the national interest.\n\nFurther, the Constitution (Article 309) also empowered the legislature to regulate the recruitment\n\n\nand service conditions of persons appointed to public services and posts. The conduct rules made\nunder this provision also impose reasonable restrictions on the fundamental rights of civil servants.\n\nTherefore, the position in India is that the civil servants cannot become members of any service\nassociation which is not recognised by the Government. Thus joining an unrecognised association is a\ndisciplinary offence.\n\nRight to Strike Like in the UK, in India also there is no law prohibiting a strike by civil servants.\nHowever, the conduct rules prohibit a civil servant from participating in any strike. Hence striking by\ncivil servants constitute a disciplinary offence. Jagannath Das Commission (i.e. the Second Pay\nCommission) said that the civil servants should not enjoy the right to strike. The Administrative\nReforms Commission of India went one step ahead and recommended complete ban on strikes by\ncivil servants.\n\nPolitical Rights Like the USA, India has also imposed severe restrictions on political rights of the\ncivil servants. According to the conduct rules, the civil servants:\n(i) should not indulge in active politics.\n(ii) should not join any political party.\n(iii) should not canvass in favour of any candidate.\n(iv) should not contest Lok Sabha or state assembly elections.\n(v) should not aid any political movement.\n\nThus, except the right to vote, the civil servants in India do not enjoy any other political rights.\nHowever, a civil servant can contest in a local election with the permission of the Government.\n\nMachinery for Consultation Staff Committees were established in all central ministries in 1954 on\nthe recommendation of the First Pay Commission. These were renamed as Staff Councils in 1957.\n\nThe aims and objectives of these councils were as follows:\n\n(i) To provide a machinery for dealing with the grievances of the employees.\n(ii) To negotiate and settle the disputes related to conditions of service between the Government\nand the employees.\n\n(iii) To ensure maximum cooperation between the Government and its employees.\n\n(iv) To improve efficiency in the public service.\n\n(v) To promote welfare of the employees.\n\nEvery ministry had two Staff Councils namely, a Senior Staff Council for Class II and Class III\nemployees, and a Junior Staff Council for Class IV employees. Thus, Class I employees were\nexcluded from this scheme. They were only advisory.\n\nThe Second Pay Commission found that these councils were not effective in fulfilling their\nobjectives. Hence, it recommended the following measures.\n\n(i) A central joint council should be established and it should cover both the industrial and non-\nindustrial civil service.\n\n(ii) A compulsory arbitration tribunal should be set up to deal with matters of pay and\n\nallowances, hours of work and leave.\n\n(iii) The Ministry of Labour should play an important role in matters pertaining to staff relations.\n\nThe above recommendations were implemented in 1966 when the machinery for joint consultation\nand compulsory arbitration for Central Government employees was established.\n\n\nThe Joint Consultative Machinery (JCM) is patterned on the Whitley Council in the UK. It consists\nof the national council, the departmental councils and the local councils. The council has equal\nnumber of both, official as well as staff representatives.\n\nThe JCM is concerned with the following:\n\n(i) General principles related to recruitment, promotion and discipline.\n(ii) All matters pertaining to conditions of service.\n(iii) Improvement of efficiency in public service.\n(iv) Welfare of the employees.\n\nIt does not entertain the discussion of individual cases.\n\nThe JCM includes all civil servants except the following:\n\nGroup A (i.e. Class I) Officers\n\nGroup B (i.e. Class Il) Services except the Central Secretariat Service\n\nPersons employed in industrial establishment at the managerial or supervisory level\nEmployees of union territories\n\nPolice Personnel\n\nThere is also a provision for compulsory arbitration in case of disagreement between the official\nand the staff. For this purpose, Board of Arbitration under the control of the Ministry of Labour has\nbeen established. The awards of the Board are final, subject to the over-riding authority of the\nParliament of India.\n\nDisciplinary Action\n\nDisciplinary action is taken against a civil servant who has violated the conduct rules in the\nperformance of his job. The important conduct rules in India are:\n\n\" All India Services (Conduct) Rules, 1954.\n\n\"Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1955.\n\n\" Railway Services (Conduct) Rules, 1956.\n\nA formal disciplinary action constitutes the imposition of minor as well as major penalities. The\nfollowing are the minor penalities.\nCensure or reprimand\nWithholding increments\nWithholding promotion\nRecovery of pecuniary loss\n\nThe following are the major penalities:\nReduction to lower scale or rank\nCompulsory retirement\n\nRemoval from service\n\nDismissal from service\n\nThe difference between removal and dismissal is that the former shall not disqualify for future\nemployment, while the latter shall disqualify for future employment.\n\nThe various steps in the process of disciplinary action are:\n\n(i) Calling for an explanation from the employee against whom disciplinary action is initiated.\n\n\n(ii) Framing of charges, if the explanation is not satisfactory.\n(iii) Suspension of the employee from the service.\n(iv) Hearing of charges and giving opportunity to the employee to defend himself.\n(v) Findings and making report.\n(vi) Giving second opportunity to the employee to defend himself against the proposed\npunishment.\n(vii) Punishment order (exoneration).\n(viii) Appeal, if any.\n\nThe following constitutional provisions govern the proceedings of the disciplinary action against a\ncivil servant.\n(i) A civil servant cannot be removed or dismissed by any authority subordinate to the authority\nby which he was appointed (Article 311).\n(ii) A civil servant cannot be reduced in rank or removed or dismissed unless he is given\nreasonable opportunity to defend himself (Article 311).\n\nThe President of India is the disciplinary authority in respect of All India Services, Central\nServices Class I (i.e. Group A) and some Class II (i.e. Group B) services.\n\nIn respect to class III (ie. Group C) and Class IV (i.e. Group D) employees, the Secretary of the\nministry concerned is the disciplinary authority."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Translate the following text into Hindi accurately, preserving the original meaning and context."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Generalists and specialists are the two components of the civil service in India. The proper\nrelationship between the two is essential for the efficient functioning of the civil service. However,\nthere has been an unending controversy between these two since the British rule.\n\nMeaning\n\nA generalist civil servant is one who does not possess a specialised background but is well equipped\nwith the administrative procedures, rules and regulations and hence, can be appointed in any field of\nadministration. He belongs to the managerial class and usually performs the POSDCORB functions,\nthat is, Planning, Organising, Staffing, Directing, Coordinating, Reporting and Budgeting. Thus, the\ncivil servants who make policies, coordinate, supervise and control the administration are called\ngeneralists. An IAS officer is an example of a generalist civil servant par excellence.\n\nA specialist civil servant, on the other hand, is one who possesses special knowledge or skill in a\nspecific field or area of administration. He is an expert professional. Thus, like a generalist, he is not\nan all-rounder. Engineers, doctors, agriculturists, meteorologists, educationists and statisticians are\nsome of the examples of specialists.\n\nCategorisation of Services\n\nThe civil services in India can be grouped into two broad categories viz. technical services and non-\ntechnical services. The technical services are those to which recruitment is done only on the basis of\n\n\nspecialised and professional qualifications of the candidates. These services include Indian\nEconomic Service, Indian Statistical Service, Indian Forest Service, Central Engineering Service,\nCentral Legal Service, Central Health Service, Indian Meteorological Service, and so on. These\ntechnical services are called ‘Specialist Services’ and the members of these services are called the\n“Specialists.”\n\nThe non-technical services, on the other hand, are those to which recruitment is done on the basis\nof general educational qualifications and is open to all candidates who possess the minimum required\neducational qualification, for instance, a university degree. These services includes Indian\nAdministrative Service, Indian Police Service, Indian Revenue Service, Indian Foreign Service,\nIndian Audit and Accounts Service, Indian Postal Service, Central Secretariat Service, and so on.\nThese non-techcnical services can be further divided into two sub-categories, that is, functional\nservices and general purpose service. The members of the functional services remain in the specific\nfield of administration for which they are selected and appointed throughout their career. In the course\nof time, they acquire expert and specialised knowledge due to work experience and regular training.\nThese functional services include all the nontechnical services except the IAS. The IAS is the only\ngeneral purpose service at the national level. The members of IAS occupy top positions in the\nadministrative heirarchy in various fields of administration. There is no functional field carved out\nfor the members of IAS.\n\nTo sum up, the specialists class include the members of the technical services and the non-\ntechnical functional services, and the generalists class includes the members of only the IAS. Thus the\ngeneralists and the specialists controversy is nothing but the controversy between the members of the\nIAS and the non-IAS.\n\nHistorical Perspective\n\nThe origin of the generalists and specialists dichotomy can be traced to the British Northcote-\nTrevelyan Committee Report of 1854. This Committee recommended a superior position for the\nmembers of the British Administrative Class (generalists) and subordinate position for the members\nof the technical (specialists) services. The Macaulay Committee Report of 1854 on the Indian Civil\nService was influenced by the British Northcote-Trevelyan Committee Report and recommended the\nsame position in India too.\n\nHence, the administrative machinery in India during the British colonial rule was structured and\ndesigned to give a dominant position to the members of the generalist services, especially the ICS.\nEven after independence, there has been no significant change in this pattern of administration.\n\nIn Britain, the Fulton Committee Report of 1968 examined this matter in the changed conditions and\nrecommended a better status and greater role for the specialists, and professionalisation of higher\ncivil service. However, the generalist dominance continues to prevail in Britain with marginal\nimprovement in the status of the specialists. Similarly in India also, the Second Pay Commission\n(1957-1959), the Estimates Committee of Parliament and the Administrative Reforms Commission\n(1966-70) recommended for remedial measures to give better status to the specialists. However, the\nsituation has not changed much and the old system still continues, of course, with little change.\n\nAreas of Controversy\n\n\nThe following points give an account of the present position with regard to the respective roles and\nstatus of the generalists and the specialists in the administrative system. In other words, the\ngeneralists and specialists controversy is surrounded around the following points.\n\n(i) The pay and service conditions (including promotion) of the generalists are more attractive\nand favourable than those of the specialists. This is the foremost grievance of the specialists.\n\n(ii) The majority of top posts (i.e. policy formulation and consideration levels) in the Union and\nstate governments are reserved for the members of JAS. In other words, entry into these top\nposts is usually denied to the specialists.\n\n(iii) Below the Secretariat level, the positions are usually manned by specialists. But many a\ntimes, generalists are appointed as heads of the executive departments for example, Director\nof Agriculture, Chief Conservator of Forests, Director of Health, and so on.\n\n(iv) At the regional level, the key posts like Divisional Commissioner, Command Area\nDevelopment Commissioner, and others, are manned by generalists.\n\n(v) At the district level, the District Collector, who is head of the district administration is a\n‘generalist civil servant par excellence’. A district administration consists of a number of\ntechnical departments which are headed by the specialists. Even the Chief Executive Officer\nof the Zilla Parishad is a generalist and heads a team of specialists.\n\n(vi) The proximity to the political bosses which is enjoyed by the generalists is much more than\nthe specialists.\n\n(vii) Inter-organisational mobility of generalists is much wider than that of specialists. The IAS\nofficers move from one department to another, from a department to a public enterprise or\nlocal government and vice-versa. The specialists move only within their respective\ndepartments or fields of administration.\n\n(viii) The generalists have a greater and quicker chance of promotion than specialists.\n\n(ix) The performance appraisal and assessment of specialists is done by generalist IAS officers.\n\n(x) The advises, proposals and ideas of the specialists are not cared much by the IAS officers\nwho consider the specialists as their subordinates.\n\nThe above points of controversy between the generalists and specialists have led to discontentment\namong specialists thereby affecting their morale and efficiency.\n\nCase for Generalists\n\nThe arguments put forward for the superiority of the generalists are:\n\n(i) The generalists are more suitable than specialists for the performance of higher management\nlevel jobs due to their high caliber, ability, and a wide and rich experience.\n\n(ii) The tenure system of Secretariat staffing which is based on the concept of district or field\nexperience favours a band of generalist administrators.\n\n(iii) There should be a generalist civil servant at all levels of administration to perform the\nmanagerial functions, as the administration is historically based on the principle of ‘area\nadministration’, that is, ta/uga, district, division and so on.\n\n(iv) A generalist acts as a mediator between a amateur minister and the specialist, between the\npeople and the government, and between the pressure groups and public interest.\n\n(v) The specialists are narrow-minded and parochial as they “know more and more about less\nand less.” As rightly said by Paul H. Appleby, “the price of specialisation of every kind is\n\n\nparochialism”. The generalists, on the other hand, have a broad out look and flexibility of\napproach.\n\nCase for Specialists\n\nThe arguments put forward by the specialists in favour of their better position and greater role in\nadministration are:\n\n(i) The generalists are not suitable for all policy-making positions as they do not have\nprofessionalism and adequate knowledge.\n\n(ii) Amateur generalists cannot understand the technical complexities of the proposals forwarded\nby the specialists. An IAS officer is “a jack of all trades but master of none.”\n\n(iii) The ‘intelligent amateur theory’ underlying the constitution of the generalist civil service\ndeveloped in Britain and India during the nineteenth century does not hold good in the present\ntimes as the functions of administration have become more complex, more technical and\nsubject specific.\n\n(iv) In the present set up, a minister is deprived of expert advice and specialised knowledge of the\nspecialists.\n\n(v) The policies formulated by the generalists are unrealistic as they are not fully aware of the\nproblems faced by the specialists in the effective implementation of policies.\n\nForms of Organisation\n\nThere are four forms of organisation of generalists and specialists. The nature of relationship between\nthem depends on the type of the form being adopted. These are explained below.\n\nSeparate Hierarchy In this system, there will be common pay for the generalists and the specialists.\nHowever, the specialists will have greater respect. This form is prevalent in Germany, Sweden and\nAustralia.\n\nParallel Hierarchy Under this system, a specialist will be working with a generalist. In other\nwords, the specialists and the generalists will have their own respective hierarchies (which are\nparallel to each other). The coordinating work is achieved by frequent liaison between the two.\n\nJoint Hierarchy Under this system, both a generalist bureaucrat and a specialist technocrat report\njointly to their common superior, permanent secretary, who is a generalist. Similarly, a minister may\nalso be advised by a Specialist as well as generalist.\n\nUnified Hierarchy Under this system, there will be a unified (Integrated) civil service which is\ncreated by merging all the services and cadres. There will be a common open competitive\nexamination for entry into such service and uniformity in pay and service conditions. Pakistan\nadopted this model in 1973. This idea is also under discussion in India whereby it is suggested that\nthe Central Services and All India Services should be merged to create a unified civil service.\n\nSteps Taken\n\n\nSince Independence, the Government of India has taken the following steps to resolve the generalist-\nspecialist controversy:\n\n1.\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\nIt has created the Central Secretariat Service in 1948. This gave rise to a separate cadre of\npermanent secretariat officers.\n\nIt has established the Central Administrative Pool in 1957 for manning the higher positions in\nthe Central Secretariat.\n\nIt has created the Indian Forest Service in 1966. It is a specialist All-India Service.\n\nIt has created the Indian Economic Service and Indian Statistical Service in 1961. These are\nthe specialist central services.\n\nIt has been appointing specialists to the senior administrative positions like Secretary,\nAdditional Secretary, Joint Secretary and so on.\n\nIt has been inducting specialists into the Board of Directors of the central public sector\nenterprises.\n\nIt has been appointing specialists to a majority of positions in the Planning Commission."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The political executive consists of the\nPrime Minister, Cabinet Ministers, Ministers of State and Deputy Ministers. The permanent\nexecutive, on the other hand, consists of civil servants, that is, Secretaries, Additional Secretaries,\nJoint Secretaries, Deputy Secretaries and other professional administrators. The civil servants of a\nministry/department are headed politically by a minister and administratively by a Secretary.\n\nThe political executive derives its power from the people through a mechanism of periodic\nelections, and exercises power by virtue of the constitutional position. The permanent executive, on\nthe other hand, is selected on the basis of merit and derives its power from both administrative\npositions and the technical expertise. As the system of government is based on the doctrine of popular\nsovereignty (i.e. possession of supreme power by the people), the permanent executive is\nsubordinated to the political executive which represents the people. In the words of Mohit\nBhattacharya, “Under the parliamentary system of government, the superiority of the minister and the\nsubordination of the Secretary are axiomatic.”\n\nRelative Roles\n\nA proper and harmonious relationship between the minister (i.e. political or transient executive) and\nthe secretary (i.e. civil servant or permanent executive) is of great importance for smooth and\nefficient functioning of the parliamentary government. A minister (i.e. non-official) is responsible for\nthe following functions.\n\n(i) To formulate policies\n(ii) To make decisions on important matters\n(iii) To supervise the implementation of policies\n\n\n(iv) To decide on larger administrative questions\n(v) To make appointments to top posts\n(vi) To intervene in administration for the redressal of legitimate public grievance(s)\n\nThe Civil Servant (i.e. official), on the other hand, is responsible for the following functions.\n(i) To implement policies and decisions\n(ii) To provide information, facts and ethical judgements needed in policy making\n(iii) To direct and supervise the work of subordinates\n(iv) To maintain continuity of administration\nPfiffner has excellently enumerated the points of distinction between the political executive and the\ncivil servant in the following way:\n\n41) (eee Minister vs. Civil Servant\n\nSl.No. Minister Civil Servant\n1. Amateur Professional\n2. Non-technical Technical\n3. Partisan Non-partisan\n4. Temporary Permanent\n5. More public contacts Less public contacts\n6. More legislative contacts Less legislative contacts\n7. More policy formulating Less policy formulating\n8. More decisions More advisory\n9. More coordination More performance\n10. Influenced by technical opinion Influenced by technical data collection from\nstudy and research\nPrinciples\n\nThe principles that govern relationship between the minister and the civil servant are:\n\n(i) Both should uphold the constitutional provisions and parliamentary laws while discharging\ntheir respective duties.\n\n(ii) A minister has the ultimate prerogative in policy-making.\n\n(iii) A civil servant should execute faithfully all policies and decisions of the minister even when\nthey are against the advice tendered by him.\n\n(iv) A civil servant enjoys full freedom to express himself frankly without fear in tendering advice\nto the minister.\n\n(v) A civil servant should observe the principles of neutrality, impartiality and anonymity.\nNeutrality means that a civil servant should remain non-political and must serve different\ngovernments in power without any political consideration. Impartiality means that the civil\nservant should, in the words of Mohit Bhattacharya, “act without bias irrespective of the\nsocial pressures and variations in the nature of clients.” Anonymity means that a civil servant\nmust work from behind the curtain, without praise or blame.\n\nRelationship in Practice\n\nThe minister-civil servant relationship in India emerged as a result of the Government of India Act of\n1919, also known as the Montague-Chelmsford Reforms. This Act was enforced in 1921 to introduce,\namong others, the new scheme of ‘Dyarchy’ (dual scheme of governance) in the provinces.\nConsequently, the office of minister came into existence, and for the first time, the ICS Officers were\nmade to work under the ministers who were responsible to the Legislative Council.\n\nIn practice, the relationship between a minister and a Civil Servant is characterised by conflicts,\ndisputes, uneasiness and suspicion. Let us examine some important cases here.\n\nThe first conflict in the relationship between a minister and a Civil Servant in the post-\nIndependence era occurred in 1957 in the “Mundhra Deal.” In this case, the funds amounting to rupees\none crore and a quarter of the nationalised Life Insurance Corporation were spent to purchase the\nshares of a private concern. When it became a point of concern, both, the then Fianance Minister\n(T.T. Krishnamachari) and Principal Finance Secretary (H.M. Patel) blamed each other.\nConsequently, the Government of India appointed a one man inquiry commission consisting of M.C.\nChagla to enquire and examine into the facts and propriety of the Mundhra deal in 1958. The Chagla\nCommission held in its report that “Constitutionally the minister is responsible for the action taken by\nhis secretary... He cannot take shelter behind them nor can he disown their actions.” Thus, the Chagla\nCommission upheld the principle of ministerial responsibility and the norm of anonymity of civil\nservice. Consequently, the Finance Minister resigned.\n\nAgain in 1966, the then Home Minister (Gulzari Lal Nanda) complained to the Prime Minister of\nthe non-cooperative attitude of his Home Secretary (L.P. Singh) and requested for his replacement.\nThe Prime Minister did not consider the request and consequently Gulzari Lal Nanda resigned.\n\nAnother episode took place in 1971 when the Railway Minister (K. Hanumanthaiya) meted out a\nshabby treatment to the Chairman of the Railway Board (B.C. Ganguli). They had differences over a\nnumber of issues mainly related to railway financial administration. B.C. Ganguli left under\nhumiliating circumstances as his services were terminated by the Government.\n\nIn 1987, Rajiv Gandhi, the then Prime Minister of india, also misbehaved with the Agriculture\nSecretary (C.S. Sastry), Rural Development Secretary (D. Bandopadhyaya) and Foreign Secretary\n(A.P. Venkateshran).\n\nIn 1993, the Home Secretary resigned due to difference in the style of functioning of the Home\nMinister.\n\nReasons for Conflicts\n\nThe factors responsible for the deterioration of the relationship between a minister and a civil servant\nare:\n\n(i) The ministers generally do not encourage free, frank and impartial advice from the civil\nservants. This hinders mutual understanding and cooperation.\n\n(ii) The emergence of personal affiliations between the minister and the civil servant leading to\npoliticisation of the civil service.\n\n(iii) Frequent use of transfer, suspension and disciplinary powers by ministers against civil\nservants who do not act favourably.\n\n(iv) Factionalism, group rivalry and casteism among the ministers and the civil servants.\n\n\n(v) The end of “one dominant party system” (i.e. the Congress) leading to political instability. It\ndoes not facilitate the growth of mutual confidence.\n\n(vi) Lack of proper understanding with regard to their respective roles. The ministers usually\ninterfere with day-to-day administration while the civil servants do not bring important\nmatters to the notice of ministers.\n\n(vii) The attitude of ministers to blame the civil servants for their failures. According to Chagla\nCommission, “The doctrine of ministerial responsibility has two facets. The minister has\ncomplete autonomy within his sphere of authority. As a necessary corollary, he must take full\nresponsibility for the actions of his servants.”\n\n(viii) The habit of civil servants to criticise the ministers and their policies in social and private\ncircles make the ministers react similarly.\n\n(ix) The civil servants are not sensitive towards the difficulties and problems of the ministers.\nThey do not appreciate the political role of ministers who try to accommodate individual and\ngroup interests.\n\n(x) The ministers and the civil servants differ from each other in terms of historical role, social\nbackground, professional commitments, mental ability and outlook and so on."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

It operates through the\ninstrument of ‘Budget’ and encompasses the entire “budgetary cycle’, that is, formulation of the\nbudget, enactment of the budget, execution of the budget, accounting and auditing.\n\nAccording to C.P. Bhambhri, “the term ‘budget’ was used in its present sense for the first time in\n1773, in a satire entitled ‘Opening the Budget’ directed against Walpole’s financial plan for that\nyear”.\n\nSignificance\n\nThe popular statements made on the importance of financial administration to the government\nadministration are mentioned below.\n\nAaron Wildavsky: “Budget is the life blood of the government.”\n\nKautilya: “All undertakings depend upon finance. Hence, foremost attention shall be paid to the\ntreasury.”\n\nHoover Commission: Financial administration is “at the core of modern government.”\nLloyd George: “Government is Finance.”\n\nMorstein Marx: “Finance is as universally involved in administration as oxygen is in the\natmosphere.”\n\nMeaning\n\nThe term ‘Budget’ is derived from an old English word ‘Bougett’ which means a sack or pouch. It\nwas a leather bag from which the British Chancellor of Exchequer extracted his papers to present to\nthe Parliament the government’s financial programme for the ensuing fiscal year. From that\nassociation, it came to mean the papers themselves, especially those containing financial proposals.\nThe budget is a statement of the estimated receipts (revenue or income) and expenditure of the\ngovernment in respect to a financial year. In other words, it is a financial document of the government\n\n\nas presented to the legislature and as sanctioned by the legislature.\n\nFunctions\n\nThe following points highlight the functions or purposes of budget.\n\n1. It ensures the financial and legal accountability of the executive to the legislature.\n\n2. It ensures the accountability of subordinates to superiors in the administrative hierarchy.\n\n3. It is an instrument of social and economic policy to serve the functions of allocation,\ndistribution and stabilisation.\n\n4. It facilitates the efficient execution of the functions and services of government.\n\n5. It facilitates administrative management and coordination as it unifies the various activities of\nthe government departments into a single plan.\n\nPrinciples\nThe principles of sound budgeting are:\n\nBudget should be on Annual Basis This means that the legislature should grant money to the\nexecutive for one year only. This principle of annuality of budget is considered ideal because: (a) a\nyear is the optimum period for which the legislature can afford to give financial authority to the\nexecutive; (b) a year is the minimum period needed by the executive to implement the budget\neffectively; and (c) a year corresponds with the customary measure of human estimates. Presently, the\nfinancial year in India is from 1st April to 31st March. However, the Administrative Reforms\nCommission of India (ARC) recommended that the financial year should be from 1st November to\n31st October.\n\nEstimates should be on Departmental Basis This means that the expenditure and revenue estimates\nof budget should be prepared by the department directly dealing with them, irrespective of the fact\nthat such expenditure or revenue is on account of another department. The observance of this\nprinciple is suggested because: (a) it gives a clear picture of the programmes and activities of every\ndepartment; and (b) it ensures the financial solvency of every department. However, to avoid any\nconfusion in this regard, the department preparing the estimates should give footnotes indicating the\nexpenditure or revenue of that department dealt by another department.\n\nBudget should be a Balanced One This means that the estimated expenditure should not exceed the\nestimated revenue. In other words, a ‘balanced budget’ is one in which the estimated expenditure\nmatches the estimated revenue. If the estimated revenue is more than the estimated expenditure, it is\ncalled a ‘surplus budget’, and if the estimated revenue is less than the estimated expenditure, it is\ncalled a ‘deficit budget’.\n\nEstimates should be on a Cash Basis This means that the expenditure and revenue estimates of\nbudget should be prepared on the basis of what is expected to be actually spent or received during the\nfinancial year. The opposite of ‘cash budgeting’ is called ‘revenue budgeting’, under which the\nbudgeting estimates are prepared on a demand and liability basis, that is, the revenue and expenditure\naccrued in a financial year are included in the budget of that financial year regardless of whether they\nare actually realised or incurred in that financial year. The USA, UK and India have cash budgeting,\n\n\nwhile France and some other continental countries have revenue budgeting. Cash budgeting facilitates\nan early closure of public accounts than revenue budgeting. The delayed accounts lose much of their\nvalue for purposes of financial control.\n\nOne Budget for all Financial Transactions This means that the government should incorporate all\nits revenues and expenditure (of all the departments) in a single budget. The opposite of ‘single\nbudget’ is ‘plural budget’ under which separate department-wise budgets are prepared. The single\nbudget system reveals the overall financial position of the government as a whole, that is, overall\nsurplus or deficit. The UK and USA have single budget, while France, Switzerland and Germany\nhave plural budgets. India has two budgets, viz. general budget and railway budget.\n\nBudgeting should be Gross and not Net This means that all transactions of receipts and\nexpenditure of the government should be fully and separately shown in the budget and not merely the\nresultant net position. The practice of deducting receipts from expenditure or vice versa, and\npreparing the budget for net receipts or expenditure is not a sound principle of budgeting. This is\nbecause, it reduces the legislative control over finances due to incomplete accounts.\n\nEstimating should be Close This means that the budgetary estimates should be as exact as possible.\nThis is because, overestimating leads to excessive taxation and underestimating leads to ineffective\nexecution of the budget. “Close budgeting’ also means that particular items of expenditure should be\nspecified and there should be no demand for lumpsum grant.\n\nRule of Lapse The budget should be on annual basis, that is, the legislature should grant money to\nthe executive for one financial year. If the granted money is not spent by the end of the financial year,\nthen the balance would expire and should be returned to the treasury. This practice is known as the\n‘rule of lapse’. The financial year in India and the UK is from 1st April to 31st March, in the USA it\nis from 1st July to 30th June, and in France it is from 1st January to 31st December.\n\nThe rule of lapse facilitates effective financial control by the legislature as no reserve funds can be\nbuilt up without its authorisation. However, the observance of this rule leads to heavy rush of\nexpenditure towards the close of the financial year. This is popularly called as ‘March Rush’ in India.\n\nRevenue and Capital Portions should be Separated This means that the current financial\ntransactions of the government should be distinguished from the transactions of a capital nature and\nthe two must be shown in two separate parts of the budget called the ‘revenue budget’ and the ‘capital\nbudget’. This necessitates the separation of operational expenditure from that of investment\nexpenditure. The revenue budget is financed out of the current revenue while the capital budget is\nfinanced out of the savings and borrowings.\n\nForm of Estimates should Correspond to form of Accounts This means that the form of budgetary\nestimates should correspond to the form of accounts to facilitate effective financial control. For\nexample, the budgetary heads and accounting heads are same in India, that is, major head, minor head,\nsubhead and detailed head.\n\nForms or Systems\n\nThe forms (systems) of budgeting which have evolved over a period of time are explained below.\n\n\nLine-item Budgeting This is also called as traditional budgeting or conventional budgeting. This\nsystem of budgeting developed in the 18th and 19th century. It emphasises on the items (objects) of\nexpenditure without highlighting its purpose and conceives budget in financial terms. In other words,\nit presents budget in terms of objectwise (line-item) classification. Under this system, the amount\ngranted by the legislature on a specific item should be spent on that item only. The objectives of this\nbudgeting are to prevent wastage, over-spending and misuse of money granted by the legislature to the\nexecutive. This system of budgeting facilitates maximum control of public expenditure. In fact, the\nsole object of line-item budgeting has been the accountability of funds, that is, ensuring legality and\nregularity of expenditure. This system is also called as ‘incremental budgeting’ as the funds are\nallotted on an incremental basis after identifying the existing base.\n\nPerformance Budgeting The system of performance budgeting (earlier called as functional\nbudgeting or activity budgeting) originated in the USA. The term ‘performance budget’ was coined by\nthe First Hoover Commission (1949). This commission recommended the adoption of performance\nbudgeting in the USA to make effective management approach to budgeting. Accordingly, it was\nintroduced in 1950 by President Truman.\n\nUnlike the line-item budgeting, the performance budgeting emphasises on the purpose of\nexpenditure rather than the expenditure itself. It presents budget in terms of functions, programmes,\nactivities and projects. It establishes a correlation between the physical (performance or output) and\nfinancial (input) aspects of each programme and activity. Hence, it necessitates a functional\nclassification of the budget.\n\nIn India, the adoption of performance budget was recommended first by the Estimates Committee of\nParliament in 1956. In 1964, the Government invited Frank W. Krause, an American expert, to study\nthe suitability and feasibility of this system of budgeting in India. Finally the Central Government\nintroduced performance budgeting in 1968 on the recommendation of the Administrative Reforms\nCommission. According to this commission, the advantages (benefits/objectives) of the performance\nbudgeting are as follows:\n\n(i) It presents more clearly, the purposes and objectives for which the funds are sought by the\nexecutive from the Parliament.\n(ii) It brings out the programmes and accomplishments in financial and physical terms.\n(iii) It facilitates a better understanding and better review of the budget by the Parliament.\n(iv) It improves the formulation of the budget.\n(v) It facilitates the process of decision-making at all levels of government.\n(vi) It increases the accountability of the management.\n(vii) It provides an extra tool of management control of financial operations.\n(viii) It renders performance audit more purposeful and effective.\n\nIn 1968, the performance budgeting was introduced in four ministries of the Government of India.\nLater in 1977-78, it was extended to about 32 developmental departments.\n\nProgramme Budgeting Like performance budgeting, programme budgeting (also known as\nplanning-programming-budgeting system—PPBS) also originated in the USA. It was introduced in\n1965 by President Johnson. However, it was abandoned in 1971. This system of budgeting integrates\nthe planning, programming and budgeting functions. It incorporates a scheme of planning in the\nbudgeting process. In the words of K.L. Handa, “Programme budgeting or PPBS emphasises the\nplanning aspect of budgeting for selecting the best out of a number of available programmes and for\n\n\noptimising the choice in economic terms while allocating funds in the budget... It treats budgeting as\nan allocative process among competing claims to be conducted by using the relevant planning\ntechniques.”\n\nZero-based Budgeting (ZBB) The ZBB also originated and developed in the USA. It was created\nin 1969 by Peter A. Pyhrr, a manager of a private industry. It was introduced in the USA by President\nJimmy Carter in 1978.\n\nLike the performance budgeting or PPBS, the ZBB is also a rational system of budgeting. Under\nthis system, every scheme should be reviewed critically and rejustified totally from zero (or scratch)\nbefore being included in the budget. Thus, the ZBB involves a total re-examination of all schemes\nafresh (from base zero) instead of following the incremental approach to budgeting which begins with\nthe estimation of the current expenditure. In the words of K.L. Handa, “The basic feature of a zero-\nbased budget is that the departments, while preparing their budgets, should not take anything for\ngranted and, therefore, should start on a clean slate. The budget making for the ensuing year should be\nstarted from zero instead of treating the current budget as the base or the starting point.”\n\nThe advantages/benefits of ZBB technique are:\n\n(i) It eliminates or minimises the low priority programmes.\n\n(ii) It improves the programme effectiveness dramatically.\n\n(iii) It makes the high impact programmes to obtain more finances.\n\n(iv) It reduces the tax increase.\n\n(v) It facilitates critical review of schemes in terms of their cost-effectiveness and cost benefits.\n\n(vi) It provides for quick budget adjustments during the year.\n\n(vii) It allocates the scarce resources rationally.\n(viii) It increases the participation of the line personnel in the preparation of budget.\n\nIn India, the ZBB was first introduced in the Department of Science and Technology in 1983 and in\nall the ministries during 1986-87 fiscal year.\n\nSunset Legislation It is a formal process of policy review for eliminating the undesired, outdated,\nredundant and irrelevant programmes. In the words of K.L. Handa, “It embodies the concept of self-\nretiring government programmes by providing for the termination of statutory authorisation of\nprogrammes. This is achieved by placing time limits on government programmes in the legislative\nenactments themselves and providing for their automatic termination on the prescribed dates unless,\naffirmatively recreated by legislature after conducting a detailed review.”\nThe advantages or benefits of the sunset legislation are as follows:\n(i) It ensures economy in government expenditure.\n(ii) It avoids unnecessary expansion of government activities.\n(iii) It makes the financial resources available for new programmes.\n(iv) It ensures administrative rationality by facilitating the reallocation of limited funds on a\ncontinuous basis.\n(v) It helps in overcoming the resistance met within the executive for eliminating an ongoing\nprogramme by shifting the major responsibility for its evaluation to the legislature.\n\nTop-Down Budgeting The system of Top-Down Budgeting was introduced in the USA in 1981\nduring the Reagan era. It is also known as ‘Target Base Budgeting’. It has the elements of earlier\nsystems of budgeting, that is, performance budgeting, PPBS, Management by Objectives (MBO), ZBB\n\n\nand Sunset Legislation.\n\nNicholas Henry has defined Top-Down Budgeting as “a method of allocating public revenues to\nthe agencies in which agency spending limits (and, often, agency goals, too) are set by the chief\nexecutive officer of the government, while agency heads are permitted to attain their goals in the\nmanner that they deem to be most effective within these centrally set spending limits”. He further\nobserved, “Top-Down Budgeting clearly empowers the central administration to set expenditure and\nprogrammatic goals; therefore, it is a complete reversal of the traditional budgetary process in\ngovernment, which is bottom-up. The real system of budgeting now is from the top downward.”\n\nHistorical Perspective\n\nThe institutions of financial administration originated and developed in modern India during the\nperiod of British Rule. The following points can be noted in this regard:\n(i) In 1753, the Indian Audit and Accounts Department was created.\n(ii) In 1860, a system of budget was introduced.\n(iii) In 1870, financial administration was decentralised by Lord Mayo. Consequently, provincial\ngovernments were made responsible for the management of local finances.\n(iv) In 1921, the Railway Budget was separated from the General Budget on the recommendation\nof the Acworth Committee.\n(v) In 1921, Public Accounts Committee was created at the Centre.\n(vi) In 1935, the Reserve Bank of India was established by an Act of Central legislature."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The financial year in India is from Ist April to 31st March.\n\nThe Constitution refers to the budget as the ‘annual financial statement’. In other words, the term\n“budget” has nowhere been used in the Constitution. It is the popular name for the ‘annual financial\nstatement’ that has been dealt with in Article 112 of the Constitution.\n\nIn addition to the estimates of receipts and expenditure, the budget contains certain other elements.\nOverall, the budget contains the following:\n\n1. estimates of revenue and capital receipts,\n\n2. ways and means to raise the revenue,\n\n3. estimates of expenditure,\n\n4. details of the actual receipts and expenditure of the closing financial year and the reasons for\nany deficit or surplus in that year, and\n\n5. economic and financial policy of the coming year, that is, taxation proposals, prospects of\nrevenue, spending programme and introduction of new schemes/projects.\n\nAgencies\n\nThe four different organs involved in the formulation of the budget are:\n\n\nThe Finance Ministry It has the overall responsibility for the formulation of the budget, and\nprovides the required leadership and direction.\n\nThe Administrative Ministries They have a detailed knowledge of administrative requirements.\n\nThe Planning Commission It facilitates the incorporation of plan priorities in the budget. In other\nwords, the Finance Ministry remains in close touch with the Planning Commission in order to\nincorporate the plan priorities in the budget.\n\nThe Comptroller and Auditor-General He provides the accounting skills which are necessary for\nthe formulation of the budget estimates.\n\nStages/Process\nThe various stages involved in the formulation of the budget are explained below:\n\nPreparation of Estimates by the Drawing and Disbursing Officers In September—October (i.e.\n5—6 months before the commencement of the financial year), the Finance Ministry dispatches circulars\nand forms to Administrative Ministry inviting their estimates of expenditure for the ensuing financial\nyear. The Administrative Ministry in turn pass on these forms (in which the estimates and other\nrequisite information have to be filled in) to their local/field offices, that is, to the disbursing officers.\nBach such form contains the following columns:\n\nActual figures of the previous year\n\nSanctioned budget estimates for the current year\n\nRevised estimates of the current year\n\nProposed estimates for the next year (with explanation for any increase or decrease)\n\nActuals of the current year available (at the time of preparation of the estimates)\n\nActuals for the corresponding period of the previous year\n\nScrutiny and Consolidation of Estimates by the Departments and Ministries Head of the\ndepartment, after receiving the estimates from the drawing officers, scrutinises and consolidates them\nfor the entire department and submits them to the Administrative Ministry.\n\nThe Administrative Ministry also scrutinises the estimates in the light of its general policy and\nconsolidates them for the whole ministry and submits them to the Finance Ministry (Budget Division\nof the Department of Economic Affairs).\n\nScrutiny by the Finance Ministry The Finance Ministry scrutinises the estimates received from the\nAdministrative Ministry from the point of view of economy of expenditure and availability of\nrevenues. Its scrutiny is nominal in case of ‘standing charges’ and more exacting in case of ‘new\nitems’ of expenditure.\n\nSettlement of Disputes If there is a difference of opinion between the Administrative Ministry and\nthe Finance Ministry on the inclusion of a scheme in the budget estimates, the former can submit such\nestimates to the Union Cabinet. The decision of the Cabinet in this regard is final.\n\nConsolidation by the Finance Ministry After this, the Finance Ministry consolidates the budget\nestimates on the expenditure side. Based on the estimated expenditure, the Finance Ministry prepares\n\n\nthe estimates of revenue in consultation with the Central Board of Direct Taxes and the Central Board\nof Indirect Taxes. It is also assisted in this regard by the Income Tax Department and the Central\nExcise and Customs Department.\n\nApproval by the Cabinet The Finance Ministry places the consolidated budget before the Cabinet.\nAfter the approval of the Cabinet, the budget can be presented to the Parliament. It must be mentioned\nhere that the budget is a secret document and should not be leaked out before it is presented to the\nParliament."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

This legalises the receipts and\nexpenditure of the government. This means that the government can neither collect money nor spend\nmoney without the enactment of the budget.\n\nStages in Enactment\n\nThe budget goes through the following six stages in the Parliament:\nPresentation of budget\n\nGeneral discussion\n\nScrutiny by departmental committees\n\nVoting on demands for grants\n\nPassing of Appropriation Bill\n\nPassing of Finance Bill\n\nPresentation of Budget Rule 213 of the Lok Sabha provides for the presentation of the budget to\nthe Lok Sabha in two or more parts, and when such presentation takes place, each part shall be dealt\nwith in the manner as if it were the budget. Accordingly, the budget is presented in two parts—\nRailway Budget and General Budget. Both are governed by the same procedure.\n\nThe introduction of Railway Budget precedes that of the General Budget. While the former is\npresented to the Lok Sabha by the Railway Minister in the third week of February, the latter is\npresented to the Lok Sabha by the Finance Minister on the last working day of February.\n\nThe Finance Minister presents the General Budget with a speech known as the ‘budget speech’. At\nthe end of the budget speech in the Lok Sabha, the budget is laid before the Rajya Sabha which can\nonly discuss it and has no power to vote on the demand for grants.\n\nThe documents that are also presented to the Lok Sabha along with the budget are:\n\nAn explanatory memorandum on the budget\n\nAn Appropriation Bill\n\nA Finance Bill containing the taxation proposals\nAnnual reports of the ministries\n\nEconomic classification of the budget\n\nEarlier, the economic survey report prepared by the Finance Ministry also used to be presented to\n\n\nthe Lok Sabha along with the budget. Now, it is presented a few days before the presentation of the\nbudget.\n\nGeneral Discussion The general discussion on budget begins a few days after its presentation. It\ntakes place in both the houses of Parliament and lasts usually for three to four days. It is a British\nlegacy.\n\nDuring this stage, the Lok Sabha can discuss the budget as a whole or on any question of principle\ninvolved therein but no cut motion shall be moved nor shall the budget be submitted to the vote of the\nHouse. The Finance Minister shall have a general right of reply at the end of the discussion.\n\nScrutiny by Departmental Committees After the general discussion on the budget is over, the\nHouses are adjourned for about three to four weeks. During this gap period, the 24 departmental\nstanding committees of the Parliament examine and discuss in detail the demands for grants of the\nconcerned ministries and prepare reports on them. These reports are submitted to both the Houses of\nParliament for consideration.\n\nThe standing committee system established is 1993 makes parliamentary financial control over the\nministries much more detailed, close, in-depth and comprehensive.\n\nVoting on Demands for Grants In the light of the reports of the departmental standing committees,\nthe Lok Sabha takes up voting of demands for grants. The demands are presented ministrywise. A\ndemand becomes a grant after it has been duly voted.\n\nTwo points should be noted in this context. One, the voting of demands for grants is the exclusive\nprivilege of the Lok Sabha, that is, the Rajya Sabha has no power of voting the demands. Second, the\nvoting is confined to the votable part of the budget—the expenditure charged on the Consolidated\nFund of India is not submitted to the vote (it can only be discussed).\n\nWhile the General Budget has totally 109 demands (103 for civil expenditure and 6 for defence\nexpenditure), the Railway Budget has 32 demands. Each demand is voted separately by the Lok\nSabha. During this stage, the members of Parliament can discuss the details of the budget. They can\nalso move motions to reduce any demand for grant. Such motions are called as ‘cut motions’ which\nare of three kinds:\n\nDisapproval of Policy Cut Motion It represents the disapproval of the policy underlying the\ndemand. It states that the amount of the demand be reduced to * 1. The members can also advocate an\nalternative policy.\n\nEconomy Cut Motion \\t represents the economy that can be affected in the proposed expenditure. It\nstates that the amount of the demand be reduced by a specified amount (which may be either a\nlumpsum reduction in the demand or omission or reduction of an item in the demand).\n\nToken Cut Motion It ventilates a specific grievance which is within the sphere of responsibility of\nthe Government of India. It states that the amount of the demand be reduced by * 100.\n\nThe significance of a cut motion lies in two things:\n(a) It facilitates the initiation of concentrated discussion on a specific demand for grant; and\n(b) It upholds the principle of responsible government by probing the activities of the government.\n\nHowever, the cut motions do not have much utility in practice. They are only moved and discussed\nin the house but not passed as the government enjoys majority support. Their passage by the Lok\n\n\nSabha amounts to the expression of want of parliamentary confidence in the government and may lead\nto its resignation.\n\nIn total, 26 days are allotted for the voting of demands. On the last day (i.e. 26th day) the Speaker\nputs all the remaining demands to vote and disposes them whether they have been discussed by the\nmembers or not. This is called as ‘Guillotine’.\n\nPassing of Appropriation Bill The Constitution states that “no money shall be withdrawn from the\nConsolidated Fund of India except under appropriation made by law.” Accordingly, an Appropriation\nBill is introduced to provide for the appropriation out of the Consolidated Fund of India all money\nrequired to meet:\n\n(i) The grants voted by the Lok Sabha.\n(ii) The expenditure charged on the Consolidated Fund of India.\n\nNo such amendment can be proposed to the Appropriation Bill in either house of the Parliament\nwhich will have the effect of varying the amount or altering the destination of any grant voted, or of\nvarying the amount of any expenditure charged on the Consolidated Fund of India.\n\nThe Appropriation Bill becomes the Appropriation Act after it is assented to by the President. This\nAct authorises (or legalises) the payments from the Consolidated Fund of India. This means that the\nGovernment cannot withdraw money from the Consolidated Fund of India till the enactment of the\nAppropriation Bill. This takes time and usually goes on till the end of April. But the government\nneeds money to carry on its normal activities after 31st March (the end of the financial year). To\novercome this functional difficulty, the Constitution has authorised the Lok Sabha to make any grant in\nadvance in respect to the estimated expenditure for a part of the financial year, pending the\ncompletion of the voting of the demands for grants and the enactment of the Appropriation Bill. This\nprovision is known as the ‘Vote on Account’. It is passed (or granted) after the general discussion on\nbudget is over. It is generally granted for two months for an amount equivalent to one-sixth of the total\nestimation.\n\nPassing of Finance Bill Under Rule 219 of the Lok Sabha, the ‘Finance Bill’ means the Bill\nordinarily introduced in each year to give effect to the financial proposals of the Government of India\nfor the next following financial year, and includes a bill to give effect to supplementary financial\nproposals for any period. It is subjected to all the conditions applicable to a Money Bill. Unlike the\nAppropriation Bill, the amendments (seeking to reject or reduce a tax) can be moved in the case of\nFinance Bill.\n\nAccording to the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act of 1931, the Finance Bill must be enacted\n(i.e. passed by the Parliament and assented to by the President) within 75 days.\n\nThe Finance Act legalises the income side of the budget and completes the process of the enactment\nof the budget."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

In other words, the overall responsibility regarding the\nexecution of the budget lies with the Finance Ministry—the central financial agency of the\nGovernment of India.\n\nExpenditure Part\n\nThe financial control exercised by the Finance Ministry has been very tight due to the excessive\nconcentration of financial authority in it.

Translate the following text into Hindi accurately, preserving the original meaning and context."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The various sources of funds to finance economic development in the modern states are (i) taxation,\n(ii) public borrowing, (iii) government savings, (iv) surplus of public enterprises, (v) deficit\nfinancing, and (vi) external assistance.\n\nWhen the government cannot raise sufficient resources through taxation, public borrowing and so\non, it resorts to deficit financing to meet its development expenditure.\n\nMeaning\n\nDeficit financing, in general, refers to any public expenditure that is in excess of current public\nrevenue.\n\nIn the Western countries and the USA, the term ‘deficit financing’ is used in a wider sense while, in\nIndia, it is used in a narrower sense.\n\nIn the Western countries and the USA, government expenditure financed through public borrowings\n(i.e. from people, commercial banks, and the Central Bank) are included in deficit financing.\n\nIn India, on the other hand, government expenditure financed through borrowing from people and\ncommercial banks are excluded from deficit financing. These are known as market borrowings.\n\nAccording to the Planning Commission, deficit financing in India includes:\n\n(i) withdrawal of past accumulated cash balances by the government;\n\n(ii) borrowing from the Central Bank, that is, the Reserve Bank of India; and\n\n(iii) Issuing of new currency.\n\nAs observed by Misra and Puri, “when government borrows from the Reserve Bank of India, it\nmerely transfers its securities to the Bank which, on the basis of these securities, issues more notes\nand puts them into circulation on behalf of the government. This accounts to creation of money”.\n\nIn short, the deficit financing in the Indian context connotes direct increase in money supply through\nthe issue of fresh currency by the government in order to meet the budget deficit.\n\nConcepts\nThe Government of India recognises five concepts of deficit financing. They are:\n\n1. Revenue Deficit When revenue expenditure of the government is more than its revenue receipts,\nit is known as revenue deficit. The revenue expenditure of the government comprises the resources\nspent on those items which do not create assets like expenditure on civil administration, defence, law\nand order, justice, interest payment, subsidies and so on. The revenue receipts of the government\nincludes tax revenues and non-tax revenues.\n\n2. Budget Deficit When the total expenditure of the government is more than its total receipts, it is\nknown as budget deficit or overall budgetary deficit. The total expenditure of the government includes\nboth revenue expenditure and capital expenditure. Similarly, the total receipts of the government\nincludes both revenue receipts and capital receipts.\n\n3. Fiscal Deficit Since 1950, the Government recognised the above two concepts of deficit. Later in\n1986, the third concept of deficit, called fiscal deficit, was introduced on the recommendation of the\nSukhmoy Chakravarty Committee (1982-1985) on the Review of the Working of the Monetary System\nin India. The fiscal deficit refers to budgetary deficit plus market borrowings and other liabilities of\nthe government. It measures the total borrowing requirements of the government from both internal\nand external sources.\n\n4. Primary Deficit It indicates the fiscal deficit minus amount of interest paid by the government. It\nis also known as non-interest deficit. This concept of deficit was introduced recently.\n\n5. Monetised Deficit The budget deficit can be financed in two ways: either by borrowing from the\n\n\npublic or by borrowing from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). When it is financed through borrowing\nfrom the RBI, it is called Monetised Deficit. In other words, it is increase in the net RBI credit to the\nGovernment.\n\nRole\nModern states have resorted to deficit financing under three different circumstances:\n\n1. Depression The developed countries of Europe and USA resorted to deficit financing during the\ngreat depression of 1930s to deal with the problem of mass unemployment. It was J.M. Keynes who\nsuggested the logic of deficit financing to fight cyclical depressions in capitalist countries and to\neliminate mass unemployment. He opined that the main cause of unemployment in a developed\ncountry is lack of effective demand (for goods) which depends on the propensity for consumption. To\novercome this problem, Keynes suggested deficit financing to finance public works projects. In case\npublic works are not available, the governments should, according to Keynes, ask people to “dig\nwells and fill wells”. This increases the purchasing power of people and results in effective demand\nfor goods. This further increases employment which again increases effective demand and hence\nemployment and so on. Keynes called it “multiplier effect”. In this way, the economy can be revived\nand lifted from the morass of depression.\n\n2. Economic Development The developing countries including India have resorted to deficit\nfinancing for financing economic development. This is because, these countries do not have sufficient\nresources to finance public investment to accelerate the process of development. The deficit financing\nhelps rapid capital formation for economic development. It breaks bottlenecks and structural\nrigidities in the economy and thereby increases productivity. Thus, it provides stimulus to economic\ndevelopment by financing investment, employment and output in the economy. However, it has a\nnegative effect on the economy, that is, inflationary rise in prices of goods and services. This is\nbecause, the deficit financing increases the supply of money in the economy without a corresponding\nincrease in supply of goods and services. This inflationary character of deficit financing changes the\npattern of investment by people, results in forced savings, adversely affects balance of payments,\nincreases economic inequalities, increases credit creation by banks and so on.\n\n3. War The modern states have also resorted to deficit financing to finance war operations. The\nfinancial resources raised by the governments through taxation and borrowing do not suffice to meet\nthe cost of war. Hence, the governments have no alternative except to create new money by printing\nmore currency. This war deficit financing brings in circulation a large quantity of money in the\neconomy. This increases the monetary incomes and demand for goods. Such a situation results in\ninflation due to absence of corresponding increase in supply of goods.\n\nSafe Limit\n\nDeficit financing is a necessary evil. On the one hand, it is essential for economic development and\non the other hand, it is intrinsically inflationary in nature. Hence, it should be kept within the safe\nlimit so that it leads to capital formation without inflationary rise in prices.

Translate the following text into Hindi accurately, preserving the original meaning and context."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Meaning\n\nPublic debt is an instrument of resource mobilisation by the modern government. The revenue raised\nthrough taxation and other sources is not sufficient to meet the increased expenditure of the\ngovernment. Revenue from taxation cannot be raised beyond a certain limit while, the deficit\nfinancing becomes inflationary when it crosses the safe limit. Hence the government has to resort to\npublic debt to accelerate the process of development.\n\nPublic debt denotes borrowing by the government from the people, banks, financial institutions and\nso on. It is the debt incurred by the government in mobilising resources in the form of loans, which\nare to be repaid at a future date with interest.\n\nClassification\nPublic debt is classified in the following ways:\n\n1. Internal and External When the government borrows within the country, it is called internal\ndebt. When the government, on the other hand, borrows from outside the country, it is called external\ndebt. Internally, the government borrows from individuals, business establishments, financial\ninstitutions, commercial banks, and central bank. Externally, it borrows from foreigners, foreign\n\n\nbanks, foreign governments, and international institutions. Unlike internal debt, external debt involves\nmaterial loss to the debtor country.\n\n2. Voluntary and Compulsory When the government borrows by issuing securities to which people\nare free to subscribe, it is called voluntary debt. When the government, on the other hand, enforces\nborrowing through legal compulsion, it is called compulsory debt. Generally, public debts are\nvoluntary in nature. The government resorts to compulsory loan under extraordinary circumstances\nlike war, famine, or to curb inflation.\n\n3. Productive and Unproductive Productive debt is one which is incurred for those projects which\nyield income to the government. For example, the debt incurred to meet expenditure on power\nprojects, irrigation projects, public enterprises, and railways. The income derived from these assets\nis used to pay the interest and the principal of the debt. Unproductive debt, on the other hand, is one\nwhich neither yields any income to the government nor creates any asset. For example, debt incurred\nto cover any budgetary deficit or to finance war, earthquake, famine and drought. Hicks called these\ntwo types of debts as active debt and dead weight debt respectively.\n\n4. Funded and Unfunded Funded debt is a long-term debt, payable after a year, while unfunded debt\nis a short-term debt, payable within a year. The former is incurred to create a permanent asset,\nwhereas the latter is incurred to meet temporary gap in budget. Unfunded debt is also known as\nfloating debt and includes treasury bills, ways and means advances from central bank and so on.\n\n5. Redeemable and Irredeemable When the government borrows money with a promise to pay off\nin future at a specified date, it is known as redeemable debt. When the government, on the other hand,\nborrows without any intention to repay the same in future, it is known as irredeemable debt.\nHowever, the government continues to pay the interest on such loans. The redeemable and\nirredeemable debts are also known as terminable and perpetual debts.\n\nA situation in which borrowings have to be resorted to just keep up with the servicing of debt is\nknown as ‘debt trap’. Debt servicing denotes payment of interest on debts as well as repayment of\ninstalments of debts. The debt trap could be both internal and external.\n\nRedemption\n\nRedemption of public debt means repayment of public debt. There are various methods of redemption\nof public debt:\n\n1. Refunding In this method, the government issues new bonds and securities in order to repay the\nmatured loans. In other words, matured or old debts are replaced by new debts. Hence, the money\nburden of the debt is not relinquished. Rather, it is accumulated due to the postponement of debt\nrepayment.\n\n2. Terminable Annuities In this method, public debt is repaid in equal instalments. The government\n\nrepays a part of the debt every year by issuing terminable annuities. Thus, the debt goes on\ndiminishing annually and finally it vanishes.\n\n3. Conversion When the rate of interest falls, the government converts the old loan into a new loan\nand thus reduces its interest payments. It may be compulsory or voluntary. Unlike refunding,\n\n\nconversion involves changes in terms of loan including rate of interest. Dalton called this conversion\nprocess a ‘Partial repudiation.’\n\n4. Sinking Fund It connotes a ‘debt redemption fund’. It involves the creation and the gradual\naccumulation of a separate fund by the government every year from its revenues to repay the debt.\nAlthough, it is the most systematic method of redemption, it is a slow process and the government may\nencroach upon it during a financial crisis.\n\n5. New Taxation In this method, the government imposes new taxes and raises money for the\nrepayment of old debts. It transfers the resources from tax-payers to the bond holders and thus causes\nredistribution of income and wealth in the community.\n\n6. Capital Levy It connotes a special ‘redemption levy’. Under this method, there will be single but\nvery heavy taxation on the property and wealth of individuals; levied once for all for the clearance of\nthe debt. It is usually levied after a war to repay the unproductive war debts. Its merit is that the\ncountry is thereby freed from the burden of interest payment in future.\n\n7. Surplus Budget Under the surplus budget (income exceeding expenditure), the government is left\nwith some money which can be used for the clearance of debts. A surplus budget can be realised in\ntwo ways: (a) through heavy taxation, or (b) through reduction in government expenditure.\n\n8. Surplus BOP The repayment of external debt requires a surplus balance of payments (BOP).\nHence, the government should accumulate the necessary foreign exchange by creating export surplus\nand by reducing imports. Temporarily, the external debt can be repaid through the floating of new\nexternal loans.\n\n9. Currency Expansion Under this method, the government prints more currency to repay the debts.\nThis results in inflation and destroys the value of fixed money claims. This method was used by\nGermany after the First World War (1914-1918).\n\n10. Repudiation In this method, the government refuses to pay the interest or principal or both. In\nother words, the government does not recognise its obligation to repay the loans taken by it. In 1917,\nUSSR repudiated all its debts, both internal and external."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Below is an excerpt from my book titled 'Understanding governance in india for upsc', specifically from Chapter 'ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT', Section 'ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT'. Translate the following text into Hindi accurately, preserving the original meaning and context."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Meaning of Accounts\n\nThe term ‘Accounts’ is defined as “Statements of facts relating to money or things having money\nvalue.” The facts which are incorporated in the records of accounts are called ‘transactions’. Thus,\naccounting means keeping a systematic record of financial transactions. It involves the collection,\nrecording, classifying and summarising transactions of a financial nature and interpreting the results\nthereof.\n\nAccounting has three purposes— (i) the determination of the fidelity of those handling funds; (ii)\nthe furnishing of information regarding financial conditions and operations for policy-making and\nadministrative purposes; and (iii) the keeping of expenditure within the budgetary provisions and\n\n\nlimitations.\n\nMeaning of Audit\n\nAudit is an important means of legislative control over financial administration. It is an instrument of\nenforcing accountability of administration to the legislature. It is a part of external control over\nadministration.\n\nAudit is an examination of the accounts in order to discover and report to the legislature the\nunauthorised, illegal or irregular expenditures and unsound financial practices on the part of\nadministration. Its objective is to see that the expenditure is incurred with the sanctions of the\ncompetent authority, and made for the purpose for which it was sanctioned by the legislature.\n\nThe audit can be either post-audit or pre-audit. If the audit occurs after the money is spent, it is\ncalled post-audit. On the other hand, if the audit occurs before the money is spent or during the\nprocess of spending, it is referred to as pre-audit or concurrent audit.\n\nRole of Audit\nThe following points highlight the role of audit in the modern state:\n\nRegulatory Audit It is concerned with the legal and technical aspects of expenditure by the\nadministration. It ensures the conformity of expenditure to laws, rules and regulations and sees that it\nis supported by adequate vouchers. Hence, it is also known as legal audit.\n\nPropriety Audit It is concerned with the wisdom, faithfulness and economy of expenditure. It\ndetects cases of extravagance and waste even when the expenditure is incurred according to laws,\nrules and regulations.\n\nPerformance Audit It is concerned with the appraisal of accomplishments. It measures the\nperformance of administration against the expenditure incurred. Hence, it is also known as efficiency\naudit.\n\nSeparation of Accounts from Audit\n\nTill 1976, accounting and auditing functions were combined in the office of the Comptroller and\nAuditor-General of India. In other words, he was responsible for both the compilation and\nmaintenance of accounts as well as their auditing, not only with respects to the Central Government\nbut also the state governments. This combined arrangement was a relic of the British rule and came to\nbe criticised. Accordingly, the Inchcape Committee (1923), the Muddiman Committee (1924), the\nSimon Commission (1929), the Public Accounts Committee and the Estimates Committee\nrecommended the separation of accounts from audit on following grounds.\n(i) The separation would increase the efficiency of Audit Department as it will be relieved of\naccounting responsibilities and can concentrate on audit functions only.\n(ii) The combined system has the inherent danger of frauds and embezzlements and prevent their\ncoming to light.\n(iii) The combination of the two functions in a single office is not appropriate as accounting is an\n\n\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n(vi)\n(vii)\n\n(viii)\n\n(ix)\n\nexecutive function while auditing is a quasi-parliamentary function.\n\nThe combined system requires the Comptroller and Auditor-General to audit the accounts\nwhich are compiled by himself. This places him in a highly embarrassing position and is\nagainst the practice of other modern governments which have separated the two functions.\n\nThe separation makes the spending departments not to exceed the appropriations sanctioned\nby the Parliament as they are entrusted with the accounting responsibilities.\n\nThe separation would increase the independence of audit, as the combined system runs\ncounter to the principle of independence of audit.\n\nThe entrustment of accounting responsibilities to the departments would not only improve the\nsystem of accounting but also make them responsible.\n\nThe separation of the two functions by entrusting the accounting responsibilities to executive\ndepartments not only facilitates close budgeting but also more effective formulation of revised\nestimates by them.\n\nThe separation facilitates use of accounting in decision-making and financial management.\n\nDepartmentalisation of Accounts\n\nIn 1976, the Central Government separated accounting from audit by adopting the new scheme of\ndepartmentalisation of accounts. The salient features of the scheme of departmentalised management\naccounting system are as follows:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\nThe Comptroller and Auditor-General of India was relieved of the responsibility of the\n\ncompilation and maintenance of accounts of the Central Government and is now concerned\n\nwith their auditing only. However, he continues to be responsible for the compilation and\n\nmaintenance of accounts of the states which have not separated accounts from audit.\n\nThe administrative departments have taken over most of the payment and receipt functions\n\nfrom the treasuries. In other words, they have assumed responsibility for making payments and\n\ntheir accounting.\n\nThe Secretary of the ministry is designated as the chief accounting authority for all the\n\ntransactions of the Ministry as well as its attached and subordinate offices. He is totally\n\nresponsible for the working of the payment and accounting setup, and is also responsible for\n\nthe certification of the monthly accounts. He discharges this responsibility through and with\n\nthe assistance of the Integrated Financial Advisor of the Ministry.\n\nThe Integrated Financial Advisor is the head of the payment and accounting organisation of the\n\nministry. On behalf of the chief accounting authority (i.e. Secretary of the Ministry), he is\n\nresponsible for the following:\n\n(a) Formulation of the budget of the ministry and its departments.\n\n(b) Control of expenditure.\n\n(c) Arranging payments sanctioned by the ministry.\n\n(d) Consolidation of the accounts of the ministry as a whole.\n\n(e) Preparation of Appropriation Accounts for the grants controlled by the ministry.\n\n(f) Introduction of an efficient system of management best suited to the functional\nrequirements of the ministry and its departments.\n\n(g) Internal audit of payments and accounts.\n\n(h) Ensuring accuracy of accounts and efficiency of operations.\n\n\nIn the performance of the above duties, the Integrated Financial Advisor is assisted by principal\naccounts officers, the heads of pay and accounts offices, the Chief Controller of Accounts, and the\nController of Accounts.\n\nController General of Accounts\n\nIn 1976, a new office of the Controller General of Accounts was established as a part of the\nDepartment of Expenditure of the Ministry of Finance. He is to administer matters relating to the\ndepartmentalisation of accounts of the Central Government. He is the technical authority heading the\nnew accounting setup of Central Government. He is responsible for the following:\n\n(i) He prescribes general principles and form of accounts of Central as well as state governments\nand frames rules and manuals relating thereto.\n\n(ii) He carries out the budget control, payments, receipt collection and accounting functions for\nthe Central Government.\n\n(iii) He provides regular feedback to the Finance Minister and other line ministries on the status of\ngovernment finances.\n\n(iv) He provides technical advice to all civil ministries and departments on various accounting\nmatters. His advice is binding on them.\n\n(v) He is responsible for disbursement and accounting of pension payments to government\nemployees retiring from all civil ministries.\n\n(vi) He conducts the internal audit of the expenditure incurred by the various ministries and\ndepartments of the Central Government to bring out the financial irregularities.\n\n(vii) He is responsible for the evaluation and processing of proposals relating to the capital\nrestructuring and disinvestments of various public sector undertakings of the Central\nGovernment. This job was entrusted to him in 1989.\n\n(viii) He manages the cadre of the Indian Civil Accounts Service and the total accounts’ personnel\ndeployed in civil ministries and is responsible for the entire gamut of personnel management\nin relation to them.\n\n(ix) He consolidates the monthly and annual accounts of the Central Government.\n\n(x) He administers rules under Article 283 of the Constitution. This article deals with the custody\nand other aspects of Consolidated Fund, Contingency Fund and moneys credited to the Public\nAccounts.\n\n(ix) He prepares a condensed form of the Appropriation Accounts and Finance Accounts of the\nCentral Government. These, after getting audited by the Comptroller and Auditor-General of\nIndia, are placed before the Parliament by the President.\n\nThe Appropriation Accounts compare the actual expenditure under various grants with the amount\nof voted grants as specified in the Appropriation Act passed by the Parliament. On the other hand, the\nFinance Accounts shows (under the respective heads) the annual receipts and disbursements for the\npurposes of the Central Government.\n\nStructure of Accounts\n\nAccording to Article 150 of the Constitution, the form of the accounts of the Central and state\ngovernments is prescribed by the President of India on the advice of the Comptroller and Auditor-\n\n\nGeneral of India. Rule 204 of Lok Sabha states that the budget shall be presented to the Lok Sabha in\nsuch a form as the Finance Minister may (after considering the suggestions, if any, of the Estimates\nCommittee) settle. In practice, the form of budget corresponds to the form of accounts.\n\nThe existing accounting practice could not meet the requirements of Performance Budgeting.\nConsequently, a revised accounting structure was introduced in 1974 by the Central Government to\nserve the objectives of management and the need of financial control and accountability.\n\nIn pursuance of this revised scheme, a five-tier classification of accounts has been adopted.\n\n\" Sectoral\nMajor Head\nMinor Head\nSubhead\nDetailed Head\n\nThe sectoral classification has divided the functions of government into 3 sectors—General\nServices (with six subsectors), Social and Community Services, and Economic Services (with seven\nsubsectors). In addition, there is a fourth sector, namely Grants-in-aid and Contributions.\n\nThe major head of account denotes a function of government (e.g. agriculture), while the minor\nhead is assigned to a programme (e.g. agricultural farms). The subhead denotes the scheme covered\nby a programme and the detailed head represents the expenditure on the scheme in terms of inputs like\nsalaries, investments, and so on.\n\nIn the new revised classification, the ‘Object Head’ (i.e. the object level of classification) has\nbeen retained and placed under the last tier. It provides item-wise control over expenditure.\n\nThe approval of the Comptroller and Auditor-General of India is required for any change in the\nmajor head."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

These forces are also known as the Central Para-Military Forces\n(CPMFs).\n\nThe AR, BSF, ITBP and SSB are the border guarding forces while the CRPF assists the states in\nmatters related to law and order and is trained and equipped for internal security management.\n\nThe Rapid Action Force (RAF) and Commando Battalion for Resolute Action (CoBRA) are\nspecialised wings of the CRPF to deal with riots and left wing militancy respectively.\n\nThe CISF provides security and protection to vital installations, Public Sector Undertakings\n(PSUs), airports, industrial buildings, museums and government buildings.\n\nThe NSG is a specialised force for counter-terrorism and anti-hijacking operations. It is also\nentrusted with the task of securing high risk VIPs.\n\nThe RPF is meant for providing security and maintenance of order in railways and their\npassengers/goods areas.\n\n1. Assam Rifles (AR): Known as ‘Friends of the Hill People’, the AR, raised initially as\n\n“‘Cachar Levy’ in 1835, is the oldest police force in the country with headquarters at Shillong.\n\nThe AR has dual role of maintaining internal security in the states in the North Eastern\nRegion and guarding the Indo-Myanmar Border.\n\n2. Border Security Force (BSF): The BSF was raised in 1965 to do away with multiplicity of\nstate forces guarding the Indian borders with the neighbouring countries.\n\nThe operational responsibility of BSF is spread over International Border with Pakistan and\nBangladesh. It is also deployed on Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu & Kashmir.\n\n3. Central Industrial Security Force (CISF): Raised in the year 1969, the CISF is mandated to\nprovide security to major critical infrastructure installations of the country in diverse regions\nincluding terrorist and naxal affected areas. It is currently providing security cover to 289\nunits which include Atomic Power Plants, Space Installations, Defence Production Units,\nMines, Oil Fields and Refineries, Major Sea Ports, Heavy Engineering Steel Plants, Fertilizer\nunits, Airports, Hydro electric/thermal power plants, etc.\n\nThe CISF is also one of the largest fire protection service providers in the country. It\nprovides fire protection cover to 80 industrial undertakings.\n\nThe CISF Act was amended to enable the force to provide security, on payment basis, to\nprivate/joint venture industrial undertakings, which are vital for the security and economy of\nthe country.\n\n4. Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF): Initially raised as the Crown Representative Police\nin 1939 at Neemuch, Madhya Pradesh, the Force was rechristened Central Reserve Police\nForce (CRPF) after Independence. Since then, the Force has achieved remarkable growth in\nstrength and capabilities.

Later, some states have also enacted their own State Police Acts, mostly on the lines of the\n1861 Act.

According to the Indian Police Act of\n1861, the administration of police in a district is vested in the SP, but subject to the general control\nand direction of the District Magistrate (i.e., District Collector). Thus, there is a system of dual\ncontrol of law and order in the district, that is, control by the district magistrate and control by the\ndepartmental line headed by the DGP.\n\nA district is divided into a number of police sub-divisions.

Subsequently, the concept of the voluntary citizens’\nforce was adopted by several states. In the wake of Chinese aggression in 1962, the Centre advised\nthe states and union territories to merge their existing voluntary organisation into one uniform\n\nvoluntary force known as Home Guards.\n\nFunctions The functions of Home Guards are as follows:\n1. To serve as an auxiliary to the police in the maintenance of law and order and internal\nsecurity situations\nTo help the community in any kind of emergency such as an air-raid, fire, cyclone, earthquake,\nepidemic, etc.\nTo help in maintenance of essential services\nTo promote communal harmony and assist the administration in protecting weaker sections\nTo participate in socio-economic and welfare activities\nTo perform civil defence duties\n\nLd\n\nAnPw\n\nOrganisation Home Guards are of two types—tural and urban. In the border states, Border Wing\nHome Guards Battalions have also been raised, which serve as an auxiliary to the Border Security\nForce. The total strength of Home Guards in the country is 5,73,793 against which the raised strength\nis of 5,04,621 Home Guards. The organisation is spread over in all states and union territories except\nin Kerala.\n\nRecruitment Home Guards are raised under the Home Guards Act and Rules of the states/union\nterritories. They are recruited from various cross sections of the people such as doctors, engineers,\nlawyers, private sector organisations, college and university students, agricultural and industrial\nworkers, etc., who give their spare time to the organisation for betterment of the community. All\ncitizens of India, who are in the age group of 18—S0, are eligible to become members of Home\nGuards. Normal tenure of membership in Home Guards is three to five years.\n\nFacilities The amenities and facilities given to Home Guards include free uniform, duty allowances\nand awards for gallantry, distinguished and meritorious services. A Home Guard, whenever called\nout for duty/training, is paid duty/training allowance at prescribed rates to meet out-of-pocket\nexpenses.\n\nTraining The members of Home Guards with three years service in the organisation are trained by\nthe police in maintenance of law and order, prevention of crime, anti-dacoity measures, border\npatrolling, prohibition, flood relief, fire-fighting, election duties and social welfare activities. In the\nevent of national emergency, some portion of civil defence work is also entrusted to the Home\nGuards.\n\nCentre-State Coordination The Ministry of Home Affairs formulates the policy in respect of role,\nraising, training, equipping, establishment and other important matters of Home Guards Organisation.\nThe expenditure on Home Guards is generally shared between Central and state governments in the\nratio of 25% by the Centre and 75% by the state governments for raising, training and equipping on\nreimbursement basis. For North-Eastern states, the sharing pattern between the Centre and states is in\nthe ratio of 50:50."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

It is to be organised as an integral\npart of the defence of the country.\n\nFunctions During times of war and emergencies, the Civil Defence Organisation has the vital role of\nguarding the hinterland, supporting the armed forces, mobilising the citizens and helping civil\nadministration for\n\n1. saving life and property\n\n2. minimizing damage\n\n3. maintaining continuity in production centers and\n\n4. raising public morale.\n\nThe concept of civil defence over the years has shifted from management of damage against\nconventional weapons to also include threat perceptions against nuclear weapons, biological and\nchemical warfare and natural disasters.\n\nPolicy The Civil Defence Act, 1968 is applicable throughout the country, but the Civil Defence\nOrganisation is raised only in such areas and zones which are considered vulnerable to enemy\nattacks. The revision and renewal of categorised civil defence towns is being done at regular\nintervals, with the level of perceived threat with regards to external aggression or hostile attacks by\nanti-national elements or terrorists to vital installations, being the fundamental criterion for\ncategorisation. At present, civil defence activities are restricted to 225 categorised towns, spread\nover the states/union territories.\n\nOrganisation Civil Defence is primarily organised on a voluntary basis except for a small nucleus\nof permanent staff and establishment, which is augmented during emergencies. The present target of\ncivil defence volunteers is 13.20 lakh, out of which 5.51 lakh volunteers have already been raised\nand 4.61 lakh have been trained. These volunteers are supervised and trained by Deputy Controllers,\nMedical Officers and Civil Defence Instructors, who hold permanent posts.\n\nTraining Apart from carrying out training and rehearsal/demonstration of civil defence measures\nduring peace time, civil defence volunteers are also deployed, on a voluntary basis, in various\nconstructive and nation building activities, which include providing assistance to the administration\nin undertaking social and welfare services and in the prevention/mitigation of natural/man-made\ndisasters as well as in post-disaster response and relief operations. The civil defence training is\nconducted by the state governments/UT administrations in three tiers, i.e. at the local/town level, state\nlevel and national level.\n\nRole in Law and Order The scheme for revamping the civil defence set-up in the country, which\nhas been launched in 2009, focuses on the training of civil defence volunteers in the following areas :\n1. Intelligence gathering, maintenance of communal harmony, prevention of rumour mongering,\nreporting of suspicious activities and maintaining general vigil in the area of their operation\n2. Assisting police in law and order situations, etc.\n3. Rescue and relief operation during manmade disasters\n4. Evacuation of casualties and providing first-aid"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Translate the following text into Hindi accurately, preserving the original meaning and context."}, {"role": "user", "content": "In any representative democratic government, whether Parliamentary or Presidential, the legislature is\nthe supreme organ of the government as it consists of the representatives of the people. It reflects the\nwill of the people and acts as a custodian of the interests of the people. Hence, it exercises control\nover administration to hold it accountable and responsible. However, the system of legislative\ncontrol over administration in a parliamentary form of government (India and UK) differs from such a\ncontrol in a presidential form of government (USA).\n\nLegislative Control Under Parliamentary System\n\nThe parliamentary system of government prevalent in India is based on the principle of collective\nresponsibility. It means that the ministers are responsible to the Parliament for their policies and\nactions. Thus, the legislative control over administration under such a system is only indirect, that is,\nthrough ministers. The officials (administrators) cannot be held responsible to the Parliament directly.\nThey take shelter behind the principle of ministerial responsibility and remain anonymous. In other\nwords, it is the minister who assumes responsibility for the actions of the administrators working\nunder his ministry/department.\n\nThe Parliament exercises control over administration through the executive in the following ways.\n\n(i) General control over the policies and actions of the government through questions,\ndiscussions, motions and resolutions.\n\n(ii) Financial control through budget and audit.\n\n(iii) Detailed control over financial, administrative and legislative matters through committees.\n\nThe various techniques/methods/tools of parliamentary control are as follows.\n\nLaw Making It is the primary function of the Parliament. The Parliament lays down the policies of\nthe government by making (enacting) or changing (amending) or cancelling (repealing) the laws.\nParliamentary laws determine and condition the organisation, structure, powers, functions and\nprocedures of the administration. However, the control exercised by the Parliament through the law-\nmaking process is in broad and general terms. The Parliament makes laws in a skeleton form and\nauthorises the executive to make detailed rules and regulations within the framework of the parent\nlaw. This is known as delegated legislation or executive legislation or subordinate legislation. Such\nrules and regulations are placed before the Parliament for its examination.\n\n\nQuestion Hour (Interpellations) The first hour of every parliamentary sitting is slotted for this.\nDuring this time, the MPs ask questions and the ministers usually give answers. The questions are of\nthree kinds, viz. starred, unstarred and short notice.\n\nA starred question is one which is distinguished by an asterisk. It requires an oral answer and\nhence supplementary questions can follow.\n\nAn unstarred question, on the other hand, is one which is not distinguished by an asterisk. It\nrequires a written answer and hence, supplementary questions cannot follow.\n\nA short notice question is one which is asked by giving a notice of less than ten days. It is\nanswered orally.\n\nQuestions (or interpellations) are effective tools of legislative control over administration and\nkeeps the civil service alert and on its toes. Earl Attlee, the former Prime Minister of Britain, said, “I\nalways consider that question time in the House as one of the finest examples of real democracy. The\neffect of questions to the Minister and still more questions asked publicly in the House, is to keep the\nwhole of the civil service on their toes.” Similarly Hugh Gaitskell observed, “Anybody who has\nworked in a civil service department would agree with me that, if there is one major thing which\nleads civil servants to be excessively cautious, timid and careful and to keep records, which outside\nthe civil service would be regarded as unnecessary, it is the fear of parliamentary questions.”\n\nZero Hour Unlike the Question Hour, the Zero Hour is not mentioned in the rules of procedure. Thus\nit is an informal device available to the members of the Parliament to raise matters without any prior\nnotice. The Zero Hour starts immediately after the Question Hour and lasts until the agenda for the\nday (i.e. regular business of the House) is taken up. In other words, the time gap between the Question\nHour and the agenda is known as Zero Hour. It is an Indian innovation in the field of parliamentary\nprocedures and has been in existence since 1962.\n\nHalf-an-Hour Discussion It is meant for raising a discussion on a matter of sufficient public\nimportance which has been subjected to a lot of debate and the answer to which needs elucidation on\na matter of fact. The Speaker can allot three days in a week for such discussions. There is no formal\nmotion or voting before the House.\n\nShort Duration Discussion It is also known as two hour discussion as the time allotted for such a\ndiscussion should not exceed two hours. The members of the Parliament can raise such discussions on\na matter of urgent public importance. The Speaker can allot two days in a week for such discussions.\nThere is neither a formal motion before the house nor voting. This device has been in existence since\n1953.\n\nOther Discussions In addition to the above discussions, there are various other occasions available\nto the members of Parliament to raise discussions and debates to examine and criticise the\nadministration for its lapses and failures. These include the following:\n\n\" Inaugural speech of the President (that is, Motion of Thanks)\n\n\" Introduction of several Bills for enactment of laws (i.e. debates on legislation)\n\n\" Introduction and passing of resolutions on matters of general public interest\n\nCalling Attention It is a notice introduced in the Parliament by a member to call the attention of a\nminister to a matter of urgent public importance, and to seek an authoritative statement from him on\nthat matter. Like the Zero Hour, it is also an Indian innovation in the parliamentary procedure and has\nbeen in existence since 1954. However, unlike the Zero Hour, it is mentioned in the rules of\n\n\nprocedure.\n\nAdjournment Motion It is introduced in the Parliament to draw attention of the House to a matter of\nurgent public importance. This motion needs the support of 50 members to be admitted. As it\ninterrupts the normal business of the House, it is regarded as an extraordinary device. It involves an\nelement of censure against the government and hence Rajya Sabha is not permitted to make use of this\ndevice.\n\nNo Confidence Motion Article 75 of the Constitution states that the Council of Ministers shall be\ncollectively responsible to the Lok Sabha. It means that the ministry stays in office so long as it enjoys\nconfidence of the majority of the members of the Lok Sabha. In other words, the Lok Sabha can\nremove the ministry from office by passing the No Confidence Motion. The motion needs the support\nof 50 members to be admitted.\n\nCensure Motion A Censure Motion is different from a No Confidence Motion in the following\nrespects:\n\n#01 (0 ee Censure Motion vs No Confidence Motion\n\nCensure Motion No Confidence Motion\n\n1. It should state the reasons for its adoption 1. It need not state the reasons for its\nin the Lok Sabha adoption in the Lok Sabha.\n\nIt can be moved against an individual\nminister or a group of ministers or the\nentire council of ministers.\n\nIt is moved for censuring the council of\nministers for specific policies and actions.\nIf it is passed in the Lok Sabha, the\nCouncil of Ministers need not resign from\nthe office.\n\nIt can be moved against the entire Council\nof Ministers only\n\nIt is moved for ascertaining the confidence\nof Lok Sabha in the Council of Ministers.\nIf it is passed in the Lok Sabha, the\nCouncil of Ministers must resign from\noffice.\n\nBudgetary System This is the most important technique of parliamentary control over\nadministration. The Parliament controls the revenues and expenditures of the government through\nenactment of the budget. It is the ultimate authority to sanction the raising and spending of government\nfunds. It can criticise the policies and actions of the government and point out the lapses and failures\nof administration during the process of enactment of the budget.\n\nUnless the Appropriation Bill and the Finance Bill are passed, the executive cannot incur\nexpenditure and collect taxes respectively. (For details see chapter on “Financial Administration”).\n\nAudit System This is an important tool of parliamentary control over administration. The\nComptroller and Auditor General of India [CAG], on behalf of the Parliament, audits the accounts of\ngovernment and submits an annual ‘Audit Report’ about the financial transactions of the government.\nThe report of CAG highlights the improper, illegal, unwise, uneconomical and irregular expenditures\nof the government. The CAG is an agent of the Parliament and is responsible only to it (i.e.\nParliament). Thus the financial accountability of the government to the Parliament is secured through\nthe Audit Report of the CAG.\n\n\nPublic Accounts Committee This committee was set up first in India in 1921 under the provisions\nof the Government of India Act of 1919 and has since been in existence. At present, it consists of 22\nmembers (15 from the Lok Sabha and 7 from the Rajya Sabha). The members are elected by the\nParliament every year from amongst its members according to the principle of proportional\nrepresentation by means of the single transferable vote. Thus, all parties get due representation in it.\nThe term of office of the members is one year. A minister cannot be elected as a member of the\nCommittee. The Chairman of the Committee is appointed by the Speaker from amongst its members.\nUntil 1966-67, the Chairman of the Committee belonged to the ruling party. However, since then (i.e.\n1967) a convention has developed whereby the Chairman of the Committee is selected invariably\nfrom the Opposition.\n\nThe function of the Committee is to examine the annual audit reports of the Comptroller and\nAuditor-General of India (CAG) which are laid before the Parliament by the President. In this\nfunction, the Committee is assisted by the CAG.\n\nThe CAG submits three audit reports to the president, namely, audit report on appropriation\naccounts, audit report on finance accounts and audit report on public undertakings.\n\nThe committee examines public expenditure not only from the legal and formal point of view to\ndiscover technical irregularities but also from the point of view of economy, prudence, wisdom and\npropriety to bring out the cases of waste, loss, corruption, extravagance, inefficiency and nugatory\nexpenses.\n\nEstimates Committee The origins of this committee can be traced to the Standing Financial\nCommittee setup in 1921. The first Estimates Committee in the post-independence era was constituted\nin 1950 on the recommendation of John Mathai, the then Finance Minister. Originally, it had 25\nmembers but in 1956 its membership was raised to 30. All the thirty members are from Lok Sabha\nonly. The Rajya Sabha has no representation in this Committee. These members are elected by the\nLok Sabha every year from amongst its members, according to the principles of proportional\nrepresentation by means of a single transferable vote. Thus, all parties get due representation in it.\nThe term of office is one year. A minister cannot be elected as a member of the Committee. The\nChairman of the Committee is appointed by the Speaker from amongst its members. The Chairman of\nthe Committee is invariably from the ruling party.\n\nThe function of the Committee is to examine the estimates included in the budget and suggest\n‘economies’ in public expenditure. Hence, it has been described as a ‘continuous economy\ncommittee.’\n\nCommittee on Public Undertakings This Committee was created in 1964 on the recommendation\nof the Krishna Menon Committee. Originally, it had 15 members (10 from the Lok Sabha and 5 from\nthe Rajya Sabha). But in 1974, its membership was raised to 22 (15 from the Lok Sabha and 7 from\nthe Rajya Sabha). The members are elected by the Parliament every year from amongst its members\naccording to the principle of proportional representation by means of a single transferable vote. Thus,\nall parties get due representation in it. The term of office of the members is one year. A minister\ncannot be elected as a member of the Committee. The Chairman of the Committee is appointed by the\nSpeaker from amongst its members who are drawn from the Lok Sabha only. Thus, the members of the\nCommittee who are from the Rajya Sabha cannot be appointed as the Chairman.\n\nThe functions of the Committee are:\n\n(a) To examine the reports and accounts of public undertakings.\n\n(b) To examine the reports, if any, of the Comptroller and Auditor-General on public\n\n\nundertakings.\n\n(c) To examine, in the context of autonomy and efficiency of public undertakings, whether the\naffairs of the public undertakings are being managed in accordance with sound business\nprinciples and prudent commercial practices.\n\n(d) To exercise such other functions vested in the Committee on Public Accounts and the\nCommittee on estimates in relation to public undertakings as may be allotted to the Committee\nby the Speaker from time to time.\n\nCommittee on Subordinate Legislation This Committee was constituted in 1953. It consists of 15\nmembers including the Chairman, who are nominated by the Speaker. The term of office of the\nmembers is one year. A minister cannot be nominated as a member of the Committee. The Chairman\nof the Committee is drawn from the Opposition.\n\nThe function of the Committee is to examine and report to the Lok Sabha, whether the powers to\nmake regulations, rules, sub-rules, bye-laws and others, conferred by the Constitution or delegated by\nthe Parliament to the executive, are being properly exercised by it.\n\nCommittee on Government Assurances This Committee was constituted in 1953. It consists of 15\nmembers including the Chairman, who are nominated by the Speaker. The term of office of members\nis one year. A minister cannot be nominated as a member of the Committee.\n\nThe function of the Committee is to examine the assurances, promises, undertakings, and so on,\ngiven by ministers from time to time on the floor of the Lok Sabha, and to report on:\n\n(a) The extent to which such assurances, promises, undertakings have been implemented.\n\n(b) Whether such implementation has taken place within the minimum time necessary for the\n\npurpose.\n\nDepartmental Standing Committees On the recommendation of the Rules Committee of the Lok\nSabha, 17 departmentally related standing committees were set up in the Parliament in 1993. In 2004,\nseven more such committees were setup, thus increasing their number from 17 to 24.\n\nThe main objective of the standing committees is to secure more accountability of the Executive\n(i.e., the Council of Ministers) to the Parliament, particularly financial accountability. They also\nassist the Parliament in debating the budget more effectively.\n\nThe 24 standing committees cover under their jurisdiction all the ministries/departments of the\nCentral Government.\n\nEach standing committee consists of 31 members (21 from Lok Sabha and 10 from Rajya Sabha).\nThe members of the Lok Sabha are nominated by the Speaker from amongst its members, while the\nmembers of the Rajya Sabha are nominated by the Chairman from amongst its members.\n\nA minister is not eligible to be nominated as a member of any of the standing committee. In case a\nmember, after his nomination to any of the standing committee, is appointed as a minister, he then\nceases to be a member of the committee.\n\nThe term of office of each standing committee is one year from the date of its constitution.\n\nOut of the 24 standing committees, 8 committees work under the Rajya Sabha and 16 committees\nwork under the Lok Sabha.\n\nThe functions of each of the standing committees are:\n\n(a) To consider the demands for grants of the concerned ministries/departments and make a report\n\non the same to the Houses. The report shall not suggest anything of the nature of cut motions.\n\n(b) To examine bills pertaining to the concerned ministries/departments and make report thereon.\n\n\n(c) To consider annual reports of ministries/departments and make reports thereon.\n(d) To consider national basic long term policy documents presented to the Houses, and make\nreports thereon.\n\nLegislative Control Under Presidential System\n\nThe system of legislative control over administration in the presidential form of government (in the\nUSA) is different from the control system in the parliamentary form of government (in India and\nBritain). Therefore, most of the techniques of legislative control described above are not practiced in\nthe USA. The reason for such a difference lies in the ‘theory of separation of power’ which is the\nbasis of presidential government prevalent in the USA. Accordingly, the executive and the legislative\norgans of the government are separated from each other, and hence, remain independent of each other.\nThe executive (which consists of the President and his secretaries) neither sits in the legislature\n(which is called Congress in the USA) nor is responsible to it for its policies and actions. The\nPresident of the USA enjoys a fixed tenure of four years and cannot be removed before the completion\nof his tenure in normal circumstances. The President need not have a majority support in the Congress\n(which consists of the House of Representatives and the Senate) for his continuity and survival in\noffice. In fact, the President and his secretaries are not the members of the Congress and do not\nparticipate in its proceedings. Hence Congressional control over the executive through questions or\nadjournment motion or no confidence motion or censure motion is not possible. Under such\ncircumstances, the Congress in the USA exercises control over administration through the following\ntools:\n\n(i) The Congress creates executive departments, commissions, boards and other administrative\nagencies. It also determines their structure, organisation, powers and functions. In fact, the\nIndependent Regulatory Commissions report directly to the Congress as they are placed\noutside the President’s control.\n\n(ii) The Congress appoints committees to investigate into and criticise the working of\nadministrative departments and agencies. This power of the Congress is known as the power\nof ‘legislative investigation’ .\n\n(iii) The Congress enacts laws or amends and repeals the existing laws to lay down public\npolicies, methods and procedures.\n\n(iv) The Congress approves the Federal Budget prepared by the Office of Budget and Management\nunder the President’s direction. The budget presented to the Congress by the President is\nthoroughly examined and revised by its committees and sub-committees. It also examines the\naccounts and audit reports.\n\n(v) The Senate (upper house of the Congress) enjoys the power of confirming the treaties\nexecuted by the President.\n\n(vi) The Senate also enjoys the power of confirming higher appointments made by the President.\n\n(vii) The Congress has the power to impeach the President before the completion of his four years\ntenure on grounds of treason or corruption.\n\n(viii) The Congress requires the administrative agencies to report their past actions or future plans\nto its committees or to it as a whole. FA. Nigro calls it the “doctrine of codirectorship”,\nwhich means direct participation of the Congress in administrative decision-making.\n\n(ix) The executive departments are required to submit the annual as well as special reports to the\nCongress. These reports relate to their performance and problems.\n\n\n(x) The members of the Congress are provided with an office and staff to maintain regular\ncontacts with the administrative officials to seek remedial action on complaints received from\nthe citizens of their respective constituencies. This is known as the institution of ‘case work’.\n\n(ix) The Congress directly supervises the operations of certain administrative departments and\nagencies. This is known as the doctrine of ‘legislative oversight’.\n\nThus, the Congressional control over administration in the USA is limited and restricted in nature\nand scope.\n\nLimitations and Ineffectiveness\n\nThe legislative control over administration in parliamentary countries like India is more theoretical\nthan practical. In reality, the control is not as effective as it ought to be. The following factors are\nresponsible for the ineffectiveness of parliamentary control in India.\n(i) The Parliament has neither time nor expertise to control the administration which has grown in\nvolume as well as complexity.\n(ii) Parliament’s financial control is hindered by the technical nature of the demands for grants.\nThe parliamentarians being laymen cannot understand them properly and fully.\n(iii) The legislative leadership lies with the executive and it plays a significant role in formulating\npolicies.\n(iv) The very size of the Parliament is too large and unmanageable to be effective.\n(v) The majority support enjoyed by the executive in the Parliament reduces the possibility of\neffective criticism.\n(vi) The financial committees like Public Accounts Committee examines the public expenditure\nafter it has been incurred by the executive. Thus, they do post mortem work.\n(vii) The increased recourse to ‘Guillotine’ reduced the scope of financial control.\n(viii) The growth of ‘delegated legislation’ reduced the role of Parliament in making detailed laws\nand increased the powers of bureaucracy.\n(ix) The frequent promulgation of ‘Ordinances’ by the President dilutes the Parliament’s power of\nlegislation.\n(x) The Parliament's control is sporadic, general and mostly political in nature.\n(ix) Lack of a strong and steady opposition in the Parliament, and a setback in the parliamentary\nbehaviour and ethics, have also contributed to the ineffectiveness of legislative control over\nadministration in India.\n\nAppleby’s Criticism\n\nPaul H. Appleby (an American scholar of public administration), in his report entitled “Re-\nexamination of India’s Administrative Systeny’ (1956), was very critical of parliamentary control\nover administration in India. He said that there is excessive parliamentary interference in public\nadministration of India. He came to the conclusion that one of the important negative influences on\nachievement was Parliament. His list of criticisms were as follows:\n(i) The members of Parliament greatly exaggerate the importance of the function of the\nComptroller and Auditor-General and pay far too much attention to his reports. So doing, the\nParliament increases the timidity of public servants at all levels, making them unwilling to\n\n\ntake responsibility for decisions, forcing decisions to be made by a slow and cumbersome\nprocess of reference and conference in which everybody finally shares dimly in the making of\nevery decision, not enough gets done and what gets done is done too slowly.\n\n(ii) There is, among members of the Parliament, too much general and vague fear that its\nresponsibilities are not being preserved. Such fear cannot be supported by a bill of particulars\nreally related to the high level of parliamentary responsibility. Government proposals to the\nParliament are amended in India much more often than in the United Kingdom, and the\nproposals are drawn originally with much more regard for the sentiments of even a small\nsegments of the Parliament.\n\n(iii) The Parliament often exhibits a prejudice for reliance on the judgement of businessmen.\n\n(iv) The Parliament seems strangely inclined to make too ready concessions to some of the self-\n\ninterest demands of small but influential business interests, and to enforce corresponding\n\nchanges in government’s decisions.\n\nBy Parliament’s endorsement of the formerly small and narrow approach of the Public\n\nService Commission to its own functions in the mistaken belief that this strengthens the merit\n\nsystem, it undermines the responsibility of the ministries and thereby, undermines the\n\nresponsibility of the Parliament.\n\n(vi) Parliament is a chief citadel of opposition to delegation of powers, the need for which is the\nworst shortcoming of Indian administration. Parliament’s reluctance to delegate its power in\ndetail, as it is essential to do if parliamentary powers are to be important and positive,\ndiscourages ministers from delegating their powers, discourages secretaries from delegating\ntheir powers, and managing directors from delegating their powers.\n\n(v\n\n~"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Translate the following text into Hindi accurately, preserving the original meaning and context."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executive control over administration means the control exercised by the chief executive (political\nexecutive) over the functioning of bureaucracy. Such control in the USA is exercised by the President\nand his secretaries, and in India and Britain by the Cabinet and ministers (individually).\n\nIn parliamentary government the Cabinet is collectively responsible to the Parliament for its\npolicies and actions. Each minister is also individually responsible for the acts of omission and\ncommission in his Ministry/department. In other words, ministerial responsibility is the basic feature\nof the Parliamentary government. For this very reason the political executive (Cabinet and ministers)\nexercise control over administration.\n\nUnlike the legislative control which is general, periodical, informational and reportive, the\nexecutive control is fuller in content, constant, continuous, stimulative, corrective and directive.\n\nThe executive exercises control over administration through following means or techniques.\n\nPolitical Direction (Policy-making) In India, the Cabinet formulates administrative policies and\nenjoys the power of direction, supervision and coordination with regard to its implementation. The\nminister, who is incharge of one or more departments, lays down the departmental policy and directs,\nsupervises and coordinates its implementation by the administrators. Thus, through political direction,\nthe Minister controls the operations of administrative agencies working under his\nministry/department(s). The departmental officials are directly and totally responsible to the minister.\nIn the USA, the same function is performed by the President and his secretaries.\n\n\nBudgetary System The executive controls the administration through budgetary system. It\nformulates the budget, gets it enacted by the Parliament, and allocates the necessary funds to the\nadministrative agencies to meet their expenditure. In all such activities, the Ministry of Finance\n(which is the central financial agency of the Government of India) plays an important role. It\nexercises financial control over administration in the following ways.\n(i) Approval of policies and programmes in principle.\n(ii) Acceptance of provision in the budget estimates.\n(iii) Sanctioning expenditure subject to the powers which are delegated.\n(iv) Providing financial advice through the Integrated Financial Advisor.\n(v) Reappropriation of grants (i.e. transfer of funds from one sub-head to another).\n(vi) Internal audit system.\n(vii) Prescribing a financial code to be followed by the spending authorities.\n\nAppointment and Removal (Personne! Management and Control) This is the most effective\nmeans of executive control over administration. The executive plays an important role in personnel\nmanagement and control and enjoys the power of appointment and removal of top administrators. In\nthis function, the executive (in India) is assisted by the Department of Personnel and Training, the\nMinistry of Finance, and the UPSC. The Department of Personnel and Training is the central\npersonnel agency in India and plays a major role in personnel management and control. At the highest\nlevel, the ministers play an important role in the selection and appointment of secretaries and heads of\ndepartments. Thus they (i.e. ministers) exercise full control over the administration of departments\nunder their charge through such appointees.\n\nIn the USA also, though the President has to seek the approval of Senate for effecting appointments\nto top posts, he has the exclusive power of removing them from office. The Office of Personnel\nManagement (OPM) in the US plays an important role in personnel management and control.\n\nDelegated Legislation Also known as the executive legislation, it is an important tool in the hands\nof the executive to exercise control over administration. The Parliament makes laws in skeleton forms\nand authorises the executive to fill in minor details. Therefore, the executive makes rules, regulations\nand bye-laws which have to be observed by the administrators in execution of the law concerned.\n\nOrdinances The Constitution of India authorises the chief executive, that is, the President to\npromulgate ordinances during the recess (interval) of Parliament to meet situation demanding\nimmediate action. An ordinance is as authoritative and powerful as an act of Parliament and hence,\ngoverns the functioning of administration.\n\nCivil Service Code The executive has prescribed a civil service code to be observed and followed\nby the administrators in the exercise of their official powers. It consists of a set of conduct rules\nwhich prevent the administrators from misutilising their powers for their personal ends. The\nimportant among such rules in India are as follows.\n\n(a) All-India Services (Conduct) Rules, 1954\n(b) Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1955\n(c) Railway Services (Conduct) Rules, 1956.\n\nThey deal with various things like loyalty to the state, obeying the official orders of the superiors,\npolitical activities of civil servants, financial transactions of civil servants, marital restrictions, and\nothers.\n\n\nStaff Agencies The executive also exercises control over administration through staff agencies. The\nimportant staff agencies in India are the Department of Administrative Reforms, the Planning\nCommission, the Cabinet Secretariat and the Prime Minister’s Office. Mooney said that a staff agency\nis “an expansion of the personality of the executive. It means more eyes, more ears and more hands to\naid him in forming and carrying out his plans.” Thus, the staff agencies exercise influence and indirect\ncontrol over the administrative agencies and play an important role in coordinating their policies and\nprogrammes.\n\nAppeal to Public Opinion The administrative system, (i.e. civil service or bureaucracy) whether in\nthe USA or the UK or India, is status quo oriented and hence resists change. It does not receive new\npolicies, plans, programmes and projects formulated by the executive with positive mindedness. In\nfact, the various organs of the administrative machinery, in the words of Pfiffner and Presthus, “seek\nto strengthen their position vis a vis other agencies, and the executive, by alliances with legislature\nand pressure groups, as well as by calculated support building campaigns directed at the general\npublic. They develop vested interests not only in programme areas, but equally in established ways of\ndoing things, which enhance the self-consciousness and strategic position of the bureaucracy.” Due to\nthis, the bureaucracy resists new programmes and methods as they threaten its (bureaucracy’s) strong\nposition. Under such circumstances, the executive appeals to the public opinion."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Translate the following text into Hindi accurately, preserving the original meaning and context."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The control exercised by the Courts over the administrative acts is called judicial control. In other\nwords, it means the power of the courts to keep the administrative acts within the limits of law. It also\nimplies the right of an aggrieved citizen to challenge the wrongful acts of administrators in a court of\nlaw. The primary objective of judicial control over administration is the protection of the rights and\nliberties of citizens by ensuring the legality of administrative act. In the words of L.D. White, “The\npurpose of legislative supervision is principally to control the policy and the expenditure of the\nexecutive branch, the end sought by judicial control of administrative acts is to ensure their legality\nand thus, protect citizens against unlawful trespass on their constitutional or other rights.”\n\nAs rightly observed by M.P. Sharma (the first Professor of public administration in India), “looked\nat from the point of view of the citizens whose liberties and rights they (i.e. courts) are intended to\nprotect, the controls exercised by the courts are called ‘judicial remedies.’ As a matter of fact,\nofficial liability before the courts and judicial remedies for the citizens against official excesses or\nabuse of power are the two faces of the same coin.”\n\nBasis\n\nThe judicial control over administration emanates from the concept of ‘rule of law’ which is a\ncardinal feature of the British Constitution as well as the Indian Constitution. A.V. Dicey, the British\nconstitutional lawyer, in his famous book Jntroduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution\ngave a classic exposition of this concept which is as follows.\n\n“No man is punishable or can be lawfully made to suffer in body or goods except for a distinct\nbreach of law established in the ordinary legal manner before the ordinary courts of the land... no man\n\n\nis above the law, but... every man, whatever be his rank or condition, is subject to the ordinary law of\nthe realm and amenable to the jurisdiction of the ordinary tribunals... every official from the Prime\nMinister down to a constable or a collector of taxes, is under the same responsibility for every act\ndone without legal justification as any other citizen... the general principles of Constitution... are with\nus the result of judicial decision determining the rights of private persons in particular cases brought\nbefore the courts.”\n\nIn short, the three elements of ‘rule of law’ are as follows:\n\n(i) Absence of arbitrary power, that is, no man can be punished except for a breach of law.\n\n(ii) Equality before the law, that is, equal subjection of all citizens (rich or poor, high or low,\nofficial or non-official) to the ordinary law of the land administered by the ordinary law\ncourts.\n\n(iii) The primacy of the rights of the individual, that is, the Constitution, is the result of the rights of\nthe individual as defined and enforced by the courts of law rather than the Constitution being\nthe source of the individual rights. Thus, the rights of the citizens of Great Britain flow from\nthe judicial decisions, not from the Constitution.\n\nScope (Grounds)\n\nThe judiciary can intervene in the administrative acts under the following circumstances.\n\n(i) Lack of jurisdiction, that is, when the administrator acts without authority or beyond the scope\nof his authority or outside the geographical limits of his authority. It is technically called\n‘overfeasance’ (excess of authority).\n\n(ii) Error of law, that is, when the administrator misinterprets the law and thus imposes upon the\ncitizen, obligations which are not required by the content of law. It is technically called\n‘misfeasance’.\n\n(iii) Error in fact finding, that is, when the administrator makes a mistake in the discovery of facts\nand acts on wrong presumptions.\n\n(iv) Abuse of authority, that is, when the administrator uses his authority (or power or discretion)\nvindictively to harm some person. It is technically called ‘malfeasance.’\n\n(v) Error of procedure, that is, when the administrator does not follow the laid down procedure.\n\nThe citizens who are affected by the above cases can seek the intervention of judiciary in the\nadministrative acts.\n\nMethods\n\nThe judiciary exercises control over administration through the following methods or techniques.\n\nJudicial Review It is the power of the courts to examine the legality and constitutionality of\nadministrative acts. On examination, if they are found to be violative of the Constitution (ultra vires),\nthey can be declared as illegal, unconstitutional and invalid by the courts. The scope of judicial\nreview in the USA is much wider than in Britain. India falls in between the two due to the\nconstitutional and statutory limitations (on the scope of judicial review).\n\nStatutory Appeal The parliamentary statute (i.e. law or act) may itself provide that in a specific\ntype of administrative act, the aggrieved citizen will have the right of appeal to the courts. Under such\n\n\ncircumstances, the statutory appeal is possible.\n\nSuits Against Government In India, Article 300 of the Constitution governs the suability of the\nstate. It states that the Union Government and state government can be sued, subject to the provisions\nof the law made by the Parliament and the state legislature respectively. The state is suable in\ncontracts. This means that the contractual liability of the Union Government and the state governments\nis same as that of an individual under the ordinary law of contract. However, in case of torts, the\nposition is different (a tort is a wrongful action or injury for which a suit for damages lies). In this\nregard, a distinction is made between the sovereign and non-sovereign functions of the state. The\nstate, for the tortious acts of its servants, can be sued only in case of its non-sovereign functions but\nnot in case of its sovereign functions.\n\nIn Britain, there has been traditional immunity of the state (i.e. Crown) from any legal liability for\nany action. Suits against government in contract or tort were severely restricted. Such restrictions\nwere relaxed and the situation was improved by the Crown Proceedings Act of 1947. The present\nposition in Britain is that the State can be sued for the wrongful acts of its officials whether in\ncontracts or torts, with some exceptions.\n\nIn the USA, subject to a few exceptions, the state cannot be sued in cases pertaining to torts. In\nother words, the State (either federal government or state government) is immune from the tortious\nliability of its servants, except in few cases.\n\nIn France, where the system of ‘Droit Administratif? prevails, the state assumes responsibility for\nthe official actions of its servants and compensate the citizens for any loss suffered by them. The\naggrieved citizens can directly sue the state in the ‘administrative courts’ and get the damages\nawarded.\n\nSuits Against Public Officials In India, the President and the state governors enjoy personal\nimmunity from legal liability for their official acts. During their term of office, they are immune from\nany criminal proceedings, even in respect of their personal acts. They cannot be arrested or\nimprisoned. However, after giving two months’ notice, civil proceedings can be instituted against\nthem during their term of office in respect of their personal acts. The ministers do not enjoy such\nimmunities and hence they can be sued in ordinary courts like common citizens for crimes as well as\ntorts.\n\nUnder the Judicial Officer’s Protection Act of 1850, the judicial officers are immune from any\nliability in respect of their acts and hence cannot be sued.\n\nThe civil servants are conferred personal immunity from legal liability for official contracts by the\nArticle 299 of the Constitution of India. In other cases, the liability of the officials is the same as of\nany ordinary citizen. Civil proceedings can be instituted against them for anything done in their\nofficial capacity after giving a two months’ notice. As regards criminal liabilities, proceedings can\nbe instituted against them for acts done in their official capacity with prior permission from the\ngovernment.\n\nThe Monarch in Britain and the President in the USA enjoy immunity from legal liability. The\nlegally accepted phrase in Britain is, “The King can do no wrong.’ Hence he cannot be sued in any\ncourt of law.\n\nExtraordinary Remedies These consist of the following six kinds of writs issued by the courts.\n(i) Habeas Corpus It literally means “to have the body of.” It is an order issued by the court to a\nperson who has detained another person, to produce the body of the latter before it. The court\n\n\nwill set the imprisoned person free if the detention is illegal. This writ is a bulwark of\nindividual liberty against arbitrary detention.\n\n(ii) Mandamus It literally means ‘we command’. It is a command issued by the court to a public\nofficial asking him to perform his official duties which he has failed to perform.\n\n(iii) Prohibition It literally means ‘to forbid.’ It is issued by a higher court to a lower court when\nthe latter exceeds its jurisdiction. It can be issued only against judicial and quasi-judicial\nauthorities and not against administrative authorities. Hence, its importance as a tool of\njudicial control over administration is highly restricted.\n\n(iv) Certiorari It literally means ‘to be certified.’ It is issued by a higher court to a lower court\nfor transferring the records of proceedings of a case pending with it, for the purpose of\ndetermining the legality of its proceedings or for giving fuller and a more satisfactory effect to\nthem than could be done in the lower court. Thus, unlike the prohibition which is only\npreventive, the Certiorari is both preventive as well as curative.\n\n(v) Quo Warranto It literally means ‘by what authority or warrant.’ It is issued by the courts to\nenquire into the legality of claim of a person to a public office. Therefore, it prevents illegal\nassumption of public office by a person.\n\n(vi) Injunction It is issued by the court asking a person to do a thing or refrain from doing it. Thus,\nit is of two kinds viz. mandatory and preventive. The mandatory injunction resembles the writ\nof Mandamus but it is different. As put by M.P. Sharma, “Mandamus cannot be issued against\nprivate persons while the injunction is primarily a process of private law and only rarely a\nremedy in administrative law. Mandamus is a remedy of common law while injunction is the\nstrong arm of equity.”\n\nSimilarly, preventive injunction resembles the writ of prohibition but it is different. In the words of\nM.P. Sharma, “Injunction is directed to the litigant parties while prohibition to the court itself. Also,\nwhile injunction recognises the jurisdiction of the court in which the proceedings are pending,\nprohibition strikes at such jurisdiction.”\n\nWrits in India\nThe following points can be noted in this context.\n\n(i) The courts can issue all the above mentioned writs. However, only the first five are\nmentioned in the Constitution of India.\n\n(ii) Article 32 of the Constitution authorises the Supreme Court to issue writs for the enforcement\nof the Fundamental Rights of citizens guaranteed to them by the Constitution.\n\n(iii) Article 226 of the Constitution authorises High Courts to issue the writs not only for the\nenforcement of the Fundamental Rights of citizens guaranteed by the Constitution but also for\nother purposes. This means that the writ jurisdiction of High Courts is wider than that of the\nSupreme Court.\n\n(iv) Parliament (under Article 32) can empower any other court to issue these writs. Since no such\nprovision has been made so far, only the Supreme Court and the High Courts can issue the\nwrits and not any other court.\n\nLimitations\n\n\nThe following factors limit the effectiveness of judicial control over administration.\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n(iii)\n(iv)\n\n(v)\n(vi)\n\n(vii)\n\nThe judiciary cannot intervene in administrative process on its own. The courts intervene only\nwhen the aggrieved citizen takes the matter before them. Therefore, the judiciary lacks the suo\nmoto power.\n\nThe control exercised by the courts is in the nature of a post mortem control, that is, they\nintervene after the damage is done to the citizen by the administrative acts.\n\nAll administrative acts are not subject to judicial control as the Parliament may exclude\ncertain matters from the jurisdiction of the courts.\n\nSelf-denying ordinance, that is, the judiciary denies to itself jurisdiction in certain matters.\nThe courts refuse to intervene in certain purely administrative matters on its own accord.\n\nThe judicial process is very slow and cumbersome as well as very expensive.\n\nThe judges being legal experts cannot fully and properly understand the highly technical nature\nof administrative acts.\n\nThe volume, variety and complexity of administration has increased due to welfare orientation\nof the state. Hence, the courts cannot review each and every administrative act affecting the\ncitizen."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Election The representative democracy is classified in two kinds, namely, the Presidential\nGovernment and the Parliamentary Government. In the Presidential Government prevalent in the USA,\nthe President is directly elected by the people. He is the Chief Executive enjoying all powers of the\nexecutive organ of the government. He is not responsible to the Legislature (i.e., Congress) but to the\npeople ultimately. Thus, the popular control over Chief Executive in a presidential government like\nUSA is direct.\n\nIn the Parliamentary Government prevalent in Britain and India, the real executive (i.e., Cabinet) is\ndrawn from the legislature and remains responsible to it for its policies and actions. The legislature\nin turn is responsible to the people. Thus the popu-lar control over the executive in a parliamentary\ngovernment like Britain and India is indirect as it is exercised through the elected Parliament.\n\nIn a democracy whether presidential or parliamentary, when the government becomes\nunresponsive, corrupt, irresponsible and inefficient, it can be removed from office by means of\nperiodic elections. The elections are the medium of expression of people’s confidence in the popular\ngovernment.\n\n2. Recall It is a direct democratic device. It is used in Switzerland and thirteen states of USA where\nthe administrative officials are directly elected by the people. The system of recall enables the people\nto remove the elected official from office before the expiry of his tenure, when he fails to repre—sent\ntheir will. In other words, the official has to vacate office before the completion of his tenure, if he is\n\n\nee\ndefeated in a recall poll. The device of recall can be used when the people are not satisfied with the\nperformance of the elected official while in office and it does not require any charges of illegal\nactions. The chief merit of recall is that it enables the people to hold their public officials\ncontinuously responsible for their profes~sional role and duties.\n\n3. Pressure Groups The term ‘Pressure Group’ originated in USA. It is a group of people who are\norganised actively for the purpose of promoting their common interest. Some examples of such groups\nare voluntary agencies, trade unions, employment associa~tions, professional associations, student\nunions and so forth. These groups are also called as interest groups or vested groups. They exert\npressure on the administration to promote their objectives. They influence the policy-making and\npolicy-implementation in government through legal and legitimate methods like publicity,\npropagandising, petitioning, public debating, maintaining contacts with their legislators and so forth.\nThey act as a liaison between the administration and their members. However, some times they resort\nto illegimate and illegal methods like strikes, violent activities and corruption which damages public\ninterest and administrative integrity.\n\n4. Advisory Committees These are also called as Advisory Councils or Boards. They are attached\nto the administrative system at all levels from top to bottom. They consist of expert citizens and\nrepresentatives of the special interests. They act as a link between the administration and the public\nand provide advise to the government on administrative policies, problems and procedures. The\nrecommendations made by these agencies are only advisory in nature and are not binding on the\ndepartment to which they are attached. However, they act as an effective instrument of the\ndepartment’s public relations and make administration democratic in character.\n\n5. Public Opinion Unlike the above formal modes, public opinion is an informal mode of citizens’\ncontrol over administration. Public opinion is the opinion of people in relation to the government\npolicies and actions. It is expressed through various agencies like press, public platform, political\nparties, radio, television, cinema, pressure groups, educational institutions and so on. Of these,\nindependent press is the most effective agency of public opinion. It is described as the “fourth estate”\nof democracy.\n\nThe importance of public opinion as a mode of citizens’ control over administration is highlighted\nby the following points:\n\n(i) It influences the policies and programmes of the government.\n\n(ii) It keeps the administration responsive and acts as a watchdog on it.\n\n(iii) It acts as a source of laws and facilitates their successful implementation.\n\n(iv) It safeguards individual liberty by keeping a check on unpopular and undemocratic activities\nof the government."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

So maintaining some provisions of Act of 1890, rendering some provisions redundant\nand replacing new provisions, a new legislation named the Railways Act, 1989 was enacted.\n\nThe broad features of this Act are that Railways were re-constituted in zones with a General\nManager for each zone. The Central Government had power to fix the rates of carriage of passengers\nand goods. The provision for compensation by Railways on account of loss, damage of goods etc. and\nalso due to accidental deaths and injury was maintained. The special provisions were introduced\nregarding monetary liability of railways as carriers of goods etc.\n\nThe Railway Claims Tribunal Act, 1987 was enacted to provide speedy disposal of claims against\nthe Railway Administration. Although Railway Administration made a way to compensate the\nconsignor/consignee of goods etc. and also for compensation for loss of lives yet people were not\noften satisfied and they went to Courts, which took very long time to decide the claims and litigation\nwas protracted for indefinite period. Therefore, the necessity was felt to expedite the disposal of\nclaims at the earliest, which resulted in establishment of the Claims Tribunal, which would\nexclusively deal with such claims and speedily dispose of the same. As a result, the burden of Courts\nwas reduced and speedy relief was made available. Even the refund of fares and freights was also\nbrought within the purview of Tribunal.\n\nThe RCT Act is to provide for the establishment of a Railway Claims Tribunal for inquiring into\nand determining claims against a Railway Administration for loss, destruction, damage, deterioration\nor non-delivery of animals or goods entrusted to it to be carried by railway or for the refund of fares\nor freight or for compensation for death or injury to passengers occurring as a result of railway\naccidents or untoward incidents.\n\nThe scheme of the Act shows that it made provisions for establishment of Tribunal, its Benches,\nofficers and staff, their term, eligibility, the jurisdiction, powers and authority of Tribunal, its\nprocedure, execution of its orders and appeals. In this way, the Act is a self-contained Act."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

It also recognised the identical nature of qualifications stipulated for entry into such posts\nin various offices. Hence, it advocated the pooling of requirements of non-technical posts by different\n\n\ndepartments and selection of personnel either by joint recruitment or through a recruitment board.\nThis recommendation was accepted by the Government of India.\n\nAccordingly, the Subordinate Services Commission was established in 1975 by an executive\nresolution of the Central Government. Later in 1977, this Commission was renamed Staff Selection\nCommission (SSC).\n\nThe SSC enjoys the status of an attached office of the Department of Personnel and Training\n(DoPT) and acts as an advisory body.\n\nFunctions of the Commission\n\nThe functions of the SSC have been enlarged from time to time.

This flagship programme of the\nGovernment of India touches the lives of the rural poor and promotes inclusive growth.\n\nObjectives\n\nThe MGNREGA with its legal framework and rights-based approach was notified in the year 2005. It\naims at enhancing livelihood security by providing at least 100 days of guaranteed wage employment\nin a financial year to every rural household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual\nwork. The Act covered 200 districts in its first phase, and was extended to all the rural districts of the\ncountry in phases.\n\nThe MGNREGA is the first ever law, internationally, that guarantees wage employment at an\nunprecedented scale. The primary objective of the Act is meeting the demand for wage employment in\nrural areas. The works permitted under the Act address causes of chronic poverty like drought,\ndeforestation and soil erosion, so that the employment generation is sustainable. The Act is also a\nsignificant vehicle for strengthening decentralisation and for deepening the processes of democracy\nby giving a pivotal role to local governance bodies, that is, the Panchayati Raj Institutions.\n\nFeatures\n\nThe salient features of the Act are as follows:\n\n1. Rights-based Framework For adult members of a rural household willing to do unskilled\nmanual work.\n\n2. Time-bound Guarantee Fifteen days for provision of employment, else unemployment\nallowance to be paid.\n\n3. Guaranteed Employment Upto 100 days of guaranteed wage employment in a financial year\nper household, depending on the actual demand.\n\n4. Labour-intensive Works 60 : 40 wage and material ratio for permissible works at the Gram\nPanchayat; no contractors/machinery.\n\n5. Decentralised Planning In this context, the following points can be noted:\n\n\n(i) Gram Sabhas to recommend works\n(ii) At least 50% of works by Gram Panchayats for execution\n(iii) Principal role of PRIs in planning, implementation and monitoring\n\n6. Work-site facilities Créche, drinking water, first aid and shade provided at work sites.\n\n7. Women empowerment At least one-third of beneficiaries should be women.\n\n8. Transparency and Accountability Proactive disclosure through wall writings, citizen\ninformation boards and Management Information System (MIS) and Social Audits.\n\n9. Funding Hundred per cent cost towards unskilled wages and 75% towards skilled, semi-\nskilled and material is borne by the Central Government and 25% of skilled, semi-skilled and\nmaterial costs is contributed by states. In addition, 6% administrative expenses are borne by\nthe Centre for effective implementation of the Act.\n\nRecent Initiatives\n\nOver the last few years, based on reports from the field and research inputs on implementation issues\nand challenges, the Ministry has taken the following initiatives to strengthen the programme\nimplementation at grass-root level:\n\n1.\n\nThe Fourth edition of MGNREGA Operational Guidelines, 2013 was been released in\nFebruary 2013. The revised guidelines have attempted to meet important implementation\nchallenges, viz., accurate capturing of demand for the scheme, delays in wage payment, issues\nof transparency and accountability.\nThe list of permissible works under MGNREGA was expanded in May 2012 to:\n(i) strengthen the synergy between MGNREGA and rural livelihoods, particularly\nagriculture, and create durable quality assets;\n(ii) respond to the demands of states for greater location-specific flexibility in permissible\nworks;\n(iii) help improve the health and ecological situation in rural India, with particular focus on\nsanitation.\n\n3. The contribution from MGNREGA for construction of individual toilets under Total\n\nSanitation Campaign, now renamed as Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan, has been increased to ¢4500\nfrom 1200.\n\nAppointment of Ombudsman at district level for expeditious redressal of grievances on\nimplementation of MGNREGA.\n\nSocial Audits The MGNREG Act requires that Gram Sabhas shall monitor the execution of\nworks within the Gram Panchayat (GP). The Gram Sabha shall conduct regular social audits\nof all projects taken up under the scheme within the GP. Social Audit is not only a\nmanagement tool but also a platform for public and primary stakeholders of MGNREGA to\nscrutinise the resources (both financial and non-financial) used for development initiatives.\nThe MGNREGA Audit of Schemes Rules 2011 clearly provide that Social Audit Unit shall\nfacilitate conduct of Social Audit of the works taken up under the Act in every GP at least\nonce every six months in the manner prescribed under the rules.\n\nGrievance Redressal To effectively address issues of concern on implementation of the\nMGNREGA and leakages in the Scheme, the Ministry has formulated the Standard Operating\nProcedure (SOP) for redressing complaints. This was realised during September 2012. The\n\n\nnew mechanism delineates procedures for managing various types of complaints that will\nstreamline the redressal procedures.\n\n7. CAG Audit Performance audit of MGNREGA by the Comptroller and Auditor General\n(CAG) is in progress and detailed report is expected soon.\n\n8. CA Audit at GP Level The objective is to make certification of MGNREGA accounts at the\nGP level by chartered accountants compulsory over time, starting with 10% GPs in the\nidentified highest spending district in each state in 2012-13.\n\nNew Guidelines\nThe highlights of the Fourth Edition MGNREGA Operational Guidelines, 2013 are mentioned below:\n\n1. Constitution of Cluster Facilitation Teams (CFTs), State Employment Guarantee Mission and\nManagement Team and National Management Team.\n\n2. Dedicated Programme Officers (PO): Blocks that have high concentration of SC/ST/landless\nlabourers and are likely to have more demand for MGNREGA works should have a dedicated\nPO for MGNREGA. The dedicated PO should not be assigned responsibilities not directly\nrelated to MGNREGA.\n\n3. Register applications for work through telephones including mobile phones and this should\nfeed in directly into NREGASoft. Ensuring convenience to illiterate workers through\nInteractive Voice Response System (IVRS) and voice-enabled interactions.\n\n4. Network of Capacity Building Institutions for building the capacity of MGNREGA\nfunctionaries.\n\n5. Baseline survey to assess quantum and timing of demand for work.\n\n6. Habitation level as the unit of planning and identification of project.\n\n7. Priority of works to be decided by Gram Panchayat in meetings of the Gram Sabha and the\nWard Sabha.\n\n8. The 60 : 40 ratio for wage and material costs should be maintained at GP level for all works\n\nto be taken up by GP and for works to be taken by all other agencies it should be maintained at\nthe Block/Intermediate Panchayat level."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Later, the SGSY has been restructured as National\nRural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM), subsequently renamed as “Aajeevika”, to implement it in a\nmission mode across the country. The programme was formally launched in 2011.\n\nThe NRLM aims at reducing poverty by enabling poor households to access gainful self-\nemployment and skilled wage employment opportunities. This should result in appreciable\nimprovement in their livelihoods on a sustainable basis, through building strong and sustainable\ngrassroots institutions of the poor.\n\nThe NRLM implementation is in a Mission Mode. This enables: (a) shift from the present\nallocation based strategy to a demand-driven strategy, enabling the states to formulate their own\nlivelihoods-based poverty reduction action plans, (b) focus on targets, outcomes and time bound\n\n\ndelivery, (c) continuous capacity building, imparting requisite skills and creating linkages with\nlivelihoods opportunities for the poor, including those emerging in the organised sector, and (d)\nmonitoring against targets of poverty outcomes.\n\nThe salient features of NRLM (Aajeevika) are mentioned below:\n\n1.\n\nUniversal Social Mobilisation NRLM follows a saturation approach by ensuring that at least\none woman member from each identified rural poor household is brought under the Self Help\nGroup (SHG) network in a time-bound manner. Aajeevika ensures adequate coverage of\nvulnerable sections of the society such that 50% of the beneficiaries are SC/STs, 15% are\nminorities and 3% are persons with disability, while keeping in view the ultimate target of\n100% coverage of BPL families.\n\nPromotion of Institutions of the Poor Strong quality institutions of the poor such as SHGs\nand their federations are set up on priority. They empower the poor and acts as instruments of\nknowledge and technology dissemination, and hubs of production, collectivisation and\ncommerce.\n\nTraining, Capacity Building and Skill Building Aajeevika ensures the poor are provided\nwith the requisite skills for managing their institutions, linking up with markets, managing their\nexisting livelihoods, enhancing their credit absorption capacity and credit worthiness. A\nmulti-pronged approach is adopted for providing continuous capacity building of the targeted\nfamilies, SHGs, their federations, government functionaries, bankers, NGOs and other key\nstakeholders.\n\nRevolving Fund and Capital Subsidy Subsidy is made available in the form of revolving\nfund and capital subsidy. Revolving Fund is provided to the SHGs (where more than 70%\nmembers are from BPL households) as an incentive to inculcate the habit of thrift and\naccumulate their own funds towards meeting their credit needs in the long run and immediate\nconsumption needs in the short run.\n\nUniversal Financial Inclusion Aajeevika works on both demand and supply side of financial\ninclusion. On the demand side, it promotes financial literacy among the poor and provides\ncatalytic capital to the SHGs and their federations. On the supply side, it coordinates with the\nfinancial sector and encourage use of Information, Communication & Technology (ICT) based\nfinancial technologies, business correspondents and community facilitators like ‘Bank\nMitras’.\n\nProvision of Interest Subsidy To ensure affordable credit for the rural poor, Aajeevika has\nmade a provision for subsidy on interest rate above 7% per annum for all eligible SHGs, who\nhave availed loans from mainstream financial institutions, based on prompt loan repayment.\nInfrastructure Creation and Marketing Support Aajeevika ensures that the infrastructure\nneeds for the major livelihoods activities of the poor are met with. It also provides support\nfor marketing to the institutions of the poor.\n\nSkills and Placement Projects Scale up of existing skills and placement projects through\npartnership mode as one of the best investments in youth, and provide impetus to livelihoods\nopportunities in emerging markets. For strengthening this, various models of partnerships with\npublic, private, non-government and community organisations would be developed.\n\nRural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETIs) Aajeevika encourages public sector\nbanks to set up RSETIs in all districts of the country. RSETIs transform unemployed rural\nyouth in the district into confident self-employed entrepreneurs through need-based\n\n\nexperiential training program followed by systematic handholding support and bank linkage.\nFunding Pattern Aajeevika is a centrally sponsored scheme and the financing of the\nprogramme would be shared between the Centre and the states in the ratio of 75 : 25 (90: 10\nin case of north-eastern states including Sikkim; completely from the Centre in case of UTs).\nMahila Kisan Sashaktikaran Pariyojana The Mahila Kisan Sashktikaran Pariyojana\n(MKSP) was launched in 2010-11 as a sub component in Aajeevika, in order to improve the\npresent status of women in agriculture and enhance the opportunities for empowerment.\nMKSP was initiated for livelihood enhancement and vulnerability reduction interventions\nacross the country. MKSP recognises the centrality of women in agriculture and therefore\naims to provide direct and indirect support to enable them to achieve sustainable agriculture\nproduction.\n\nHimayat The Ministry of Rural Development is also implementing a new scheme under\nAajeevika titled “Skill Empowerment and Employment in J&K” (see J&K) — “Himayat”. This\nis a training-cum-placement programme developed and initiated by the Ministry of Rural\nDevelopment as a special scheme to address the needs and aspirations of the unemployed\nyouth in Jammu and Kashmir."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The scheme is designed to enable Below Poverty Line (BPL)\nhouseholds to build their houses or get house sites with financial and technical assistance\nfrom the government.\nComponents of the Scheme The IAY has the following three components:\n(i) Assistance for construction of a new house\n(ii) Upgradation of kutcha or dilapidated houses\n(iii) Provision of house sites\n\nUnder IAY, with affect from 2013, a shelterless BPL family is given assistance of 70,000\nin plain areas and 75,000 in hilly/difficult areas/IAP (Integrated Action Plan) districts.\nAssistance for purchase of house sites has been fixed at ¢20,000.\nFunding Pattern The cost of the scheme except the component for provision of house sites is\nshared between Government of India and state governments in the ratio of 75 : 25. In the case\nof north-eastern states, the ratio is 90 : 10. The cost of providing house sites is shared 50 : 50\nbetween Government of India and state governments. The Government of India provides the\nfull cost in respect of Union Territories (UTs).\nEarmarking of Funds At the national level, 60% of the funds are earmarked for SCs and STs\nwith the proportion between SCs and STs being decided from time to time by the Ministry of\nRural Development and reflected in the targets. Further, 15% of the funds are set apart for\nbeneficiaries from among the minorities. The state should ensure that atleast 3% of\nbeneficiaries are from among persons with disabilities.\n\n\n5. Allocation of Funds Ninety-five per cent of the total budget is utilised for the components\nrelating to new houses, upgradation of houses and provision of house sites and administrative\nexpenses. The remaining 5% is reserved for special projects.\n\nAllocation to states/UTs and from States/UTs to districts, blocks and wherever the states so\ndesire, to the village Panchayats is on the basis of houseless people from among the BPL\npopulation for each category, i.e., SC, ST, minorities and others.\n\nThe Ministry has fixed the annual allocation for the States/UTs on the basis of 75%\nweightage to housing shortage in rural areas and 25% weightage to the number of people BPL.\nWithin this overall target, allocation of funds for SCs, STs and Minorities is made on the basis\nof the proportionate population of these categories in the States/UTs.\n\n6. Special Projects Five per cent of IAY allocation is retained at the central level as reserve\nfund. Special Projects for utilising the reserve fund can be posed by the States/UTs for the\nfollowing purposes:\n\n(i) Rehabilitation of BPL families affected by natural calamities.\n(ii) Rehabilitation of BPL families affected by violence and law and order problems.\n(iii) Settlement of freed, bonded labourers and liberated, manual scavengers.\n(iv) Settlement of particularly vulnerable tribal groups.\n(v) New technology demonstration — especially with focus on affordable and green\ntechnologies.\n\n7. Administrative Expenses Upto 4% of the funds released can be utilised for administering the\nscheme, of which upto 0.5% can be retained at the state level and the balance can be\ndistributed to the districts. The district allocation includes two parts, one part to meet fixed\nexpenditure which is same for all districts in a state and the other part proportional to the\ntargets allotted to the district in order to meet working expenses. The states may decide the\nformula and also the formula for distribution to the intermediate and Village Panchayat levels\nin accordance with workload assigned to them.\n\n8. Agency for Implementation At the district level the implementation is entrusted to Zilla\nParishad or its equivalent in states where there are no Zilla Parishads.\n\nAt the local level, the Village Panchayat, or its equivalent where the state has no Village\nPanchayats, implements the programme. If Village Panchayats are too small to implement the\nscheme, the state may entrust the task to the Panchayat at the intermediate level. In such cases,\nVillage Panchayats are given clear roles in selection of habitats and beneficiaries and in\nsupervision and monitoring.\n\n9. Selection of Beneficiaries The Gram Sabha selects the beneficiaries from the list of eligible\nBPL households/Permanent [AY Waitlist wherever it has been prepared.\n\nIn order to introduce transparency in selection of beneficiaries, permanent [AY waitlists\nhave to be prepared gram panchayat wise. These lists contain the name of deserving BPL\nfamilies who need IAY houses in order of their poverty status based on the BPL list 2002.\n\nConstruction of an IAY house is the responsibility of the beneficiary. Engagement of\ncontractors is prohibited and no specific type, design has been stipulated for an IAY house.\nHowever, sanitary latrine and smokeless chullah are required to be constructed along with\neach IAY house. For construction of the sanitary latrine, the beneficiary can avail of the\nexisting assistance from the Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC).\n\n10. Women Empowerment The basic parameter of the scheme aims for gender equality and\nempowerment. However, under the scheme no separate funds are earmarked for women. As\n\n\nper scheme guidelines, houses constructed are to be allotted in the name of female member of\nthe beneficiary household. Alternatively, it can be allotted in the name of both husband and\nwife under the programme. When there is no eligible female member in the family\navailable/alive, [AY house is allotted to the male members of a deserving BPL family.\nHomestead Scheme The scheme was launched in 2009 as part of LAY, for providing\nhomestead sites to those rural BPL households whose names are included in the Permanent\nIAY Waitlists but who do not have house site.\n\nConvergence Necessary instructions have been issued to all the DRDAs regarding\nconvergence of various Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) with IAY. IAY beneficiaries can\nget benefits under Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana (RGGVY), Total Sanitation\nCampaign (TSC), Janshree and Aam Aadmi Bima Yojana and Differential Rate of Interest\n(DRI) Scheme."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Decentralised Planning The Programme draws upon the model of decentralised network\nplanning for rural roads. The District Rural Roads Plans (DRRPs) have been developed for\nall the districts of the country and Core Network has been drawn out of the DRRP to provide\nfor at least a single connectivity to each target habitation.\n\n2.

In particular, Article 41 of the Constitution of India\ndirects the state to provide public assistance to its citizens in case of unemployment, old age, sickness\nand disablement and in other cases of undeserved want within the limit of its economic capacity and\ndevelopment. It is in accordance with these noble principles that the Government of India launched\nthe National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) in 1995.\n\nThe NSAP then comprised National Old Age Pension Scheme (NOAPS), National Family Benefit\nScheme (NFBS) and National Maternity Benefit Scheme (NMBS). These programmes were meant for\nproviding social assistance benefit to the aged, the BPL households in the case of death of the primary\nbreadwinner and for maternity. These programmes were aimed at ensuring minimum national\nstandards in addition to the benefits that the states were then providing or would provide in future.\n\nThe NMBS was transferred to Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in 2001 and subsumed in\nJanani Suraksha Yojana. In 2000, a new scheme known as Annapurna Scheme was launched. In 2009,\ntwo new schemes, namely, Indira Gandhi National Widow Pension Scheme (IGNWPS) and Indira\nGandhi National Disability Pension Scheme (IGNDPS) have been introduced under NSAP.\n\nTherefore, at present (2014), the NSAP comprises the following five schemes:\n\n1. Indira Gandhi National Old Age Pension Scheme (IGNOAPS) The Government of India in\nthe year 2007 modified the eligibility criteria for grant of old age pension to persons aged 65\n\n\nyears or higher and belonging to a household below the poverty line. With this modification\nthe National Old Age Pension Scheme (NOAPS) was renamed as Indira Gandhi National Old\nAge Pension Scheme (IGNOAPS).\n\nUnder IGNOAPS, since 2007, old age pension of ,200 per month was being provided to\npersons of 65 years and above.\n\nIn the year 2011, under IGNOAPS, the eligibility for old age pension has been reduced from\n65 years to 60 years and the amount of pension has been raised from 200 to 7500 per month\nfor those who are 80 years or above.\n\nHence, under the IGNOAPS scheme, the BPL persons in the age group of 60-79 years are\nentitled to a monthly pension of 200 and BPL persons of age of 80 years and above are\nentitled to a monthly pension of 7500\n\nIndira Gandhi National Widow Pension Scheme (IGNWPS) In the year 2009, the GOI has\napproved pension to BPL widows in the age group of 40-64 years @ 7200 p.m per\nbeneficiary. Consequent upon the lowering of age under IGNOAPS, the upper age limit under\nIGNWPS has been lowered from 64 years to 59 years.\n\nIn the year 2012, the amount of pension under IGNWPS has been increased to ¢300 p.m. and\nupper age limit has been increased to 79 years. Hence, IGNWPS is applicable to widows in\nthe age group of 40-79 years and belonging to household living below poverty line.\n\nIndira Gandhi National Disability Pension Scheme (IGNDPS) In 2009, the GOI has also\napproved pension under Indira Gandhi National Disability Pension Scheme (IGNDPS) for\nBPL persons with severe or multiple disabilities between the age group of 18-64 years @ x\n200 p.m. per beneficiary. Consequent upon the lowering of age under IGNOAPS, the upper\nage limit under IGNDPS has been lowered from 64 years to 59 years.\n\nIn the year 2012, the amount of pension under IGNDPS has been increased to z300 p.m. and\nupper age limit has been increased to 79 years. Hence, IGNDPS is applicable to persons with\nsevere or multiple disabilities between the age group of 18-79 years and belonging to\nhousehold living below poverty line.\n\nNational Family Benefit Scheme (NFBS) At inception, grant of ,5000 in case of death due\nto natural causes and z10,000 in case of accidental death of the “primary breadwinner” was\nprovided to the bereaved household under this scheme. The primary breadwinner specified in\nthe scheme, whether male or female, had to be a member of the household whose earning\ncontributed substantially to the total household income. The death of such a primary\nbreadwinner occurring whilst he or she was in the age group of 18 to 64 years, i.e., more than\n18 years of age and less than 65 years of age, made the family eligible to receive grants under\nthe scheme.\n\nIn 1998, the amount of benefit under NFBS was raised to ¢10,000 in case of death due to\nnatural causes as well as accidental causes.\n\nIn the year 2012, the amount of assistance under NFBS has been increased to 20,000 and\nupper age limit of death of primary breadwinner has been reduced to 59 years.

The\nNLRMP was formed by the merger of two pre-existing centrally sponsored schemes, viz.,\nStrengthening of Revenue Administration and Updating of Land Records (started in 1987-88) and\nComputerisation of Land Records (launched in 1988-89).\n\nComponents\n\nThe main objective of the NLRMP is to modernise the land records system in the country and to build\nup an integrated land information management system with up-to-date and real time land records. For\nthis purpose, the two main systems of land records management and registration are to be integrated\nwith the help of modern technology. Accordingly, the following activities are being supported under\nthe programme:\n\n1. completion of computerisation of the records of rights (RoRs).\n\n2. digitisation of maps and integration of textual and spatial data.\n\n3. survey/resurvey using modern technology including aerial photogrammetry.\n\n4. computerisation of registration.\n\n5. automatic generation of mutation notices.\n\n6. vertical linking of revenue offices and connectivity amongst the land records and registration\noffices.\n\n7. modern record rooms/land records management centres at tehsil/taluk/circle/block level.\n\n8. training and capacity building of the concerned officials and functionaries.\n\nFunding Pattern\n\nThe NLRMP is being implemented as a centrally sponsored scheme with the following funding\npattern for its various components:\n\n(i) Computerisation of land records including digitisation of cadastral maps, integration of textual\nand spatial data, data centres at tehsil, sub-division, district and state level, interconnectivity\namong revenue offices (100% by Government of India).\n\n(ii) Survey/resurvey and updating of the survey & settlement records (including ground control\nnetwork and ground truthing) using modern technology options. (90% and 50% by Govt. of\nIndia for NE states and other states respectively).\n\n(iii) Computerisation of Registration including connectivity to SROs with revenue offices (90%\nand 25% by Govt. of India for NE states and other states respectively).\n\n(iv) Modern record rooms/land records management centres at tehsil level (90% and 50% by\nGovt. of India for NE states and other states respectively).\n\n(v) Training & capacity building (100% by Govt. of India)\n\n(vi) Core GIS (100% by Govt. of India)\n\n\nSignificance\n\nA major focus of the NLRMP is on citizen services, such as providing computerised copies of the\nrecords of rights (RoRs) with maps; other landbased certificates such as caste certificates, income\ncertificates, domicile certificates; information for eligibility for development programmes etc.\nProperty owners are accessed to their land records, as records are placed on the websites with\nproper security IDs. Abolition of stamp papers and payment of stamp duty and registration fees\nthrough banks, e-linkages to credit facilities, automatic and automated mutations and single-window\nservice can be achieved under the programme.\n\nFurther, the NLRMP is of immense usefulness to the governments—both Central and state\ngovernments—in modernising and bringing efficiency to the land revenue administration as well as\noffering a comprehensive tool for planning various land-based developmental, regulatory and disaster\nmanagement activities needing location-specific information.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the NLRMP is to usher in the system of conclusive titling, to replace the\ncurrent system of presumptive titles in the country. The activities to be undertaken under the\nprogramme are to converge in the district and district is the unit of implementation. All the districts in\nthe country are expected to be covered under the programme by the end of the Twelfth Plan."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The DDP was launched in 1977-78 for hot desert areas of Rajasthan,\nGujarat, Haryana and cold desert areas of Jammu & Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. In 1995—96, the\ncoverage of DDP was extended to six districts of Karnataka and one district of Andhra Pradesh. The\nIWDP was launched in 1989 for development of wastelands on watershed basis.

The primary objectives of\nthe scheme are the provision of livelihood opportunities and urban amenities in rural areas to bridge\nthe rural—urban divide and to improve the quality of life in rural areas. The scheme is being\nimplemented on pilot basis.\n\nLack of livelihood opportunities, modern amenities and services for decent living in rural areas\nlead to migration of people to urban areas. There are wide gaps in the availability of physical and\nsocial infrastructure between rural and urban areas. To address these issues, in the year 2003, the\nthen President of India Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam had enunciated the idea of integrated development of\nvillages leading to urbanisation through a mission for Provision of Urban Amenities in Rural Areas\n(PURA). Dr. Kalam visualised providing four connectivities: physical connectivity, electronic\nconnectivity, knowledge connectivity leading to economic connectivity of rural areas.\n\nPURA and PURA 1.0\n\n\nSubsequently, PURA was implemented as a pilot scheme during the Tenth Five Year Plan in Basmath\n(Maharashtra), Bharthana (Uttar Pradesh), Gohpur (Assam), Kujanga (Orissa), Motipur (Bihar),\nRayadurg (Andhra Pradesh) and Shahpura (Rajasthan). An evaluation study of these pilot projects by\nNational Institute of Rural Development (NIRD) revealed that the scheme was open-ended without\nspecific guidelines and had no in-built business plan. Besides, it was largely infrastructure-centric\nwithout factoring lead economic activities and the site selection was not based on growth potential. It\ndid not allow for convergence with other schemes of rural development or other departments, hence\nhaving limited impact on holistic development of rural areas.\n\nBased on the findings of the evaluation study by NIRD, comments of various\nMinistries/Departments, feedback received during consultations with private sector representatives\nand officials of state governments, and the recommendations of the consulting team of Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB), the scheme was totally restructured as PURA 1.0 for implementation on\npilot basis during Eleventh Five Year Plan as a central sector scheme. The salient features of the\nrestructured PURA 1.0 included the following :\n\n1. Convergence of Central and state government schemes.\nImplementation in project mode and based on lifecycle cost approach that allows bundling of\nconstruction and O&M of infrastructure and amenities.\n\n3. Implementation through a single private partner to ensure simultaneous delivery of key\ninfrastructure required in villages leading to optimal use of resources.\n\n4. Site selection by private partner on basis of socio-economic growth considerations.\n\n5. Agreement between Gram Panchayat and the private partner that makes the restructured PURA\na model for empowerment of Gram Panchayats and public accountability.\n\nThe Working Group for PURA 1.0 constituted by Planning Commission has recommended that\nPURA 1.0 be upscaled as a full-fledged scheme during the Twelfth Five Year Plan and implemented\nall over the country.\n\nPURA 2.0 (PURA Phase ID)\n\nAccordingly, in 2012, the Ministry of Rural Development has launched PURA Phase II (PURA 2.0)\nas a central sector scheme which is implemented through a Public Private Partnership (PPP)\narrangement amongst Central Government, state government, Gram Panchayat(s) and the private\nsector. The rollout of projects is supported by Planning Commission, Department of Economic\nAffairs and Asian Development Bank.\n\nThe redesigned PURA 2.0 is a unique blend of infrastructure provisioning, economic activity, skill\ndevelopment and livelihood generation. It is an effort to provide a different framework for the\nimplementation of rural infrastructure development schemes and harness private sector efficiencies in\nthe management of assets and delivery of services.\n\nThe scope of the scheme is to select private partners to develop livelihood opportunities, urban\namenities and infrastructure facilities to prescribed service levels almost akin to urban standards and\nto be responsible for maintenance of the same for a period of ten years in identified\nPanchayats/cluster of Panchayats. Private sector entities having experience in development and\nmanagement of community-oriented infrastructure projects are selected through an open competitive\nbidding process based on rigorous qualifications and evaluation criteria.\n\nThe selected private partners are required to provide standard amenities like water supply and\nsewerage, roads, drainage, solid waste management, street lighting and power distribution and\n\n\nundertake some economic and skill development activity as part of the PURA project. The private\npartners may also provide ‘add-on’ revenue-earning facilities such as village linked tourism,\nintegrated rural hub, rural market, agri-common services centre and warehousing, etc. in addition to\nthe above-mentioned amenities. Where the PURA project spans several Panchayats in a cluster, the\nprivate partner would propose sub-projects with the PURA elements for each of the Panchayats.\n\nThe leveraging of public funds with private capital and management expertise for creation and\nmaintenance of rural infrastructure is the essence of the PURA scheme. Further, the scheme is\nenvisioned to act as the catalyst not only for convergence between different infrastructure\ndevelopment schemes but also for the new model for the management of urbanisation of rural areas."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Under the scheme, projects are taken up in the areas of irrigation, road, rural housing,\nrural water supply, rural electrification and rural telecommunication connectivity. Specific goals and\ntargets were set in each of these areas.\n\nUnder Bharat Nirman, the effort is to impart a sense of urgency to these goals by up-scaling the\nphysical targets under various components and making the programme timebound, transparent as well\nas accountable. Phase I of the programme was implemented in the period 2005—06 to 2008-09 and on\nthe basis of the outcome, Phase II was implemented from 2009-10 to 2011-12.

The\n\nplan has been extended to the end of\n2014.\n6. Rural Telephone To connect remaining 66,822 Increase rural tele-density to 40%\nConnectivity villages with telephone by 2007. and provide broadband connectivity\n\nand Bharat Nirman Seva Kendras to\n\n\nall 2.5 lakh Panchayats. The plan has\nbeen extended to the end of 2014.\n\nThe components-wise details of the programme are given below:\n\n1. Drinking Water Supply Bharat Nirman envisages providing safe drinking water to all uncovered\nhabitations by 2012. Supply of safe drinking water in uncovered, slipped back and quality affected\nhabitations is one of the components of Bharat Nirman. Thus Bharat Nirman envisaged covering\n55,067 uncovered habitations, 2.8 lakh slipped back habitations and about 2.17 lakh quality affected\nhabitations.\n\nThe Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation is responsible for meeting this goal in partnership\nwith state governments. Against 55,067 un-covered habitations to be covered during the Bharat\nNirman period, 54,440 habitations have been covered during Phase-I. The implementation status of\nthe NRDWP under Bharat Nirman Phase-II shows that all the uncovered habitations envisaged under\nBharat Nirman have been covered and against an overall physical target of 1,05,479 quality affected\nhabitations to be covered up to 2011-12, a total of 87,028 habitations have been covered upto\nOctober, 2012.\n\n2. Irrigation Irrigation is one of the six components of Bharat Nirman. There is huge gap between\nirrigation potential created and the potential utilised. Under Bharat Nirman it is planned to restore\nand utilise irrigation potential of 10 lakh hectare through implementation of extension, renovation and\nmodernisation of schemes alongwith command area development and water management practices.\nThere are considerable areas in the country with unutilised ground water resources. Irrigation\npotential of 28 lakh hectare is planned to be created through ground water development. The\nremaining target for creation of irrigation potential of 10 lakh hectares is planned to be created by\nway of minor irrigation schemes using surface flow. Ten lakh hectare of irrigation potential is also\nplanned by way of repair, renovation and restoration of water bodies and extension, renovation and\nmodernisation of minor irrigation schemes.\n\nThe irrigation potential created was 7.3155 mha against a target of 10 mha during phase-I and\nduring phase-II 4.460 mha irrigation potential was created upto October, 2012.\n\n3. Roads Road connectivity is a major component of Bharat Nirman. The aim is to connect all\nvillages that have a population of 1000 (or 500 in hilly/tribal area) with an all-weather road by 2012.\nThis is expected to generate multiplier effects in the rural economy of linking production to markets\nand services. This work, which is being undertaken under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana\nsince 2000, has been modified to address the above goals within the stipulated time-frame. The\nfunding for the programme is made under the CSS ‘Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak’ Yojana by Ministry\nof Rural Development which is 100% funding by the Centre to the states.\n\nNew connectivity is proposed to be provided to a total of 54,648 habitations under Bharat Nirman.\nThis will involve construction of 1,46,185.34 km of rural roads. In addition to new connectivity, the\nscheme also envisages upgradation/renewal of 1,94,130.69 km of existing rural roads. Under the rural\nroads component of Bharat Nirman, 44,089 habitations have been provided all-weather road\nconnectivity, 2,35,903 km road had upgraded and 1,89,897 km length road has been provided under\nnew connectivity up to March 2012.\n\n4. Electricity The Ministry of Power launched Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana\n(RGGVY) as one of its flagship programme in March 2005 with the objective of electrifying over one\n\n\nlakh un-electrified villages and to provide free electricity connections to 2.34 crore rural BPL\nhouseholds. This programme has been brought under the ambit of Bharat Nirman. Under RGGVY,\nelectricity distribution infrastructure is envisaged to establish Rural Electricity Distribution\nBackbone (REDB) with at least a 33/11 KV sub-station in a block, Village Electrification\nInfrastructure (VEI) with at least a Distribution Transformer in a village or hamlet, and standalone\ngrids with generation where grid supply is not feasible.\n\nSubsidy towards capital expenditure to the tune of 90% is being provided, through Rural\nElectrification Corporation Limited (REC), which is a nodal agency for implementation of the\nscheme. Electrification of un-electrified Below Poverty Line (BPL) households is being financed\nwith 100% capital subsidy @ ¢2200 per connection in all rural habitations.\n\nRural Electrification Corporation is the nodal agency for implementation of the scheme. The\nservices of Central Public Sector Undertakings (CPSU) are available to the states for assisting them\nin the execution of Rural Electrification projects. The Management of Rural Distribution is mandated\nthrough franchisees.\n\nThe target is to take electricity to all villages and offer electricity connection to 1.75 crore poor\nhouseholds by 2012. By November 2011, 1.75 lakh BPL households were electrified. One lakh\nunelectrified villages were electrified against a target of electrification of 1.0 lakh unelectrified\nvillages.\n\n5. Housing Rural Housing is one of the six components of the Bharat Nirman package. The rural\nhousing programme is implemented by the Ministry of Rural Development through the Indira Awaas\nYojana scheme, which is a centrally sponsored scheme where the cost is shared between the Centre\nand the states on a 75 : 25 basis. The criteria adopted for allocation of financial resources between\nthe States/UTs gives greater emphasis to the states with higher incidence of shelterlessness. Seventy-\nfive per cent weightage is given to housing shortage and 25% weightage to the poverty ratios\nprescribed by the Planning Commission for state-level allocations. For district-level allocations,\n75% weightage is given again to housing shortage and 25% to SC/ST component of the population.\n\nAgainst a target of construction of 60 lakh houses, 71.76 lakh houses were constructed during the\nPhase-I of Bharat Nirman under the component of Housing and against a target of construction of 120\nlakh houses, 95.1 lakh houses were constructed upto September, 2012.\n\n6. Rural Telephone Connectivity The Department of Telecommunications in the Ministry of\nCommunications and Information Technology has the responsibility of providing telephone\nconnectivity to the 66,822 villages that remain to be covered. The resources for implementation of\nuniversal services obligation are raised through a Universal Service Levy which has presently been\nfixed at 5% of the adjusted gross revenue of all telecom service providers except the pure value-\nadded service providers like internet, voice mail, e-mail service providers. The rules also make a\nprovision for the Central Government to give grants and loans to the fund. The balance to the credit of\nthe fund does not lapse at the end of the financial year.\n\nUnder Rural Telephony component of Bharat Nirman programme Phase II, the objective is to\nachieve 40 per cent rural telephony by the year 2014, ensure broadband coverage to all 2.5 lakh\nPanchayats and set up Bharat Nirman Seva Kendras at Panchayat level by 2012. As on August 2011,\nrural teledensity of 36.23 per cent was achieved and broadband coverage was extended to 1,38,434\nvillage Panchayats till September, 2011. 62,101 village telephones were provided against a target of\n62,302 of VPTs."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Later, this duration has been extended by three years upto 2014-15 for completion of on-\ngoing projects and reforms.\n\nThe aim of JNNURM is to encourage reforms and fast-track planned development of identified\ncities. The focus is on efficiency in urban infrastructure and service delivery mechanisms, community\nparticipation, and accountability of ULBs/Parastatal agencies towards citizens.\n\nObjectives\n\nThe objectives of the JNNURM are to ensure that the following are achieved in the urban sector :\n\n(a) Focussed attention to integrated development of infrastructure services in cities covered under\nthe Mission;\n\n(b) Establishment of linkages between asset-creation and asset-management through a slew of\nreforms for long-term project sustainability;\n\n(c) Ensuring adequate funds to meet the deficiencies in urban infrastructural services;\n\n(d) Planned development of identified cities including peri-urban areas, outgrowths and urban\ncorridors leading to dispersed urbanisation;\n\n(e) Scale-up delivery of civic amenities and provision of utilities with emphasis on universal\naccess to the urban poor;\n\n(f) Special focus on urban renewal programme for the old city areas to reduce congestion; and\n\n(g) Provision of basic services to the urban poor including security of tenure at affordable prices,\nimproved housing, water supply and sanitation, and ensuring delivery of other existing\nuniversal services of the government for education, health and social security.\n\nComponents\n\nThe JNNURM comprises two Sub-Missions, namely :\n(i) Urban Infrastructure and Governance (UIG) (Sub-mission I)\n(ii) Basic Services to the Urban Poor (BSUP) (Sub-mission II)\nThere are, in addition, two other components :\n(i) Urban Infrastructure Development Scheme for Small & Medium Towns (UIDSSMT)\n(ii) Integrated Housing and Slum Development Programme (IHSDP)\n\nThe UIG and BSUP are for select 65 large cities and cities of religious/historical/tourist\nimportance while the all other cities/towns are covered under UIDSSMT and IHSDP.\n\nThe Ministry of Housing & Urban Poverty Alleviation is the nodal Ministry for BSUP and IHSDP\nwhereas the Ministry of Urban Development is the nodal Ministry for UIG and UIDSSMT.\n\nThe scope of the two Sub-Missions is as follows:\n\nSub-Mission for Urban Infrastructure and Governance The main thrust of the Sub-Mission is on\n\n\ninfrastructure projects relating to water supply and sanitation, sewerage, solid waste management,\nroad network, urban transport and redevelopment of old city areas with a view to upgrading\ninfrastructure therein, shifting industrial and commercial establishments to conforming areas, etc.\n\nSub-Mission for Basic Services to the Urban Poor The main thrust of the Sub-Mission is on\nintegrated development of slums through projects for providing shelter, basic services and other\nrelated civic amenities with a view to providing utilities to the urban poor.\n\nStrategy\n\nThe objectives of the Mission are met through the adoption of the following strategy:\n(1) Preparing City Development Plan: Every city is expected to formulate a City Development\nPlan (CDP) indicating policies, programmes and strategies, and financing plans.\n\n(2) Preparing Projects: The CDP would facilitate identification of projects. The Urban Local\nBodies (ULBs)/parastatal agencies are required to prepare Detailed Project Reports (DPRs)\nfor undertaking projects in the identified spheres. It is essential that projects are planned in a\nmanner that optimises the life-cycle cost of projects. The life-cycle cost of a project would\ncover the capital outlays and the attendant O&M costs to ensure that assets are in good\nworking condition. A revolving fund would be created to meet the O&M requirements of\nassets created, over the planning horizon. In order to seek JNNURM assistance, projects\nwould need to be developed in a manner that would ensure and demonstrate optimisation of\nthe life-cycle costs over the planning horizon of the project.\n\nRelease and Leveraging of Funds: It is expected that the JNNURM assistance would serve\nto catalyse the flow of investment into the urban infrastructure sector across the country. Funds\nfrom the Central and state government flows directly to the nodal agency designated by the\nstate, as grants-in-aid. The funds for identified projects across cities would be disbursed to\nthe ULB/Parastatal agency through the designated State Level Nodal Agency (SLNA) as soft\nloan or grant-cum-loan or grant. The SLNA / ULBs in turn would leverage additional\nresources from other sources.\n\nIncorporating Private Sector Efficiencies: In order to optimise the life-cycle costs over the\nplanning horizon, private sector efficiencies can be inducted in development, management,\nimplementation and financing of projects, through Public Private Partnership (PPP)\narrangements.\n\n(3\n\n-\n\n(4\n\nDeer]\n\nExpected Outcome\n\nOn completion of the Mission period, it is expected that ULBs and parastatal agencies will have\nachieved the following:\n(1) Modern and transparent budgeting, accounting, financial management systems, designed and\nadopted for all urban service and governance functions\n(2) City-wide framework for planning and governance will be established and become\noperational\n(3) All urban residents will be able to obtain access to a basic level of urban services\n(4) Financially self-sustaining agencies for urban governance and service delivery will be\n\n\nestablished, through reforms to major revenue instruments\n\n(5) Local services and governance will be conducted in a manner that is transparent and\naccountable to citizens\n\n(6) E-governance applications will be introduced in core functions of ULBs/Parastatal resulting\nin reduced cost and time of service delivery processes."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The\n\n\ncities/UAs covered under preparatory phase of RAY are automatically included under\nimplementation phase of RAY.\n\nFurther, the scheme is applicable to all slums within a city, whether notified or non-notified\n(including identified and recognised), whether on lands belonging to Central Government or\nits Undertakings, Autonomous bodies created under the Act of Parliament, State Government\nor its Undertakings, Urban Local Bodies or any other public agency and private sector. It is\nalso applicable to “urbanised villages” inside the planning area of the city, urban homeless\nand pavement dwellers.\n\nImplementation Approach Two-step implementation strategy is adopted i.e., preparation of\nSlum-free City Plans of Action on ‘whole city’ basis and Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) on\n‘whole slum’ basis for selected slums.\n\nThe strategy to tackle slums would need to be in two parts—(a) Curative Strategy for slum\nredevelopment of all existing slums; and (b) Preventive Strategy for containment of growth of\nfuture slums.\n\nAffordable Housing in Partnership Scheme In order to increase affordable housing stock, as\npart of the preventive strategy, Affordable Housing in Partnership (AHP) is implemented as\npart of the scheme. The Central support is provided at the rate of 75,000 per EWS/LIG DUs\n(Dwelling Units) for housing and internal development components in affordable housing\nprojects taken up under various kinds of partnerships. A project size of minimum 250\ndwelling units are considered under the scheme.\n\nCredit Risk Guarantee Fund A Credit Risk Guarantee Fund has been created to guarantee\nthe lending agencies for loans to new EWS/LIG borrowers in urban areas seeking individual\nhousing loans not exceeding a sum of 5 lakh for a housing unit."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The SJSRY was launched in 1997 to provide gainful\nemployment to the urban unemployed and underemployed poor.\n\nThe objective of NULM is to reduce poverty and vulnerability of the urban poor households by\nenabling them to access gainful self-employment and skilled wage employment opportunities. This\nshould result in an appreciable improvement in their livelihoods on a sustainable basis, through\nbuilding strong grassroots level institutions of the poor. The mission also aims at providing shelter\nequipped with essential services to the urban homeless in a phased manner. In addition, the mission\nalso addresses livelihood concerns of the urban street vendors.\n\nThe NULM is implemented in all District Headquarter Towns and all other cities with a population\nof 100,000 or more. The target of NULM is the urban population identified as below poverty line\npopulation in urban areas by the States/UTs. The coverage may be broadened to include families of\ndisadvantaged groups like SCs, STs, women, minorities, disabled etc. subject to a maximum of 25\nper cent of the above urban poor population.\n\nThe financing of the mission is shared between the Centre and the States/UTs in the ratio of 75 : 25\nand in the case of North Eastern and special category states, the ratio is 90 : 10.\n\nThe NULM has the following components:\n\n1. Social Mobilisation and Institution Development NULM envisages universal social\n\n\nooo\nmobilisation of urban poor into Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and their federations. At least one\nmember from each urban poor household, preferably a woman, should be brought under the\nSelf-Help Group network in a time-bound manner. These groups will serve as a support\nsystem for the poor, to meet their financial and social needs.\n\n2. Capacity Building and Training The objective of this component is to establish timely and\nhigh quality technical assistance at Central, State and City levels to roll out and implement\nNULM. A National Mission Management Unit (NMMU) is established at the Centre.\nAdditionally, support to states and cities is provided for setting-up of State Mission\nManagement Unit (SMMU) and City Mission Management Unit (CMMU).\n\n3. Employment Through Skills Training and Placement This component focuses on providing\nassistance for development/upgrading of the skills of the urban poor so as to enhance their\ncapacity for self-employment and salaried employment.\n\n4. Self-Employment Programme This component focuses on financial assistance to\nindividuals/groups of urban poor for setting up gainful self-employment ventures / micro-\nenterprises, suited to their skills, training, aptitude and local conditions.\n\n5. Support to Urban Street Vendors This component aims at skilling of street vendors, support\nmicro-enterprise development, credit enablement and pro-vending urban planning along with\nsupporting social security options for vulnerable groups such as women, SCs/STs and\nminorities.\n\n6. Scheme of Shelter for Urban Homeless The objective of this scheme is to provide shelter\nand all other essential services to the poorest of the poor segment of urban societies. The\nshelters should be permanent all-weather shelters for the urban homeless.\n\n7. Innovative and Special Projects This component focuses on the promotion of novel\ninitiatives in the form of innovative projects. These initiatives may be in the nature of\npioneering efforts, aimed at catalysing sustainable approaches to urban livelihoods through\nPublic, Private, Community Partnership (P-P-CP), demonstrating a promising methodology or\nmaking a distinct impact on the urban poverty situation through scalable initiatives."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

However, Ministry of Housing and Urban\nPoverty Alleviation (HUPA) has been made the nodal ministry to monitor the implementation of the\nEmployment of Manual Scavengers and Construction of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act, 1993, which\nprohibits construction and/or maintenance of dry latrines and employment of manual scavengers. The\nobnoxious practice of manual scavenging or engaging fellow human beings into cleaning the untreated\nhuman excreta is a blot on the society. The Government of India is deeply concerned about liberation\nof manual scavengers from the inhuman task of carrying night soil.\n\nThe Integrated Low Cost Sanitation (ILCS) Scheme aims at conversion of individual dry latrines\ninto pour flush latrines thereby liberating manual scavengers from the age old, obnoxious practice of\nmanually carrying night soil. The ILCS Scheme was initially started in 1980-81 through the Ministry\n\n\nof Home Affairs and later was being implemented through Ministry of Social Justice and\nEmpowerment. The scheme was transferred in 1989-90 to Ministry of Urban Development and\nPoverty Alleviation and from 2003-04 onwards to Ministry of HUPA which revised the guidelines in\nJanuary 2008.\n\nRevised Scheme\n\nUnder the revised guidelines of the ILCS scheme, funds for conversion of 2,51,963 and construction\nof 1,55,937 units have been approved to the States of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, West\nBengal, Kerala, Manipur, Nagaland, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Tripura, Rajasthan,\nChhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Odisha.\n\nSince, state governments had informed successfully converting all reported dry latrines under ILCS\nScheme during the Eleventh Plan period, the scheme was proposed to be discontinued during the 12th\nPlan Period. However, the provisional figures released by Census of India, 2011 highlighted that\nthere are 7,94,390 latrines serviced by humans out of which 2, 08,323 are located in urban areas. In\nview of the provisional figures on latrines serviced by humans released by the Census of India 2011,\nit has been decided to extend the Integrated Low Cost Sanitation Scheme with revised features and\ncost estimates in the Twelfth Plan to cover all existing dry latrines which are serviced by human\nbeings. The approval of Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) has been received in\nNovember 2012 at a total subsidy of ¢367.16 crore.\n\nNew Features\n\nThe continued ILCS has following new features:\n\n1. To increase the unit of cost of twin pit pour flush latrines from z10,000 to 15,000 (for hilly\n\nareas from 712,500 to x18,750).\n\n2. When the states decide to adopt environment friendly and maintenance free technologies like\nbio-toilets/eco-san toilets or any other such innovative technologies, an additional funding up\nto 15% over and above the normal cost are provided. Unit cost of bio-toilets/eco-san toilets\nfor general category is 17,250 (for hilly areas y21,563).\n\nThe other components of ILCS scheme are to continue as per the existing guidelines.\n4.

The RRY is a\nCentral Sector Scheme applicable in all the urban areas of the country.\n\nThe tenure of ISHUP expired on September 30, 2013 and Rajiv Rinn Yojana is effective from\n\n\nOctober 1, 2013. The salient features of the scheme are mentioned below:\n\n1.\n\non\n\n10.\n\n11.\n\nPurpose The scheme provides home loan with Central Government interest subsidy to\nEWS/LIG persons for acquisition/construction of house. Assistance is also available to such\nof the EWS/LIG beneficiaries who intend to make additions to the existing dwelling units.\nSuch beneficiaries who own land in any urban area but do not have any pucca house is also\ncovered under the scheme.\n\nEligibility The economic parameter of EWS is defined as households having an average\nannual income up to ¢1,00,000 and the economic parameter of LIG is defined as households\nhaving an average annual income between ¢1,00,001 and ¢2,00,000.\n\nLoan Amount Admissible The scheme provides an interest subsidy for a maximum amount of\n75,00,000 for an EWS individual for a house. Additional loans, if needed would be at\nunsubsidised rates. The loan tenure can be between 15-20 years.\n\nA maximum loan amount of ¢8,00,000 for an LIG individual is admissible.

The loan tenure can be between 15-20 years.\nSubsidy The subsidy is 5% p.a. on interest charged on the admissible loan amount for EWS\nand LIG, for construction or acquisition of a new house or for carrying out addition to the\nexisting building.\n\nThe Central Nodal Agencies (CNA) for the scheme are the National Housing Bank (NHB) and\nHousing & Urban Development Corporation Ltd. (HUDCO). The nodal agencies will not lend\ndirectly to the borrower but through banks or Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) who agree\nto be part of the scheme.\n\nThe scheme will currently close on March 31, 2017, the last year of the Twelfth Five Year\nPlan Period (2012-17).

Borrowers would be free to approach and negotiate a loan\nunder the scheme directly with the lender. However, it is envisaged that such borrowers\nwould be few. Most borrowers and lenders would require the intercession of state\nGovernments/Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) to identify borrowers with land, help them with\npreparation of papers and liaise for them with the lenders.\n\nThe voluntary NGOs may also be involved by State Governments/ULBs in building\nawareness about the scheme among the urban poor. The applications duly filled through\nNGOs may also be accepted by the Banks and HFCs.\n\nIn identifying beneficiaries, the ULB or the local agency identified by the state should as far as\npossible identify clusters in which land has been allotted and housing can be supported\nthrough this scheme within such clusters. The preference under the scheme (subject to\n\n\n12.\n\nbeneficiaries being from EWS/LIG segments) should be given to Women, Scheduled Caste,\nScheduled Tribe, Minorities and Persons with disabilities.\n\nApplicants Applicants planning to form cooperative group housing societies or organisations\nlike Employees Welfare Housing, Labour Housing, etc. should be given preference and\nwherever possible construction of houses by such cooperatives by way of 1+3 storeyed\nbuildings should be promoted so that cost of land is shared among beneficiaries.

Thus, addressing locally felt developmental and\ninfrastructural needs and bridging the gap for developmental works is envisaged under the Scheme.\nThe salient features of the MPLAD Scheme are as follows:\n1. MPLADS is a Plan scheme under which funds are released in the form of Grant-in-aid, as\nSpecial Central Assistance to States.\n2. Works which are developmental in nature, based on locally felt needs and always available\nfor public use at large, are eligible under the scheme.\n\n\n3.\n\n10.\n\n11.\n\n12.\n\n13.\n\n14.\n\nThe Members of Parliament have a recommendatory role under the Scheme. The MPs\nrecommend the works based on locally felt needs to the concerned District Authorities who\nget the works implemented by following the established procedure of the concerned state\ngovernment.\n\nExamining the eligibility, sanctioning, funding, selection of implementing agencies,\nprioritisation and overall execution and monitoring of the scheme at the ground level, is done\nby the district authorities.\n\nThe Lok Sabha Members can recommend works in their respective constituencies. The\nelected members of the Rajya Sabha can recommend works anywhere in the state from which\nthey are elected. Nominated Members of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha may select works for\nimplementation anywhere in the country.\n\nThe funds released under the scheme are non-lapsable, i.e., the liability of funds not released\nin a particular year is carried forward for making releases in the subsequent years subject to\neligibility. The annual entitlement per MP is ¢5 crore from 2011-12. In 1993-94, when the\nscheme was launched, an amount of ¢5 lakh per MP was allotted which was enhanced to ¢1\ncrore per annum from 1994-95 per MP constituency. This was further increased to 2 crore\nfrom 1998-99. Now it has been increased from 2 crore to x5 crore from 2011-12.\n\nImportant items of work like drinking water, education, public health, and funds for\ndevelopment of SC/ST are given priority.\n\nThere is no limit for a work to be executed by government agencies. There is a ceiling of 725\nlakh for the works to any Trust/Society. Also to encourage Trusts/Societies to work for the\nbetterment of the tribal people, the ceiling of 725 lakh has been increased to 37.50 lakh where\nthe additional amount of * 12.50 lakh should be used for the creation of public utility building\nassets primarily for the benefit of tribal people exclusively in the notified tribal CD blocks\nwith more than 50% tribal population.\n\nMPLADS emphasises work relating to provision of drinking water in the notified drought\naffected districts, such as hand pumps for drinking water, storage tanks, reservoirs, community\nrain water harvesting, etc.\n\nThe maximum limit for rehabilitation work in areas affected by severe calamities is now 50\nlakh.\n\nIn order to give special attention to development of areas inhabited by Scheduled Castes and\nScheduled Tribes, 15% of MPLADS funds would be utilised for areas inhabited by SC\npopulation and 7.5% for areas inhabited by ST population and if there is no tribal population\nin the constituency of the Lok Sabha members of Parliament, they can recommend works\nwithin their state of election upto 7.5% of their annual entitlement in the notified CD blocks\nwith more than 50% tribal population.\n\nThe role of Panchayati Raj Institutions and Urban Local Bodies as Implementing Agencies is\nstressed.\n\nRelease of first installment equal to 50% of annual entitlement in respect of MPs at the time of\nconstitution of Lok Sabha and election to the Rajya Sabha is done automatically without\nwaiting for any document from district authorities.\n\nTo bring in more financial accountability, Utilisation Certificate for the previous financial\nyear and the Audit Certificate for the funds released in the year prior to the previous year are\nalso pre-requisites for the release of the second instalment. From 2012-13, release of first\ninstalment is made on the basis of the release of second instalment of previous year being\n\n\nmade and also provisional Utilisation Certificate to be given by the District Authority in\nrespect of 80% of entitlement of first instalment of previous year.\n\n15. Funds received by the Government of India are deposited by the District Administrations in\nnationalised banks.\n\n16. The normal financial and audit procedures prevalent in the states in which the works are\nexecuted apply with regard to the implementation of the works.\n\n17. The roles of Central Government, State Government, District Authorities and Implementing\nAgencies have been clearly demarcated for implementation of MPLAD Scheme.\n\n18. The MPLADS Parliamentary Committee of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha make suggestions\nand recommendations to the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation on\nrepresentations received from MPs and issues raised by the MPs from time to time.\n\n19. The role of the Central Government inter-alia is to monitor overall position of fund release,\nreceipt of completion reports etc. and to bring out the annual report on the implementation of\nMPLADS.\n\n20. The role of the State/UT Government inter-alia is to coordinate with the ministry as well as\nfrom district authorities for effective implementation of the scheme.\n\n21. The role of the District Authority inter-alia is to inspect and monitor the works regularly.\n\n22. The implementing agencies are to furnish physical and financial progress of each work to the\nDistrict Authorities every month and also furnish completion report certificates.\n\nOne “MP-One Idea Scheme”\n\nIn the year 2012, the government announced a new scheme “One MP—One Idea” under the Member of\nParliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS). In order to foster, a grass-root bottoms-up\napproach to innovation and development and to arrive at solutions for local problems which are\nsustainable and scalable, there is a need for seeking out and campaigning for ideas that have the\npotential to solve challenges. Accordingly, based on the innovative ideas received from the local\npeople regarding developmental projects, a ‘One MP—One Idea’ competition may be held in each Lok\nSabha constituency annually to select the three best innovations for cash awards on the specific\nrequest of an MP to promote such a scheme in his/her constituency.\n\nUnder the scheme, the applications are invited for providing innovative solutions pertaining to\nsocial issues, especially in the area of education and skills, health, water and sanitation, housing and\ninfrastructure, agriculture, energy, environment, community and social service, etc. These innovative\nsolutions are evaluated in a transparent manner by a selection committee headed by the DC/DM of the\nNodal District and consisting of six members from Engineering, Finance, Health and Sanitation,\nAcademia, Industry and Banking and Financial Institutions.\n\nThe Member of Parliament awards Certificate of Honour along with cash award of ¢2.5 lakh, x1.5\nlakh and z1 lakh to the first, second and third best innovative solutions respectively through his\nMPLAD funds in a public function. In addition, a Certificate of Appreciation is given to the next five\nbest innovations.

The committee identifies and adopts the most backward districts of the State\nand also a Mother NGO having a good track record, adequate infrastructure and experience from the\nconcerned area for implementation of the project. Motivational camps are conducted in identified\nareas in the States culminating into formation of Community Based Groups (CBG). The groups\ndemocratically decide the activity to be undertaken by them.\n\n13. Gender Budgeting Scheme\n\nGender Budgeting is not an accounting exercise but an ongoing process to ensure that benefits of\ndevelopment reach women as much as men. It entails maintaining a gender perspective at various\nstages like programme/policy formulation, assessment of needs of target groups, review of existing\npolicies and guidelines, allocation of resources, implementation of programmes, impact assessment,\nreprioritisation of resources, etc. A gender responsive budget is the culmination of this process.\n\nGender Budgeting involves dissection of the Government budget to establish its gender-differential\nimpacts and to translate gender commitments into budgetary commitments. It does not seek to create a\nseparate budget but to provide affirmative action to address the specific needs of women. It goes\nbeyond allocation of resources for women, to cover tracking the utilisation of allocated resources,\nimpact analysis and beneficiary incidence analysis of public expenditure and policy from a gender\nperspective.\n\nTo institutionalise Gender Budgeting in India, the setting up of Gender Budgeting Cells (GBCs) in\nall Ministries/Departments was mandated by the Ministry of Finance in 2004-05.\n\nIn 2004-05, the Ministry of Women and Child Development adopted “Budgeting for Gender\nEquity” as a Mission Statement. The Ministry as the nodal agency for Gender Budgeting has been\nundertaking several initiatives for taking it forward at the National and State levels. The Ministry has\nbeen following a three-pronged strategy to pursue the process of Gender Budgeting in the country:\n\n(i) Placing emphasis on and advocating for setting up of gender budgeting structures/mechanisms\n\nin all Ministries/Departments of the Government;\n\n(ii) Strengthening internal and external capacities and building expertise to undertake gender\n\nmainstreaming of policies/schemes/programmes; and\n\n(iii) Initiating the exercise of gender auditing of existing programmes, which would then feed into\n\naddressing gaps and strengthening service delivery mechanisms.\n\nA Plan Scheme for Gender Budgeting was launched in the year 2008 during the Eleventh Plan\nperiod, for conducting trainings/workshops, capacity building, research surveys, etc. Under the\nScheme, inter alia, the Ministry undertakes many programmes as well as provides financial support to\nCentral/State Government agencies, for the purpose. This scheme is being continued in the Twelfth\nPlan."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

These are explained below:\n\n1. Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Scheme\n\nThe Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) of Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Scheme\nwas launched in 1975. It is one of the flagship programmes of the Government of India and represents\none of the world’s largest and unique programmes for early childhood care and development. It is the\nforemost symbol of country’s commitment to its children and nursing mothers, as a response to the\nchallenge of providing pre-school non-formal education on one hand and breaking the vicious cycle\nof malnutrition, morbidity, reduced learning capacity and mortality on the other. The beneficiaries\nunder the scheme are children in the age group of 0-6 years, pregnant women and lactating mothers.\n\nObjectives The objectives of the scheme are as follows:\n\n(i) to improve the nutritional and health status of children in the age-group 0-6 years;\n\n(ii) to lay the foundation for proper psychological, physical and social development of the child;\n\n(iii) to reduce the incidence of mortality, morbidity, malnutrition and school dropout;\n\n(iv) to achieve effective co-ordination of policy and implementation amongst the various\ndepartments to promote child development; and\n\n(v) to enhance the capability of the mother to look after the normal health and nutritional needs of\nthe child through proper nutrition and health education.\n\nPackage of Services The ICDS Scheme offers a package of six services, viz.,\n(i) supplementary nutrition\n\n(ii) pre-school non-formal education\n\n(iii) nutrition & health education\n\n(iv) immunisation\n\n(v) health check-up\n\n(vi) referral services\n\nThe last three services are related to health and are provided by Ministry/Department of Health\nand Family Welfare through NRHM & Health system.\n\nThe perception of providing a package of services is based primarily on the consideration that the\noverall impact will be much larger if the different services develop in an integrated manner as the\nefficacy of a particular service depends upon the support it receives from the related services.\n\nFor better governance in the delivery of the scheme, convergence is, therefore, one of the key\nfeatures of the ICDS scheme. This convergence is in-built in the scheme which provides a platform in\nthe form of Anganwadi Centres for providing all services under the Scheme.\n\nRestructuring of ICDS _In order to address various programmatic, management and institutional\n\n\ngaps and to meet administrative and operational challenges, the Government has approved the\nStrengthening and Restructuring of ICDS Scheme with an allocation of ¢ 1,23,580 crore during the\nTwelfth Five Year Plan. The administrative approval in this regard has been issued to the States/UTs\nin October 2012. The key features of Strengthened and Restructured ICDS, inter-alia, include\naddressing the gaps and challenges with:\n\nA.

However, in the\n\n\nevent the State fails to transfer the funds within 15 days, it will be liable to pay interest on the\namount on the pattern of releases for the Finance Commission funds.\n\n(vi) Nutrition Counsellor cum Additional Worker in 200 high-burden districts and link workers in\nother districts will be on demand by State Government approved through Annual Programme\nImplementation Plans (APIPs) by Empowered Programme Committee (EPC). Incentives\nproposed for link workers including Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) workers\nunder National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) will be linked to outcomes.\n\n(vii) For those States not covered in the implementation plan during initial two years, two technical\npersons would be provided, until the State Mission Directorates are set up and functional.\n\n(viii) District Mission Unit would be set up as per the phasing plan of the ICDS Mission. Besides,\nDistrict ICDS Cells to continue to operate as per existing norms and District Cells to be set up\nin those districts where the Cell is not there.\n\n(ix) Constitution of a Mission Steering Group (NMSG) and Empowered Programme Committee\n(EPC) at national and state levels for effective planning, implementation, monitoring and\nsupervision of ICDS Mission.\n\n(x) Creation of a separate ICDS Mission Budget head to allow flexibility and integration within\nthe child development and nutrition sectors and for convergent action with wider determinants\nof maternal and child under-nutrition.\n\n(xi) The ICDS Mission targets would be to attain three main outcomes namely; (a) Prevent and\nreduce young child under-nutrition (underweight children 0-3 years) by 10 percentage point;\n(b) Enhance early development and learning outcomes in all children 0-6 years of age; and (c)\nImprove care and nutrition of girls and women and reduce anaemia prevalence in young\nchildren, girls and women by one-fifth. Annual Health Survey (AHS) and District Level\nHousehold Survey (DLHS) to be used as baseline for measuring the outcomes of ICDS\nmission.\n\n(xii) To strengthen training and capacity building with the Broad Framework as part of the EFC.\n\n(xiii) To revise the rent for AWC building up to ¢ 750, ¢ 3000 and ¢ 5000 per month per unit for\nRural/Tribal, Urban and Metropolitan cities respectively, revised norms for pre-school\neducation (PSE) kits for ¢ 3000 per AWC p.a and ¢ 1500 per mini-AWC p.a; revised cost\nnorms for two uniforms @ - 325 each per annum per worker subject to overall budgetary\nallocations and piloting of créche services in 5% of the AWCs.\n\nWheat Based Nutrition Programme (WBNP) Under the Wheat Based Nutrition Programme\n(WBNP), food grains viz., wheat, rice and other coarse grains are allocated at BPL rates to the\nstates/UTs through the Department of Food & Public Distribution (DoFPD), for preparation of\nsupplementary food in ICDS.\n\nThe Ministry is responsible for processing and approval of the proposals from the States/UTs for\nallocation of food grains in coordination with the DoFPD.\n\nAnganwadi Karyakartri Bima Yojana (AKBY) The ICDS Scheme envisages Anganwadi Workers\n(AWWs) and Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) as honorary workers who are paid a monthly honorarium.\nAKBY under the LIC’s Social Security Scheme is one of the welfare measures extended to the\ngrassroots functionaries of the ICDS Scheme.\n\nThe Government of India has introduced the Anganwadi Karyakatri Bima Yojana in the year 2004.\n\n\nThe premium under the scheme is ¢ 280 per annum per member out of which ¢ 100 is paid by LIC\nfrom Social Security Fund, , 100 by the Government of India and x 80 by the Anganwadi\nWorker/Helper (insured member).\n\nICDS Systems Strengthening and Nutrition Improvement Project In the year 2013, the Ministry of\nWomen and Child Development launched a specific project called “ICDS Systems Strengthening and\nNutrition Improvement Project (ISSNIP)” (formerly called ICDS-IV Project). The project is assisted\nby the International Development Association (IDA) of the World Bank.\n\nThe ISSNIP has been designed to supplement and provide value addition on the existing ICDS\nprogramme, through a process of systems strengthening at different levels of programme\nimplementation. It also facilitates the select states/districts to experiment, innovate and conduct pilots\nof potentially more effective approaches to achieve the early childhood education and nutrition\noutcomes and offer evidences for scale up. The additional financial and technical support through the\nproject is catalytic and is an important dimension of MWCD’s overall efforts to strengthen and\nrestructure the ICDS programme. The project, inter-alia, supports building capacities of district and\nblock level ICDS functionaries for development of District ICDS Action Plans and result-oriented\nmonitoring and evaluation system. The project has four major components, viz.,\n\n(a) Institutional and systems strengthening in ICDS;\n\n(b) Community mobilisation and behaviour change communication;\n\n(c) Piloting multi-sectoral nutrition actions; and\n\n(d) Project Management, Technical Assistance and Monitoring & Evaluation.\n\nThe project is implemented in identified 162 districts having higher proportion of child under-\nnutrition across eight States, viz. Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra,\nRajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh. Besides, urban pilots are undertaken in and around\nNCR of Delhi and convergent nutrition action pilots in some selected districts in two non-project\nStates, viz., Odisha and Uttarakhand.\n\n2. Integrated Child Protection Scheme (ICPS)\n\nThe Ministry of Women & Child Devepment introduced, in 2009-10, a comprehensive scheme,\nnamely, the Integrated Child Protection Scheme (ICPS) under which financial and technical support is\nprovided to the State Governments/UT Administrations. ICPS brings several existing child protection\nprogrammes, under one umbrella, with improved norms. These include: (i) A Programme for Juvenile\nJustice; (ii) An Integrated Programme for Street Children; and (iii) Scheme for Assistance to Homes\n[Shishu Greh] to promote In-country Adoption.

Schemes of Economic Empowerment\n\n1. Scheduled Castes Sub-Plan (SCSP) The Special Component Plan for Scheduled Castes\nevolved in 1979 has been renamed as Scheduled Castes Sub-Plan (SCSP). The strategy of Scheduled\nCastes Sub-Plan (SCSP) is one of the most important interventions through the planning process for\nsocial, economic and educational development of Scheduled Castes and also for improvement in their\nworking and living conditions.\n\nThe Scheduled Castes Sub-Plan (SCSP) is not a scheme by itself. It is an umbrella strategy to\nensure flow of targeted financial and physical benefits from all the general sectors of development for\nthe benefit of Scheduled Castes. Under this strategy, States/UTs and Central Ministries are required\nto formulate and implement Scheduled Castes Sub-Plan (SCSP) as part of their Annual Plans by\nearmarking resources in proportion to their share in total population.\n\nAt present, 27 States/UTs having siseable SC populations are implementing Scheduled Castes Sub-\nPlan. The Ministry regularly impresses upon the States to ensure adequate allocations under\nScheduled Castes Sub-Plan during interactions with them. As an incentive, 25% Special Central\nAssistance is released to States/UTs on the basis of percentage allocation made by them under\nScheduled Castes Sub-Plan as compared to share of Scheduled Castes population in the total\npopulation.\n\n2. Special Central Assistance (SCA) to Scheduled Castes Sub-Plan (SCSP) The Special Central\nAssistance (SCA) to Scheduled Castes Sub Plan (SCSP) is a central sector scheme, started in 1980,\nunder which 100% grant is given to the States/UTs, as an additive to their Scheduled Castes Sub Plan\n(SCSP). The main objective is to give a thrust to family-oriented schemes of economic development\nof SCs below the poverty line. The Central assistance under the scheme is released to States/UTs on\nthe basis of the following criteria:\n\nCriteria for Release of Funds to States/UTs Under SCA to SCSP\n\nSLNo. Basis Percentage\n(i) SC Population of the States/UTs 40%\n(ii) Relative backwardness of the States/UTs 10%\n(iii) Percentage of SC families in the States/UTs covered by composite economic 25%\ndevelopment programmes in the State Plan to enable them to cross the\npoverty line\n(iv) Percentage of SCSP to the Annual Plan as compared to SC population 25%\npercentage of the States/UTs\n\nThe salient features of the scheme are mentioned below:\n(i) Funds under the scheme are provided as an additive to States/UTs implementing SCSP.\n(ii) Main thrust is on economic development of SC population in order to bring them above\n\n\npoverty line through self employment or training.\n\n(iii) Amount of subsidy admissible under the scheme is 50% of the project cost, subject to a\nmaximum of ¢ 10,000 per beneficiary.\n\n(iv) Upto 10% of the total release to State/UT can be utilised for infrastructure development in\nvillages having 50% or more SC population.\n(v) At least 15% of the SCA to be utilised by States/UTs for SC women.\n\n(vi) Five per cent of the total SCA released to the States/UTs will be utilised by them exclusively\nfor the economic development of disabled persons among SCs.\n\n(vii) Three per cent of the total SCA released to the States/UTs shall be utilised by States for\nsupervision, monitoring and evaluation of economic development schemes implemented with\nthe support of SCA funds.\n\n(viii) Two per cent of the total budget allocation for the scheme will be earmarked for North\nEastern States which implement SCSP for SCs.\n\n(ix) At least 10% of the funds of SCA to SCSP should be utilised for skill development\nprogrammes within existing framework of the Scheme in order to enhance the employability of\nthe target group.\n\n3. Assistance to State Schedule Castes Development Corporations The Centrally Sponsored\nScheme for participating in the equity share of the Schedule Castes Development Corporations\n(SCDCs) in the ratio of 49:51 (Central:State) was introduced in 1979. At present, SCDCs are\nfunctioning in 27 States/UTs. The main functions of SCDCs include identification of eligible SC\nfamilies and motivating them to undertake economic development scheme, sponsoring the schemes to\nfinancial institutions for credit support, providing financial assistance in the form of margin money at\nlow rate of interest and subsidy in order to reduce the repayment liability and providing necessary tie\nup with other poverty alleviation programmes. The SCDCs are playing an important role in providing\ncredit and inputs by way of margin money loans and subsidy to the target group.\n\nThe SCDCs finance employment oriented schemes covering (i) Agriculture and allied activities\nincluding minor irrigation, (ii) Small Scale Industry, (iii) Transport, and (iv) Trade and Service\nSector.

National Safai Karamcharis Finance & Development Corporation The National Safai\nKaramcharis Finance and Development Corporation (NSKFDC) was incorporated in the year 1997\n\n\nas a company not for profit. The target group of the Corporation are “Scavengers”, which means\npersons wholly or partially employed for manual handling of human excreta and their dependents, and\n“Safai Karamcharis” which means persons engaged in or employed for any sanitation work, and their\ndependents.\n\nNo income limit is fixed for availing financial assistance. However, the Corporation accords\npriority to the economic development and rehabilitation of scavengers, women and Persons with\nDisabilities (PwDs) from among the target group. The NSKFDC provides loan at the concessional\nrate of interest to the beneficiaries through the State Channelising Agencies (SCAs) appointed by the\nrespective State Governments/Union Territories across the country.\n\nInitially, the Authorised Share Capital of the Corporation was 200 crores which was enhanced to\nz 300 crores in 2009 and to z 600 crores in 2012. The paid up capital of the Corporation in 2013\nwas ¢ 394.99 crore. During 2012-13, ¢ 50 crore has been released as Equity Share Capital to the\nCorporation.\n\nThe Corporation implements schemes to promote self employment in an alternative occupation\nthrough concessional finance, and skill development. Since its inception, the Corporation has\ndisbursed ¢ 829.81 crore covering 248,019 beneficiaries.\n\nC. Schemes of Social Empowerment\n\n1. Assistance for Implementation of the Protection of Civil Rights Act and the SCs and STs\n(Prevention of Atrocities) Act: These two Acts are implemented by the respective state\nGovernments and Union Territory Administrations. With a view to ensure their effective\nimplementation by the states, Central assistance is provided to them under the Centrally Sponsored\nScheme for implementation of the Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955 and the Scheduled Castes and\nthe Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, for following purposes:-\n(i) Functioning and strengthening of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Protection Cell\nand Special Police Stations.\n(ii) Setting up and functioning of exclusive Special Courts.\n(iii) Relief and Rehabilitation to atrocity victims.\n(iv) Incentive for Inter-Caste Marriages, where one of the spouses is a member of Scheduled\nCaste\n(v) Awareness generation.\nThe funding pattern of the scheme is such that over and above the committed liability of respective\nState Governments, the expenditure is shared between Centre and States on 50:50 basis and UT\nAdministrations receive 100% Central assistance.\n\n2. Pilot Scheme of Pradhan Mantri Adrash Gram Yojana (PMAGY) __ The pilot PMAGY scheme\nhas been launched in 2010. The scheme aims at integrated development of the selected 1000 villages\nhaving more than 50% SC population, into “model villages” so that, inter alia,\n(i) they have requisite physical and social infrastructure for their socio-economic development;\n(ii) disparity between SC and non-SC population of the village in terms of common\nsocioeconomic indicators (e.g., literacy rate, completion rate of elementary education,\nIMR/MMR, ownership of productive assets, etc.) is eliminated, and the indicators are raised\nto at least the level of the national average; and\n\n\n(iii) untouchability, discrimination, segregation, and atrocities against SCs are eliminated, as are\nother social evils like discrimination against girls/women, alcoholism and substance (drugs)\nabuse, etc., and all sections of society are able to live with dignity and equality, and in\nharmony with others.\n\n3. Scheme of Grants-in-aid to Voluntary Organisations Working for Scheduled Castes The main\nobjective behind the scheme is to involve the voluntary sector to improve educational and socio-\neconomic conditions of the target group i.e. Scheduled Castes with a view to upgrade skill to enable\nthem to start income generating activities on their own or get gainfully employed in some sector or the\nother. The principle that good voluntary organisations should not only be assisted but also\nconsciously built up, has been guiding spirit behind the formulation of the scheme. The following\nfacts can be noted:\n(i) The scheme was started in 1953-54.\n(ii) The scheme was last revised in 1998.\n(iii) Projects covered under the scheme are 40.\n\nThe scheme provides that quantum of assistance shall be determined in each case on merit.\nHowever, Government of India may meet 90% of the approved expenditure. The remaining\nexpenditure is to be met by the concerned voluntary organisation from its own source.\n\n4. Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers A National Scheme of\nLiberation and Rehabilitation of Scavengers and their Dependents (NSLRS) was started in 1992 to\nrehabilitate manual scavengers and their dependents in alternative occupations. As per reports\nreceived from State Governments from time to time, there were about 7.70 lakh manual scavengers\nand their dependents, to be rehabilitated under NSLRS. Out of this, about 4.23 lakh beneficiaries\nwere assisted for rehabilitation, during the period of implementation of NSLRS.\n\nThis Ministry formulated a ‘Self Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers’\n(SRMS) which was introduced in January 2007 with the objective of rehabilitating remaining manual\nscavengers and their dependents by March, 2009. Under the scheme, the identified beneficiaries were\nprovided loan, at subsidised rate of interest, and credit linked capital subsidy for setting up self\nemployment projects. It also had liberal provisions for training of beneficiaries in marketable skills\nto enhance their employability. They were paid a stipend of , 1000 per month during the period of\ntraining.\n\nThe Self Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers originally envisaged\nrehabilitation of all manual scavengers in alternative occupations by March 2009. However, as this\ncould not be done by the target date, the scheme was extended upto March 2010, with a provision for\nthe coverage of spill-over beneficiaries even thereafter, if required. As per the updated number\nreported by States/UTs after launch of the scheme, about 1.18 lakh manual scavengers and their\ndependents in 18 States/UTs were identified for implementation of the scheme.\n\nThere was a proposal to revise the existing SRMS to make it more effective. Hence, the Scheme\nhas been revised w.e.f. November, 2013. As per the revised scheme, identified manual scavengers,\none from each family, are provided one-time cash assistance. The identified manual scavengers and\ntheir dependents are provided project based back-ended capital subsidy upto ¢ 3,25,000 and\nconcessional loan for undertaking self-employment ventures. Beneficiaries are also provided training\nfor skill development for a period upto two years, during which a stipend of ¢ 3,000 per month is\nalso provided.\n\n\nReservation in Education & Employment\n\nReservation in Education The Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Act,\n2006 came into force with effect from academic session 2008-09. The Act provides for Reservation\nof 15% for the students belonging to the Scheduled Caste, 7.5% for Scheduled Tribes & 27% for\nOther Backward Classes (excluding creamy layer) in central educational institutions (other than those\nexempted under the Act).\n\nReservation in Employment Instructions were issued by Ministry of Home Affairs in 1947,\nproviding 12.5% reservation in direct recruitment made by open competition and 16.66% for other\nthan by open competition for Scheduled Castes. With the increase in the percentage of Scheduled\nCastes population, a need was felt to increase the reservation percentage. The 1961-Census showed\nthat the percentage of population of Scheduled Castes was 14.7%. Accordingly, in 1970, the\npercentage of reservation for Scheduled Castes in direct recruitment by open competition was\nincreased from 12.5% to 15%. The percentages of reservation in the case of direct recruitment\notherwise than by open competition was kept unchanged at 16.66%. The position regarding\npercentage of reservation for SCs/STs in public employment has remained unchanged since then. The\nreservation policy of the Government is mutatis-mutandis extended to Central Public Sector\nEnterprises (CPSEs)."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Scheme of Strengthening Education among ST girls in Low Literacy Districts This gender-\nspecific scheme was introduced in 1993-94 for ST girls in low literacy pockets. The scheme has been\nrevised in 2008-09.\n\nThe scheme aims to bridge the gap in literacy levels between the general female population and\ntribal women, through facilitating 100% enrolment of tribal girls in the identified districts or blocks,\nmore particularly in naxal affected areas and in areas inhabited by Particularly Vulnerable Tribal\nGroups (earlier known as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs), and reducing drop-outs at the elementary\nlevel by creating the required ambience for education.\n\nThe scheme lays emphasis on providing hostel facilities to enable the ST girls to attend regular\nschools and wherever schools are not available within five km distance, both schooling and hostel\nfacilities are provided. Improvement of the literacy rate of tribal girls is essential to enable them to\nparticipate effectively in and benefit from, socio-economic development.\n\nThe scheme covers the 54 identified districts as indicated in the revised scheme where the ST\npopulation is 25% or more, and ST female literacy rate below 35%, as per 2001 census. Any other\ntribal block in a district, other than aforesaid 54 identified districts, which has scheduled tribe\npopulation 25% or above, and tribal female literacy rate below 35% as per 2001 census, is also\ncovered.\n\n13. Eklavya Model Residential Schools (EMRS) With the objective of providing quality\neducation to the tribal students, it was decided during 1997-98 to utilise a part of the grant under\nArticle 275(1) of the Constitution of India for setting up of 100 Model Residential Schools from\nClass VI to Class XII. Till the end of Xth Plan 100 schools were sanctioned to 22 States, of which 92\nare reported to be functional.\n\nThe schools were required to be operated in each state through an autonomous society formed for\nthis purpose. In order to provide a uniform pattern of education in those schools and enable their\nstudents to compete effectively for higher education programmes (medical, technical etc.), these\nschools are mainly affiliated to State Boards. These schools have been named as Eklavya Model\nResidential Schools and envisaged on the lines of Navodaya Vidyalayas but with state-centered\nmanagement.\n\n\nB. Schemes of Economic Empowerment\n\n1. Tribal Sub-Plan The Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP) strategy was developed for the rapid socio-\neconomic development of tribal people and was adopted for the first time in the Fifth Five Year Plan.\nThe strategy adopted continues till this day and the salient features are given as follows.\n(i) Preparation of plan meant for the welfare and development of tribals within the ambit of a\nState or a UT plan is a part of the overall plan of a State or UT, and is therefore called a Sub-\nPlan.\n\n(ii) The funds provided under the Tribal Sub-Plan have to be at least equal in proportion to the ST\npopulation of each State or UT.\n\n(iii) Tribals and tribal areas of a State or a UT are given benefits under the TSP, in addition to\nwhat percolates from the overall Plan of a State/UT.\n\n(iv) The Sub-Plan should:\n\n(a) Identify the resources for TSP areas;\n(b) Prepare a broad policy framework for development; and,\n(c) Define a suitable administrative strategy for its implementation.\n\n(v) The TSP strategy has been in operation in 22 States and 2 UTs.\n\n(vi) TSP concept is not applicable to the tribal majority States of Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya,\nMizoram and Nagaland and in the UTs of Lakshadweep and Dadra & Nagar Haveli where\ntribals represent more than 60% of the population, since the Annual Plan in these States/UTs\nis itself a Tribal Plan.\n\nThe TSP strategy is expected to be followed in the Central Ministries/Departments also so that an\n\nadequate flow of funds in the Central Ministries/Departments is ensured.\n\nThe funds for tribal development under TSP are sourced from the following:\n\n(i) State Plans\n\n(ii) The Special area programmes of Special Central Assistance (SCA) to Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP)\nand Grant under Article 275 (1) of the Constitution and, funds under other Schemes of the\nMinistry;\n\n(iii) Sectoral programmes of Central Ministries/Departments; and\n\n(iv) Institutional Finance.\n\n2. Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Plan (SCA to TSP) This is a major programme\nadministered by the Ministry and under this grant is provided to the States Governments based on\nannual allocation made by the Planning Commission. This is treated as an additive to the State Plan,\nfor areas where State Plan provisions are not normally forthcoming to bring about economic\ndevelopment to tribals. The programme was launched during 1974 and till the end of the IX Five\nYear Plan, the SCA to TSP was meant for filling up critical gaps in the family-based income-\ngenerating activities of TSP.\n\nFrom the Tenth Five Year Plan period, the objective and scope of SCA to TSP, was expanded to\ncover employment-cum-income generation activities and infrastructure incidental thereto. Besides\nfamily-based activities, other activities run by the Self-Help Groups (SHGs)/Community are also to\nbe taken up. The ultimate objective of extending SCA to TSP is to boost the demand based income-\ngeneration programmes and thus raise the economic and social status of tribals.\n\n\nThe SCA is provided to the 22 Tribal Sub-Plan States and 2 Union Territories including the North\nEastern States of Assam, Manipur, Sikkim and Tripura and two Union territories. However, since\n2003-04 funds meant for UTs are being provided for in the budget of Ministry of Home Affairs and\nthe Ministry is not concerned in the administration of funds in the UTs.\n\nThe SCA is released for economic development in the following areas and for the following\npopulation:\n\n(i) Integrated Tribal Development Project/Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDP/ITDA)\nareas (192 Nos.), which are generally contiguous areas of the size of at least tehsil or block or\nmore in which the ST population is 50% or more of the total population;\n\n(ii) Modified Area Development Approach (MADA) pockets (259 Nos.), which are identified\n\npockets having 50% or more ST population with a minimum population of 10,000;\n(iii) Clusters (82 Nos.), which are identified pockets having 50% ST population with a minimum\npopulation of 5,000;\n\n(iv) Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PTGs) (72 Nos.), characterised by a low rate of\n\ngrowth of population, pre-agricultural level of technology and extremely low level of literacy;\n\n(v) Dispersed tribal population — those tribals who fall outside the categories (i) to (iv) above.\n\n3. Programme for Development of Forest Villages Prior to Independence, habitations were set up\nin forest areas for secured availability of labour force for various forestry operations. Over the years,\nthese habitations grew into villages. These villages are outside the revenue administration of the\ndistricts and have, therefore, missed the fruits of development. A process of conversion of these\nforest villages into revenue villages is underway. However, there are about 2,474 such identified\nforest villages in 12 States, which are managed by State Forest Departments. Most of the inhabitants\nin these villages are tribals. The level of development in these villages is not at par with rest of the\nareas in the State.\n\nDevelopment of forest villages estimated to be having about 2.5 lakh tribal families was one of the\nthrust areas of tribal development during the Tenth Five Year Plan. Accordingly, Planning\nCommission allocated , 450 crore to the Ministry of Tribal Affairs in the Tenth Five Year Plan for\nDevelopment of Forest Villages with an average allocation of z 15 lakh per village. The Ministry of\nTribal Affairs initiated the programme for Development of Forest Villages as an extension of the\nSpecial Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Plan (SCA to TSP).\n\nTowards the end of Tenth Plan, a considered view was taken that the programme may be continued\nfor a limited period during the XI Plan also, keeping in view the need for adequate developmental\nactivities to be undertaken in these villages pending conversion into revenue villages. It was decided\nthat an additional funding upto , 15 lakh each would be provided to all those forest villages that have\navailed the first phase funding during the X Plan.\n\n4. Grants under Article 275(1) of the Constitution of India In pursuance of the Constitutional\nobligation, the Ministry of Tribal Affairs provides Funds to State Government having Scheduled\nTribe population through the Special Area programme ‘Grants under Article 275(1) of the\nConstitution’.\n\nUnder this Special Area Programme, 100 percent grant is provided by the Ministry to meet the cost\nof such project for tribal development, undertaken by a State Government, for (a) raising the level of\nadministration of Scheduled Areas to bring them at par with the rest of the state, and (b) for welfare\nof the tribal people. The grants are provided to the states on the basis of the percentage of ST\n\n\npopulation in the State.\n\nIn this regard, the following guidelines have been laid down:\n\n(i) Prior to 2000-01, Grants under Article 275(1) of the Constitution of India used to be released\nas block grants to states. Since then, the fund is provided for taking up specific projects for\ncreation and up gradation of critical infrastructure required to bring the tribal areas at par\nwith the rest of the State.\n\n(ii) The states are to identify the areas/sectors critical to enhancement of the Human Development\nIndex (HDI) and projects can be taken up for bridging gaps in critical infrastructure.\n\n(iii) People’s participation in planning and implementation of schemes and projects has been\nenvisaged in the guidelines. Due regard is to be given to the provisions of the States\nPanchayats Acts, and the PESA Act, 1996.\n\n(iv) Integrated and holistic approach for preparing micro plans for ITDP/MADA/Cluster through\nmulti-disciplinary teams is also envisaged.\n\n(v) At least 30% projects are to be targeted to benefit women.\n\n(vi) Two per cent of the grants may be used for project management, training, MIS, administrative\nexpenses, monitoring and evaluation.\n\n(vii) Up to 10% of the allocation to the state can be used with prior approval of the Ministry for the\nmaintenance of infrastructure.\n\n(viii) Ten per cent of the total allocation of funds out of grants under Article 275 (1) of the\nConstitution is allocated as innovative grant.\n\n5. National Scheduled Tribes Finance and Development Corporation The National Scheduled\nTribes Finance and Development Corporation (NSTFDC) was incorporated in 2001 as a Government\nof India company under Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA) and was granted license under the\nCompanies Act, 1956 (a company not for profit). It is managed by the Board of Directors with\nrepresentation from Central Government, State Channelising Agencies, National Bank for Agriculture\nand Rural Development (NABARD), Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), Tribal Co-\noperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd. (TRIFED) and eminent persons from the Scheduled\nTribes.\nThe NSTFDC is an apex organisation under MoTA for providing financial assistance for the\neconomic development of the Scheduled Tribes. The broad objectives of NSTFDC are:\n(i) To identify economic activities of importance to the Scheduled Tribes so as to generate self-\nemployment and raise their income level.\n\n(ii) To upgrade their skills and processes through both institutional and on the job training.\n\n(iii) To make existing State/UT Scheduled Tribes Finance and Development Corporations (SCAs)\nand other developmental agencies engaged in economic development of the Scheduled Tribes\nmore effective.\n\n(iv) To assist SCAs in project formulation, implementation of NSTFDC assisted schemes and in\nimparting training to their personnel.\n\n(v) To monitor implementation of NSTFDC assisted schemes in order to assess their impact.\nThe functions of NSTFDC are as follows:\n(i) To generate awareness amongst the STs about NSTFDC concessional schemes.\n(ii) To provide assistance for skill development and capacity building of the beneficiaries as well\n\n\nas of the officials of SCAs.\n\n(iii) To provide concessional finance for viable income generating schemes through SCAs and\nother agencies for economic development of the eligible Scheduled Tribes.\n\n(iv) To assist in market linkage of tribal produce.\n\n6. Tribal Co-operative Marketing Development Federation of India Ltd. The Tribal\nCooperative Marketing Development Federation of India Limited (TRIFED) is a Multi-State\nCooperative Society. It was set up in 1987 under the Multi-State Cooperative Societies Act, 1984\n(now the Multi-State Cooperative Societies Act, 2002)\n\nThe TRIFED is now functioning both as a service provider and market developer for tribal\nproducts. Further in the role as a capacity builder, it imparts training to ST Artisans and Minor Forest\nProduce (MFP) gatherers.\n\nThis Ministry extends Grants-in-Aid to TRIFED under the Scheme “Market Development of Tribal\nProduct” for undertaking the following four main activities:\n\n(i) Marketing Development Activities;\n(ii) Tribal MFP Gatherers’ Training & Capacity Building;\n\n(iii) Tribal Artisans Training & Capacity Building; and\n\n(iv) Research & Development.\n\n7. Grants-in-Aid for Minor Forest Produce (MFP) Operations In order to help tribals, the State\nGovernments have established State-level Government Organisations like State Tribal Development\nCooperative Corporations (STDCCs), Forest Development Corporations (FDCs), etc. with the\nmandate to purchase MFP from tribals paying them remunerative prices for their MFP.\n\nThe Central Sector Scheme of Grants-in-Aid for MFP Operations was launched in 1992-93 to help\nthese State-level Organisations. Grants-in-Aid are extended to these Organisations under this Scheme\nthrough their respective State Governments for: -\n\n(i) increasing the quantum of MFP handled by setting off operational losses, if need be;\n(ii) strengthening the share capital base of the corporation for undertaking MFP operations thereby\nincreasing the quantum of MFP presently handled;\n\n(iii) setting up of scientific warehousing facilities, wherever necessary;\n\n(iv) establishing processing industries for value addition with the objective of ensuring maximum\n\nreturns on the MFPs for the tribals;\n(v) giving consumption loans to the tribals; and\n(vi) supplementing Research & Development (R&D) activities/efforts.\n\nC. Schemes of Social Empowerment\n\n1. Scheme of Grants-in-aid to Voluntary Organisations working for the welfare of Scheduled\nTribes The ‘Grants-in-aid to Voluntary Organisations working for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes’\nscheme was launched in 1953-54 and is continuing. The prime objective of the scheme is to enhance\nthe reach of welfare schemes of Government and fill the gaps in service deficient tribal areas, in the\nsectors such as education, health, drinking water, agro-horticultural productivity, social security net\netc. through the efforts of voluntary organisations, and to provide an environment for socio-economic\n\n\nupliftment and overall development of the Scheduled Tribes (STs). Any other innovative activity\nhaving direct impact on the socio-economic development or livelihood generation of STs may also be\nconsidered through voluntary efforts.\n\nThe scheme is a Central Sector Scheme. The grants are provided to the eligible non-governmental\norganisations/autonomous societies for the categories of projects prescribed in the scheme. Funds are\ngenerally provided to the extent of 90% by the Government. The voluntary organisation is expected to\nbear the remaining 10% as contribution from its own resources. However, the extent of assistance\nunder the scheme is 100% for those projects being implemented in the Scheduled Areas.\n\nMany categories of projects have been prescribed under the scheme which may be considered for\ngrant. The list of categories is as below:\n\n(i) Residential schools\n(ii) Non-residential schools\n(iii) Hostels\n(iv) Mobile dispensaries\n(v) Ten-bedded hospitals\n\n(vi) Computer training centre\n\n(vii) Library\n\n(viii) Mobile library cum AV unit\n\n(ix) Rural night school for tribal adult education\n\n(x) Balwadi/Creche centre\n\n(xi) Preventing health and sanitation programme\n\n(xii) Drinking water programme\n\n(xiii) Training in agriculture and allied activities\n\n(xiv) Sponsoring of 15 tribal girls of NE States, A & N Islands and Lakshadweep\n\n(xv) Training centres for employable skills\n\n(xvi) Old age homes\n\n(xvii) Involving school children in spreading awareness\n(xviii) Any other innovative project for socio-economic development\n\n2. Scheme for Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups _In 1998-99, a separate\n100% Central Sector Scheme for exclusive socio-economic development of PTGs was started. Based\non the knowledge and experience gathered meanwhile, the scheme was revised in 2008-09, to make it\nmore effective.\n\nThe scheme covers only the 75 identified Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups among Scheduled\nTribes. The scheme is very flexible and it enables every State to focus on any area that they consider\nis relevant to their PTGs and their socio-cultural environment. Activities under it may include\nhousing, land distribution, land development, agricultural development, cattle development,\nconstruction of link roads, installation of non-conventional sources of energy for lighting purpose,\nsocial security including Janshree Beema Yojana or any other innovative activity meant for the\ncomprehensive socio-economic development of PTGs.\n\nThe funds under this scheme are made available for those items/activities which are very crucial\nfor the survival, protection and development of PTGs and are not specifically catered to by any other\n\n\nscheme of State or Central Government.\n\nThe scheme is implemented by the State/UT through various agencies of the State Government/UT\nAdministration like Integrated Tribal Development Projects (ITDPs)/Integrated Tribal Development\nAgencies (ITDAs), Tribal Research Institutes (TRIs), and also Non-Governmental Organisations\n(NGOs).\n\n3. Grants-in-aid to Tribal Research Institutes Under the scheme, so far 18 Tribal Research\nInstitutes (TRIs) have been set up in the States of Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand,\nGujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Orissa, Rajasthan,\nTamil Nadu, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Manipur, Tripura and Union Territory of Andaman &\nNicobar Islands.\n\nThe Ministry of Tribal Affairs releases 50% Central share to the State Governments and 100% to\nUnion Territories for the Tribal Research Institutes, for meeting the expenses, including\nadministrative costs. These institutes are engaged in the work of providing planning inputs to the State\nGovernments, conducting research and evaluation studies, collection of data, conducting training,\nseminars and workshops, documentation of customary laws; setting up of tribal museum for exhibiting\ntribal artifacts, and other related activities.\n\nAs part of the research activities of the Tribal Research Institutes (TRIs), the Ministry also\nsupports construction of tribal museums within the premises of the TRIs to preserve the tribal art,\ncraft and material culture.\n\nIn order to effectively coordinate all the functions presently being carried out in Tribal Research\nInstitutes (TRIs) throughout the country, as well as for new activities, the Ministry of Tribal Affairs\nhas evolved the concept of Nodal TRI (NTRI). The NTRI is to provide policy inputs to the Ministry\nof Tribal Affairs, carry out and coordinate research and evaluation studies, and undertake other\nrelated activities for the TRIs which are clubbed under their charge.\n\n4. Supporting Projects of All-India or Inter-State Nature This scheme is in operation since\n1979-80 for dissemination of knowledge about tribal issues, and developmental schemes/works\nthrough study, seminars/workshops and publication of tribal literature.

Identification of Minority Concentration Districts (MCDs) In 1987, a list of 41 minority\nconcentration districts was drawn up based ona single criterion of minority population of 20 percent\nor more in a district as per 1971 Census for enabling focused attention of government programmes\nand schemes on these districts.\n\n\nIn order to ensure that the benefits of schemes and programmes of government reach the relatively\ndisadvantaged segments of society, it was decided to identify districts on the basis of minority\npopulation of Census 2001 and backwardness parameters. A fresh exercise was, therefore, carried\nout based on population figures and the following backwardness parameters of 2001 Census:\n\nReligion-specific socio-economic indicators at the district level:\n\n(i) literacy rate;\n(ii) female literacy rate;\n(iii) work participation rate; and\n(iv) female work participation rate.\nBasic amenities indicators at the district level:\n(i) percentage of households with pucca walls;\n(ii) percentage of households with safe drinking water;\n\n(iii) percentage of households with electricity; and\n\n(iv) percentage of households with water closet latrines.\n\nThe process of identification of minority concentration districts has been carried out as follows:-\n\n(i) (a) Districts with a ‘substantial minority population’ of at least 25% of the total population\n\nwere identified in 29 States/UTs.\n(b) Districts having a large absolute minority population exceeding 5 lakh and the percentage\nof minority population exceeding 20% but less than 25% were identified in 29 States/UTs.\n(c) In the six States/UTs, where a minority community is in majority, districts having 15% of\nminority population, other than that of the minority community in a majority in that\nState/UT were identified.\n\n(ii) Thereafter, the position of these districts in terms of “backwardness” was evaluated against the\ntwo sets of socio-economic and basic amenities indicators. 90 Minority Concentration Districts\n(MCDs) having a substantial minority population, which are relatively backward and falling\nbehind the national average in terms of socio-economic and basic amenities indicators, have\nbeen identified in 2007 based on population data and the backwardness parameters of 2001\nCensus.\n\nThe Government while approving the identification of 90 MCDs directed for implementation of a\nspecial area development programme. To sharpen the focus on minority concentration areas and to\nextend the benefit to other deserving areas, the Ministry is proposing to identify the blocks and towns\nhaving substantial minority population during 12th Five Year Plan.\n\n2. Scheme of Multi-Sectoral Development Programme The Multi-Sectoral Development\nProgramme (MsDP) was launched in 2008-09. The programme aims at improving the socio-economic\nand basic amenity facilities for improving the quality of life of the people and reducing imbalances in\nthe Minority Concentration Districts (MCDs).\n\nThe identified ‘development deficits’ are addressed through a district specific plan for provision\nof better infrastructure for school and secondary education, sanitation, pucca housing, drinking water\nand electricity supply, besides beneficiary oriented schemes for creating income generating activities.\n\nThe absolutely critical infrastructure linkages like connecting roads, basic health infrastructure,\nICDS centers, skill development and marketing facilities required for improving living conditions and\nincome generating activities and catalysing the growth process are eligible for inclusion in the plan.\n\n\nThe focus of this programme is on rural and semi-rural areas of the identified 90 minority\nconcentration districts.\n\nThe programme is implemented by the Department in the State/UT dealing with minority\naffairs/welfare. Panchayati Raj Institutions/urban local bodies are involved in the implementation of\nthe MsDP wherever the mechanism is established. The State may, however, decide to execute the\nproject through any qualified, reputed, experienced agency, including renowned and widely accepted\nNGOs.\n\nAs far as possible, the focus of the programme is on providing appropriate social and economic\ninfrastructure rather than targeting individual beneficiaries. In case schemes for individual benefits\nare taken up under the programme, there will be no divergence from existing norms for selection of\nbeneficiaries from the list of BPL families in the district, so that benefits from the additional funds\nflow to all BPL families and not selectively to families of minority communities.\n\nFinancial assistance are sanctioned to the State Government/UT administration concerned on 100%\ngrant basis in two installments linked with the satisfactory progress made as per approved plan.\nFunds under the programme are released to the states/UTs only against the approved district\ndevelopment plans. Once the proposal is approved for support by the Ministry of Minority Affairs,\nthe first installment is released. State share wherever applicable is given by the State Government.\n\n3. Nai Roshni (Scheme for Leadership Development of Minority Women) The scheme of\nLeadership Development of Minority Women (Nai Roshni) is a new initiative of the Ministry in the\narea of gender empowerment.

Scheme for Computerisation of the Records of the State Waqf Boards The Waqf properties\nare spread out all over the country but effective survey of Waqf properties has not been carried out in\nmost states. There is scope for large scale development of Waqf properties to ensure substantial\nincome for the welfare schemes of the community.\n\nIn order to streamline record keeping of the Waqf lands, introduce transparency and social audit\nand to computerise the various functions/processes of the Waqf Boards and to develop a single web\nbased centralised application, the scheme for computerisation of the records of the State Waqf\nBoards with the help of Central financial assistance was launched in 2009.\n\nThe broad objectives of the scheme for computerisation of Management of Waqf properties are as\nfollows:-\n\n(a) Properties Registration Management.\n\n(b) Muttawalli Returns Management.\n\n(c) Leasing of Properties Management.\n\n(d) Litigations Tracking Management.\n\n(e) Documents Archiving & Retrieval Management.\n\n(f) GIS of Waqf Properties.\n\n\n(g) Funds Management to Mosques, Durgah, Kabristan, Imams, Muzzins, widows, girls\nmarriages, scholarships, schools, hospitals, dispensaries, musafirkhanas, skill development\ncentres etc.\n\n(h) Loans Management for development of Urban Wagf properties.\n\n6.

NMDFC provides concessional loans for self-employment and\nincome generating activities to persons of minority communities, having a family income below\ndouble the poverty line which at present is ¢ 55,000 per annum and ¢ 40,000 per annum in urban and\nrural areas respectively. NMDFC provides loans through (i) State Channelising Agencies (SCAs)\nnominated by the respective State/UT Governments and (ii) through Non-Governmental Organisations\n(NGOs). The following are the schemes run by NMDFC:\n(i) The scheme of Term Loan is implemented through SCAs, for individual beneficiaries,\nwherein projects costing up to ¢ 5 lakh are financed.\n(ii) Under the Educational Loan Scheme implemented through the SCAs, NMDFC provides\n2,50,000 to the eligible candidates belonging to minority communities.\n(iii) Under micro financing scheme, implemented through SCAs as well as NGOs, microcredit up\nto z 25,000 is being given to each of the members of the Minority Self Help Groups (SHGs).\n(iv) In addition, NMDFC is also implementing schemes of Vocational Training and Marketing\nAssistance through the SCAs for capacity building of the target groups for self employment as\nwell as wage employment.\n\n7. Grants-in-Aid Scheme to State Channelising Agencies The National Minorities Development\nand Finance Corporation implements its schemes through the State Channelising Agencies (SCAs).\nThese agencies are nominated by the respective state governments. The SCAs identify beneficiaries,\nchannelise the lending and make recoveries from the beneficiaries. However, most of the State\nChannelising Agencies have a very weak infrastructure leading to a weak delivery system.\nConsequently, the performance and the ambit of coverage of NMDFC may not improve unless the\ninfrastructure of these agencies is improved.\n\nThe Ministry launched a scheme of Grants-in-Aid for improving the infrastructure of the SCAs\nduring 2007-08. Under the scheme, assistance is provided on matching basis, the Central and the state\ngovt. contributing in the ratio of 90:10.\n\n8. National Waqf Development Corporation The Ministry has set up a new National Waqf\nDevelopment Corporation (NAWADCO) in January, 2014. This is an initiative to finance the\ndevelopment of Waqf properties for public purposes throughout the country.\n\nThe setting up of NAWADCO would facilitate and mobilise financial resources for provision of\namenities like schools, colleges, hospitals on Waqf properties for community purposes.\n\nIndia has the largest number of Waqf properties in the world. The Prime Minister’s High Level\nCommittee on the Social, Economic and Educational Status of Muslim Community of India (also\nknown as the Sachar Committee) in its report published in 2006 had mentioned that there are more\nthan 4.9 lakhs registered augqaf spread over the country but the current annual income from these\nproperties is only about z 163 crores.\n\nMany of these Augaf (Waqf Properties/Assets) are on prime urban land and they have the potential\n\nof generating considerable returns for fulfilling the objectives of the auqaf. The Sachar Committee\nhad estimated that such properties, if properly developed, with a minimum return of 10%, would have\npotential of generating an income of about ¢ 12000 crore per annum.\n\nThe Corporation has an authorised share capital of , 500 crore with initial paid up capital of -\n100 crore only. The contribution of National Minorities Development & Finance Corporation\n(NMDFC) in the authorised share capital of the corporation is 49%. The Central Waqf Council\n(CWC) and the individual Wagf Institutions and the Public have 9% and 42% shares respectively.\n\n9. Minority Cyber Gram The Ministry has launched a pilot project “Minority Cyber Gram” for\nDigital literacy of Monirities in collaboration with Digital Empowerment Foundation in PPP Mode at\nvillage Chandauli, District Alwar, Rajasthan, in February 2014. Total 2,600 villagers have been\ntargeted under this pilot project.\n\nThe MCGY programme seeks to introduce digital literacy skills in identified minority clusters in\nIndia through designated Digital Fellows towards knowledge empowerment and entitlement gains of\nminority focused groups and beneficiaries.\n\nWith basic literacy level low among the backward sections of the minorities, the social and\neconomic profile is further aggravated due to lack of basic digital skills and knowledge to derive\nadvantages from digital tools, devices, platforms and knowledge networks. In order to mainstream\nminority groups and communities with national development goals and objectives, it is extremely\nimportant and relevant to deploy and introduce digital literacy skills to get benefits in knowledge\nbased networks and in public schemes and other services through information empowerment.\n\nThe objectives of the scheme are as follows:\n\n(i) To impart digital literacy and skills among identified minority groups and beneficiaries\nthrough designated Digital Fellows (DFs) in identified minority clusters for information and\nknowledge empowerment and entitlement gains.\n\n(ii) To provide opportunities in information and knowledge networks for local communities.\n\n10. Jiyo Parsi (Scheme for Containing Population Decline of Parsis) The Ministry has launched\na unique scheme with the name “Jiyo Parsi” during 2013-14 for containing population decline of\nParsis in India. The scheme is being implemented with participation of Parzor Foundation, Bombay\nParsi Panchayat and local Anjumans.\n\nThe studies conducted by the National Commission for Minorities (NCM) and the joint studies\nconducted by Parzor Foundation and Tata Institute of Social Science (TISS), have identified the\nfollowing reasons as the important causes for decline in population of Parsis:\n\n(a) Late and non-marriages;\n\n(b) Fertility decline;\n\n(c) Emigration;\n\n(d) Out-Marriages; and\n\n(e) Separation and divorces\n\nThere has been a demand from the members of Parsi community for Government intervention to\narrest the declining trend. In view of this, the Government of India considered it necessary to\nintervene immediately to arrest the declining trend of population of Parsi community and reverse it to\nbring their population above the threshold level.\n\nThe objective of the scheme is to reverse the declining trend of Parsi population by adopting a\n\nscientific protocol and structured interventions, stabilise their population and increase the population\nof Parsis in India. The target groups within the Parsi community for the infertility treatment are as\nfollows:\n\n(i) Parsi married couples of child bearing age who seek assistance under the scheme.\n\n(ii) Adults/young men/women/adolescent boys/girls for detection of diseases resulting in\n\ninfertility.\n\n11. Seekho aur Kamao (Scheme for Skill Development of Minorities) The Ministry has launched\na new scheme “Seekho aur Kamao (Learn & Earn) for skill development of minorities during 2013-\n14. The scheme guarantees minimum 75% employment of trained minority youths and out of them\n50% would be in organised sector. The Ministry has sanctioned z 17 crore for skill development\ntraining of 20,164 minority youths in 29 states through 32 expert skill development organisations.\n\nThe objectives of the scheme are as follows:\n\n(i) To bring down unemployment rate of minorities during Twelfth Plan period.\n\n(ii) To conserve and update traditional skills of minorities and establish their linkages with\n\nmarket.\n\n(iii) To improve employability of existing workers, school dropouts etc. and ensure their\n\nplacement.\n\n(iv) To generate means of better livelihood for marginalised minorities and bring them in the\n\nmainstream.\n(v) To enable minorities to avail opportunities in the growing market.\n\n(vi) To develop potential human resource for the country.\n\nThe scheme aims at upgrading the skills of the minority youths in various modern/traditional\nvocations depending upon their educational qualification, present economic trends and the market\npotential, which can earn them a suitable employment or make them suitably skilled to go for self\nemployment.\n\nThe Ministry took up skill development programme for Modular Employable Skills (MES) which\nare approved by National Council of Vocational Training (NCVT). The MES courses approved by\nNCVT include majority of traditional skills being practiced by the minority communities e.g.\nEmbroidery, Chikankari, Zardosi, Patch work, Gem and Jewelry, Weaving, Wooden works, Leather\ngoods, Brass metal works, Glass wares, Carpet etc. Moreover, other courses approved by NCVT\nmay also be taken up in a particular state or region depending on the demand and local market\npotential. This would help, on one hand to conserve the traditional arts and crafts practiced by\nminorities and on the other hand empower the minority communities to face the market challenges and\navail opportunities."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

These are explained\nbelow:\n\n1. Awareness Generation Campaign About the Ill-Effects of\n\nAlcoholism and Substance Abuse\n\nThe Ministry recognizes drug abuse as a psychosocio-medical problem, which can be best handled by\nadoption of a family/community-based approach by active involvement of NGOs/Community Based\nOrganisations (CBOs). The strategy for demand reduction is three-pronged:\n\n(a) Awareness building and educating people about ill-effects of drug abuse.\n\n(b) Community based intervention for motivational counseling, identification, treatment and\nrehabilitation of drug addicts, and\n\n(c) Training of volunteers/service providers and other stakeholders with a view to build up a\ncommitted and skilled cadre.\n\nThe Ministry in collaboration with Nehru Yuva Kendra Sanghathan has conducted an awareness\ngeneration programme in the State of Punjab and Manipur covering 3000 villages of 10 districts in the\nState of Punjab and 750 villages of 7 districts in the State of Manipur. This programme was\ncompleted in November, 2012.

National Awards for Outstanding Services in the Field of\nPrevention of Alcoholism and Substance (Drug) Abuse\n\nSubstance abuse being a psycho-social-medical problem, community based intervention through Non-\nGovernmental Organisations (NGOs), Panchayat/Municipal bodies, Educational Institutions etc. has\nbeen considered as the best approach for treatment and rehabilitation of the addicts. In order to\nrecognise the efforts and encourage excellence in the field of prevention of substance abuse and\nrehabilitation of its victims, the Ministry started in 2013 the “Scheme of National Awards for\noutstanding services in the field of Prevention of Alcoholism and Substance (Drug) Abuse”. The\nScheme is applicable to institutions and individuals working in the field of Prevention of Drug and\n\nAlcoholism Abuse.\n\nThe following awards (generally one in each category) are presented, every year, on 26\" June,\nwhich has been declared by the United Nations, as the International Day against Drug Abuse and\nIllicit Trafficking:\n\n(i) Best Integrated Rehabilitation Centre for Addicts (IRCA) for providing rehabilitation\nservices to alcoholics and drug users.\n\n(ii) Best Regional Resource and Training Centre (RTC) providing exemplary contribution in the\n\nfield of prevention of addiction.\n\n(iii) Best Panchayati Raj or Municipal Body working for prevention of alcoholism and substance\n\n(drug) abuse\n\n(iv) Best Educational Institution doing outstanding work in awareness generation and prevention\n\nof alcoholism and substance (drug) abuse\n\n(v) Best Non-Profit Institution with outstanding contribution to Prevention of Alcoholism and\n\nSubstance (Drug) Abuse.\n\n(vi) Best Research or Innovation\n\n(vii) Best Awareness Campaign\n\n(viii) Outstanding individual achievement by a professional\n\n(ix) Outstanding individual achievement by a non-professional\n\n(x) Former addict, who has done outstanding work in the field of awareness generation or de-\naddiction or rehabilitation\n\n3.

The\nCommittee has representation of various stakeholders, which also include agencies dealing with\nsupply and demand reduction. The Committee advises the Government on issues connected with drug\ndemand reduction, education/awareness building, de-addiction and rehabilitation of drug-addicts.\nThe first meeting of the Committee was held in 2008. Two major recommendations which emerged in\nthe meeting were:\n(i) To bring about further necessary changes in the Scheme for Prevention of Alcoholism and\nSubstance (Drugs) Abuse and\n(ii) To formulate a national policy on Prevention of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse and\nrehabilitation of its victims.\n\nA sub-committee of the NCCDR was constituted in 2009 to take necessary steps in regard to both\nthe above recommendations. The sub-Committee submitted its recommendations in 2010 (i)\nsuggesting changes in the ongoing scheme on de-addiction and (ii) a draft for formulation of a policy\non drug demand reduction.\n\nThese recommendations on the changes to the scheme and the draft national policy were discussed\nin the second meeting of NCCDR. Further action on revising the Scheme for Prevention of\nAlcoholism and Substance (Drugs) Abuse and redrafting the national policy on Prevention of\n\n\nAlcoholism and Substance Abuse and rehabilitation of its victims is in progress.\n\n4. Assistance to Voluntary Organisations for Prevention of\nAlcoholism and Drug Abuse\n\nThe ‘Scheme of Assistance for the Prevention of Alcoholism & Substance (Drugs) Abuse and for\nSocial Defence Services’ is the flagship scheme of the Ministry in the field of drug demand reduction.\nThe Scheme has two parts viz. (i) ‘Assistance for the Prevention of Alcoholism & Substance (Drugs)\nAbuse’ (Part I) and (ii) ‘Financial Assistance in the Field of Social Defence’ (Part II).\n\nThe Scheme of Assistance for the Prevention of Alcoholism and Substance (Drugs) Abuse is being\nimplemented for identification, counseling, treatment and rehabilitation of addicts through voluntary\nand other eligible organisations. Under this scheme, financial assistance up to 90% of the approved\nexpenditure is given to the voluntary organisations and other eligible agencies for setting up/running\nIntegrated Rehabilitation Centre for Addicts (IRCAs), Regional Resource and Training Centres\n(RRTCs), for holding Awareness-cum-de-addiction camps (ACDC) and Workplace Prevention\nProgrammes etc. In the case of North-Eastern states, Sikkim and Jammu & Kashmir, the quantum of\nassistance is 95% of the total admissible expenditure. The balance has to be borne by the\nimplementing agency.\n\nThe important features of the scheme are mentioned as follows:\n\n(i) the honorarium rates for service providers of the Integrated Rehabilitation Centres for Addicts\n(IRCA) projects have been enhanced,\n\n(ii) provision for food for inmates who are below poverty line (BPL) has been introduced at the\nrate of z 900 per month per inmate,\n\n(iii) Panchayati Raj Institutions/Urban Local Bodies have been included under the\n\norganisations/institutions eligible for receiving assistance under the scheme, and\n\n(iv) the 15 and 30 bed IRCAs can be upgraded to 20 and 40 beds respectively, in the urban areas\n\nand the North-East.\n\n5. Financial Assistance in the Field of Social Defence\n\nThe Scheme of ‘General Grants-in-Aid Programme for Financial Assistance in the Field of Social\nDefence’ aims to:\n(i) Meet urgent needs falling within the mandate of the Ministry which cannot be met under the its\nregular schemes; and\n(ii) Support such initiatives of an innovative/pilot nature in the area of welfare and empowerment\nof the Ministry’s target groups, as cannot be supported under its regular schemes.\nFinancial assistance is given up to 90% of the approved expenditure to the voluntary and other\neligible organisations. In case of an organisation working in a relatively new area where both\nvoluntary and Government effort is very limited but the need for the service is very great the\nGovernment may bear up to 100% of the cost.\n\n6. National Centre for Drug Abuse Prevention (NCDAP)\n\n\nTraining is an important component for capacity building and skill development for the service\nproviders. It is important to have exposure to the new trends regarding the kind of drugs abused,\nmedical and psychiatric problems, new medicines/methodologies available for the treatment of\naddiction through participation in training programmes and conferences. Updating and training\nthrough refresher courses also needs to be provided to existing staff.\n\nA National Centre for Drug Abuse Prevention (NCDAP) was established in 1998, in the National\nInstitute of Social Defence (NISD) at New Delhi to serve as an apex body for training, research and\ndocumentation in the field of alcoholism and drug demand reduction.\n\n7. Regional Resource and Training Centres (RRTC)\n\nTen Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), with long years of experience and expertise in\ntreatment, rehabilitation, training and research have been designated as Regional Resource and\nTraining Centres (RRTCs) for different regions of the country.\n\nThese serve as field training units of National Centre for Drug Abuse Prevention (NCDAP) on\nvarious aspects of demand reduction. RRTCs provide the following services to the NGOs working in\nthe field of Drug Abuse Prevention:\n\n(i) Documentation of all activities of the NGOs including preparation of Information, Education\nand Communication (IEC) material.\n(ii) Undertaking Advocacy, Research and Monitoring of drug abuse programmes.\n(iii) Technical support to the NGOs, Community Based Organisations and Enterprises."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

However, their rights on their\nancestral lands and their habitats had not been adequately recognised despite them being integral to\nthe very survival and sustainability of the forest eco-system. The traditional rights and interests of\nforest dwelling scheduled tribes and other traditional forest dwellers on forest lands were left\nunrecognised and unrecorded through faulty reservation process during consolidation of State forests,\nin the past.\n\nThe forest dwelling tribal people and the forests are inseparable, a factor that also ensures\nconservation of ecological resources stemming from the very ethos of tribal life. The conservation\nprocesses for creating wilderness and forest areas for production forestry somehow ignored the\nbonafide interests of the tribal community from legislative framework in the regions where tribal\ncommunities primarily inhabited. The simplicity of tribals and their general ignorance of modern\nregulatory frameworks precluded them from asserting their genuine claims to resources in areas\nwhere they belonged and depended upon. The modern conservation approaches also advocated\nexclusion rather than integration. It was much later that forest management regimes initiated action to\nrecognise the occupation and other rights of the forest dwellers and integrated them in designs of\nmanagement. Insecurity of tenure and fear of eviction from the lands where they had lived and thrived\nfor generations were perhaps the biggest reasons why tribal communities felt emotionally as well as\nphysically alienated from forests and forest lands. This historical injustice needed correction and,\ntherefore, the government enacted the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers\n(Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, which is commonly known as Forest Rights Act (FRA).\n\nThe Act also goes beyond the “recognition” of forest rights and also empowers the forest rights\nholders, Gram Sabhas and local level institutions with the right to protect, regenerate, conserve and\nmanage any community forest resource. This marks a decisive step forward in resource governance\nitself. Hailed rightly as a milestone in the history of tribal peoples’ and forest dwellers’ movements,\nthe Act endeavors to facilitate their political empowerment to govern the forests for sustainable use\nand conservation.\n\nProvisions of the Act\n\nThe various provisions/features of the Forest Rights Act are as follows:\n1. The Act lists the rights which shall be the forest rights of the forest dwelling Scheduled Tribes\nand Other Traditional Forest Dwellers. These forest rights are :\n\n(a) right to hold and live in the forest land under the individual or common occupation for\nhabitation or for self-cultivation for livelihood by a member or members of a forest\ndwelling Scheduled Tribe or other traditional forest dweller;\n\n(b) community rights such as nistar, by whatever name called, including those used in erstwhile\n\n\nPrincely States, Zamindari or such intermediary regimes;\n\n(c) right of ownership, access to collect, use, and dispose of minor forest produce which has\nbeen traditionally collected within or outside village boundaries;\n\n(d) other community rights of uses or entitlements such as fish and other products of water\nbodies, grasing (both settled or transhumant) and traditional seasonal resource access of\nnomadic or pastoralist communities;\n\n(e) rights including community tenures of habitat and habitation for primitive tribal groups and\npre-agricultural communities;\n\n(f) rights in or over disputed lands under any nomenclature in any State where claims are\ndisputed;\n\n(g) rights for conversion of Pattas or leases or grants issued by any local authority or any state\ngovernment on forest lands to titles;\n\n(h) rights of settlement and conversion of all forest villages, old habitation, unsurveyed\nvillages and other villages in forests, whether recorded, notified or not into revenue\nvillages;\n\n(i) right to protect, regenerate or conserve or manage any community forest resource which\nthey have been traditionally protecting and conserving for sustainable use;\n\n(j) rights which are recognised under any State law or laws of any Autonomous District\nCouncil or Autonomous Regional Council or which are accepted as rights of tribals under\nany traditional or customary law of the concerned tribes of any State;\n\n(k) right of access to biodiversity and community right to intellectual property and traditional\nknowledge related to biodiversity and cultural diversity;\n\n(1) any other traditional right customarily enjoyed by the forest dwelling Scheduled Tribes or\nother traditional forest dwellers, which are not mentioned in (a) to (k) but excluding the\ntraditional right of hunting or trapping or extracting a part of the body of any species of\nwild animal;\n\n(m) right to in situ rehabilitation including alternative land in cases where the Scheduled Tribes\nand other Traditional forest dwellers have been illegally evicted or displaced form forest\nland of any description without receiving their legal entitlement to rehabilitation prior to 13\nDecember, 2005.\n\n2. The Act provides for diversion of forest land for certain facilities managed by the Government\nnotwithstanding anything contained in the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 and which involve\nfelling of trees not exceeding seventy five trees per hectare and the forest land to be diverted for\nthe purpose is less than one hectare and the clearance of such development project is\nrecommended by the Gram Sabha.\n\n3. The Act recognises and vests forest rights in forest dwelling Scheduled Tribes and Other\nTraditional Forest Dwellers notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time\nbeing in force.\n\n4. The Act provides for modification or resettlement of forest rights in critical wildlife habitats of\nNational Parks and Sanctuaries for the purpose of creating inviolate areas for wildlife\nconservation subject to fulfilment of the following conditions :\n\n(a) process of recognition of rights is complete in all the areas under consideration,\n\n\n(b) no other reasonable option exists,\n\n(c) it has been established that the activities or the impact of the present right holders will\ncause irreversible damage and threaten the existence of wildlife and their habitat,\n\n(d) free and informed consent of the concerned Gram Sabhas has been obtained,\n\n(e) resettlement or alternative package has been prepared and communicated that provides a\nsecure livelihood for the affected individuals and communities and fulfils the requirements\nof such affected families and communities given in the relevant laws and policy of the\nCentral Government, and\n\n(f) the resettlement should take place only after the facilities and land allocation at the\nresettlement location are complete.\n\nIt is also provided that critical wildlife habitats from which right holders are relocated shall not\n\nbe subsequently diverted for other users.\n\n. The Act subjects the recognition and vesting of the forest rights to the condition that the forest\n\ndwelling Scheduled Tribes or Other Traditional Forest Dwellers had occupied the forest land\n\nbefore 13 December, 2005. It also stipulates that the rights conferred shall be heritable but not\nalienable or transferable and shall be registered jointly in the name of both the spouses in case\nof married persons.\n\nA very important and crucial safeguard has been provided to the forest right holders. It mandates\n\nthat no forest dwelling Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers shall be evicted\n\nor removed from the forest land under his occupation till the recognition and verification\nprocedure is complete.\n\n. The right to hold and live in the forest land under the individual or common occupation for\nhabitation and for self-cultivation for livelihood by a member or members of a forest dwelling\nScheduled Tribes or Other Traditional Forest Dwellers shall be restricted to area under actual\noccupation and shall in no case exceed an area of four hectares. Further, the Act provides that\nforest rights shall be conferred free from all encumbrances and procedural requirements.\n\n. The forest rights recognised and vested under this Act includes the right of land to forest\ndwelling Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers who can establish that they\nwere displaced from their dwelling and cultivation without land compensation due to state\ndevelopment interventions and where the land has not been used for the purpose for which it was\nacquired within five years of the said acquisition.\n\n9. The Act empowers the holders of forest rights, the Gram Sabha and the village-level institutions\n\nto:\n\n(a) protect the wildlife, forest and bio-diversity;\n\n(b) ensure that adjoining catchment area, water sources and other ecological sensitive areas are\nadequately protected;\n\n(c) ensure that the habitat of forest dwelling Scheduled Tribes and other traditional forest\ndwellers is preserved from any form of destructive practices affecting their cultural and\nnatural heritage; and\n\n(d) ensure that the decisions taken in the Gram Sabha to regulate access to community forest\nresources and stop any activity which adversely affects the wild animals and the bio-\ndiversity are complied with.\n\nwn\n\ns\n\ns\n\noo\n\n\n10. The Act deals with the authorities and procedures to vest forest rights in forest dwelling\n\nScheduled Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers. There is a three-tier structure of\nauthorities to vest forest rights. The Gram Sabha is the initiating authority for determining the\nnature and extent of individual or community forest rights or both that may be given to the forest\ndwelling Scheduled Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers. The Sub-Divisional Level\nCommittee examines the resolution passed by the Gram Sabha and forwards it to the District\nLevel Committee for the final decision. Any person aggrieved by the resolution of the Gram\nSabha may prefer a petition to the Sub-Divisional Level Committee and any person aggrieved by\nthe decision of the Sub-Divisional Level Committee may prefer a petition to the District Level\nCommittee. The decision of the District Level Committee on the record of forest rights is final\nand binding.\nThere is a State Level Monitoring Committee to monitor the process of recognition and vesting\nof forest rights and to submit to the nodal agency such returns and reports as may be called by\nthat agency. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs, Government of India, is the nodal agency for the\nimplementation of this Act.\n\nImplementation of the Act\n\nAs on 31-12-2012, the total number of claims filed under FRA is 32,37,656 out of which 27,91,330\nclaims have been disposed of and 12,79,076 titles have been issued. Odisha has the distinction of\nissuing highest number of titles which is 3,01,200 (3,00,321 individual titles and 879 community\ntitles). Maharashtra has the distinction of having highest forest area over which titles have been\nissued under this Act. The total forest area over which title has been issued in Maharashtra is\n6,35,915.57 acres.

Translate the following text into Hindi accurately, preserving the original meaning and context."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Rationale of the Act\n\nDomestic violence is undoubtedly a human rights issue and serious deterrent to development. The\nVienna Accord of 1994 and the Beijing Declaration and the Platform for Action (1995) have\nacknowledged this. The United Nations Committee on Convention on Elimination of All Forms of\nDiscrimination Against Women (1989) has recommended that State parties should act to protect\nwomen against violence of any kind, especially that occurring within the family.\n\nThe phenomenon of domestic violence in India is widely prevalent but has remained largely\ninvisible in the public domain. Where a woman is subjected to cruelty by her husband or his\nrelatives, it is an offence under section 498A of the Indian Penal Code. The civil law does not\nhowever address this phenomenon in its entirely.\n\nTherefore, the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act , 2005 was enacted keeping in\nview the rights guaranteed under articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution of India. The Act is\nintended to provide a remedy under the civil law for the protection of women from being victims of\ndomestic violence and to prevent the occurrence of domestic violence in the society.\n\nThe Act is a comprehensive legislation to protect women from all forms of domestic violence. The\nAct also covers women who have been/are in a relationship with the abuser and are subject to\nviolence of any kind—physical, sexual, mental, verbal or emotional.\n\nThe Ministry of Women and Child Development has notified the Protection of Women from\nDomestic Violence Rules, 2006 laying down the rules for implementation of the Act. The copies of\nthe Act and the Rules have been circulated to all State Chief Secretaries with the request to appoint\nProtection Officers, register Service Providers and to give wide publicity to the Act for creating\nawareness of its provisions among the public.\n\nProvisions of the Act\n\nThe various provisions/ features of the Act are as follows:\n\n1.\n\nIt covers those women who are or have been in a relationship with the abuser where both\nparties have lived together in a shared household and are related by consanguinity, marriage,\na relationship in the nature of marriage, or adoption. In addition, relationships with family\nmembers living together as a joint family are also included. Even those women who are\nsisters, widows, mothers, single women, or living with the abuser are entitled to the\nprotection under the proposed legislation. However, whereas the Act enables the wife or the\nfemale living in a relationship in the nature of marriage to file a complaint against any relative\nof the husband or the male partner, it does not enable any female relative of the husband or the\nmale partner to file a complaint against the wife or the female partner.\n\nIt defines “domestic violence” to include actual abuse or the threat of abuse that is physical,\nsexual, verbal, emotional or economic.

It is expedient to make provisions for giving effect to the said\nconvention for protection of women against sexual harassment at workplace.\n\nThe sexual harassment at workplace is a violation of women’s right to gender equality, life and\nliberty. It creates an insecure and hostile work environment, which discourages women’s\nparticipation in work, thereby adversely affecting their economic empowerment and the goal of\ninclusive growth. However, there is no domestic law to address this issue except a few provisions of\nthe Indian Penal Code and the Supreme Court Guidelines in the case of Vishaka vs. State of\nRajasthan. The increasing work participation rate of women has made it imperative that a\ncomprehensive legislation focusing on prevention of sexual harassment as well as providing a\nredressal mechanism be enacted.\n\nProvisions of the Act\n\nThe various provisions/ features of the Act are as follows:\n\n1. It defines “sexual harassment at the workplace” in a comprehensive manner, in keeping with\nthe definition laid down in the Vishaka judgment, and broadening it further to cover\ncircumstances of implied or explicit promise or threat to a woman’s employment prospects or\ncreation of hostile work environment or humiliating treatment, which can affect her health or\nsafety.\n\n2. The definition of “aggrieved woman”, who will get protection under the Act is extremely\nwide to cover all women, irrespective of her age or employment status, whether in the\norganised or unorganised sectors, (public or private) and covers clients, customers and\ndomestic workers as well.\n\n3. While the “workplace” in the Vishaka guidelines is confined to the traditional office set-up\nwhere there is a clear employer-employee relationship, the Act goes much further to include\norganisations, departments, offices, branch units, etc., in the public and private sectors\n(organised and unorganised), hospitals, nursing homes, educational institutions, sports\ninstitutes, stadiums, sports complex and any place visited by the employee during the course\nof employment including the transportation.\n\n4. Definition of employee covers regular/temporary/ad hoc/daily wage employees, whether for\nremuneration or not and can also include volunteers. The definition of employer includes the\n\n\n10.\n\n11.\n\n12.\n\n13.\n\nhead of the Government department/organisation/institution/office/branch/unit, the person\nresponsible for management/supervisions/control of the workplace, the person discharging\ncontractual obligations with respect to his/her employees and in relation to a domestic worker\nthe person who benefits from that employment.\n\n. The redressal mechanism provided in the Act is in the form of Internal Complaints Committee\n\n(ICC) and Local Complaints Committee (LCC). All workplaces employing 10 or more than\n10 workers are mandated under the Act to constitute an ICC. The ICC will be a four-member\ncommittee under the Chairpersonship of a senior woman employee and will include two\nmembers from amongst the employees preferably committed to the cause of women or has\nexperience in social work/legal knowledge and includes a third party member (NGO, etc) as\nwell.\n\n. Complaints from workplaces employing less than 10 workers or when the complaint is against\n\nthe employer will be looked into by the LCC. A District Officer notified under the Act will\nconstitute the LCC at the district level. LCC will also look into complaints from domestic\nworkers.\n\n. LCC will be a five-member committee comprising of a chairperson to be nominated from\n\namongst eminent women in the field of social work or committed to the cause of women, one\nmember from amongst women working in block/taluka/tehsil/manicipality in the district, two\nmembers of whom at least one shall be a woman to be nominated from NGOs committed to\nthe cause of women or a person familiar with the issues related to sexual harassment provided\nthat at least one of the nominees should preferably have a background in law or legal\nknowledge. The concerned officer dealing with the social welfare or women and child\ndevelopment shall be an ex officio member.\n\n. Acomplaint of sexual harassment can be filed within a time limit of three months. This may\n\nbe extended to another three months if the woman can prove that grave circumstances\nprevented her from doing the same.\n\n. The Act has a provision for conciliation. The ICC/LCC can take steps to settle the matter\n\nbetween the aggrieved woman and the respondent, however this option will be used only at\nthe request of the woman. The Act also provides that monetary settlement shall not be made a\nbasis of conciliation. Further, if any of the conditions of the settlement is not complied with by\nthe respondent, the complainant can go back to the Committee who will proceed to make an\ninquiry.\n\nThe Committee is required to complete the inquiry within a time period of 90 days. On\ncompletion of the inquiry, the report will be sent to the employer or the District Officer, as the\ncase may be, they are mandated to take action on the report within 60 days.\n\nIn case the complaint has been found proved, then the Committee can recommend action in\naccordance with the provision of service rules applicable to the respondent or as per the rules\nwhich will be prescribed, where such service rules do not exist. The Committee can also\nrecommend deduction of an appropriate sum from the salary of the respondent or ask\nrespondent to pay the sum. In case the respondent fails to pay such sum, district officer may be\nasked to recover such sum as an arrear of land revenue.\n\nIn case the allegation against the respondent has not been proved then the Committee can write\nto the employer/district officer that no action needs to be taken in the matter.\n\nIn case of malicious or false complaint then the Act provides for a penalty according to the\nService Rules. However, this clause has a safeguard in the form of an enquiry prior to\n\n\n14.\n\n15.\n\nestablishing the malicious intent. Also, mere inability to prove the case will not attract penalty\nunder this provision.\n\nThe Act has provisions for providing reliefs to the aggrieved woman in the interim period\nincluding leave and transfer during the pendency of the inquiry.\n\nThe Act prohibits disclosure of the identity and addresses of the aggrieved woman,\nrespondent and witnesses. However, information regarding the justice secured to any victim\nof sexual harassment under this Act without disclosing the identity can be disseminated.\n\n. The Act casts a responsibility on every employer to create an environment which is free from\n\nsexual harassment. Employers are required to organise workshops and awareness\nprogrammes at regular intervals for sensitising the employees about the provision of this\nlegislation and display notices regarding the constitution of Internal Committee, penal\nconsequences of sexual harassment, etc.\n\n. An employer will be liable to a fine of z 50,000 in case of violation of his duties under the\n\nAct and in case of subsequent violations the amount of fine will be double together with\npenalty in the form of cancellation of his licence, withdrawal or non-withdrawal of the\nregistration required for carrying out his activity.\n\n18. In case of domestic worker the procedure is different considering the nature of employment. A\ndomestic worker can approach the LCC in case of any complaint. If the complainant wishes then\nconciliation may be carried out. However, in other cases if the complaint is proved prima facie\nthen the LCC can forward the complaint to the police for registering the case and taking\nappropriate action under the relevant provision of IPC."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Translate the following text into Hindi accurately, preserving the original meaning and context."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Rationale of the Act\n\nArticle 15 of the Constitution, inter-alia, confers upon the State powers to make special provision for\nchildren. Further, Article 39, inter alia, provides that the State shall in particular direct its policy\ntowards securing that the tender age of children are not abused and their childhood and youth are\nprotected against exploitation and they are given facilities to develop in a healthy manner and in\nconditions of freedom and dignity.\n\nThe United Nations Convention on the Rights of Children, ratified by India on 11\" December,\n1992, has prescribed a set of standards to be followed by all State parties in securing the best\ninterests of the child. It requires the State parties to undertake all appropriate national, bilateral and\nmultilateral measures to prevent :\n\n(a) the inducement or coercion of a child to engage in any unlawful sexual activity;\n(b) the exploitative use of children in prostitution or other unlawful sexual practices; and\n(c) the exploitative use of children in pornographic performances and materials.\n\nThe data collected by the National Crime Records Bureau shows that there has been increase in\ncases of sexual offences against children. This is corroborated by the ‘Study on Child Abuse: India\n2007’ conducted by the Ministry of Women and Child Development. Moreover, sexual offences\nagainst children are not adequately addressed by the existing laws. A large number of such offences\nare neither specifically provided for nor are they adequately penalised. The interests of the child,\n\n\nboth as a victim as well as a witness, need to be protected. It is felt that offences against children\nneed to be defined explicitly and countered through commensurate penalties as an effective\ndeterrence.\n\nTherefore, a special law, namely, the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act,\n2012 was passed to deal with child sexual abuse cases. The Act has come into force with effect from\n14\"\" November, 2012 along with the Rules framed thereunder.\n\nThe POCSO Act, 2012 is a comprehensive legislation to provide for protection of children from\nthe offences of sexual assault, sexual harassment and pornography with due regard for safeguarding\nthe interest and well being of the child at every stage of the judicial process, incorporating child-\nfriendly procedures for reporting, recording of evidence, investigation and trial of offences and\nprovision for establishment of Special Courts for speedy trial of such offences. It would contribute to\nenforcement of the right of all children to safety, security and protection from sexual abuse and\nexploitation.\n\nProvisions of the Act\n\nThe various provisions/features of the POCSO Act of 2012 are as follows:\n\n1. The Act defines a child as any person below the age of 18 years and provides protection to all\nchildren under the age of 18 years from the offences of sexual assault, sexual harassment and\npornography. These offences have been clearly defined for the first time in law.\n\n2. The Act provides for stringent punishments, which have been graded as per the gravity of the\noffence. The punishments range from simple to rigorous imprisonment of varying periods.\nThere is also provision for fine, which is to be decided by the Court.\n\n3. An offence is treated as “aggravated” when committed by a person in a position of trust or\nauthority of child such as a member of security forces, police officer, public servant, etc.\n\n4. Punishments for Offences covered in the Act are:\n\n(i) Penetrative Sexual Assault —Not less than seven years which may extend to imprisonment\nfor life.\n\n(ii) Aggravated Penetrative Sexual Assault — Not less than ten years which may extend to\nimprisonment for life, and fine.\n\n(iii) Sexual Assault — Not less than three years which may extend to five years, and fine.\n\n(iv) Aggravated Sexual Assault — Not less than five years which may extend to seven years,\nand fine.\n\n(v) Sexual Harassment of the Child — Three years and fine.\n\n(vi) Use of Child for Pornographic Purposes — Five years and fine and in the event of\nsubsequent conviction, seven years and fine.\n\n5. The Act provides for the establishment of Special Courts for trial of offences under the Act,\nkeeping the best interest of the child as of paramount importance at every stage of the judicial\nprocess. The Act incorporates child-friendly procedures for reporting, recording of evidence,\ninvestigation and trial of offences. These include:\n\n(i) Recording the statement of the child at the residence of the child or at the place of his\nchoice, preferably by a woman police officer not below the rank of sub-inspector.\n(ii) No child to be detained in the police station in the night for any reason.\n\n\n(iii) Police officer not to be in uniform while recording the statement of the child.\n(iv) The statement of the child to be recorded as spoken by the child.\n(v) Assistance of an interpreter or translator or an expert as per the need of the child.\n(vi) Assistance of special educator or any person familiar with the manner of communication\nof the child in case child is disabled.\n(vii) Medical examination of the child to be conducted in the presence of the parent of the child\nor any other person in whom the child has trust or confidence.\n(viii) In case the victim is a girl child, the medical examination shall be conducted by a woman\ndoctor.\n(ix) Frequent breaks for the child during trial.\n(x) Child not to be called repeatedly to testify.\n(xi) No aggressive questioning or character assassination of the child.\n(xii) In-camera trial of cases.\n\n6. The Act recognises that the intent to commit an offence, even when unsuccessful for whatever\nreason, needs to be penalised. The attempt to commit an offence under the Act has been made\nliable for punishment for upto half the punishment prescribed for the commission of the\noffence.\n\n7. The Act also provides for punishment for abetment of the offence, which is the same as for the\ncommission of the offence. This would cover trafficking of children for sexual purposes.\n\n8. For the more heinous offences of Penetrative Sexual Assault, Aggravated Penetrative Sexual\nAssault, Sexual Assault and Aggravated Sexual Assault, the burden of proof is shifted on the\naccused. This provision has been made keeping in view the greater vulnerability and\ninnocence of children. At the same time, to prevent misuse of the law, punishment has been\nprovided for making false complaint or proving false information with malicious intent. Such\npunishment has been kept relatively light (six months) to encourage reporting. If false\ncomplaint is made against a child, punishment is higher (one year).\n\n9. The media has been barred from disclosing the identity of the child without the permission of\nthe Special Court. The punishment for breaching this provision by media may be from six\nmonths to one year.\n\n10. For speedy trial, the Act provides for the evidence of the child to be recorded within a period\nof 30 days. Also, the Special Court is to complete the trial within a period of one year, as far\nas possible.\n\n. To provide for relief and rehabilitation of the child, as soon as the complaint is made to the\nSpecial Juvenile Police Unit (SJPU) or local police, they will make immediate arrangements\nto give the child, care and protection such as admitting the child into shelter home or to the\nnearest hospital within twenty-four hours of the report. The SJPU or the local police are also\nrequired to report the matter to the Child Welfare Committee within 24 hours of recording the\ncomplaint, for long-term rehabilitation of the child.\n\n12. The Act casts a duty on the Central and state governments to spread awareness through media\nincluding the television, radio and the print media at regular intervals to make the general\npublic, children as well as their parents and guardians aware of the provisions of this Act.\n\n13. The National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) and State\nCommissions for the Protection of Child Rights (SCPCRs) have been made the designated\n\n_\n_\n\n\nN.S...\nauthority to monitor the implementation of the Act."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

It defines ‘Senior Citizen’ as “any person being a citizen\nof India, who has attained the age of sixty years or above”.\n\nIn the light of the above, the Government of India decided to rename the National Council for Older\nPersons (NCOP) as the “National Council of Senior Citizens (NCSrC)”.\n\n\nsociety or community.\n\nEquity and Inclusiveness A society’s well being depends on ensuring that all its members\nfeel that they have a stake in it and do not feel excluded from the mainstream of society. This\nrequires all groups, but particularly the most vulnerable, have opportunities to improve or\nmaintain their well-being.\n\nEffectiveness and Efficiency Good governance means that processes and institutions\nproduce results that meet the needs of society while making the best use of resources at their\ndisposal. The concept of efficiency in the context of good governance also covers the\nsustainable use of natural resources and the protection of the environment.\n\nAccountability Accountability is a key requirement of good governance. Not only\ngovernment institutions but also the private sector and civil society organisations must be\naccountable to the public and to their institutional stakeholders. Who is accountable to whom\nvaries depending on whether decisions or actions taken are internal or external to an\norganisation or institution. In general an organisation or an institution is accountable to those\nwho will be affected by its decisions or actions. Accountability cannot be enforced without\ntransparency and the rule of law.\n\nGood Governance Initiatives\n\nThe following initiatives were taken in India to promote/ensure good governance in the country:\n\n1.\n\n2.\n\n»\n\nSl\n\nThe 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments (1992) provided for the participation of people\nin the governance process.\n\nRights-related statutory bodies such as the National Commission for Women (1992), the\nNational Commission for Minorities (1993), the National Human Rights Commission (1993)\netc., have been set-up.\n\nThe Government of India commenced the exercise to formulate Citizen’s Charters in 1996.\n\nA Commission on Review of Administrative Laws was set up in 1998 to recommend, inter\nalia, the repeal of dysfunctional laws.\n\nA Computerised Public Grievances Redressal and Monitoring System was installed in 2001.\nThe 89th Constitutional Amendment (2003) bifurcated the combined National Commission for\nSCs and STs into two separate bodies.\n\nThe Central Vigilance Commission was accorded a statutory status in 2003.\n\nA committee on Civil Service Reforms was set up in 2004 to examine the whole gamut of\ncivil service reforms.\n\nThe Prime Minister’s Awards for Excellence in Public Administration was instituted in 2005.\nLaws were enacted giving certain rights to people like the Protection of Women from\nDomestic Violence Act (2005), the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers\n(Recognition of Forest Rights) Act (2006) and so on.\n\nThe Eleventh Plan (2007-2012) document has identified the several other good governance\ninitiatives taken during the Tenth Plan (2002—2007). These are mentioned as follows:\n\n1.\n\nThe Right to Information Act, 2005 was brought into force. This applies to Union and state\nagencies, local governments and societies which receive public funds, and empowers\ncitizens.\n\n\n10.\n\nPromoting Good Governance Practices\n\nThe Documentation and Dissemination Division of the Department of Administrative Reforms and\nPublic Grievances (DARPG) primarily carries out the activities of documentation, incubation and\ndissemination of good governance practices of Centre, State/Union Territory Governments with a\nview to sharing of experience with each other and replication elsewhere. The activities dealt with by\nthe Division are detailed below:\n\n1.\n\n2. Series of Presentations on Best Practices In order to facilitate replication of the successful\n\n(vii) incentivising reforms\n\nThe All India Service Rules were amended, providing a certain fixed tenure for specified\nposts to be notified by the state and Central Governments. It will help promote accountability.\nA new Value Added Tax regime was introduced which simplifies the tax systems and has\nenormous positive implications for major reforms in the tax structure.\nElectoral funding reforms were introduced, promoting transparency and fairness and creating\ntax incentives to donors and disclosure of antecedents of candidates contesting for public\noffice.\nAn e-Governance Plan for 31 major areas was adopted. This is designed to assist, improve\ndelivery of services and digitisation of information.\nInitiatives on participatory governance were introduced under the National Rural Employment\nGuarantee Programme, National Rural Health Mission and other measures.\nA policy for voluntary organisations was announced by the Central Government, reflecting the\nimportance of the voluntary sector in promoting participatory systems.\nA National Disaster Management Authority was established to bring more focused attention to\nthis important area and to initiate preparatory work to make responses to disasters more\neffective.\nIn 2005, the Second Administrative Reforms Commission was constituted to prepare a\ndetailed blue-print for revamping the public administration system. It was asked to suggest\nmeasures to achieve a proactive, responsive, accountable, sustainable and efficient\nadministration for the country at all levels of government.\nThe Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances proposed a framework for\ngood governance in the form of a Code of Governance. The main components of this Code\nare:\n(i) improving service delivery\n(ii) development of programmes for weaker sections and backward areas\n(iii) technology and system improvement\n(iv) financial management and budget sanctity\n(v) accountability and transparency\n(vi) public service morale and anti-corruption and\n\nFinancial Assistance to States/UTs for Professional Documentation and Dissemination of\nGood Governance Practices The objective of the scheme is to provide financial assistance\nto support professional documentation and dissemination of good governance initiatives by\nthe State/UT Governments with a view to sharing experience with each other and replicating\nit elsewhere. Till date this Department has granted financial assistance for professional\ndocumentation of 62 good governance initiatives of 21 different States/UTs.\n\n\ngood governance initiatives in other states, a novel initiative was taken by the Cabinet\nSecretary in 2005 with the introduction of a presentation series on best practices. This\npresentation is being organised before a select group of Secretaries and senior officers of\nstate governments and Central Government departments. Champions of the best practices are\ncalled for making the presentations. Already 21 such presentations on diverse topics have\nbeen made which were well-attended by senior officers from the Central as well as selected\nstate governments.\n\nRegional Conferences on Reforms for Citizen Centric Governance Consequent to the\n‘Conference of Chief Ministers’ held in 1997, an Action Plan to facilitate Citizen Charter and\naccountable administration, effective and speedy public grievances redress system,\ntransparency and Right to Information and dissemination of best practices has been adopted by\nthe Department of Administrative Reforms & Public Grievances. The Regional Conferences\nare being organised with a view to bringing National and State level organisations along with\nother stakeholders including NGOs, intelligentsia, media, etc. on the same platform to share\nexperiences in the formulation and implementation of good governance practices. Senior\nofficers of the Central and state governments responsible for implementing good governance\npractices including Citizen Charters, officials from cutting edge level, representatives of the\nNGOs/consumer organisations, etc. participate in the Conference.\n\nThe main objective of the Conference is to generate awareness amongst the participants about\nthe recent reforms for promotion of good governance. Senior officers of Government of India\nresponsible for implementing good governance, officers from state governments and experts in\nthe area of governance and administration are the main partner/participants of these\nconferences.\n\nPublication of Book This Division is engaged in organising lecture series, presentations, etc.\nof best practices across the country. These lectures/presentations are immensely useful for the\nadministrators and the dissemination of these success stories might facilitate replication of the\nsame elsewhere also. As such, publication of books containing a compilation of these\nlectures/presentations would also go a long way in facilitating dissemination and eventual\nreplication. The Division has already published a series of books on the subject.\n\nProduction of Documentary Films on Best Practices One of the objectives of the\nDepartment of Administrative Reforms & Public Grievances is to promote best practices.\nMany states have achieved excellence in various aspects of administration and service\ndelivery. It is useful to gain from the experiences of each other by exchange of ideas. The\nDepartment is engaged in producing documentary films on best practices across the country.\nThese films are immensely useful for the administrators and the dissemination of success\nstories might facilitate replication of the same elsewhere also. Forty-three such documentary\nfilms have already been produced and eighteen more are in the pipeline.\n\nGovernance Knowledge Centre (GKC) The Department of Administrative Reforms and\nPublic Grievances has taken up the initiative to design and develop a web-based repository of\ngood governance initiatives and best practices. The GKC encompasses web-based digital\nrepository put together by support team comprising domain experts, resource persons, analysts\nalong with technical professionals who continuously ensure dynamic updation of Knowledge\nResources and Case Studies relevant to the profile of users visiting the repository. The Digital\nRepository is envisaged as a tool to enable capturing, organising and storing for easy retrieval\nof digital contents with respect to the various selected case studies of “Good Governance\n\n\nPractices” in India and abroad. The GKC Portal aims to assist civil servants to seek practical\nand implementable solutions to the day-to-day challenges they face. It serves as a platform for\ncollaborative knowledge exchange for the improvement of governance. It also offers a\nwidespread and reputed lot of governance knowledge that civil society can utilise to\nunderstand the nuances of civil service practices and reforms. At present, the portal consists\nof 240 well documented best practices and 544 case studies, working papers, toolkits, policy\nbriefings, etc.\n\nConference of Secretaries (AR) of all States/UTs The objective of this new initiative is (i)\nto create a national platform to share experiences of the states in the field of\nreforms/initiatives undertaken by themto improve public service delivery, make the\nadministration effective, transparent and accountable; and to make the administration citizen\nfriendly, (ii) to discuss challenges faced by the state government to achieve the above goal\nand (iii) to fulfill the expectation of the state/UT Government from Department of AR & PG,\nGOL\n\nPublication of ‘Management in Government’ — A Quarterly Journal The Department of\nAdministrative Reforms and Public Grievances is bringing out a quarterly journal\n“Management in Government” since 1969 in order to provide a forum for frank exchange of\nviews and opinions among administrators, academicians, scholars and others interested in\npublic administration and public sector management. The focus of journal is on application of\nmanagement techniques to practical situations of public administration as well as on\nconceptualisation of principles of good management based upon experience of live situations.\nPublication of ‘Civil Services News’ — A monthly newsletter This newsletter is being\nbrought out since the year 1988 for serving and retired government servants. The main\nobjective of the priced publication is to act as an effective medium for transmission of\ninformation to civil servants on the latest developments taking place at the Centre with regard\nto personnel management, pensions, administrative reforms and public grievances and other\nmatters of interest to the civil servants.\n\nBarriers to Good Governance\n\nThe Second Administrative Reforms Commission in its report entitled “Citizen Centric\nAdministration: The Heart of Governance” (2009) identified five barriers to good governance in\nIndia and explained them in the following way:\n\n1.\n\nAttitudinal Problems of the Civil Servants There is a growing concern that the Civil\nServices and administration in general, have become wooden, inflexible, self-perpetuating\nand inward looking. Consequently, their attitude is one of indifference and insensitivity to the\nneeds of citizens. This, coupled with the enormous asymmetry in the wielding of power at all\nlevels, has further aggravated the situation. The end result is that officers perceive themselves\nas dispensing favour to citizens rather than serving them and given the abject poverty,\nilliteracy, etc., a culture of exaggerated deference to authority has become the norm.\n\nLack of Accountability A common reason usually cited for inefficiency in governance is the\ninability within the system to hold the Civil Services accountable for their actions. Seldom\nare disciplinary proceedings initiated against delinquent government servants and imposition\nof penalties is even more rare. This is primarily because, at most levels, authority is divorced\n\n\nfrom accountability leading to a system of realistic and plausible alibis. Cumbersome\ndisciplinary procedures have added to the general apathy towards discipline in government.\nMoreover the safeguards provided to civil servants—which were well intentioned—have\noften been misused. Another reason for lack of accountability is that performance evaluation\nsystems within the government have not been effectively structured. The complacency that the\nsystem breeds has resulted in employees adopting an apathetic or lackadaisical attitude\ntowards citizens and their grievances.\n\nRed Tapism Bureaucracies the world over are expected to adhere to rules and procedures\nwhich are, of course, important for good governance. However, at times, these rules and\nprocedures are ab-initio ill conceived and cumbersome and, therefore, do not serve their\npurpose. Also, government servants sometimes become overly pre-occupied with rules and\nprocedures and view these as an end in themselves.\n\nLow Levels of Awareness of the Rights and Duties of Citizens Inadequate awareness about\ntheir rights prevents citizens from holding erring government servants to account. Similarly,\nlow levels ofcompliance of rules by the citizens also acts as an impediment to good\ngovernance; when citizens do not adhere to their duties they infringe on the freedom and rights\nof other citizens. Thus, awareness of rights and adherence to duties are two sides of the same\ncoin. A vigilant citizenry, fully aware of its rights as well its duties, is perhaps the best way to\nensure that officials as well as other citizens, discharge their duties effectively and honestly.\nIneffective Implementation of Laws and Rules There is a large body of laws in the country,\neach legislated with different objectives—maintaining public order and safety, maintaining\nsanitation and hygiene, protecting rights of citizens, giving special protection to the vulnerable\nsections, etc. Effective implementation of these laws creates an environment which would\nimprove the welfare of all citizens and at the same time, encourage each citizen to contribute\nhis best towards the development of society. On the other hand, weak implementation can\ncause a great deal of hardship to citizens and even erode the faith of the citizenry in the\ngovernment machinery."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Thus, e-Governance or electronic governance\nimplies the application of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) to government\nfunctioning.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, e-governance refers to the use by government agencies of\ninformation technologies (such as Wide Area Networks, the Internet, and mobile computing) that have\nthe ability to transform relations with citizens, businesses, and other arms of government.\n\ne-Governance is basically a move towards SMART governance implying: simple, moral,\naccountable, responsive and transparent governance.\n\n1. Simple — meaning simplification of rules, regulations and processes of government through\nthe use of ICTs and thereby providing for a user-friendly government\n\n2. Moral — connoting emergence of an entirely new system of ethical values in the political and\nadministrative machinery; technology interventions improve the efficiency of anti-corruption\n\n\nagencies, police, judiciary, etc.\n\nAccountable — facilitating design, development and implementation of effective Management\nInformation System and performance measurement mechanisms and thereby ensuring\naccountability of public service functionaries\n\nResponsive — streamlining the processes to speed up service delivery and make system more\nresponsive\n\nTransparent — bringing information hitherto confined in the government documents to the\npublic domain and making processes and functions transparent, which in turn would bring\nequity and rule of law in responses of the administrative agencies\n\nInteractions in e-Governance\n\nThere are four types of interactions in e-Governance viz., government to citizens (G2C), government\nto business (G2B), government to government, that is, inter-agency relationships (G2G), and\ngovernment to employees (G2E).\n\nThe Second Administrative Reforms Commission has explained the above four types of\ninteractions in e-Governance in its report entitled “Promoting e-Governance: The SMART Way\nForward” (2008) in the following manner:\n\n1.\n\nG2C (Government to Citizens) — In this case, an interface is created between the\ngovernment and citizens which enables citizens to benefit from efficient delivery of a large\nrange of public services. This expands the availability and accessibility of public services on\nthe one hand and improves the quality of services on the other. It gives citizens the choice of\nwhen to interact with the government (being available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week), from\nwhere to interact with the government (e.g., service centre, unattended kiosk or from one’s\nhome/workplace) and how to interact with the government (e.g., through internet, fax,\ntelephone, email, face-to-face, etc). The primary purpose is to make government, citizen-\nfriendly.\n\nG2B (Government to Business) — Here, e-Governance tools are used to aid the business\ncommunity —providers of goods and services — to seamlessly interact with the government.\nThe objective is to cut red tape, save time, reduce operational costs and to create a more\ntransparent business environment when dealing with the government. The G2B initiatives can\nbe transactional, such as in licensing, permits, procurement and revenue collection. They can\nalso be promotional and facilitative, such as in trade, tourism and investment. These measures\nhelp to provide a congenial environment to businesses to enable them to perform more\nefficiently.\n\nG2G (Government to Government) — In this case, Information and Communications\nTechnology is used not only to restructure the government processes involved in the\nfunctioning of government entities but also to increase the flow of information and services\nwithin and between different entities. This kind of interaction is only within the sphere of\ngovernment and can be both horizontal i.e., between different government agencies as well as\nbetween different functional areas within an organisation, or vertical i.e., between national,\nprovincial and local government agencies as well as between different levels within an\norganisation. The primary objective is to increase efficiency, performance and output.\n\nG2E (Government to Employees) — The government is by far the biggest employer and like\nany organisation, it has to interact with its employees on a regular basis. This interaction is a\n\n\ntwo-way process between the organisation and the employee. Use of ICT tools helps in\nmaking these interactions fast and efficient on the one hand and increases satisfaction levels of\nemployees on the other.\n\nBenefits of e-Governance\n\nThe benefits (or advantages or goals) of e-Governance are as follows:\n\nCONAMWPYNHE\n\nBetter delivery of government services to citizens\n\nImproved interactions with business and industry\n\nCitizen empowerment through access to information\n\nMore efficient government management\n\nLess corruption in administration\n\nIncreased transparency in administration\n\nGreater convenience to citizens and businesses\n\nCost reductions and revenue growth\n\nIncreased legitimacy of government\n\nFlattens organisational structure (less hierarchic)\n\nReduced paper work and red tapism in the administrative process\nBetter planning and coordination between different levels of governance\nGreater citizen participation in the governance process\n\nImproved relations between the public authorities and civil society\nRe-structuring of administrative processes\n\ne-Governance Initiatives\n\nThe various steps taken to promote e-Governance in India are as follows:\n\n1.\n\n2.\n3\n\nA National Task Force on Information Technology and Software Development was set-up in\n1998.\n\nThe Ministry of Information Technology was created at the Centre in 1999.\n\nIn the year 2000, a 12-point minimum agenda for e-Governance was identified for\nimplementation in all the central ministries and departments.\n\nThe Information Technology Act (2000) was enacted. This Act was amended in 2008.\n\nThe Semiconductor Integrated Circuits Layout-Design Act (2000) was enacted.\n\nThe first National Conference of States IT Ministers was organised in the year 2000, for\narriving at a Common Action Plan to promote IT in India.\n\nThe National Institute for Smart Government (NISG) was set-up at Hyderabad in the year\n2002.\n\nThe state governments launched e-Governance projects like e-seva (Andhra Pradesh),\nBhoomi (Karnataka), Gyandoot (Madhya Pradesh), Lokvani (Uttar Pradesh), FRIENDS\n(Kerala), e-mitra (Rajasthan) and so on.\n\nThe National e-Governance Plan (NeGP) was launched in 2006. Initially, it consisted of 27\nMission Mode Projects (MMPs) and 8 support components. Later, in 2011, 4 more projects\n(health, education, PDS and posts) were introduced. With this, the number of MMPs increased\nfrom 27 to 31. These 31 MMPs are further classified as central MMPs (11), State MMPs (13)\n\n\nand integrated MMPs (7). These MMPs and support components are mentioned below in\nTables 21.1 and 21.2.\n\n10. A National Policy on Open Standards for e-Governance was notified in November 2010. It\nprovides a set of guidelines for the consistent, standardised and reliable implementation of e-\nGovernance solutions.\n\n11. The National Policy on Information Technology (NPIT) was approved in 2012. It focuses on\ndeployment of ICT (Information and Communication Technology) in all sectors of the\neconomy and providing IT based solutions to address citizen centric issues.\n\nMission Mode Projects under National e-Governance Plan\n\nCentral MMPs (11) State MMPs (13) Integrated MMPs (7)\n1.

Organisation structures\n\nNational Conference on e-Governance\n\nThe Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG) along with the\nDepartment of Information Technology, in association with one of the state governments has been\n\n\norganising the National Conference on e-Governance every year since 1997.\n\nThis Conference provides a platform to the senior officers of the Government including IT\nSecretaries of state governments, IT Managers of the Central Government, and resource persons,\nexperts, intellectuals from the industry and academic institutions, etc. to discuss, exchange views and\nexperiences relating to various e-governance initiatives.\n\nEvery year, the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances recognises and\npromotes excellence in e-Governance by awarding government organisation/institutions which have\nimplemented e-Governance initiatives in an exemplary manner. National Awards for e-Governance\nare given in the following categories:\n\n(a) Excellence in Government Process Re-engineering;\n\n(b) Exemplary Re-Use of ICT based Solutions;\n\n(c) Outstanding Performance in Citizen-Centric Service Delivery;\n(d) Innovative use of Technology in e-Governance;\n\n(e) Innovative use of ICT by PSUs for Customer’s Benefits;\n\n(f) Best Government Portal; and\n\n(g) Sectoral Award\n\ne-office— A National Mission Mode Project\n\ne-Office is one of the Mission Mode Projects (MMPs), under the National e-Governance Plan\n(NeGP). The project is aimed at significantly improving the operational efficiency of Central\nGovernment Ministries and Departments through improvement in the workflow mechanisms and\nassociated office procedure manuals. The DARPG is the nodal agency for implementing the project.\n\n“e-Office” primarily involves workflow automation and knowledge management including\ndocument records management, setting and controlling the workflow in the organisation, work\nallocation and tracking, maintaining audit trails, performance benchmarking and generating\noperational MIS. The project is being implemented through NIC.\n\nThe DARPG has adopted a phased plan for e-Office implementation across the\nMinistries/Departments of GOI. The project was initially launched in 3 pilot sites, i.e., DARPG,\nTraining Division of DoPT and e-Governance Division of Department of Electronics and Information\nTechnology in September 2010. 12 Ministries/Departments were taken up during Phase 1 and 7 in\nPhase 2.\n\nThe DARPG has also formulated and circulated Reports on Change Management Strategy,\nBusiness Process Reengineering and Government Process Architecting Framework to all Central\nGovernment Ministries/Departments. The Central Secretariat Manual on e-Office Procedure\n(CSMeOP) has also been circulated by the department.\n\nMaster e-Governance Training Plan under NeGP\n\nThe DARPG has finalised Master e-Governance Training Plan under NeGP in consultation with\nDeitY and DoPT. It is being implemented in e-Office enabled Ministries/Departments in the initial\nphase.\n\ne-Governance offers enormous potentials for improving the internal efficiency of the public sector\nand the delivery of public services to citizens and other government customers. Most governments\n\n\naround the world have integrated e-Governance into their broader public sector modernisation\nagendas. The availability of skilled workforce with good capacity for learning is essential for e-\nGovernance, along with other factors like leadership, regulatory frameworks, financial resources,\norganisational conditions, and Information and Technology (IT) infrastructure. This is in line with a\npopular opinion that staffing is one of the key factors in determining the success or failure of\ntechnology applications. In fact, the survey of e-Governance projects carried out by the World Bank\nrevealed that successful e-Governance projects expend at least 10% of their budgets on training.\n\nThe purpose of the document is to highlight the need of training for effective implementation of e-\nGovernance projects and also to develop a common understanding of a core training curriculum. The\nmaster training plan outlines:\n\n(i) core competency required by various roles for e-Governance projects,\n\n(ii) delivery mechanisms,\n\n(iii) institutional frame work,\n\n(iv) broad curriculum,\n\n(v) feedback mechanism, and\n\n(vi) certification."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

It empowers the citizens to demand the committed\nstandards of service. However, it is not legally enforceable and hence, non-justiciable. Its objective\nis to build bridges between citizens and administration and to streamline administration in tune with\nthe needs and concerns of citizens.\n\nPrinciples of Citizens’ Charter\n\nThe concept of a citizens’ charter was first articulated and implemented in the United Kingdom by the\nConservative Government of John Major in 1991 as a national programme with a simple aim: to\ncontinuously improve upon the quality of public services for the people of the country so that these\nservices respond to the needs and wishes of the users. The programme was re-launched in 1998 by\nthe Labour Government of Tony Blair which rechristened it “Services First”.\nThe six principles of the citizens’ charter movement, as originally framed, were:\n(i) Quality: Improving the quality of services\n(ii) Choice: For the users wherever possible\n(iii) Standards: Specifying what to expect within a time frame and how to act if standards are not\nmet\n(iv) Value: For the taxpayers’ money\n(v) Accountability: Of the service provider (individual as well as an organisation) and\n(vi) Transparency: In rules, procedures, schemes and grievances redressal.\nThese were later elaborated by the Labour Government as the following nine principles of Service\nDelivery (1998):\n(i) Set standards of service\n\n\n(ii) Be open and provide full information\n\n(iii) Consult and involve\n\n(iv) Encourage access and promote choice\n\n(v) Treat all fairly\n\n(vi) Put things right when they go wrong\n\n(vii) Use resources effectively\n(viii) Innovate and improve and\n\n(ix) Work with other providers.\n\nIn 1992, the UK Government also introduced the Charter Mark Award Scheme for recognising\nexcellence in delivering public services. Later in the year 2008, this scheme was replaced by a new\nscheme called, “Customer Service Excellence Award Scheme”.\n\nThe UK’s citizens’ charter initiative aroused considerable interest around the world and several\ncountries implemented similar programmes, e.g., Australia (Service Charter, 1997), Belgium (Public\nService Users’ Charter, 1992), Canada (Service Standards Initiative, 1995), France (Service Charter,\n1992), India (Citizens’ Charter, 1997), Jamaica (Citizens’ Charter, 1994), Malaysia (Client Charter,\n1993), Portugal (The Quality Charter in Public Services, 1993), Spain (The Quality Observatory,\n1992) and so on.\n\nCitizens’ Charter Initiative in India\n\nIn 1996, the Centre organised a Conference of Chief Secretaries of States and Union Territories on\n“Effective and Responsive Administration”. The conference inter alia recommended the adoption of\ncitizens’ charters for all public service organisations. This recommendation was approved by the\nCentre, states and union territories in the Conference of Chief Ministers held in 1997.\n\nSince 1997, when the scheme was introduced in India, the various ministries, departments,\ndirectorates and other agencies of the Central Government, state governments and union territory\nadministrations have formulated a number of citizens’ charters. At present (2010), there are 131\ncitizens’ charters of the Central Government, and 729 of the state governments and union territory\nadministrations.\n\nA citizens’ charter in India has the following components:\n\n(i) Vision and Mission Statement of the Organisation\n\n(ii) Details of Business transacted by the Organisation\n\n(iii) Details of citizens or clients\n\n(iv) Statement of services including standards, quality, time frame etc., provided to each\n\ncitizen/client group separately and how/where to get the services\n\n(v) Details of grievance redressal mechanism and how to access it and\n\n(vi) Expectations from the citizens or clients.\n\nIn India, the following are regarded as the attributes/elements of a good citizens’ charter:\n\n(i) Focus on Customer Requirements\n\n(ii) Simple Language\n\n(iii) Service Standards\n\n(iv) Effective Remedies\n\n(v) Training\n\n(vi) Delegation\n\n(vii) Feedback Mechanism\n\n\n(viii) Close Monitoring and\n(ix) Periodic Review.\n\nPromoting Citizens’ Charters\n\nThe Citizens’ / Clients’ charters, as a tool for empowering the public, are being taken forward\nthrough the following five initiatives :\n\n1.\n\nThe first initiative is of Citizens’ Charters in all Central Ministries/Departments and the\n\nSecond is of Citizens’ Charter in all States/Union Territories. Both were started in May 1997.\n\nUnder these two initiatives progress is reflected in the increase in the number of Citizens’\n\nCharters listed on a special portal.\n\nFrom 2010 onwards, the Citizens’/Clients’ charters of all Central Ministries/Departments are\n\nup-loaded on their websites. All Central Ministries/Departments have also been requested to\n\ninclude information about their Citizens’/Clients’ charters in their annual reports.\n\nThe third initiative is for making the Citizens’ Charters more dynamic through the Sevottam\n\nframework for bringing excellence in service delivery through continuous improvement. Here\n\nthe Citizens’ Charter as one of the three components of Sevottam, is not only being created\nand reviewed but is being linked to the service delivery processes of the Ministry/Department\nconcerned.\n\nThe fourth initiative for Citizens’ Charter is as per the 12th Report of Second ARC: the\n\nSecond Administrative Reforms Commission (ARC) in its12th Report entitled ‘Citizen\n\nCentric Administration — Heart of Governance” has recommended for making the Citizens’\n\ncharters more effective as a document for interacting with citizens. This recommendation has\n\nbeen accepted by Government of India. All Central Ministries/Departments have been\nrequested to review their Citizens’ Charters to make them more effective as a tool for\ninteracting with the citizens.\n\nThe fifth initiative is of creating state department charters through the 12-month pilot projects.\n\nFrom 2008 to 2010, Sevottam pilot projects were implemented in four states in four different\n\nsectors. These were in Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha.\n\n(a) In Himachal Pradesh a new citizens’ charter with quality standards has been drafted for\nservices delivered by Water Supplies and Sanitation unit of Municipal Corporation,\nShimla.\n\n(b) In Karnataka: a new Citizens’ Charter has been created for the Department of Women and\nChild Development (DWCD) for its service delivery under the Central Scheme of\nIntegrated Child Development Services (ICDS) through Anganwadi Centres at the village\nlevel.\n\n(c) In Madhya Pradesh a Citizens’ Charter has been created with service standard for the\nPublic Health and Family Welfare (PH&FW) Department.\n\n(d) In Odisha: For the Government of Odisha the Citizens’ Charter has been created for the\nFood, Supplies and Consumer Welfare (FS&CW) Department. It includes its PDS service\ndelivery units till the Gram Panchayat level.\n\nEvaluation of Citizens’ Charters\n\n\nDuring the year 2002-03, the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances\n(DARPG) engaged a professional agency to develop a standardised model for internal and external\nevaluation of citizens’ charters in a more effective, quantifiable and objective manner. This agency\nalso carried out evaluation of implementation of charters in five Central Government organisations\nand 15 departments/organisations of the states of Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh.\n\nThe findings of the evaluation carried out by the agency were :\n\n(i) Ina majority of cases charters were not formulated through a consultative process.\n\n(ii) By and large, service providers are not familiar with the philosophy, goals and main features\n\nof the charter.\n\n(iii) Adequate publicity to the charters had not been given in any of the departments evaluated. In\n\nmost departments, the Charters are only in the initial or middle stage of implementation.\n\n(iv) No funds have been specifically earmarked for awareness generation of citizens’ charter or\n\nfor orientation of staff on various components of the charter.\n\nA study sponsored by the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances on\nevaluation of the Citizens’ Charters was carried out by the Indian Institute of Public Administration in\n2008. The observations/ findings of this study are:\n\n1. Citizens’ charters have still not been adopted by all Ministries/Departments.\n\n2. There was lack of precision on standards and commitments in several cases.\n\n3. There is often little interest shown by the organisations in adhering to their charter.\n\n4. On the communications front, the charter programme has been throttled on account of poor\nplanning and resource commitment for publicity.\n\n5. Insome cases, the charters have become a one-time exercise, frozen in time.\n\n6. There was general lack of accountability and review mechanisms.\n\n7. The charters were devoid of participative mechanisms for effective performance.\n\nSevottam Model\n\nThe citizens’ charter is one of the three modules/components of the “Sevottam Model”—the other two\nbeing public grievance redressal and service delivery capability. Sevottam is a “Service Delivery\nExcellence Model” which provides an assessment-improvement framework to bring about excellence\nin public service delivery. The term “Sevottam” is formed by joining two Hindi words “seva” and\n“uttam’ meaning “service” and “excellence” respectively.\n\nThe first component of the model requires effective citizens’ charter implementation, thereby\nopening up a channel for receiving citizens’ inputs into the way in which organisations determine\nservice delivery requirements. Citizens’ charters publicly declare the information on citizens’\nentitlements thereby making them better informed and hence empowering them to demand better\nservices.\n\nThe second component of the model, “Public Grievance Redress” requires a good grievance\nredressal system operating in a manner that leaves the citizen more satisfied with how the\norganisation responds to complaints/grievances, irrespective of the final decision.\n\nThe third component of the model, “Service Delivery Capability” postulates that an organisation\ncan have an excellent performance in service delivery only if it is efficiently managing the key\ningredients for good service delivery and building its own capacity to continuously improve upon\nservice delivery.\n\nThe third component of the model, “Service Delivery Capability” postulates that an organisation can\n\n\nhave an excellent performance in service delivery only if it is efficiently managing the key ingredients\nfor good service delivery and building its own capacity to continuously improve upon service\ndelivery.\n\nEach component/module is assessed on the basis of three criteria. Each criteria, in turn, has several\nspecific elements/questions. This structure of the assessment criteria is shown below in Table 21.3.\n\n#1) C4 Ke Sevottam Model: Assessment Criteria\n\nModules (3) Criteria (9) Elements for assessment (33)\nCitizens’ Charter Implementation 5\nMonitoring\nReview\nPublic Grievance Redress Receipt\nRedress\nPrevention\nService Delivery Capability Customers\nEmployees\nInfrastructure\n\nWwW nw www"}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

It implies\ncitizens’ control over administration or public influence on administration. It is essential for the\nsmooth and effective performance of the administrative machinery. It makes the administration\nresponsive to the needs of the people. It secures public support to the government policies and makes\nthem a success. It constitutes an important means of enforcing administrative accountability.\n\nA democratic government is based on the ‘doctrine of popular sovereignty’ which means that the\npeople are supreme in a democracy, or the final authority in democracy is vested in the people.\nTherefore, administration in democracy is or should finally and ultimately be responsible to the\npeople. It is in this context that the people’s participation in administration assumes importance. It\ntransfers the representative democracy into participatory democracy. It facilitates what is known as\n“bottom-up rule’.\n\nPeople’s participation in development administration means the direct involvement of people in the\nprocess of administering development programmes meant for bringing about socio-economic changes\nin the society. It embraces the following dimensions:\n\n(i) Participation in decision-making\n\n(ii) Participation in implementation\n\n(iii) Participation in monitoring and evaluation\n\n(iv) Participation in sharing benefits\n\nPeople participate in development administration through various mechanisms like Panchayati Raj\ninstitutions, cooperative institutions, mahila mandals, farmers service societies, yuvak kendras and\n\n\nother voluntary/non-governmental organisations.\n\nBenefits\n\nPeople’s participation in development administration is beneficial in various respects:\nIt provides administration a wealth of information on local socio-cultural, economic,\necological, and technical conditions. This information is highly useful in the process of\nplanning, programming and implementation of development programmes.\n\n2. It leads to the selection of those projects which are of direct relevance to the people.\n\n3. It facilitates mobilisation of local resources in the form of cash, labour, materials and so on\nwhich are very essential for the programme’s success.\n\n4. It acts as a safeguard against the abuse of administrative authority and thus reduces the scope\nfor corruption in the operation of programmes.\n\n5. It prevents the hijacking of programme benefits by richer and powerful sections due to the\ninvolvement of poorer and weaker sections of the society. Thus, it leads to the equitable\ndistribution of benefits.\n\n6. It makes the local community easily accept the developmental change and more tolerable to\nmistakes and failures.\n\n7. It reduces the financial burden on government by sustaining the programmes even after the\nwithdrawal of its support. They can be managed by the volunteers or community-based\nworkers.\n\n8.

It came to be known as the ‘New Economic Policy’ as it made a\n‘radical’ departure from the Nehruvian Economic Philosophy contained in the 1956 policy. In\nessence, it heralded the era of liberalisation which led to privatisation and globalisation.\n\nLiberalisation means free-market economy. It marks a change from a restrictionist regime to a free\nregime. It implies reducing, relaxing and dismantling of government’s controls and regulation in\neconomic activities. These measures include delicensing of a good number of industries, raising of\nlicensing limits, relaxations under the MRTP Act, broad banding, relaxations under the FERA (now\nFEMA) regulations, legalisation of additional capacities, relaxations in export-import policy and so\nforth. Thus, the private sector is permitted to function freely in respect of investment, production and\nproducts.\n\nPrivatisation means (i) denationalisation, that is, changing the ownership of public enterprises fully\nor partially to the private parties, (ii) deregulation, that is, allowing the entry of private sector into\nareas hitherto exclusively reserved for the public sector and (iii) operating contract, that is, entrusting\nthe management and control of public enterprises to the private parties on agreed remuneration.\n\nGlobalisation means progressive integration of Indian economy with the world economy. This\nimplies opening up the Indian economy to foreign direct investment. It removes constraints to the entry\nof Multi National Companies (MNCs) in India. Thus, the Indian Economy is made a part and parcel\nof the world economy.\n\nReasons for Reforms\n\nThe various reasons for this change in the government’s policy towards public sector are as follows:\nThe dismal financial performance of the public sector.\n\nLow returns against heavy investments in public enterprises.\n\nGovernment is no longer in a position to provide budgetary support to sick enterprises.\n\nThe need to create competition for the public enterprises so that they are forced to earn profits\nthrough improved efficiency.\n\nThe global trend towards liberalisation, privatisation, and globalisation.\n\nThe private sector is coming forward to invest in huge amounts in infrastructure areas.\nExternal factors influencing the government like advanced countries, MNCs, World Bank,\nIMF and so on.\n\nPender\n\nraw\n\nProvisions for Reforms\n\nThe New Industrial Policy of 1991 contained the following provisions with regard to the public\nsector:\n1. The public sector investments will be confined to strategic, hi-tech and essential infrastructure\nareas.\n2. Some of the areas reserved for the public sector will be opened up to the private sector\nselectively. Similarly, the public sector will be allowed entry in areas not reserved for it.\n3. Chronically sick public enterprises will be referred to the Board for Industrial and Financial\n\n\nReconstruction (BIFR) for formulation of revival and rehabilitation schemes.\n\n4. A social security mechanism will be created to protect the interests of workers likely to be\naffected by such rehabilitation schemes.\n\n5. Apart of the government’s share-holding in the public sector will be offered to mutual funds,\nfinancial institutions, general public and workers.\n\n6. Boards of public sector companies would be made more professional and given more\npowers.\n\n7. Through the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) system, management would be granted\ngreater autonomy and held accountable for the results.\n\n8. Budgetary support to public enterprises would be progressively reduced.\n\nImplementation of Reforms\n\nAs a follow-up of this new policy and a series of macroeconomic policy reforms leading to the\nliberalisation of the Indian Economy, the government had taken various measures to reform the public\nenterprises. These are explained below:\n\n1. Dereservations In 1991, the number of industries reserved for the public sector was reduced\nfrom 17 to 8. In 1993, two more items were deleted from the reserved list. Again in 1998, another\ntwo items were dereserved. Further, in 2001, the government opened up one more area to the private\nsector participation. Thus, today only 3 areas stand reserved viz., (i) atomic energy, (ii) minerals\nspecified in the schedule to the atomic energy (control of production and use) order, 1953, and (iii)\nrail transport.\n\nMoreover, some of the dereserved areas are opened not only to domestic private enterprises but\nalso to foreign private enterprises.\n\n2. Sick Units In 1991, the Sick Industrial Companies Act (SICA, 1985) was amended to enable the\nsick public enterprises to be referred to the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR,\n1987) for revival or closure.\n\nThe Board for Reconstruction of Public Sector Enterprises (BRPSE) was set up in December,\n2004 to advise the government on the measures to restructure/revive both industrial and non-\nindustrial public enterprises. For the purpose of making reference to BRPSE, a company is\nconsidered sick if it has accumulates losses in any financial year equal to 50 per cent or more of its\naverage net worth during 4 years immediately preceding such financial year and/or a company which\nis a sick company within the meaning of Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985\n(SICA). The concerned administrative ministries/departments are required to send proposals of their\npublic enterprises identified as sick for consideration of BRPSE. Other loss making public\nenterprises may be considered by the Board either suo moto upon reference by the administrative\nministry if it is of the opinion that revival/restructuring is necessary for checking the incipient\nsickness (incurring loss for two consecutive years) and making the public enterprises profitable,\nkeeping the industry specific business environment in view.\n\n3. Golden Hand-Shake In 1988, government initiated the Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS)\nto help the public enterprises to shed excess manpower. This scheme came to be popularly known as\n“Golden Hand-Shake” Policy as the workers get a handsome amount from the enterprises at the time\n\n\nof dissociation. In 1992, the National Renewal Fund (NRE) was created for training and\nredeployment of retrenched workers, besides providing compensation to the persons seeking\nvoluntary retirement. The National Renewal Fund was abolished in 2000.\n\n4. Disinvestment In 1991-92, the disinvestment programme was started with the main objective\nof raising non-inflationary kind of finance for the government budget. Disinvestment is a process\nwhereby the government withdraws a portion or the total of its equity in a public enterprise. In 1992,\nthe government appointed a ‘Committee on Disinvestment of shares in Public Sector Enterprises’\nunder the chairmanship of Dr. C. Rangarajan to suggest measures with regard to the disinvestment\nprogramme. On its recommendation, the government set-up in 1996 a ‘Commission on Public Sector\nDisinvestment’ under the chairmanship of G.V. Ramakrishnan for preparing a long-term plan of\ndisinvestment of public enterprises referred to it. In order to expedite the process of disinvestment,\nthe government established a new full-fledged Department of Disinvestment in 1999 in place of the\nDisinvestment Commission.\n\n5. Navratnas In 1997, the Government identified nine leading, well-performing and high profit-\nmaking public enterprises as the ‘Navratnas’ (Nine Precious Jewels). They were granted substantial\nenhanced autonomy and operational freedom in different fields (financial, commercial, managerial,\nand organisational) to facilitate their becoming global players. Their Boards have also been\nprofessionalised by induction of non-official part-time professional directors.\n\n6. Miniratnas In 1997, the Government identified another 97 profit-making public enterprises as\nthe ‘Miniratnas’ (Small Precious Jewels) and granted them financial, managerial, and operational\nautonomy. Further, these enterprises are divided into two categories (Miniratnas-I and Miniratnas-II)\ndepending on their recent performance.\n\n7. Memorandum of Understanding The system of memorandum of understanding (MoU)\nwas introduced in 1987-88. The following points can be noted with regard to the Memorandum of\nUnderstanding (MoU):\n\n(i) The MoU is an agreement between the Government (ministry) and the public enterprises\nmanagement to grant autonomy to the latter, that is, to reduce day-to-day interference of the\nministry in the management of public enterprises.\n\n(ii) It defines obligations of both the parties for improving performance of public enterprises.\n\n(iii) It makes public enterprise managements responsible and accountable for results. Thus it is a\nsystem of annual performance contract between the ministry and the enterprise.\n\n(iv) It was recommended by the Arjun Sengupta Committee (the committee to Review the Policy\nfor the Public Enterprises) Report of 1986.\n\n(v) It is the Indian version of the French ‘Performance Contract System’ and the Korean\n“Signalling System.’\n\n8. Maharatna Scheme In December 2009, the government introduced (approved) a new\nscheme called “Maharatna Scheme”. Under this, the higher end Navaratna companies would be\nrecognised as a separate class, i.e., “Maharatnas” and granted a higher level of financial and\nmanagerial autonomy. This would enable them to expand their operations and emerge as global\ngiants. In May 2010, the government formally conferred the coveted maharatna status on four\ncompanies, viz., Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL), National Thermal Power Corporation\n\n\n(NTPC), Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC)."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

It is imperative\nto design and implement a dynamic mechanism of corporate governance, which protects the interests\nof relevant stakeholders without hindering the growth of enterprises.\n\nCorporate governance involves a set of relationships amongst the company’s management, its\nboard of directors, its shareholders, its auditors and other stakeholders. These relationships, which\ninvolve various rules and incentives, provide the structure through which the objectives of the\ncompany are set, and the means of attaining these objectives as well as monitoring performance are\ndetermined. Thus, the key aspects of good corporate governance include transparency of corporate\nstructures and operations, the accountability of managers and the boards to shareholders and\ncorporate responsibility towards stakeholders.\n\nPrinciples of Corporate Governance\n\nA company should:\n\n1. Recognise and publish the respective roles and responsibilities of board and management\n\n2. Have a board of an effective composition, size and commitment to adequately discharge its\nresponsibilities and duties\nActively promote ethical and responsible decision-making\nHave a structure to independently verify and safeguard the integrity of the company’s financial\nreporting\nPromote timely and balanced disclosure of all material matters concerning the company\nRespect the rights of shareholders and facilitate the effective exercise of those rights\nEstablish a sound system of risk oversight and management and internal control\nFairly review and actively encourage enhanced board and management effectiveness\nEnsure that the level and composition of remuneration is sufficient and reasonable and that its\nrelationship to corporate and individual performance is defined\n10. Recognise legal and other obligations to all legitimate stakeholders\n\nRY\n\nCO weNAM\n\nLegal Framework\n\nThe corporate governance legal framework in India primarily consists of the following legislations\nand regulations:\n\n1. The Companies Act, 2013 The new Companies Act of 2013 has replaced the earlier\nCompanies Act of 1956. The new Act seeks to bring corporate governance and regulation\npractices in India at par with the best global practices. The corporate sector has been given\nmore flexibility in regulating their affairs, subject to full disclosure and accountability of their\nactions, with minimum government approvals. The Act provides more opportunities for new\nentrepreneurs and enables wide application of Information Technology in the conduct of\n\n\naffairs by corporates. The other salient features of this legislation include provisions with\nregard to more accountability of audit, Corporate Social Responsibility, stricter action in case\nof fraud related offences and protection of interests of investors.\n\nThe Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 This Act covers all types of tradable\ngovernment paper, shares, stocks, bonds, debentures, and other forms of marketable securities\nissued by companies. The SCRA defines the parameters of conduct of stock exchanges as well\nas its powers.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 This Act established the\nindependent capital market regulatory authority, SEBI, with the objective of protecting the\ninterests of investors in securities, and promote and regulating the securities market.\n\nThe Depositories Act, 1996 This Act established share and securities depositories, and\ncreated the legal framework for dematerialization of securities.\n\nListing Agreement of Stock Exchanges This agreement defines the rules, processes, and\ndisclosures that companies must follow to remain as listed entities. A key element of this\nAgreement is Clause 49, which states the corporate governance practices that listed\ncompanies must follow.\n\nInstitutional Framework\n\n1.\n\nNational Foundation for Corporate Governance \\n 2003, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs\nhas set up a National Foundation for Corporate Governance (NFCG) as a not-for-profit Trust\nto provide a platform to deliberate upon issues relating to good corporate governance and to\nsensitise corporate leaders on the importance of good corporate governance practices, to\nfacilitate exchange of experiences and ideas between corporate leaders, policy makers,\nregulators, law enforcing agencies and non-government organisations.\n\nThe NFCG has been sponsoring orientation programmes for Directors through the various\nInstitutes of Excellence and has been organising seminars and conferences to propagate the\nneed for following good corporate governance practices.\n\nIndian Institute of Corporate Affairs The Indian Institute of Corporate Affairs (IICA) has\nbeen set up as a registered society under the Ministry of Corporate Affairs in 2008. Its\nobjectives are:\n(i) Develop capacity for undertaking holistic study and harmonised treatment of all issues\nimpacting governance and corporate functioning with a global perspective\n(ii) Set-up a state-of-the-art Knowledge Management (KM) system for constant creation,\ncollation and dissemination of knowledge to internal and external stakeholders on all\nissues affecting the corporate sector\n(iii) Act as a think-tank to advise government holistically on all issues impacting on corporate\nfunctioning\n(iv) Training and capacity building for officials of the ministry and all stakeholders\nSerious Fraud Investigation Office The Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) has been\nset up in 2003 by the Government of India in the Ministry of Corporate Affairs by way of a\nresolution. This office investigates corporate frauds of serious and complex nature. It carries\nout investigation under the provisions of the Companies Act and files prosecutions for the\nviolations of the provisions of the Companies Act as well as Indian Penal Code (IPC).\n\n\nThe SFIO takes up investigation of corporate frauds characterised by (a) complexity and\nhaving inter-departmental and multi-disciplinary ramifications (b) substantial involvement of\npublic interest to be judged by size either in terms of monetary misappropriation or in terms of\npersons affected and (c) the possibility of investigation leading to or contributing towards a\nclear improvement in systems, laws or procedures.\n\nCommittees on Corporate Governance\n\n1.\n\nCII Code Committee (1998) The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), India’s largest\nindustry and business association, set up a committee to examine corporate governance issues,\nand recommend a voluntary code of best practices. The committee was driven by the\nconviction that good corporate governance was essential for Indian companies to access\ndomestic as well as global capital at competitive rates. Its code (Desirable Corporate\nGovernance: A Code) was released in 1998. The code was voluntary, contained detailed\nprovisions, and focused on listed companies.\n\nKumar Mangalam Birla Committee (1999) In 1999, the SEBI set up a committee under\nKumar Mangalam Birla to promote and raise the standards of good corporate governance. The\nSEBI board had accepted and ratified key recommendations of this committee, and these were\nincorporated into Clause 49 of the Listing Agreement of the Stock Exchanges.\n\nNaresh Chandra Committee (2002) The Naresh Chandra Committee was appointed in 2002\nby the Ministry of Corporate Affairs to examine various corporate governance issues. The\nCommittee made recommendations regarding auditor-company relationship, prohibition on\naudit firms to provide non-audit services, compulsory audit partner rotation, auditor’s\ndisclosure of qualifications, CEO and CFO certification of annual audited accounts,\npercentage of independent directors, minimum board size of listed companies, disclosure on\nduration of board meetings, etc.\n\nNarayana Murthy Committee (2003) The Narayana Murthy Committee was set up by SEBI\nto review Clause 49, and suggest measures to improve upon corporate governance standards.\nThe major recommendations of the committee primarily related to audit committees, audit\nreports, independent directors, related party transactions, risk management, directorships and\ndirector compensation, code of conduct and financial disclosures.\n\nJ.J. Irani Committee (2005) An Expert Committee on Company Law was constituted by the\nMinistry of Corporate Affairs in December 2004 under the chairmanship of Dr. Jamshed J.\nIrani. The committee submitted its report in May 2005. It took a comprehensive view in\ndeveloping a perspective on changes necessary in the Companies Act, 1956 in the context of\nthe present economic and business environment. It also aimed at making India globally\ncompetitive in attracting investments from abroad, by suggesting systems in the Indian\ncorporate environment which are transparent, simple and globally acceptable."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Below is an excerpt from my book titled 'Understanding governance in india for upsc', specifically from Chapter 'AMERICAN CONSTITUTION', Section 'AMERICAN CONSTITUTION'. Translate the following text into Hindi accurately, preserving the original meaning and context."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The American Constitution is the Constitution of the United States of America which was formed in\n1787 following the American Revolution (1775-83). The Constitution was adopted in 1787 at the\nPhiladelphia Convention and came into force in 1789. The salient features of the American\nConstitution are explained below.\n\nWritten Constitution The American Constitution is usually cited as a classic example of a\nwritten Constitution. In fact, it is the oldest among the existing written Constitutions of the world. It is\ncontained in a document of some 12 pages and consists of a Preamble, 7 Articles and 27\nAmendments. However, the actual working constitutional system includes, apart from the\n“Constitutional Document,’ the following.\n(i) The statutes of the Congress (i.e. the legislature of the USA) which determine the organisation\nand functions of a number of government agencies.\n\n(ii) The orders issued by the President on some occasions for giving practical shape to the statutes\nmade by the Congress.\n\n(iii) The judicial decisions interpreting the Constitution through a system of judicial review. For\nexample, the Supreme Court has increased the scope of federal jurisdiction through the\ndoctrine of ‘implied powers.’\n\n(iv) The political conventions which have grown gradually around the Constitution. For example,\nthe Cabinet of the President is totally a product of convention.\n\nThus, the American Constitution or constitutional system, as it exists today, is a product of the 1787\nconstitutional document and subsequent amendments, the congressional statutes, executive orders,\njudicial interpretations and the political conventions.\n\nRigid Constitution Unlike the British Constitution, the American Constitution is a rigid one. It\ncannot be amended by the Congress in the same manner as the ordinary laws are made. It can be\namended by the Congress only by means of a special process provided by the Constitution for that\npurpose. Therefore, in the USA, there exists a distinction between a constitutional law and an\nordinary law.\n\nThe American Constitution, the most rigid constitution in the world, lays down the following two\nmethods for its amendment.\n\n(i) An amendment can be proposed by two-third votes of both the Houses of the Congress. It\nshould be ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths (38 out of 50) of the states within a\n\n\nseven-year time span.\n\n(ii) Alternatively, an amendment can be proposed by a constitutional convention called by the\nCongress on the petition of two-thirds (34 out of 50) of the state legislatures. It should be\nratified by the convention in three-fourths (38 out of 50) of state legislatures.\n\nHence, the procedure prescribed by the American Constitution for its amendment is very difficult,\ncomplicated and slow. Its rigid character is evident from the fact that it has been amended only 27\ntimes since its promulgation in 1789.\n\nFederal Constitution USA is a federal state. In fact, the USA is the first and the oldest federal\nstate in the modern world. It is a federal republic comprising 50 states (originally 13 states) and the\nDistrict of Columbia. The Constitution provides for division of powers between the federal (central)\ngovernment and the state governments. It confers limited and specified powers on the Centre and\nvests the residuary powers (which are not enumerated in the Constitution) in the states. Each state has\nits own Constitution, elected legislature, governor and Supreme Court.\n\nPresidential Government Unlike the British Constitution, the American Constitution provides\nfor the presidential form of government. The features of the American presidential system of\ngovernment are as follows.\n\n(i) The American President is both, the head of state and the head of government. As the head of\nstate, he occupies a ceremonial position. As the head of government, he leads the executive\norgan of government. The President of the USA is the chief real executive.\n\n(ii) The President is elected by an electoral college for a fixed tenure of four years. He cannot be\nremoved by the Congress except by impeachment for a grave unconstitutional act.\n\n(iii) The President governs with the help of the Cabinet or a smaller body called ‘Kitchen’\nCabinet. It is only an advisory body and consists of non-elected departmental secretaries.\nThey are selected and appointed by him and are responsible only to him. They can also be\nremoved by him any time.\n\n(iv) The President and his secretaries are not responsible to the Congress for their acts. They\nneither possess membership in the Congress nor attend its sessions.\n\n(v) The President cannot dissolve the House of Representatives—the lower House of the\nCongress.\n\nSeparation of Powers The doctrine of separation of powers is the basis of the American\nconstitutional system. The legislative, executive and judicial powers of the government are separated\nand vested in the three independent organs of the government. The first three articles of the\nConstitution clearly manifest this feature of the Constitution. Article I says that all legislative powers\nherein granted shall be vested in the Congress. Article II states that the executive powers shall be\nvested in the President. Article III provides that the judicial powers shall be vested in one Supreme\nCourt and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.\n\nChecks and Balances The system of checks and balances in the American Constitution is an\noutcome of the adoption of the principle of separation of powers. It enables each organ of the\ngovernment to exercise partial control on others so that no organ becomes autocratic and\nirresponsible. This means that no organ of government has unrestricted powers even in its own\nsphere.\n\n\nSome aspects of the working of the system of checks and balances in the American Constitutional\nsystem are:\n\n(i) The President can veto the bills passed by the Congress. He enjoys two kinds of vetos—\nPocket veto and Qualified veto.\n(ii) The Senate confirms the higher appointments made and international treaties concluded by the\nPresident.\n(iii) The Congress determines the organisation and appellate jurisdiction of the judiciary.\n(iv) The President appoints the judges with the consent of the Senate.\n(v) The Supreme Court can declare the congressional laws and Presidential orders as ultra vires.\n\nSupremacy of Constitution and Judicial Review The American Constitution embodies the\nprinciple of ‘hierarchy of laws.’ The written Constitution is regarded as the highest (supreme or\nfundamental) law of the land. The statutes of the Congress and state legislatures must conform to this\nsupreme law. If these statutes are against the provisions of the Constitution, they can be declared by\nthe Supreme Court as ultra vires and hence, null and void. The Supreme Court thus acts as the\ncustodian of the Constitution through its power of judicial review.\n\nBill of Rights The American Constitution is the first Constitution in the world to carry the Bill of\nRights. It guarantees a large number of rights to the people. It says that no person is to be deprived of\nlife, liberty and property without due process of law. These rights impose restrictions on the authority\nof the government. The Supreme Court acts as the protector of these rights through its power of\njudicial review. This Bill of Rights was added to the original Constitution in 1791 through the first\nten amendments.\n\nBicameralism The American Federal Legislature called the Congress is bicameral, that is, it\nconsists of two Houses namely the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Senate is the upper\nHouse while the House of Representatives is the lower House. The Senate consists of 100 members,\ntwo being elected from each state to serve for a fixed six-year term. The House of Representatives\nconsists of 435 members elected from single member constituencies to serve for a fixed two-year\nterm. The Senate is the more powerful chamber of the Congress. In fact, the American Senate is the\nmost powerful second chamber (upper House) in the world.\n\nAmerican President\n\nMode of Election The American Constitution provides for an indirect election of the President.\nHowever, the growth of political parties and political conventions has converted it into a direct\nelection.\n\nConstitutionally, the President is elected by an electoral college constituted for the purpose. The\nmembers of this college (called as Presidential Electors) are elected directly by the people of all the\nstates. The number of presidential electors in each state is equal to the number of its members in the\nCongress (both in the House of Representatives and the Senate). It means that the electoral college\nconsists of as many members as is the total strength of the two Houses of the Congress. Additionally,\nthree votes have been given to the District of Columbia, a federal enclave and not a state. Thus, the\ntotal strength of the electoral college is 538 (435 is the strength of the House of Representatives, 100\nis the strength of the Senate and 3 members of the District of Columbia). A candidate in order to win\n\n\nthe presidential election needs 270 votes, that is, 269 (half of the total votes of 538) plus 1.\n\nIt must be stressed here that the members of the electoral college are not the members of the\nCongress. The college is a special body which is formed only for electing the President and it gets\ndissolved after this.\n\nIf no candidate secures the requisite majority, the House of Representatives elects the President\nfrom among the three candidates securing the highest votes in the electoral college. There have been\nthree such occasions (1800, 1824 and 1876).\n\nQualifications, Term and Removal According to the Constitution, a candidate for the\npresidency must have the following three qualifications:\n\n(i) He must be a natural born citizen of the USA. A naturalized citizen is not eligible.\n(ii) He must have attained the age of 35 years.\n(iii) He must have been a resident of the USA for 14 years (not necessarily consecutive).\n\nThe President holds the office for a fixed tenure of 4 years. He is eligible for re-election but only\nonce. The 22\"! Amendment Act of 1951 has fixed the maximum total term for any President at 10\nyears. In other words, it bars any person from being elected as President more than twice. The\npresidential term of 4 years begins on 20 January.\n\nThe President may be removed from the office before the expiry of his normal tenure of 4 years\nthrough impeachment for treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors. The House of\nRepresentatives initiates the impeachment proceedings by a majority vote. The case is then tried by\nthe Senate. During this trial period, the Senate acts as a judicial tribunal and is presided over by the\nChief Justice of the Supreme Court (and not the Vice-president). If the Senate also passes the\nimpeachment resolution by a two-thirds majority, the President stands impeached. So far, no\nAmerican president has ever been removed by impeachment. But, there have been three impeachment\nattempts—Andrew Johnson (1868), Richard Nixon (1974) and Bill Clinton (1998).\n\nPowers and Functions The American presidency is one of the strongest democratic office in\nthe world. Lord Bryce regards it as “the greatest office in the world”. Munro observed that “the\nAmerican President exercises the largest amount of authority ever wielded by any man in a\ndemocracy”. Ogg regards him as “the greatest ruler of the world”. Harold Laski remarked: “the\nPresident of the United States is both more and less than a King, he is also both more and less than a\nPrime Minister”.\n\nThe President derives his powers and functions from four sources: Constitution, Acts of Congress,\njudicial interpretations and political conventions. These are mentioned below:\n\n1. He has to enforce the Constitution, federal laws and treaties, and judicial decisions throughout\nthe country.\n\n2. He is the supreme commander of the armed forces of the US.\n\n3. He appoints the Supreme Court judges, ambassadors, heads of executive departments,\ndiplomatic officials, consuls and other top officials.\n\n4. He formulates foreign policy and conducts foreign affairs of the US.\n\n5. He can grant pardon and reprive for offences against federal laws (except in cases of\nimpeachment).\n\n6. When a Bill approved by both the Houses of the Congress is sent to him for his assent, he has\nthree options before him:\n\n\n(i) He may give his assent to the Bill and the Bill then becomes an Act.\n\n(ii) He may reject the Bill and return it to the Congress within 10 days. But, if the same bill is\nre-passed by the Congress by a two-thirds majority, then the Bill becomes a law and the\npresident has to sign it. This is known as ‘Qualified Veto’.\n\n(iii) He may reserve the Bill with him. Then, the Bill becomes a law after the expiry of ten\ndays without his assent. But, if the Congress ends session before ten days, then the Bill\nautomatically dies. This is known as ‘Pocket Veto’ and it is absolute.\n\n7. He can send messages to the Congress proposing some legislative measures; either orally\ndelivered to the House or sent in the form of a document.\n8. He can call special sessions of the Congress for consideration of urgent matters.\n9. He prepares the national budget and submits it to the Congress for approval.\n10. He is empowered to make rules and regulations in the form of executive orders. This is known\nas delegated legislation.\n11. He is empowered to adjourn the Congress, when there is a disagreement between two Houses\non the date of adjournment."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Great Britain consists of England, Wales and Scotland. England and Wales were united in\n1535 and Scotland joined them to form the state of Great Britain in 1707, while the United Kingdom\nof Great Britain and Northern Ireland was formed in 1921.\n\nThe British constitutional system is the oldest in the world and is also the oldest democratic\nsystem. In fact, the British Constitution is the ‘mother of Constitutions.’ The principles and institutions\nof representative government were first developed in Britain.\n\nThe British Constitution is a blend of monarchy, aristocracy and democracy. The salient features of\nthe British Constitution are explained below.\n\nUnwritten Constitution Unlike the American Constitution, the British Constitution is unwritten.\nIn the UK most of the principles governing the distribution and exercise of the governmental powers\nare not written. Only a small portion of the British Constitution is covered by written documents. The\nBritish Constitution is an evolved Constitution, not an enacted one. It is a product of history and a\nresult of evolution. It is a child of chance (accident) as well as wisdom (design). It is not a static\nconstitution but a remarkably dynamic one. Hence, L.S. Amery in his book Thoughts on the\nConstitution says that the British Constitution is “a blend of formal law, precedent and tradition.”\nThe various elements or sources of the British Constitution are explained as follows.\n\n1. Conventions Conventions constitute a major element of the British Constitution. These are the\nunwritten principles of political practices and customary principles of constitutional behaviour which\nhave developed in the course of time. J.S. Mill described them as the “Unwritten maxims of the\nConstitution.” However, unlike the laws, they are not recognised and enforced by judicial courts. But\nthey play a very significant role in the actual working of the British political institutions. They are\ngenerally observed as they are backed by tradition and public opinion. The well-known conventions\nin Britain are:\n\n\n(a) The King or Queen should exercise his/her legal powers on the advise of the Cabinet headed\nby the Prime Minister.\n\n(b) The King should appoint the leader of the majority party in the House of Commons as the\nPrime Minister.\n\n(c) The King should dissolve the lower House of Parliament on the advise of the Prime Minister.\n\n(d) The King should give his assent to all the Bills passed by the Parliament.\n\n(e) The Cabinet is collectively and individually responsible to the House of Commons.\n\n2. Great Charters These are also called as constitutional charters or constitutional landmarks.\nThey are historical documents which define the powers of the Crown and liberties of the citizens, and\nso on. They have a significant bearing on some of the basic aspects of the British Constitution. The\nimportant among such charters are the Magna Carta (1215), the Petition of Rights (1628), the Bill of\nRights (1689), and others.\n\n3. Statutes These are the laws made by the British Parliament from time to time. They define and\nregulate the principles, structures and functions of many British political institutions. The important\nstatutes in Britain are the Habeas Corpus Act (1679), the Statute of Westminster (1931), Ministers of\nthe Crown Act (1937), the People’s Representation Act (1948), and others.\n\n4. Common Law It is a body of judge made laws. It has defined some of the significant rules and\nprinciples pertaining to the powers of the government and its relationship with the citizens. They are\naccepted and enforced by judicial courts. Dr. Ogg defines common law as “the vast body of legal\nprecept and usage, which through the centuries has acquired binding and almost immutable\ncharacter.”\n\n5. Legal Commentaries These are the commentaries or text books written on the constitutional\nlaw of the country by the constitutional experts. They provide insight into the working of the British\npolitical institutions. They clarify the meaning and fix the scope of certain constitutional principles.\nSome of the popular legal commentaries on the British Constitution, are A.V. Dicey’s ‘Law of the\nConstitution,” Bagehot’s ‘English Constitution,’ Blackstone’s ‘Commentaries on the Laws of\nEngland,’ and others.\n\nFlexible Constitution Unlike the American Constitution, the British Constitution is flexible in\nnature. It requires no special procedure for its amendment. It can be amended by the Parliament in the\nsame manner as the ordinary laws are made. Thus, in Great Britain, there exists no distinction\nbetween the constitutional law and the ordinary law.\n\nUnitary Constitution Great Britain is a unitary state. Hence, all the powers of the government\nare vested in a single supreme central government. The local governments are created only for\nadministrative convenience and they work under the complete control of the Central Government\nlocated at London. They derive their authority from the central government which can also abolish\nthem altogether at any time.\n\nParliamentary Government The British Constitution provides for parliamentary form of\ngovernment in which the executive hails from the legislature and remains responsible to it. The\nfeatures of the British parliamentary system of government are as follows:\n\n\n(i) The King is the nominal executive while the Cabinet is the real executive. The King is head of\n\nthe state while the Prime Minister is head of the government.\n\n(ii) The party which secures majority seats in the House of Commons, forms the government. The\nleader of that party is appointed as the Prime Minister by the King/Queen.\n\n(iii) The ministers are individually as well as collectively responsible to the House of Commons\nfor their acts. They remain in office so long as they enjoy the majority support in the House.\n\n(iv) The King can dissolve the House of Commons on the advise of the Prime Minister.\n\n(v) The ministers (members of the executive) are also the members of the British Parliament. This\navoids conflicts between the executive and the legislature and facilitates better coordination\nbetween them.\n\nSovereignty of Parliament Sovereignty means the supreme power within the state. That\nsupreme power in Great Britain lies with the Parliament. Hence sovereignty of Parliament (or\nsupremacy of Parliament) is a cardinal principle of the British constitutional law and political\nsystem. This principle implies the following things.\n\n(i) The British Parliament can make, amend, substitute or repeal any law. De Lolme said, “The\nBritish Parliament can do everything except make a woman a man and a man a woman.”\n\n(ii) The Parliament can make constitutional laws by the same procedure as ordinary laws. In other\nwords, there is no legal distinction between the constituent authority and the law-making\nauthority of the British Parliament.\n\n(iii) The parliamentary laws cannot be declared invalid by the judiciary as being unconstitutional.\nIn other words, there is no system of judicial review in Great Britain.\n\nRule of Law The doctrine of rule of law is one of the fundamental characteristics of the British\nconstitutional system. It lays down that the law is supreme and hence the government must act\naccording to law and within the limits of the law. A.V. Dicey in his book The Law of the\nConstitution (1885), has given the following three implications of the doctrine of rule of law.\n\n(i) Absence of arbitrary power, that is, no man can be punished except for a breach of law.\n\n(ii) Equality before the law, that is, equal subjection of all citizens (rich or poor, high or low,\nofficial or non-official) to the ordinary law of the land administered by the ordinary law\ncourts.\n\n(iii) The primacy of the rights of the individual, that is, the Constitution is the result of the rights of\nindividual as defined and enforced by the courts of law, rather than the Constitution being the\nsource of the individual rights. The rights of the citizens of Great Britain flow from judicial\ndecisions, not from the Constitution.\n\nConstitutional Monarchy Great Britain is a monarchical state. It is described as a limited\nhereditary monarchy. The hereditary monarch (King or Queen) is the head of the state. The Crown is\nthe visible symbol of the supreme executive power. However, the King or Queen only reigns, but\ndoes not rule. These powers are actually execised by the Cabinet headed by the Prime Minister. The\ncabinet is collectively responsible to the Parliament for its actions and ultimately to the electorate.\nHence, what Great Britain has is a “constitutional monarchy.”\n\nThe distinction between the Crown and the King is the distinction between the monarchy as an\ninstitution and the monarch as a person. In other words, the King is a person whereas the Crown is an\ninstitution (i.e. the institution of kingship). The King is mortal whereas the Crown is immortal. This is\n\n\nclearly expressed by the popular statement in Great Britain that “the King is dead; long live the\nKing.” It means that the person who occupied the throne is dead but the institution of kingship\nsurvives.\n\nBicameralism The British Parliament is bicameral, that is, it consists of two houses namely the\nHouse of Lords and the House of Commons.\n\nThe House of Lords is the upper house. It is the oldest second chamber in the world. It consist of\nlords, peers and nobles and hence, represent the aristocratic element of the British political system.\nAt present it has 677 appointed members who fall into four distinct groups. It is mostly a hereditary\nbody.\n\nThe House of Commons is the lower House but more important and powerful than the House of\nLords. It is the oldest popular legislative body in the world. It consists of the representatives elected\nby the people on the basis of universal adult franchise. There are at present 659 seats in the House of\nCommons and these are distributed among England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.\n\nBritish Cabinet\n\nComposition As the British Constitution provides for parliamentary system of government, the\nCabinet acts as the real executive authority. It consists of the Prime Minister as its head and twenty or\nso of his most senior ministerial collegues. It includes the following:\n\nPrime Minister and First Lord of the Treasury and Minister for the Civil Service.\nChancellor of the Exchequer.\nLord Privy Seal.\nChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.\nLord President of the Council.\nPresident of the Board of Trade.\nLord Chancellor.\nFirst Lord of Admirality.\nPost Master General.\nSecretaries of State for Home, Foreign, Defence, Social Services, Environment and Education\nand Science.\n11. Ministers of Agriculture and Fisheries, Health, Pension, Transport and Labour.\n12. Secretary of State of Scotland.\n13. Secretary of State for Wales.\nIt must be mentioned here that the Attorney-General, Solicitor-General, Lord Advocate and\nPaymaster-General are not members of the British Cabinet.\n\nSPE RPANDMPSYWNS\n\n_\n\nPrivy Council There is a close relationship between the Cabinet and the Privy Council. This\ncouncil, in its present form, came into existence in the fifteenth century as an advisory body to the\nBritish monarch. In the course of time, most of its powers were transferred to the cabinet as its inner\ncommittee. Presently, it consists of 330 members and includes, inter alia, all cabinet ministers (past\nand present). It is presided over by the Lord President of the Council.\n\nPrime Ministerial Government In the past, the British Constitutional and political experts had\ndescribed the relationship between the Prime Minister and the Cabinet as ‘Primus inter pares’ (first\n\n\namong equals). In the recent period, the Prime Minister’s power, influence and position have\nincreased significantly vis-a-vis the cabinet. He has come to play a ‘dominant’ role in the British\nPolitico-administrative system. Hence, the later political analysts, like Crossman, Mackintosh and\nothers have described the British Cabinet Government as ‘Prime Ministerial Government’.\n\nShadow Cabinet It is a unique institution of the British Cabinet system. It is formed by the\nopposition party to balance the ruling cabinet and to prepare its members for future ministerial office.\nIn Britain, the opposition enjoys an official recognition and is as well organized as the government. It\nruns a ‘Parallel’ government with its shadow cabinet. In this shadow cabinet, almost every member in\nthe ruling cabinet is ‘Shadowed’ by a corresponding member in the opposition cabinet. The members\nof the shadow cabinet watch critically the working of the departments assigned to them. They match\nthe cabinet ministers in the parliamentary debates. The shadow cabinet serves as the ‘alternative\ncabinet’ if there is change of government. That is why Ivor Jennings described the leader of\nopposition as the ‘alternative’ Prime Minister. He enjoys the status of a Minister and is paid by the\ngovernment."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Since the revolution, France has changed its constitution on an average after\nevery 12 years. It adopted three monarchic, two dictatorial, three imperial and four republican\nconstitutions. The present French Constitution, which established the Fifth Republic, came into force\nin 1958. It was prepared under the instructions of General de Gaulle. It was designed to give France a\nstrong and stable government.\n\nThe salient features of the Constitution of the Fifth French Republic are:\n\nWritten Constitution Like the American Constitution, the French Constitution is a written\nConstitution. It contains a Preamble and 92 Articles divided into 15 chapters. It declares ‘Liberty,\nEquality and Fraternity’ as the motto of the Fifth Republic. Article 2 of the Constitution states that\n“France is a republic, indivisible, secular, democratic and social.”\n\nArticle 1 deals with the adoption of the Constitution by the Republic and the Overseas Territories\nto set up a community. It is placed under the Preamble itself. The chapters of the Constitution are\nmentioned in Table 22.1.\n\nOE (98 ee French Constitution at a Glance\n\nChapter Number — Chapter Title Articles Covered\nI Sovereignty 2to4\nIl The President of the Republic 5 to 19\nIl The Government 20 to 23\nIV Parliament 24 to 33\nVv Relations between Parliament and Government 34 to 51\nVI Treaties and International Agreements 52 to 55\nVil The Constitutional Council 56 to 63\n\nVill The Judicial Authority 64 to 66\nIx The High Court of Justice 67 to 68\nXx The Economic and Social Council 69 to 71\nXI Territorial Entities 72 to 76\n\nXI The Community 77 to 87\n\nXi Agreements of Association 88\n\nXIV Revision 89\n\nXV Temporary Dispositions 90 to 92\n\nRigid Constitution Unlike the British Constitution, the French Constitution is rigid in nature. It\ncontains a special procedure for amendment. It can be amended by the Parliament by 60 per cent\nmajority vote in both the Houses. Alternatively, the President can call a national referendum on\nconstitutional amendment. However, the republican form of government in France is not subject to\namendment. Thus there is no place for monarchy in France.\n\nUnitary Constitution France is a unitary state. There is no division of powers between the\ncentral and local or provincial governments. All powers are vested in the single supreme Central\nGovernment located at Paris. The local governments are created and abolished by the Central\nGovernment only for administrative convenience. In fact, France is more unitary than Britain.\n\nQuasiPresidential and Quasi-Parliamentary The French Constitution provides neither\npresidential nor parliamentary government. Rather, it combines the elements of both. On one hand, it\nprovides for a powerful President who is directly elected by the people for a five-year term, on the\nother, there is a nominated council of ministers headed by the Prime Minister which is responsible to\nthe Parliament. However, the ministers shall not be the members of the Parliament.\n\nBicameralism The French Parliament comprises the National Assembly (the lower house) and the\nSenate (upper house). The National Assembly has 577 members who are directly elected for a five-\nyear term. The Senate has 321 members who are indirectly elected for a nine-year term. The National\nAssembly is more dominant and powerful than the Senate.\n\nRationalised Parliament The Constitution of France established a rationalised parliament, that\nis, a Parliament with restricted and limited powers. The powers of the French Parliament are\nrestricted vis-a-vis the political executive. It can make laws only on those items which are defined in\nthe Constitution. On all other matters, the government is empowered to legislate by executive decree.\nThe Parliament can also delegate law-making power to the executive branch. These limitations on\nparliamentary authority were imposed to provide for a strong executive.\n\nThe Constitutional Council France has a Constitutional Council. It consists of nine members\nwho are appointed for a term of nine years. It functions as a judicial watchdog and ensures that the\nexecutive decrees and parliamentary laws conform to the provisions of the Constitution. However, it\nis only an advisory body and its opinion is not binding.\n\nRecognition of Political Parties The Constitution of France gives recognition to political\nparties and their role. It is for the first time in France that a Republican Constitution not only mentions\nparties but also acknowledges them as a normal part of political life. Article 4 of the Constitution\n\n\nstates that the “parties must respect the principles of national sovereignty and democracy.”\n\nFrench President\n\nMode of Election Originally, the Constitution provided for an indirect election of the President.\nHe was to be elected by an electoral college consisting of three types of members—{i) national\nrepresentatives (members of two Houses of Parliament); (ii) representatives of the local authorities;\nand (iii) representatives of the overseas territories. But, in 1962, the Constitution was amended\nthrough a referendum.\n\nThe President is now directly elected by universal suffrage. In order to win the election, a\ncandidate has to obtain an absolute majority of the votes cast. In case no candidate obtains the\nrequisite majority in the first ballot, then a second ballot is held. Only the two candidates who have\nreceived the highest number of votes in the first ballot may stand in the second ballot.\n\nTenure and Removal The President is elected for a term of five years. He is eligible for re-\nelection, as many times as he may like. Moreover, the Constitution has not prescribed any\nqualifications (including the minimum age limit) for the presidential office.\n\nIf the presidency falls vacant, the functions of the president (except submitting a bill to a\nreferendum and dissolution of the National Assembly) are performed temporarily by the president of\nthe Senate and if he is also not in a position, the functions are performed by the government.\n\nThe President can be removed from the office before the expiry of his normal tenure of five years\nthrough an impeachment for high treason. The impeachment resolution should be passed by both the\nHouses of Parliament by an absolute majority. After this indictment by the Parliament, the president is\ntried by the High Court of Justice.\n\nPowers and Functions The president is the pivot of the Constitution and occupies a dominant\nposition in the system of government. He is the real head of the state, the leader of the nation and the\nsymbol of national unity. His powers and functions are as follows:\n\n1. He appoints the prime minister and accepts his resignation.\n\n2. He appoints and dismisses the other members of the government (Council of Ministers) on the\n\nadvice of the prime minister.\n\n3. He presides over the meetings of Council of Ministers. This provides hima direct opportunity\nto influence, guide, direct and control the policies of the government.\n\nHe makes appointments to civil and military posts of the state.\n\nHe is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces of the country.\n\nHe negotiates and ratifies treaties; and sends and receives diplomats.\n\nHe is kept informed of all the negotiations leading to the conclusion of an international\n\nagreement not subject to ratification.\n\n8. He presides over the higher councils and committees of national defence.\n9. He presides over and represents the French community.\n\n10. He appoints the president and three members of the Constitutional Council.\n\n11. He promulgates the laws within 15 days following their final adoption by the Parliament and\ntransmission to the government. However, before the end of this period, he can ask the\nParliament to reconsider a law. This reconsideration cannot be refused by the Parliament.\n\n12. He can send messages to the Parliament and summon its special sessions.\n\nNAW,\n\n\n13.\n\n14.\n16.\n\n17.\n18.\n\n19.\n\nHe can submit to a referendum any government bill on the proposal of the government during\nthe parliamentary sessions or on the joint proposal of the two Houses of the Parliament. If the\nbill is approved in the referendum, the President should promulgate it within 15 days.\n\nHe signs the ordinances and decrees that have been considered by the Council of Ministers.\nHe has the right to pardon.\n\nHe presides over the Higher Council of the judiciary. He also appoints nine members to it.\n\nHe is the protector of the independence of the judicial authority.\n\nHe is vested with special powers to deal with emergencies. During this period, he can take\nthe required measures after consulting the Prime Minister, the presidents of the two\nAssemblies (Houses) of the Parliament and the Constitutional Council.\n\nHe can dissolve the National Assembly, after consulting the Prime Minister and the Presidents\nof the two Assemblies (Houses of the Parliament). The Constitution, however, imposes two\nlimitations: (i) He cannot dissolve the National Assembly more than once in twelve months;\nand (ii) the National Assembly cannot be dissolved during an emergency. Notably, the\npresident is not required to follow the advice of the prime minister and the presidents of the\ntwo Assemblies. Further, the president can refuse dissolution when asked by the Prime\nMinister."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The Meiji\nConstitution remained in force for 58 years (i.e., from 1889 to 1947). This Constitution was based on\nthe ideals of autocracy, authoritarianism, and monarchy.\n\nAfter the Second World War (1939-45), Japan was placed under Allied Occupation from 1945 to\n1952. The U.S. General Douglas MacArthur was the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in\nJapan. Under his direction, Japan adopted a new democratic constitution in 1946. This Constitution is\nbased on the ideals of democracy and peace, as conceived by the Occupation Authorities.\n\nThe new and the present Constitution of Japan became operative in 1947. It came to be known both\nas the MacArthur constitution as well as the Showa Constitution. Showa is the title of the reign of\nEmperor Hirohito and means ‘Radiant Peace.’ At the time of adoption of the new Constitution,\nHirohito was the Emperor and Shidehara was the Prime Minister of Japan.\n\nThe salient features of the present Constitution of Japan are as follows:\n\nA Written Constitution Like the American Constitution, the Japanese Constitution is a written\nConstitution. It contains a Preamble and 103 Articles divided into 11 chapters. It is a unique blend of\nthe American and the British system. The Preamble emphasises the principle of the sovereignty of the\npeople. The chapters of the Constitution are mentioned below in Table 22.2.\n\nSE (442s Japanese Constitution at a Glance\n\nChapter Number _ Chapter Title Articles Covered\nI The Emperor 1to8\nI Renunciation of War 9\n\nIl centers and Duties of the People 10 to 40\n\nIV The Diet 41 to 64\n\nv The Cabinet 65 to 75\nVI Judiciary 76 to 82\nVII Finance 83 to 91\nVill Local Self-government 92 to 95\n\nIX Amendments 96\n\nx Supreme Law 97 to 99\n\nXI Supplementary Provisions 100 to 103\n\nRigid Constitution Like the American Constitution, the Japanese Constitution is a rigid one. It\n\ncannot be amended by the Diet (Japanese Parliament) in the same manner as the ordinary laws are\n\nmade. It can be amended only by means of a special process provided by the Constitution for that\n\npurpose. Hence, in Japan, there exists a distinction between a constitutional law and an ordinary law.\nThe Japanese Constitution lays down the following procedure for its amendment:\n\n(i) The amendment shall be initiated by the Diet. Such a proposal must be passed by a majority of\ntwo-thirds of its membership.\n(ii) After that, it is submitted to the people for ratification at a special referendum or a specific\nelection. It must be approved by the majority of the people.\n(iii) Amendment when so ratified shall immediately be promulgated by the Emperor in the name of\nthe people, as an integral part of the Constitution.\n\nIt must be mentioned here that the Japanese Constitution has not so far been amended even once.\nThus, the Constitution reads today as it did in 1947.\n\nUnitary Constitution Like the British Constitution, the Japanese constitution provides for a\nunitary state. There is no division of powers between the Central and provincial governments. All\npowers are vested in the single supreme Central Government located at Tokyo. The provinces derive\ntheir authority from the Central Government. The Diet can expand or diminish the authority and\njurisdiction of the provinces. Thus the provinces are subordinate units of government and enjoy only\nthose powers which are delegated to them by the supreme Central Government.\n\nParliamentary Government Japan has shown a preference for the British Parliamentary\nSystem rather than the American Presidential System of Government. The features of the Japanese\nParliamentary system of government are as follows:\n\n(i) The Emperor is the nominal executive while the Cabinet is the real executive. The cabinet\nconsists of the Prime Minister as its head and twenty Ministers of State. The Emperor is the\nhead of the state while the Prime Minister is head of the government.\n\n(ii) The party which secures majority seats in the House of Representatives forms the government.\nThe leader of the majority party or majority coalition invariably becomes the Prime Minister.\n\n(iii) The Prime Minister is designated from among the members of the Diet by a resolution of the\nDiet. The Emperor appoints the Prime Minister as designated by the Diet.\n\n(iv) The Prime Minister appoints the Ministers of State. But, a majority of them should be chosen\nfrom among the members of the Diet.\n\n(v) The Prime Minister can remove the Ministers of state as he chooses.\n\n(vi) The Cabinet, in the exercise of the executive power, is collectively responsible to the Diet. It\n\nmust resign when the House of Representatives passes a no-confidence resolution.\n(vii) The Emperor can dissolve the House of Representatives on the advice of the Prime Minister.\n\nAn analysis of the above points makes it clear that Japan (though adopted the British Parliamentary\npattern) differed from Britain in the following four respects:\n\n(i) In Britain, the Prime Minister is chosen as well as appointed by the King/Queen, while in\n\nJapan, the Prime Minister is chosen by the Diet but appointed by the Emperor.\n\n(ii) In Britain, the Ministers are appointed by the King/Queen, while in Japan, the Ministers are\nappointed by the Prime Minister.\n\n(iii) In Britain, the Prime Minister cannot remove the Ministers, while in Japan, the Prime Minister\ncan remove the Ministers at his will.\n\n(iv) In Britain, all the Ministers must be members of the Parliament, while in Japan, only a\nmajority of the Ministers must be members of the Diet.\n\nConstitutional Monarchy Japan is a monarchical state. It is described as a limited hereditary\nmonarchy. The constitution, though it preserves the institution of the Emperor, it deprives him of all\npowers, privileges and prerogatives he formerly exercised and enjoyed. It makes the following\nprovisions with regard to the institution of the Emperor:\n\n(i) The Emperor is the symbol of the state and of the unity of the people. He derives his position\nfrom the will of the people with whom resides sovereign power. Thus, the sovereignity of the\nEmperor is absolished.\n\n(ii) The Imperial Throne is dynastic and succeeded to in accordance with the law passed by the\nDiet.\n\n(iii) The advice and approval of the Cabinet is required for all acts of the Emperor.\n(iv) The Emperor performs only those acts which are enumerated in the constitution and he has no\npowers related to government.\n(v) The Emperor can neither give nor receive imperial property without the authorisation of the\nDiet.\nThus, the Constitution has made the Emperor merely a constitutional head. His authority is strictly\nlimited to ceremonial functions of a constitutional monarch. Like his British counterpart, he only\nreigns and does not rule.\n\nSupremacy of Constitution and Judicial Review The Japanese Constitution establishes\nthe principle of supremacy of Constitution. The Constitution is regarded as the supreme (highest or\nfundamental) law of the land. The laws, ordinances, imperial rescript and official acts must conform\nto this supreme law. If these are against the provisions of the Constitution, they can be declared by the\nSupreme Court as ultra-vires and hence, null and void.\n\nThus, the American principle of judicial review is adopted in Japan. But there is a difference. The\nAmerican Supreme Court does not derive its power of judicial review from the Constitution, whereas\nthe Japanese Supreme Court derives its power of judicial review directly from the Constitution.\nArticle 81 of the Japanese Constitution specifically says that the Supreme Court is the court of last\nresort with power to determine the constitutionality of any law, order, regulation, or official Act.\n\nFundamental Rights The Japanese Constitution provides for rights on the model of the Bill of\nRights in the USA. It guarantees a large number of civil, political and economic rights to the people of\n\n\nJapan and declares them as ‘eternal and inviolate’. The judiciary headed by the Supreme Court acts\nas the protector of these rights through its power of judicial review.\nThe rights provided by the Japanese Constitution are more elaborate and definite than the American\nBill of Rights. Out of a total of 103 Articles in the Constitution, 31 Articles (i-e., 10 to 40) are\ndevoted to the rights and duties of the people. The rights provided for in the Constitution are:\n\n(i) Right to equality.\n(ii) Right to freedom.\n(iii) Right to freedom of religion.\n(iv) Right to private property.\n(v) Economic rights.\n(vi) Right to education.\n(vii) Cultural rights.\n(viii) Right to constitutional remedies.\n\nRenunciation of War The Japanese Constitution renounces war as a sovereign right of the\nnation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes. It prohibits Japan from\nmaintaining land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential. It also does not recognise the\nright of belligerency of the state.\n\nJapan is the only modern state which has constitutionally renounced war forever. It is the most\npeculiar as well as the most controversial feature of the Japanese Constitution. This provision was\ngot inserted into the Constitution by General MacArthur to see that Japan would never again be\nallowed to act as a military nation as it did during the period of 1931 to 1945 and to abolish forever\nthe power of Japan as a rival to the US in the far east. However, it does not mean that Japan cannot\nuse arms and other forces for its security and defence. Like any other modern state, Japan has its\ndefence capabilities but the term used is ‘self-defence forces’ to look constitutionally correct. They\nare justified on the ground that every state has an inherent right to defend itself against foreign\naggression.\n\nBicameralism The Japanese Diet is bicameral, that is, it consists of two houses namely the House\nof Councillors (upper house) and the House of Representatives (lower house). The House of\nCouncillors consists of 252 members elected for a term of six years. Out of the total 252 members,\n152 are elected on a geographical basis (local constituencies) and the remaining 100 are elected by\nthe nation at large (national constituency). The House of Representatives consists of 512 members\nelected for a term of four years. The House of Representatives has more powers than the House of\nCouncillors, especially in financial matters.\n\nConstitutionally, the Diet is the highest organ of state power and is the sole law-making organ of\n\nthe state."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Lenin. After being a Super Power for\nmore than 70 years, the USSR finally collapsed and disintegrated in 1989-1991 mainly due to\n\neconomic crisis. Mikhail Gorbachev’s popular reforms called ‘Glasnost’ (Openness) and\n‘Perestroika’ (Restructuring) could not save the USSR. In December 1991, the constituent units of the\nUSSR formed a Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The CIS is an alliance of fully\nindependent states but not a state in itself. It declared itself, in some aspects of international affairs\nand law, the successor to the erstwhile USSR.\n\nThe Russian Revolution of October 1917 created, for the first time ever a socialist state whose\ngoal was Communism. Hence, the Soviet Constitution was the first socialist constitution of the world.\nSince its formation in 1917, the USSR adopted four Constitutions, that is, in 1918, 1924, 1936 (Stalin\nConstitution) and 1977 (Brezhnev Constitution).\n\nThe constitutional system of the USSR was based on the principles and ideologies of Marxism—\nLeninism. Thus, the Communist Party dominated the entire political and administrative system of the\nUSSR. As Ferrel Heady said, the system aimed “at monolithic unity under the aegis of the Communist\nParty.” It was in this respect that the politico-administrative system of the USSR was different from\nthat of the UK, USA and France. As Ferrel Heady puts it, the USSR was “a ‘Totalitarian directed\nsociety’, with the state bureaucracy basically subservient to the Communist Party.”\n\nThe salient features of the Soviet Constitution of 1977 are explained below.\n\nA Written Constitution Like American and French Constitutions, the Soviet Constitution of\n1977 was also a written one. It was drafted by a committee headed by Mr. Brezhnev. It had 20\nchapters and 174 articles divided into 9 parts.\n\nA Rigid Constitution The Soviet Constitution of 1977 was rigid in nature. It provided for a\nspecial procedure for its amendment. It could be amended by the legislature of the USSR (Supreme\nSoviet) by a two-third majority in each House.\n\nA Socialist Constitution The Constitution was socialistic in nature and laid down the foundation\nof a socialist state. It stated that “the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is a socialist state of the\nwhole people, expressing the will and interests of the workers, peasants and intelligentsia, the\nworking people of all the nations and nationalities of the country.” It further stated that “all powers in\nthe USSR belongs to the people who shall exercise the state power through Soviets of People’s\nDeputies, which constitute the political foundation of the USSR.” It also stated that “the foundation of\nthe economic system of the USSR is socialist ownership of the means of production in the form of\nstate property (belonging to all the people) and collective farm and cooperative property.”\n\nA Federal Constitution The 1977 Constitution provided for a federal state consisting of 15\nunits called Union Republics. These units of the Soviet Federation were Russia, Ukraine,\nByelorussia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Lithuania, Moldavia, Latvia, Kyrgyzstan,\nTajikistan, Armenia, Turkmenistan and Estonia. The powers were divided between the Centre and the\nunits. The powers of the Centre were enumerated while the residuary powers were given to the units\nas in the case of the USA. These 15 Union Republics had their own separate Constitutions conforming\nto the Constitution of the USSR and enjoyed the right to secede from the USSR.\n\nWithin several union republics existed autonomous republics (20), autonomous regions (8) and\nautonomous areas (10). They were vested with a certain amount of autonomy. Hence, the union\nrepublics were called as sub-federations within the Soviet Federation and the USSR was called a\n“Federation of Federations’.\n\n\nParliamentary Government The Constitution provided for a parliamentary form of\ngovernment in the USSR. The council of ministers was elected by the Supreme Soviet (legislature of\nthe USSR) and remained responsible to it for its policies and acts. The Supreme Soviet could also\nremove the ministers from their offices. The Constitution stated that “the council of ministers headed\nby the Premier is the highest executive and administrative authority of the USSR.”\n\nBicameralism The 1977 Constitution provided for a bicameral legislature for the USSR. Thus, the\nSupreme Soviet consisted of the Soviet of the Union (lower house) and the Soviet of the Nationalities\n(upper house). Both the houses had equal number of members (i.e. 750 in each) elected directly every\nfive years. The lower House represented the nation as a whole while the upper House represented the\nunits of the Soviet Federation. The two Houses had equal and coordinate powers in all policy\nmatters.\n\nPresidium The Supreme Soviet, constitutionally the highest body of state authority of the USSR,\nelected a governing body known as the Presidium. The Constitution termed it as the Standing\nCommittee of the Supreme Soviet. It was a 39-member body consisting of a Chairman, First Vice-\nChairman, 15 Vice Chairmen (i.e. the heads of the 15 Union Republics), a Secretary and 21 members.\nThe Chairman (President) of the Presidium was the formal head of the State of the USSR. It\nfunctioned as a collective presidency of the USSR. Hence it was called as the ‘Collegial Executive’\nor the ‘Plural Executive’ or the ‘Collegiate President’ of the USSR. It combined executive,\nlegislative, diplomatic, military and judicial functions. Because of its multifarious functions and the\nplural character, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR has been described as the ‘20th\nCentury Innovation.’ This type of institution was not provided by any other constitution of the world.\n\nA One-Party Dictatorship The most important feature of the constitutional system of the USSR\nwas the monopoly of the political power enjoyed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union\n(CPSU). It played the most dominant role in the politico-administrative system of the USSR. It was\nthe ‘Supreme maker of policies,’ whether political, economic, social, cultural or foreign. Article 6 of\nthe Soviet Constitution of 1977 stated, “the leading and guiding force of Soviet Society and the\nnucleus of its political system, of all state organisations and public organisations is the Communist\nParty of the Soviet Union. The CPSU exists for the people and serves the people. The Communist\nParty, armed with Marxism-Leninism, determines the general perspectives of the development of\nsociety and the course of home and foreign policy of the USSR, directs the great constructive work of\nthe Soviet people and imparts a planned, systematic and theoretically substantiated character to their\nstruggle for the victory of communism.” As Ferrel Heady says “the constitutional structure of the\nSoviet Union has always been an elaborate facade behind which ‘one-party rule and totalitarianism’\nhave occupied the political scéne.... From the top to the bottom of the Soviet structure the party plays\na more important role than the corresponding state organs.”\n\nDemocratic Centralism Another salient feature of the Constitution of 1977 was the principle of\ndemocratic centralism. Article 3 of the Constitution stated that “the Soviet state is organised and\nfunctions on the principle of democratic centralism, namely, the electiveness of all bodies of state\nauthority from the lowest to the highest, their accountability to the people and the obligation of lower\nbodies to observe the decisions of higher ones. Democratic centralism combines central leadership\nwith local initiative and creative activity and with the responsibility of each state body and official\nfor the work entrusted to them.” This principle was applicable to governmental organisation;\n\n\nhierarchy of the Soviets and the Communist Party organisation. Vyshinsky says that “the Soviet Union\nstate is built on the principle of democratic centralism sharply opposed to the bureaucratic centralism\n\nof the capitalist states.”\n\nFundamental Rights The Constitution also provided for a large number of economic, social,\npersonal, cultural and political rights to the citizens of the USSR. Ogg and Zinc termed them as “one\nof the most extraordinary Bill of Rights known to history.” These rights were guaranteed to all the\ncitizens of the country equally irrespective of nationality, race, sex, and so on. The form of the rights\ngranted to the citizens was socialist, not personal, that is, they were meant for the establishment of a\nsocialist system in the USSR. Thus, the enjoyment of these rights by the citizens was not to detriment\nthe interests of society or state or the rights of other citizens.\nThe list of fundamental rights provided by the Soviet Constitution of 1977 are:\n(i) Right to work.\n(ii) Right to rest and leisure.\n(iii) Right to health protection.\n(iv) Right to maintenance in old age, sickness and disability.\n(v) Right to housing.\n(vi) Right to education.\n(vii) Right to enjoy cultural benefits.\n(viii) Freedom of scientific, technical and artistic work.\n(ix) Right to take part in the management and administration of state and public affairs.\n(x) Right to submit proposals to the state bodies and public and social organisations.\n(xi) Freedom of speech, press, assembly, meetings, street processions and demonstrations.\n(xii) Right to associate in public and social organisations.\n(xiii) Freedom of conscience.\n(xiv) Right to seek family protection.\n(xv) Right to inviolability of person and house.\n(xvi) Right of privacy of citizens.\n(xvii) Right to protection by the court.\n‘xviii) Right to appeal against the actions of the officials, state bodies and public bodies.\n\nFundamental Duties Apart from the fundamental rights, the Constitution also provided for\nfundamental duties. The Constitution stated that the exercise of these rights and freedoms by the\ncitizens was inseparable from the performance of these duties and obligations. The following is the\nlist of the fundamental duties contained in the Brezhnev Constitution of 1977.\n(i) To observe the Constitution of the USSR and Soviet laws.\n(ii) To observe labour discipline.\n(iii) To preserve and protect the socialist property.\n(iv) To safeguard the interests of the Soviet state.\n(v) To defend the socialist motherland.\n(vi) To render military service.\n\n\n(vii) To respect the national dignity of other citizens.\n\n(viii) To respect the rights and lawful interests of other persons.\n(ix) To protect nature and conserve its richness.\n(x) To preserve historical monuments and other cultural values.\n(xi) To promote and strengthen world peace."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The President is to appoint other Federal Ministers on the advice of the Prime\nMinister. He can also dismiss the Prime Minister or any other Federal Minister.\n\nIt provides for a 19-member constitutional court. Its function is to decide the constitutionality\nof the Presidential decrees, government orders and laws of the Federal Assembly.\n\nIt authorises the Russian legislature (Federal Assembly) to remove the President by way of\nimpeachment, on the charge of high treason or grave crime.

Strengthening Financial Management Systems (2009)\n\n. State and District Administration (2009)\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMMISSION\n\nI. On Right to Information\n\n1.\n\nThe Commission has recommended that the Official Secrets Act, 1923, be repealed saying it\nis incongruous with the regime of transparency in a democratic society. It stated that the\nsafeguards for state security should be incorporated in the National Security Act.\n\n. Total reorganisation of public records for effective implementation of the Right to Information\n\n(RTD) Act. An office should be set up in each state as a repository of expertise, to monitor all\nrecords. One per cent of the funds for all flagship government programmes should be\nearmarked for five years for updating records and building infrastructure.\n\n. Atleast half the members of the Information Commission (IC) should be drawn from a non-\n\ncivil service background. Thus, the members will represent variety and experience in society.\n\n. The IC should be entrusted with monitoring implementation of the RTI Act in all public\n\nauthorities. For this purpose, clear guidelines should be evolved to determine which non-\ngovernment organisations came under the Act.\n\n. Most requests for information are for redressal of grievances. The states may be advised to\n\nestablish independent public authorities to deal with complaints of delay, harassment and\ncorruption.\n\n. Aroadmap should be chalked out for effective implementation of the Right to Information Act\n\nin the legislature and the judiciary at all levels.\n\n. Files and notings per se are not confidential and should not be inaccessible to the public\n\n\n10.\n\nunless exempted under the Right to Information Act.\n\n. Para 118(1) of the Manual of Office Procedure should be deleted as it is totally violative of\n\nthe RTI Act. The rulebook currently deems file notings to be confidential for the eyes of those\nwithin the secretariat.\n\n. The provisions regarding unauthorised communication of official information and confidential\n\ncharacter of notes/files will have to be amended.\n\nEvery government servant should make available to the public or any organisation full and\naccurate information which can be disclosed under the RTI Act.\n\nI. On Public Order\n\n1.\n\n10.\n\nThe Commission has recommended repeal of the controversial Armed Forces Special Powers\nAct (AFSPA), 1958, stating that its scrapping would remove the feeling of discrimination and\nalienation among the people of the northeastern States. To provide for an enabling legislation\nfor deployment of armed forces of the Union in the NE States, the Unlawful Activities\n(Prevention) Act, 1967, should be amended by inserting a new chapter.\n\n. It favoured a new doctrine of policing and criminal justice embedded in an inclusive\n\napproach to governance.\n\n. On another controversial issue of deployment of Central forces in States, the Commission\n\nrecommended enactment of a law to empower the Union Government to deploy its forces and\nto even give them directions in case of major public order problems which may lead to a\nbreakdown of the constitutional machinery in a State. However, such deployment should take\nplace only after the State concerned fails to act on a direction issued by the Union under\nArticle 256. All such deployments should be only for a temporary period not exceeding three\nmonths which could be extended by another three months after authorisation by Parliament.\n\n. Favouring separation of crime investigation from other police functions, the Commission\n\nrecommended that a Crime Investigation Agency be constituted in each State. A State Police\nPerformance and Accountability Commission should be constituted to provide the required\nautonomy to the police.\n\n. The tenure of the Chief of the Law and Order Police as well as the Chief of the Crime\n\nInvestigation Agency should be at least three years.\n\n. On representation of women and under represented sections of society in the police, it said\n\nthat affirmative actions should take care of this aspect but favoured 33 per cent representation\nof women in the police force.\n\n. Organisations and persons found guilty of instigating violence should be liable to pay\n\nexemplary damages. The damages should be commensurate with the loss caused by such\nviolence.\n\n. All public agencies should adopt a zero tolerance strategy towards crime to create a climate\n\nof compliance of laws leading to maintenance of public order.\n\n. Dwelling on reforms in the criminal justice system, it favoured a system of introduction of\n\nlocal courts, preferably one court for a population of 25,000 in rural areas.\nThe Commission recommended bringing investigation of certain crimes with inter-state and\nnational ramifications directly under the jurisdiction of CBI. These offences include terrorism,\n\n11.\n\norganised crimes, acts threatening national security, sedition, arms and human trafficking,\nassassination of major public figures and serious economic offences.\n\nNo sanction of the Centre or State should be necessary for prosecution under Section 153(A).\nSection 196 of Cr. PC should be amended accordingly.\n\nIl. On Ethics in Governance\n\n1.\n\nThe Commission has called for providing in the Constitution a national ombudsman, Rashtriya\nLokayukta, which will cover all the union ministers and chief ministers, MPs and others but\nwill not cover the PM’s office.\n\n. In the electoral and political spheres, it suggested partial state funding of elections, tightening\n\nof anti-defection law, a collegium for appointment of Chief Election Commissioner and other\nCommissioners, code of ethics for ministers and a law to define “office of profit”.\n\n. It recommended abolition of schemes under which MPs and MLAs are allocated funds for\n\ntheir local area development.\n\n. It proposed the establishment of National Judicial Council that will decide on appointment of\n\njudges by a collegium consisting of representatives from executive, legislature and judiciary.\n\n. It suggested a collegium headed by the PM and comprising of the Lok Sabha Speaker and the\n\nOpposition leader, among others, for appointment of the CEC and ECs.\n\nIV. On Local Governance\n\n1.\n\n2.\n\nThe commission has recommended promotion of local democracy, which is much more than\ndecentralisation and which seeks to build up local bodies as self-governing institutions.\n\nIt recommended that the government place before Parliament a framework law for local\nbodies on the lines of the South African Act for laying down the broad principles of\ndevolution of power, responsibilities and functions to the local bodies.\n\n. At the district level, a third tier of democratic government is proposed to replace the present\n\nsystem, which is a colonial legacy. In its place a district council, representing both urban and\nrural areas, should be constituted and the District Collector should work as the chief secretary\nof the council while reporting to the state government for regulatory functions. This will\nensure convergence of planning and developmental activities for rural and urban areas.\n\n. Parliament to make provision for constitution of a legislative council in each state. It would\n\ncomprise members elected by the local bodies in order to strengthen the voice of local\nbodies.\n\n. To reform the electoral process, the task of delimitation and reservation of constituencies\n\nshould be entrusted to the State Election Commission.\n\n. To strengthen local bodies’ finances, it recommended that a State Finance Commission be\n\nconstituted in such a manner that it can take into account the recommendations of Central\nFinance Commission.\n\n. It recommended that local bodies take total responsibility for the functions entrusted to them\n\nunder the Constitution and bodies such as electricity boards and water authorities made\nresponsible to them. For ensuring accountability and transparency in the functioning of local\n\n10.\n\nbodies, it was suggested that a local body ombudsman be constituted to look into complaints\nof corruption and maladministration.\n\n. To suggest steps to deal with rapid urbanisation, it recommended the setting up of a national\n\ncommission of urbanisation. It also favoured direct election of Mayors by popular mandate.\n\n. It recommended abolition of octroi and suggested that the government evolve mechanisms to\n\ncompensate local governments for revenue loss.\n\nTo tackle the problem of urban transport, particularly in larger cities, it suggested that a\nunified metropolitan transport authority be set up in all one-million plus population cities for\ncoordinated planning.\n\nV. On Combating Terrorism\n\n1.\n\n2.\n\nThe Commission favoured enactment of a comprehensive and effective legal framework to\ndeal with all aspects of terror and a federal agency to investigate terrorist offences.\n\nIt said that dealing with terrorism would require a multi-pronged, comprehensive strategy in\nwhich different stakeholders—the government, political parties, security agencies, civil\nsociety and media—would have an important role to play.\n\n. Favouring a separate, comprehensive law to deal with terrorism, it said though after the\n\nrepeal of POTA a number of provisions had been incorporated in the Unlawful Activities\nPrevention Act, the legal provisions to deal with terrorism could be incorporated in a\nseparate chapter in the National Security Act, 1980. It said a strong anti-terror law with\nequally strong safeguards to prevent its misuse is needed.\n\n. To choke funds of terrorists, it recommended that a specialised cell be created in the\n\nproposed National Counter-terrorism Centre for taking concerted action on the financial leads\ngathered by various sources.\n\n. It favoured video recording of statements made as confessions before the police. For this,\n\nnecessary amendments in the Indian Evidence Act should be made.\n\nVI. On Refurbishing of Personnel Administration\n\n1,\n\nThe Government of India should establish National Institutes of Public Administration to run\nBachelor’s Degree courses in public administration/governance/management. The selected\nuniversities should also be assisted to offer such graduate level programmes in public\nadministration/governance/public management. These graduates from the National Institutes of\nPublic Administration and selected universities would be eligible for appearing in the Civil\nServices Examination. Further, other graduates would also be eligible to appear in the Civil\nServices Examination provided they complete a ‘Bridge Course’ in the core subjects. The\nBridge Course should be run by the same national institutes/universities.\n\n. The permissible age for appearing in the Civil Services Examination should be 21 to 25 years\n\nfor general candidates, 21 to 28 years for candidates from OBC and 21 to 29 years for\ncandidates from SC/ST as also for those who are physically challenged.\n\n. The number of permissible attempts in the Civil Services Examination should be 3, 5, 6 and 6\n\nrespectively for general candidates, candidates from OBC, candidates from SC/ST and\n\n\nphysically challenged candidates respectively.\n\n. The Preliminary Examination should consist of an objective type test having one or two\n\npapers on general studies including the Constitution of India, the Indian legal system, Indian\neconomy, polity, history and culture. There should be no optional subjects.\n\n. The Main Examination should consist of two papers only in the compulsory subjects. These\n\ncompulsory subjects may include Constitution of India, Indian legal system, Indian economy,\npolity, history and culture etc. The question papers should be of the conventional descriptive\ntype. Besides, there should be a separate essay paper as a part of the Main Examination.\n\n. The induction of officers of the State Civil Services into the IAS should be done by the UPSC\n\non the basis of a common examination.\n\n. Every government servant should undergo a mandatory training at the induction stage and also\n\nperiodically during his/her career. Successful completion of these training programmes should\nbe a minimum necessary condition for confirmation in service and subsequent promotions.\nMandatory induction training programmes should be prescribed for Group D staff also before\nthey are assigned postings.\n\n. A national institute of good governance may be set up by upgrading one of the existing\n\nnational/state institutes. This institute would identify, document, and disseminate best\npractices and also conduct training programmes.\n\n. For making appraisal more consultative and transparent, the performance appraisal systems\n\nfor all Services should be modified on the lines of the recently introduced Performance\nAppraisal Rules (PAR) for the All India Services.\n\n. The Government should expand the scope of the present performance appraisal system of its\n\nemployees to a comprehensive performance management system (PMS).\n\n. Annual performance agreements should be signed between the departmental minister and the\n\nSecretary of the ministry/heads of departments, providing physical and verifiable details of\nthe work to be done during a financial year. The actual performance should be assessed by a\nthird party.\n\n. For a transparent system of appointments in the government, covering all ranks, the\n\nCommission has suggested the setting up of a Central Civil Services Authority. The Authority\nshould be a five-member body with the Chairperson appointed by the President on the\nrecommendations of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition to make it totally\napolitical.\n\n. The Commission is of the view that in order to avoid any conflict of interest, government\n\nofficials should not be allowed to go on deputation to private commercial organizations.\n\n. In order to increase accountability, the Commission suggested a periodic review of the\n\nperformance for which it recommended a system of two intensive reviews — one on\ncompletion of 14 years of service and the other on completion of 20 years. The first review\nwill primarily serve the purpose of intimating individual about his/her performance and the\nsecond is mainly to assess the fitness of the officer for his/her future continuation in service.\nThe employees found unfit after 20 years should be dispensed with."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Translate the following text into Hindi accurately, preserving the original meaning and context."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The Committee on Civil Service Reforms was constituted by the Government of India (Cabinet\nSecretariat) in February 2004 under the Chairmanship of P.C. Hota, former UPSC Chairman and\nformer Union Personnel Secretary. Its mandate was to examine the whole gamut of civil service\nreforms covering the All India Services and the organised Group ‘A’ Central Services. It submitted\nits report in July 2004.\n\nTERMS OF REFERENCE OF THE COMMITTEE\n\nThe Committee was asked to give specific recommendations on the following:\n\n1. Making the Civil Service (i) responsive and citizen-friendly; (ii) transparent; (iii)\naccountable; and (iv) ethical, in its (a) actions and (b) interface with the people.\n\n2. Making the Civil Service e-governance friendly.\n\n3. Putting a premium on intellectual growth of civil servants and on upgrading their domain\nknowledge.\n\n4. Protecting the Civil Service against wrongful pressure exerted by (a) administrative\nsuperiors; (b) political executive; (c) business interests; and (d) other vested interests.\n\n5. Changes, if any necessary, in the various All India Services Rules and Central Civil Service\nRules to provide a statutory cover to the proposed civil service reforms.\n\n6. Changes in rules governing the disciplinary proceedings against civil servants to decentralize\nthe process as far as practicable, and to make the disposal of such proceedings time-bound.\n\n7. Any other matter that the Committee may consider relevant to the subject of civil service\nreforms.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMMITTEE\n\nTo ensure good governance inter alia, civil servants be appointed to posts on the basis of objective\ncriteria, be assured of minimum tenures and be held accountable for performance. If civil servants are\ngiven tenures and targets and the political executive respects neutrality, integrity and hierarchy of the\nservice, the civil service can be expected to play its proper role in our parliamentary democracy.\n\nI. On Making the Civil Service Responsive, Transparent,\n\n\nAccountable and Ethical_\n\n1.\n\nTo mould young entrants for the higher civil service through training, government may go\nback to the period from 1948 till 1971 when the age of eligibility was 21—24 years for\ngeneral candidates (as against 21-30 years for general candidates at present) with five\nyears age concession for members of the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes. Age\nconcession for candidates of the Other Backward Classes may be three years as at present.\n\n. As no competitive examination will be proof against selection of a few unsuitable\n\ncandidates, Directors of Training Academies may invoke the Probation Rules to weed out\nunsuitable officer-trainees.\n\n. Officers must have Annual Performance Plans. Invariably an Annual Performance Plan will\n\nbe a component of the Action Plan/Vision Statement of the Department/Ministry and its\nstrategic long-term plan. Wherever possible, performance targets must be quantified. If it is\nnot possible to quantify the targets, some other mode of target setting be done to ensure that\nan officer is held strictly accountable for performance.\n\n. After 15 years of service, a rigorous review be carried out of performance of civil servants\n\nbased on the earlier guinquennial review of performance. If an officer is not honest and\nperformance-oriented, he be weeded out of service on completion of 15 years on\nproportionate pension. An officer should also have the option to retire on proportionate\npension after 15 years of service. A similar review be carried out subsequently at periodic\nintervals to determine if performance level of an officer has fallen sharply/if there are\nallegations against an officer’s integrity.\n\n. Each Department/Ministry should be required to identify the points of citizen interface,\n\nbenchmark the quality of services and strengthen the existing grievance redressal\nmechanism.\n\n. Officers of the higher Civil Service must supervise work of junior functionaries by regular\n\nvisits and inspections. All officers of the higher Civil Service must put on the website/print\nmedia their contact telephone numbers during office hours. Every Ministry/Department/\nOffice having large public interface must have a few toll free telephone numbers with voice\nmail facility.\n\n. Junior officers at the cutting edge level of administration should be given training in\n\ncustomer service, attending to phone calls and resolving public grievances.\n\n. Rules under the Freedom of Information Act 2002 be notified immediately. The\n\nimplementation of the Act be reviewed after three/four years by an independent Task Force.\n\n. The Official Secrets Act be modified to cover only the essential minimum requirements of\n\nnational security, public order and individual privacy.\n\n. All officers having a public interface to wear name badges while on duty.\n. The duties, functions and responsibilities of all senior posts be laid down and publicized.\n. After every five to seven years in service, a civil servant should spend at least two months\n\nwith a non-government organisation, academic institution or the private sector.\n\n. ISO 9000 be introduced for government offices.\n. A full time officer should be posted in the Information and Facilitation Centre and each\n\ndepartment should attend to public grievances.\n\n\n15.\n16.\n\n17.\n\n20.\n\n21.\n\n22.\n\n23.\n\nAnnual Property Return of all public servants be put on the website.\n\nRules be framed under the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act 1988 for\nattachment/forefeiture of benami/ill-gotten property of corrupt public servants.\n\nArticle 311 of the Constitution be amended to enable President/Governor to\ndismiss/remove public servants summarily in case of corrupt practice/having assets\ndisproportionate to known source of income. The officer concerned may be given post-\ndecisional hearing to prove his innocence. To ensure natural justice, such post-decisional\nhearing has been held to be constitutionally valid by the Supreme Court of India.\n\n. Under the overall control of the Central Vigilance Commission, committees of experts be\n\nset up in various departments to scrutinise cases of officers before initiating departmental\naction for corrupt practices/launching prosecution against them under the Prevention of\nCorruption Act 1988. Such a reform will encourage honest officers to take bold\ncommercial decisions in the public interest without the lurking fear of a vigilance/CBI\n\ninquiry.\n\n. Section 13 (1) (d) (iii) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1988 be amended so that civil\n\nservants are not incriminated for taking bona fide commercial decisions in the public\ninterest.\n\nEvery programme of government should specify the deliverables in terms of services.\nFunctioning of government offices having large interface with the common man should be\nassessed once in three/four years by independent organisations.\n\nCitizen Centres should be set up to build capability for analysing and suggesting changes in\ngovernment policies. The civil service training institutes should perform the nodal role in\nthis behalf.\n\nEach department of the Government should develop an internal evaluation mechanism on\nthe basis of clearly laid down parameters. The result of such evaluation should be part of\nthe Annual Administration Report. Departments should be held accountable for outcomes\nand there should be a sharp focus on service delivery.\n\nA State of Governance Report should be brought out evaluating the performance of each\nstate on the basis of a set of parameters of good governance.\n\nOn Making the Civil Service e-Governance Friendly\n\n24.\n\n25.\n\n26.\n\nPoints of public interface in government should be identified for focused attention and\nimprovement. Within a period of two years the procedures in the areas of public interface\nshould be simplified and electronic service delivery for the common people be introduced.\nEach Department/Ministry may lay down a time schedule to extend service delivery through\nelectronic means.\n\nTo provide a clean, honest, and transparent government, antiquated rules and procedures in\nGovernment must be discarded and new simplified ones be put in place. Such an exercise\nis absolutely essential for introduction of e-governance.\n\ne-Governance can augment efficiency and ensure transparency in government. The Andhra\nPradesh experiment of identifying officers as Chief Information Officers to be trained in the\nIndian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, in e-Governance is a noteworthy initiative.\n\n\n27.\n\n28.\n\n29.\n\n30.\n\n31.\n\n32.\n\n33.\n\nNew entrants to the Civil Service have adequate hands—on experience with computers and\nthe internet and they could be sent periodically for further training in application of e-\nGovernance.\n\nEach department should identify skill gaps keeping in view its functions and take steps to\ntrain the required number of people.\n\nThe National Informatics Centre (NIC) should function as a vehicle for disseminating best\npractices across the country.\n\nOfficers posted as Chief Executive of e-governance projects should be given reasonable\ntenure and held accountable for results.\n\nThe administrative and financial flexibility required for introducing innovative e-\ngovernance measures should be identified and operationalised.\n\nThe Minimum Agenda for e-Governance should be carried forward and each department is\nrequired to identify specific activities which will be e-enabled in the next 12 months.\nDepartmental examination should include a practical test on the ability to use and apply\ncomputers.\n\nEach Department/Ministry should have its own web site of basic information relating to the\nDepartment/Ministry and the web site be available for registering public grievances.\n\nIi. On Putting a Premium on Intellectual Growth and Upgrading\nDomain Knowledge\n\n34.\n\n35.\n36.\n\n37.\n\nEach Department/Ministry should undertake a review of the particular service of which it\nis the Cadre Controlling Authority to ensure that officers of the service are used optimally,\npromotion prospects for them are adequate and skill levels of officers are upgraded\nperiodically. Each Department/Ministry should undertake a skill needs assessment to\nidentify required skills and upgrade skill levels.\n\nCivil servants should be encouraged to move laterally to non-government organisations.\nGovernment should actively support and encourage outstanding work done by civil servants\nthrough National/State awards and commendations.\n\nThe initiative taken by the Department of Personnel and Training to provide funds to the\nIndian Institute of Management, Bangalore, to develop a two-year course for officers of the\nIAS at mid-career level is a worthwhile experiment. Similar training programmes be\ndevised for the Indian Police Service, the Indian Forest Service and other Central Services.\n\nIV. On Protecting the Civil Service against Wrongful Pressure\nand Changes in All India Service Rules and Central Civil\nService Rules\n\n38.\n\nIn the proposed Civil Service law, the highest political executive shall continue to be the\nfinal authority to order transfer of any officer before his tenure is over; but he will be\nexpected to give due consideration to Report of the Administrative Inquiry/views of the\n\n\n39.\n\n40.\n\n41.\n\n42.\n\n43.\n\nCivil Service Board/ Establishment Board and record reasons on the need for premature\ntransfer of an officer. It is reiterated that the political executive shall have the final\nauthority to transfer an officer at any stage in the public interest. An officer aggrieved by\norder of premature transfer can agitate the matter before a three-member Ombudsman, who\nmay, where suitable, award monetary compensation to the aggrieved officer. The\nconstitution of the Ombudsman will be the same as the Ombudsman proposed for the\nDisputes Redressal Council in this Report. The President/Governor shall receive reports\nfrom the Ombudsman and shall lay an Annual Report on such transfers on the table of the\nLegislature. There should be a suitable provision in the law to enable states to adopt it and\nmake it applicable in the states without going through the long process of drafting a law and\nget it passed in the Legislature.\n\nThe proposed comprehensive law on the Civil Service shall incorporate, inter alia, a Code\nof Ethics and a statutory minimum tenure in a post to an officer. Under the proposed law, if\nan officer is sought to be transferred before his tenure, there would be an expeditious\nadministrative inquiry by a designated senior officer to be earmarked for this purpose. This\ncan be dispensed with if the transfer is on promotion/deputation/foreign training. In all\nother cases, the Report of Inquiry with the views of the Civil Service Board/Establishment\nBoard would be put up to the Chief Minister if officers of the All India Service/other civil\nservices work in the states, or the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet if the officers\nwork under the Central Staffing Scheme. For the officers of the other Central Services\nworking in Ministries/Departments but not under the Central Staffing Scheme, the new law\nwill prescribe a tenure with a provision for administrative inquiry before an officer is\nsought to be transferred except on specified grounds.\n\nThe recommendations of the Surinder Nath Committee (July 2003) for increasing the\ndomain knowledge of IAS officers be implemented. Similar exercise be undertaken to\nincrease domain knowledge of officers of the other two All India Services and officers of\nthe Central Services.\n\nOfficers of the All-India Service on deputation to their home State must invariably report\nback to their parent cadres on expiry of their periods of deputation. Only one term of\ndeputation for an officer of the All India Service be allowed to the home state and that too\nto attend to urgent personal problem. The exemption at present available for officers of the\nNorth-East/Jammu & Kashmir cadres in matters of deputation may continue. Any violation\nof this stipulation will attract a major penalty proceeding and also be taken into account\nwhile considering the officer’s empanelment/promotion. Such a stipulation would also be\napplicable to officers of the Central Service who go on deputation to different state\ngovernments and to officers who go on deputation to international agencies/foreign\ngovernments.\n\nIntroduction of sophisticated technology alone would not make the administration people-\nfriendly unless higher civil servants have a pro-active attitude and reach out to the common\npeople. They must spend much more time in field visits, inspections, tours and night halts in\nremote and rural areas.\n\nAs officers of State Services appointed to All India Services by promotion also have to\nplay leadership roles, they should face an Interview by the Selection Board. The Interview\nwill not be a test of knowledge but will be only a test of leadership qualities. The selection\n\n\n44.\n\n45.\n\n46.\n\n47.\n\n48.\n\n49.\n\n50.\n\n51.\n\n52.\n\nfor promotion to All India Service will be made on an overall assessment of suitability of\nofficers on basis of record of service and the Interview Test.\n\nNot more than 50 per cent of the officers in a batch should make it to the Senior\nAdministrative Grade. 30 per cent should be the upper limit for Higher Administrative\nGrade and 20 per cent for the highest grade of Secretaries to Government of India.\n\nAs there are large number of senior officers of the All India Service in different cadres, in\nselected districts, senior officers of the rank of Commissioners/Deputy Inspector Generals\nof Police/Conservators of Forests may be considered for posting as District\nMagistrates/Senior Superintendents of Police/Divisional Forest Officers. The practice of\nposting very senior/Commissioner level officers in districts was prevalent before\nIndependence and even for a few years after Independence. It is still prevalent in some\nstates.\n\nIf the Establishment Board, after giving the views of the Minister in charge, who is a\nMember of the ACC, its utmost consideration, fails to change its original recommendation\nregarding the posting of an officer under the Central Staffing Scheme, the Cabinet Secretary\nmay send the proposals of the Board with observations of the Minister in charge through the\nHome Minister, who is a Member of the ACC, to the Prime Minister, who heads the ACC\nfor a final decision.\n\nSteps be taken to reduce the number of officers who are empanelled for senior posts under\nthe Central Staffing Scheme.\n\nA member of the higher Civil Service would be debarred from being appointed as a Private\nSecretary or Officer on Special Duty to a Cabinet Minister/Minister of State in Government\nof India or in a state subject to certain stipulations. Ministers may have one of the officers\nof the civil service in their Department/Ministry to function as Private Secretary for a\ncontinuous period of two years only. The stipulation that no officer of a Civil Service can\nbe Private Secretary of a Minister in the States or in the Central Government for more than\ntwo years may provide for an exception in case of the Prime Minister and the Chief\nMinisters.\n\nMembers of the All India Services and the Central Services, who are regular recruits\nthrough competitive examinations and who are unable to get promoted to the higher levels\nin their respective service due to non-availability of posts, may be allowed the next higher\ngrade as personal to them a year before retirement on superannuation. Such upgradation\nshall be available only to officers with proven record of efficiency and integrity.\nSuspension from service of All India Service Officers by the state government will be\ninvalid if not confirmed by the Government of India within a period of 60 days.\n\nUnder the new Civil Service law, a member of the higher civil service should not be\nappointed to any statutory commission or a constitutional authority after his retirement on\nsuperannuation. To insulate him from the temptation of post-retirement assignment, he\nshould be appointed to such statutory bodies/Constitutional Authority only when he is not\nover 55 years of age so that he can demit office from these Commissions and Authorities\nafter serving for five to six years.\n\nThere is a case for better compensation package for members of the higher civil service.\nSuch compensation must bear a reasonable comparison with compensation for executives in\n\n\nthe private sector. Issues related to a better package of compensation to the higher Civil\nServices may be referred to the next Central Pay Commission.\n\n53. There should be a cooling off period of at least two years after resignation/retirement\n\nbefore a civil servant can join a political party and contest elections to any political office.\nNo civil servant can be appointed to the high constitutional office of Governor of a state\nunless a period of two years elapses between his resignation’ retirement and his\nappointment as a Governor.\n\n54. The recommendations of the National Police Commission relating to tenure of senior police\n\nofficers, independent review of the work of police departments and streamlining the\npowers of arrest should be implemented. The recommendations of the Malimath Committee\non criminal justice system be also implemented.\n\n55. The procedure for reimbursement of medical expenses of civil servants should be\n\nsimplified so that quality medical services are available from recognised private hospitals\nwithout having to report to the CGHS on each occasion of ailment. The facilities available\nat the CGHS hospitals also need to be strengthened.\n\n56. To increase the representation of women in the civil service, it is proposed that within 15\n\nyears, at least 25 per cent members of the higher civil service should be women as against\n12 to 13 per cent women at present. Women in the higher civil service be given four years\nof leave with full pay in their entire service career over and above the leave due to them\nunder the normal leave rules. Such facility will enable them to balance their roles as\nofficers with their roles as mothers/housewives.\n\nOn Changes in Rules Governing the Disciplinary Proceedings\n\n57. To eliminate delay in disposal of a disciplinary inquiry, the Union Public Service\n\nCommission need not be consulted in case of a civil servant facing charges of corrupt\npractice and whose case has been referred to the Central Vigilance Commission for the first\nstage/second stage advice. If however the officer is penalized in the inquiry and prefers an\nappeal, the case may be referred to the UPSC for advice on the appeal petition.\n\n58. Where minor disciplinary proceedings are sufficient to meet the end of justice, major\n\npenalty proceedings which are lengthy and time-consuming should not be initiated.\n\n59. An Inquiry Officer should be relieved from his normal duties for a sufficient period to\n\nenable him to complete the departmental inquiry expeditiously and submit the report.\n\n60. A database on disciplinary cases should be maintained to keep track of their progress.\n\nVI. On Other Matters Related to Civil Service Reforms\n\n61. An Employees Health Insurance Scheme on the pattern of defence forces should be\n\nintroduced for the civil service.\n\n62. A high level Selection Committee having a representation of the Chairman, Union Public\n\nService Commission, be established to prepare a panel of two names for appointment of\none of them as a member of the State Public Service Commission by the Governor of a\nState. Similar High Level Selection Committee be constituted to recommend a panel of two\n\n\n63.\n\n64.\n\nnames for appointment of one of them as a Member of the Union Public Service\nCommission by the President. Similar Committees be constituted to recommend panel of\nsuitable names for other high level statutory and constitutional appointments such as\nSecurities and Exchange Board of India, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, Insurance\nRegulatory Authority, the Election Commission, the Comptroller & Auditor General to\nwhich retired civil servants are usually appointed.\n\nTo minimise litigation on service matters, in every Department/Ministry there would be a\nDispute Resolution Council (DRC) comprising a retired official as chairman and two\nserving officers as members. The decision of the DRC shall be invariably implemented. In\ncase of disagreement, orders of Core Group of Secretaries/Cabinet Secretary be obtained\nbefore DRC’s report is acted upon. Similar Dispute Redressal Councils be set up by State\nGovernments.\n\nTo ensure that the issues relating to the civil service get focussed attention at the highest\npolitical level, the Empowered Sub-Committee on Governance of the National\nDevelopment Council should go into the policy issues of the civil service and make\nsuitable recommendations."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Sorabjee, former Attorney-General of India, to draft a new Police Act that could meet,\ninter alia, the growing challenges to policing and to fulfill the democratic aspirations of the people.\nThe Committee, known as the Police Act Drafting Committee (PADC), submitted its report in\nOctober, 2006.\n\nTERMS OF REFERENCE OF THE COMMITTEE\n\n1. The Committee was tasked to draft a new Police Act in view of the changing\nrole/responsibility of the police and the challenges before it, especially on account of the\ngrowth and spread of insurgency/militancy/naxalism, etc.\n\n2. The new Act was to include measures for attitudinal changes among the police force, as well\nas changes in their working methodology to elicit cooperation and assistance of the community\nrather than its distrust.\n\n3. The new Police Act was to reflect the expectations of the people regarding the police in a\nmodern democratic society.\n\n4. The use of scientific investigation methods to strengthen the criminal justice system, enabling\nthe police to tackle futuristic trends and organised crime, including cyber crime and\ntechnological equipments in the hands of the criminals etc., had to be properly incorporated in\nthe new Act.\n\n5. The concern for human rights, weaker sections, women and the people belonging to Scheduled\nCastes/Scheduled Tribes had to be addressed.\n\nFEATURES OF THE MODEL POLICE ACT\n\nThe proposed Model Police Act has 16 chapters, consisting, in all, 221 sections. In drafting the Act,\nthe Committee was guided by the need to have a professional police ‘service’ in a democratic\nsociety, which is efficient, effective, responsive to the needs of the people and accountable to the\nRule of Law. The Act provides for social responsibilities of the police and emphasises that the police\nwill be governed by the principles of impartiality and human rights norms, with special attention to\nprotection of weaker sections including minorities. It also contains a provision that the composition\n\n\nof the police will reflect social diversity. The other salient features of the Act are mentioned below:\n\nI. Functional Autonomy\n\nWhile recognising that the police is an agency of the state and therefore accountable to the elected\npolitical executive, the Committee has specifically outlined the role of superintendence of the state\ngovernment over the police. The Model Police Act creates the following mechanisms and processes\nwhich will help the police perform its functions more efficiently as also enhance its credibility in the\neyes of the public:\n\n1. Creation of a State Police Board: This body, under the chairmanship of the State Home Minister\nand comprising the Leader of Opposition in the State Assembly, the Chief Secretary, the Home\nSecretary and the Director General of Police, besides a few independent non-government members,\nshall lay down the policy guidelines for efficient policing and identify performance indicators to\nevaluate the functioning of the police service.\n\n2. Merit-based Selection and Appointment of the Director General of Police: To ensure a\nleader who can function with professional efficiency and a temporal perspective, without fear or\nfavour, the Model Act mandates selection of the Director General of Police from among three senior-\nmost officers of the state police, empanelled for the rank against prescribed criteria. Recognising that\nthe Head of the Police must enjoy the confidence of the political executive, the Act provides for the\nstate government to appoint any of the three such officers as the Director General of Police.\n\n3. Security of Tenure: Cognisant of the fact that frequent transfers of officers seriously impede\nprofessional efficiency in police functioning, the Model Act mandates a minimum tenure of two years\nfor the Director General of Police and other key functionaries such as the District Superintendent of\nPolice and the Station House Officer. Indeed, the security of tenure does not preclude the removal of\nan officer for misconduct or inefficiency; it merely ensures that removal is consequent upon specified\ngrounds laid down in law.\n\n4. Police Establishment Committee: This is a departmental body comprising the Head of the\nPolice and other senior officers, being created at the state as well as district levels, to consider\ntransfers and postings of police officers at different levels on the basis of collective wisdom and\nexperience, and to look into complaints of police officers against any illegal orders.\n\nIl. Encouraging Professionalism\n\nTo ensure an efficient, responsive and professional police service, the Model Act introduces the\nconcept of preparing plans that lay down the policing objectives to be achieved in a given period, and\nprovides mechanisms to streamline criminal investigation and training processes for police officers.\n\n1. Earmarking Dedicated Staff for Crime Investigation: To streamline criminal investigations,\nthe Act mandates earmarking of staff in each police station, specifically for investigating heinous and\nother specified offences, who shall be trained in scientific and other methods of investigation.\n\n2. Civil Police Officer: Keeping in view the fact that the civil police—as against the armed wing of\nthe police—needs better-educated personnel to exercise discretionary powers in dealing with people\n\n\nand investigating cases, the Act stipulates that the rank of constabulary be done away within the Civil\nPolice. Now the primary rank in the civil police is the Civil Police Officer, Grade II. Those recruited\nto this rank shall be trained for three years as stipendiary cadets, and only upon passing prescribed\nbachelor’s degree examination in Police Studies would they be appointed as Civil Police Officers.\n\nIi. Accountability Paramount\n\nRealising that what matters most to the people is accountability of the police, the Act prioritises\npolice accountability, both for their performance and their conduct.\n\n1. Performance Evaluation: The Act provides detailed mechanism involving the State Police\nBoard, assisted by an Inspectorate of Performance Evaluation, to evaluate the police service at the\nstate, district and police station levels. The police shall be evaluated against identified performance\nindicators (including operational efficiency, public and victim satisfaction, accountability, optimum\nutilisation of resources, and observance of human rights standards), the targets let out in the Annual\nPlan, and the resources available with the police.\n\n2. Police Accountability Commission and District Accountability Authorities: The Act creates\nindependent civilian oversight agencies chaired by retired judges at the state and district level to\ninquire into public complaints against the police for serious misconduct and to generally monitor\ninternal departmental inquiries in other cases of misconduct.\n\n3. Offences by the Police: The Act introduces criminal penalties for the common defaults\ncommitted by the police including non-registration of FIRs, unlawful arrest, detention, search, or\nseizure to bring into sharp focus for the police personnel that some of their practices are not only\nillegal, but also criminal offences under the law of the land.\n\nIV. Improved Service Conditions\n\nThe Act aims to provide better service conditions to the police personnel including rationalising their\nworking hours, one day off in each week, or compensatory benefits in lieu. It creates a Police Welfare\nBureau to take care, inter alia, of health care, housing, and legal facilities for police personnel as\nwell as financial security for the next of kin of those who lose their lives in service. It further\nmandates the government to provide insurance cover to all officers, and special allowances to\nofficers posted in special wings, commensurate with the risk involved.\n\nV. Role in Protecting Internal Security in Light of New Threats\n\nThe Act deals with police preparedness to manage threats to internal security from activities of\nterrorists, militants, insurgents and organised crime groups. The police are not granted any special\npowers in the Act to deal with these threats; rather the Act provides for systematic preparation and\nmeticulous compliance of Internal Security Schemes and Standard Operation Procedures to handle the\nthreats as well as creation of Special Security Zones within a state and where need arises, in\ncontiguous areas of neighbouring states, that facilitate different police structure and command, control\nand response system, and cooperation between different agencies of the state(s)."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

The Government has constituted a high level\ncommittee to prepare a comprehensive report covering these aspects.\n\nThe terms of reference of the above High Level Committee (HLC) are as follows:\n\n(1) The HLC will prepare a report on the social, economic and educational status of the Muslim\n\ncommunity of India.\n\n(2) More specifically, the HLC will:\n\n(a) Obtain relevant information from departments/agencies of the Central and state\ngovernments and also conduct an intensive literature survey to identify published data,\narticles and research on relative social, economic and educational status of Muslims in\nIndia at the state, regional and district levels, to address, inter alia, the following\nquestions:\n\n(i)\n(ii)\n(iii)\n(iv)\n(v)\n\n(vi)\n\nIn which states, regions, districts and blocks do Muslims of India mostly live?\n\nWhat is the geographical pattern of their economic activity, i.e., what do they mostly\ndo for a living in various states, regions and districts?\n\nWhat are their asset bases and income levels relative to other groups across various\nstates and regions?\n\nWhat is the level of their socio-economic development in terms of relevant indicators\nsuch as literacy rate, dropout rate, maternal mortality rate (MMR), infant mortality\nrate (IMR) etc.? How does this compare with other communities in various states?\nWhat is their relative share in public and private sector employment? Does it vary\nacross states and what is the pattern of such variation? Is the share in employment in\nproportion to their population in various states? If not, what are the hurdles?\n\nWhat is the proportion of Other Backward Classes (OBCs) from the Muslim\n\n\ncommunity in the total OBC population in various states? Are the Muslim OBCs listed\nin the comprehensive list of OBCs prepared by the National and State Backward\nClasses Commissions and adopted by the Central and state governments for\nreservation for various purposes? What is the share of Muslim OBCs in the total\npublic sector employment for OBCs in the Centre and in various states in various\nyears?\n\n(vii) Does the Muslim community have adequate access to education and health services,\nmunicipal infrastructure, bank credit and other services provided by\nGovernment/public sector entities? How does this compare to the access enjoyed by\nother communities in various states? What is the level of social infrastructure\n(schools, health centers, Integrated Child Development Service Centers, etc.) located\nin areas of Muslim concentration in comparison to the general level of such\ninfrastructure in various states?\n\n(b) Consolidate, collate and analyse the above information/literature to identify areas of\nintervention by Government to address relevant issues relating to the social, economic and\neducational status of the Muslim community.\n\nFINDINGS OF THE COMMITTEE\n\nThe Committee found that while there is considerable variation in the conditions of Muslims across\nstates, (and among the Muslims, those who identified themselves as OBCs and others), the community\nexhibits deficits and deprivation in practically all dimensions of development. In fact, by and large,\nMuslims rank somewhat above SCs/STs but below Hindu-OBCs, Other Minorities and Hindu-\nGeneral (mostly upper castes) in almost all indicators considered. Among the states that have large\nMuslim populations, the situation is particularly grave in the states of West Bengal, Bihar, Uttar\nPradesh and Assam. In addition to the ‘development deficit’, the perception among Muslims, that they\nare discriminated against and excluded, is widespread. This exacerbates the problem.\nThe educational, economic and social conditions of Muslims as reflected by the Committee report\nare mentioned below.\n1. Muslims have the highest rate of stunting and second-highest rate of underweight children.\n2. 25% Muslim children in the 6-14 years age group have either never attended school or have\ndropped out.\n3. Only one out of every 25 undergraduate and 50 postgraduate students in premier colleges is a\nMuslim.\n4. Only about 4% of all Muslim students are enrolled in madarsas.\n5. Workforce participation rate among Muslim women is only 25%. In rural areas, 29% of\nMuslim women participate in the workforce as compared to 70% of Hindu women.\n6. 61% of the total Muslim workers are self-employed as against 55% of Hindu workers. 73%\nof Muslim women are self-employed as compared to 60% for Hindus.\n7. Only about 27% of the Muslim workers in urban areas are engaged in regular work as\ncompared to 40% SC/ST, 36% OBC and 49% Hindu upper caste workers.\n8. Less than 24% of Muslim regular workers are employed in the public sector or in government\n\n\njobs as compared to 39% regular SC/ST workers, 37% Hindu upper caste workers and 30%\nOBC workers.\n\n9. The share of Muslim male workers engaged in street vending (especially without any fixed\nlocation) is 12% as against the national average of less than 8%.\n\n10. The share of Muslims in Public Order and Safety Activities at the Central Government level\nis only about 6%. Hindu upper caste workers have a share of 42% and both SCs/STs and\nOBCs have 23% share each.\n\n11. The share of Muslims among defence workers is only 4%.\n\n12. Compared to other regular workers, a much larger proportion of Muslim regular workers have\nno written contract (73%, against 52% for Hindu upper caste and 63% each for Hindu-OBCs\nand SCs/STs) and no social security benefit (71% against the national average of 55%).\n\nInterestingly, despite such deficits, the Muslim community has the following positive points:\n\n1. The Muslim population shows an increasingly better sax-ratio compared with other socio-\nreligious communities.\n\n2. Infant and childhood mortality among Muslims is slightly lower than the average.\n\n3. The life expectancy for Muslims is higher than average by about one year.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMMITTEE\n\n1. Creation of a National Data Bank (NDB) where all relevant data for various socio-religious\ncommunities (SRCs) are maintained.\n\n2. Setting up of an autonomous Assessment and Monitoring Authority (AMA) to evaluate the\nextent of development benefits which accrue to different SRCs through various programmes.\n\n3. While equity in the implementation of programmes and better participation of the community\nin the development process would gradually eliminate the perception of discrimination, there\nis a need to strengthen the legal provisions to eliminate such cases.\n\n4. An Equal Opportunity Commission (EOC) should be constituted by the government to look\ninto the grievances of the deprived groups.\n\n5. Appropriate state level laws can be enacted to ensure minority representation in local bodies.\n\n6. Anomalies should be eliminated with respect to reserved constituencies under the delimitation\nschemes.\n\n7. The idea of providing certain incentives to a ‘diversity index’ should be explored. A wide\nvariety of incentives can be linked to this index so as to ensure equal opportunity to all SRCs\nin the areas of education, government and private employment and housing.\n\n8. In order to respect and sustain diversity in the development and implementation of innovative\nprogrammes or in the provision of services, the relevant functionaries should be sensitive to\nthe need for diversity and the problems associated with social exclusion.\n\n9. Aprocess of evaluating the content of the school text books needs to be initiated to purge them\nof explicit and implicit content that may impart inappropriate social values, especially\nreligious intolerance.\n\n\n19.\n\n20.\n\n21\n\n24.\n\n25.\n\n26.\n\n27.\n\n28.\n\n29.\n\n30.\n\n31.\n\n. Government schools of a high standard should be set up in all areas of Muslim concentration.\n. Exclusive schools for girls should be set up, particularly for the 9-12 standards.\n. Given the constitutional commitment to provide primary education in the child’s mother\n\ntongue, the state is required to run Urdu medium schools.\n\n. The pre-entry qualification for admission to ITIs should be reduced to Class VII.\n. The University Grants Commission (UGC) should be encouraged to evolve a system where\n\npart of the allocation to colleges and universities is linked to the diversity within the student\npopulation.\n\n. To facilitate admissions to the ‘most backward’ amongst all the SRCs in the regular\n\nuniversities and autonomous colleges, alternate admission criteria need to be evolved.\n\n. Providing hostel facilities at reasonable costs for students from minorities should be taken up\n\non a priority basis.\n\n. Teacher training should compulsorily include in its curriculum components which introduce\n\nthe importance of diversity/plurality within the country and sensitise teachers towards the\nneeds and aspirations of Muslims and other marginalised communities.\n\n. Urdu should be introduced as an optional subject in all government and government-aided\n\nschools in states having a substantial Urdu speaking population.\n\nWork out mechanisms whereby madarsas can be linked with a higher secondary school board\nso that students wanting to shift to regular/mainstream education can do so after having passed\nfrom a madarsa.\n\nDegrees from madarsas should be recoginsed for eligibility in competitive examinations such\nas the civil services, banks, defense services and other such examinations.\n\n. Access to Muslims in Priority Sector Bank Advances should be promoted and enhanced.\n22.\n23.\n\nBanks should be incentivised for opening more branches in Muslim concentration areas.\n\nSmall Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) should set aside a fund for training for\nminorities under its Entrepreneurial Development Programme.\n\nA policy to enhance the participation of minorities in the micro-credit schemes of National\nBank for Agricultural and Rural Development (NABARD) should be laid down.\n\nIt is desirable to have experts drawn from the Muslim community on relevant interview panels\nand boards. This practice is already in vogue in the case of SCs/STs.\n\nAll districts with more than 25 per cent Muslim population should be brought under the Prime\nMinister’s 15-Point Programme. A special assistance package for the development of these\ndistricts should be launched.\n\nThere should be transparency in information about minorities in all activities.\n\nDetailed data should be collected regularly on the participation of different SRCs in\ngovernment programmes, both at the state and the Central level.\n\nThe Central Government should introduce a few schemes with large outlays for welfare of\nminorities with an equitable provision for Muslims.\n\nFinancial and other support should be provided to initiatives built around occupations where\nMuslims are concentrated, and that have growth potential.\n\nLocation of ITIs, polytechnics and other institutions that provide skill training to non-\n\n\n32.\n\n33.\n\n34.\n\nmatriculates need to be located in areas/clusters which have large concentrations of Muslim\npopulation.\n\nIt is desirable to have a mandated social security system for the self-employed persons in the\ninformal sector, especially the home-based workers.\n\nEfforts should be made to increase the employment share of Muslims amongst the teaching\ncommunity, health workers, police personnel, bank employees and so on.\n\nThe registration of trusts set up by the Muslim community, such as Wakf institutions and\nmosque committees should be facilitated."}], "max_tokens": 15000}}

Kelkar, former Union Finance Secretary. It submitted its\nreport in December, 2009. Its recommendations on specified aspects of Centre-state fiscal relations\ncover the period of five years from April 1, 2010 to March 31, 2015.\n\nTERMS OF REFERENCE OF THE COMMISSION\n\n1. The Commission shall make recommendations as to the following matters:\n\n(i) the distribution between the Union and the states of the net proceeds of taxes which are to\nbe, or may be, divided between them under Chapter I in Part XII of the Constitution and the\nallocation among the states of the respective shares of such proceeds\n\n(ii) the principles which should govern the grants-in-aid of the revenues of the states out of the\nConsolidated Fund of India and the sums to be paid to the states which are in need of\nassistance by way of grants-in-aid of their revenues under article 275 of the Constitution for\npurposes other than those specified in the provisos to Clause (1) of that Article, and\n\n(iii) the measures needed to augment the Consolidated Fund of a state to supplement the\n\nresources of the panchayats and municipalities in the state on the basis of the\nrecommendations made by the Finance Commission of the state.\n\n2. The Commission shall review the state of the finances of the Union and the states, keeping in\nview, in particular, the operation of the states’ Debt Consolidation and Relief Facility, 2005-\n2010 introduced by the Central Government on the basis of the recommendations of the\nTwelfth Finance Commission, and suggest measures for maintaining a stable and sustainable\nfiscal environment consistent with equitable growth.\n\n3. In making its recommendations, the Commission shall have regard, among other\nconsiderations, to\n\n(i) the resources of the Central Government, for five years commencing on Ist April 2010, on\nthe basis of levels of taxation and non-tax revenues likely to be reached at the end of\n2008-’09\n\n(ii) the demands on the resources of the Central Government, in particular, on account of the\nprojected Gross Budgetary Support to the Central and State Plan, expenditure on civil\nadministration, defence, internal and border security, debt-servicing and other committed\nexpenditure and liabilities\n\n\n(iii) the resources of the state governments, for the five years commencing on 1*' April 2010, on\nthe basis of levels of taxation and non-tax revenues likely to be reached at the end of 2008-\n09\n\n(iv) the objective of not only balancing the receipts and expenditure on revenue account of all\nthe states and the Union, but also generating surpluses for capital investment\n\n(v) the taxation efforts of the Central Government and each state government and the potential\nfor additional resource mobilisation to improve the Tax-Gross Domestic Product ratio in\nthe case of the Union and Tax-Gross State Domestic Product ratio in the case of the states\n\n(vi) the impact of the proposed implementation of Goods and Services Tax with effect from 1**\nApril, 2010, including its impact on the country’s foreign trade\n\n(vii) the need to improve the quality of public expenditure to obtain better outputs and outcomes\n\n(viii) the need to manage ecology, environment and climate change consistent with sustainable\n\ndevelopment\n\n(ix) the expenditure on the non-salary component of maintenance and upkeep of capital assets\nand the non-wage related maintenance expenditure on plan schemes to be completed by 31°\nMarch, 2010 and the norms on the basis of which specific amounts are recommended for\nthe maintenance of the capital assets and the manner of monitoring such expenditure\n\n(x) the need for ensuring the commercial viability of irrigation projects, power projects,\ndepartmental undertakings and public sector enterprises through various means, including\nlevy of user charges and adoption of measures to promote efficiency.\n\n4. In making its recommendations on various matters, the Commission shall take the base of\npopulation figures as of 1971, in all such cases where population is a factor for determination\nof devolution of taxes and duties and grants-in-aid.\n\n5. The Commission may review the present arrangements as regards financing of Disaster\nManagement with reference to the National Calamity Contingency Fund and the Calamity\nRelief Fund and the funds envisaged in the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and make\nappropriate recommendations thereon.\n\n6. Having regard to the need to bring the liabilities of the Central Government on account of oil,\nfood and fertilizer bonds into the fiscal accounting, and the impact of various other obligations\nof the Central Government on the deficit targets, the Commission may review the roadmap for\nfiscal adjustment and suggest a suitably revised roadmap with a view to maintaining the gains\nof fiscal consolidation through 2010 to 2015.\n\n7. The Commission shall indicate the basis on which it has arrived at its findings and make\navailable the estimates of receipts and expenditure of the Union and each of the states.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMMISSION\n\nFinances of Union and States\n\n1. The Ministry of Finance (MoF) should ensure that the finance accounts fully reflect the\ncollections under cesses and surcharges as per the relevant heads, so that there are no\n\n\ninconsistencies between the amounts released to states in any year and the respective\npercentage shares in net Central taxes recommended by the Finance Commission for that year.\n2. The states need to address the problem of losses in the power sector in a time-bound manner.\n3. Initiatives should be taken to reduce the number of Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) and\nto restore the predominance of formula-based plan transfers.\n4. Acalibrated exit strategy from the expansionary fiscal stance of 2008-09 and 2009-10 should\nbe the main agenda of the Centre.\n\nII. Goods and Services Tax\n\n1. Both the Centre and the states should conclude a ‘grand bargain’ to implement the Model\nGST. This grand bargain comprises six elements:\n(i) The design of the Model GST\n(ii) The operational modalities\n(iii) The proposed agreement between the Centre and states, with contingencies for changes\n(iv) The disincentives for non-compliance\n(v) The implementation schedule\n\n(vi) The procedure for claiming compensation.\n\n2. Any GST model adopted must be consistent with all the elements of the grand bargain. To\nincentivise implementation of the grand bargain, the Commission recommended sanction of a\ngrant of ¢ 50,000 crore. The grant would be used to meet the compensation claims of state\ngovernments for revenue losses on account of implementation of GST between 2010-11 and\n2014-15, consistent with the grand bargain. Unspent balances in this pool would be\ndistributed amongst all the states, as per the devolution formula, on 1 January 2015.\n\n3. The Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers (EC) should be transformed into a\nstatutory council. The compensation should be disbursed in quarterly installments on the basis\nof the recommendations by a three-member Compensation Committee comprising the\nSecretary, Department of Revenue, Government of India, Secretary to the EC, and chaired by\nan eminent person with experience in public finance.\n\n4. In the unlikely event that a consensus with regard to implementing all the elements of the\ngrand bargain cannot be achieved and the GST mechanism finally adopted is different from\nthe Model GST suggested by it, the Commission recommended that this amount of z 50,000\ncrore shall not be disbursed.\n\n5. The states should take steps to reduce the transit time of cargo vehicles crossing their borders\nby combining check-posts with adjoining states and adopting user-friendly options like\nelectronically issued passes for transit traffic.\n\nIf. Union Finances\n\n1. The policy regarding use of proceeds from disinvestment needs to be liberalised to also\ninclude capital expenditure on critical infrastructure and the environment.\n2. Records of landholdings of PSUs need to be properly maintained to ensure that this scarce\n\n\nresource is put to productive use, or made available for other public projects, or else, sold.\n\nIV. State Finances\n\n1. The practice of diverting plan assistance to meet non-plan needs of special category states\n\nshould be discontinued.\n\n2. With reference to public sector undertakings\n\n(i) All states should endeavour to ensure clearance of the accounts of all their Public Sector\nUndertakings (PSUs).\n\n(ii) The states should use the flexibility provided by the Comptroller and Auditor General\n(C&AG) to clear the backlog of PSU accounts.\n\n(iii) All states need to draw up a roadmap for closure of non-working PSUs by March 2011.\nDivestment and privatisation of PSUs should be considered and actively pursued.\n\n(iv) The Ministry of Corporate Affairs should closely monitor the compliance of state and\nCentral PSUs with their statutory obligations.\n\n(v) A task force may be constituted to design a suitable strategy for disinvestment/privatisation\nand oversee the process. A Standing Committee on restructuring may be constituted under\nthe chairmanship of the Chief Secretary to operationalise the recommendations of the task\nforce. An independent technical secretariat may be set up to advise the finance departments\nin states on restructuring/disinvestment proposals.\n\n3. With reference to the power sector\n\n(i) Reduction of Transmission and Distribution (T&D) losses should be attempted through\nmetering, feeder separation, introduction of High Voltage Distribution Systems (HVDS),\nmetering of distribution transformers and strict anti-theft measures. Distribution franchising\nand Electricity Services Company (ESCO)-based structures should be considered for\nefficiency improvement.\n\n(ii) Unbundling needs to be carried out on priority basis and open access to transmission\nstrengthened. Governance should be improved through State Load Dispatch Centres\n(SLDCs) and this function should eventually be made autonomous.\n\n(iii) Proper systems should be put in place to avoid delays in completion of hydro projects.\n\n(iv) Instead of putting up thermal power plants in locations remote from sources of coal, states\nshould consider joint ventures (JVs) in or near the coal-rich states.\n\n(v) Case 1 bid process should be extensively used to avoid vulnerability to high-cost purchases\nduring peak demand periods.\n\n(vi) Regulatory institutions should be strengthened through capacity building, consumer\neducation and tariff reforms like Multi Year Tariff (MYT). Best practices of corporate\ngovernance should be introduced in power utilities.\n\n4. Migration to the New Pension Scheme needs to be completed at the earliest.\n\n5. States with large cash balances should make efforts towards utilising these before resorting to\n\nfresh borrowings.\n\n6. With reference to accounting reforms\n\n(i) The Government of India (Gol) should ensure uniformity in the budgetary classification\n\n\ncode across all states. The list of appendices to the finance accounts of states also needs to\nbe standardised.\n\n(ii) Details of contra-entries as well as the summary of transactions between the public account\nand the consolidated fund should be provided as a separate annexure to the finance\naccounts of the states.\n\n(iii) Public expenditure through creation of funds outside the consolidated fund of the states\nneeds to be discouraged. Expenditure through such funds and from civil deposits should be\nbrought under the audit jurisdiction of the C& AG.\n\n(iv) The following statements need to be provided with the finance accounts of states:\n\n(a) Comprehensive data on all subsidies\n\n(b) Consolidated information on the number of employees at each level, along with the\ncommitment on salary. This statement should also include information on employees\nand their salary where such expenditure is shown as grants or booked under other\nexpenditure.\n\n(c) Details of maintenance expenditure\n\nV. Sharing of Union Tax Revenues\n\n1. The share of states in net proceeds of shareable Central taxes shall be 32 per cent in each of\nthe financial years from 2010-11 to 2014-15. Under the Additional Duties of Excise (Goods\nof Special Importance) Act, 1957, all goods were exempted from payment of duty from 1\nMarch 2006. Following this, the Centre had adjusted the basic duties of excise on sugar and\ntobacco products. In view of these developments, the states’ share in the net proceeds of\nshareable Central taxes shall remain unchanged at 32 per cent, even in the event of states\nlevying sales tax (or Value Added Tax (VAT)) on these commodities.\n\n2. In the event of notification of the 88th Amendment to the Constitution and enactment of any\nlegislation following such notification, it should be ensured that the revenue accruing to a state\nunder the legislation should not be less than the share that would accrue to it, had the entire\nservice tax been part of the shareable pool of Central taxes.\n\n3. The Central Government should review the levy of cesses and surcharges with a view to\nreducing their share in its gross tax revenue.\n\n4. The indicative ceiling on overall transfers to states on the revenue account may be set at 39.5\nper cent of gross revenue receipts of the Centre.\n\nVI. Revised Roadmap for Fiscal Consolidation\n\n1. The revenue deficit of the Centre needs to be progressively reduced and eliminated, followed\nby emergence of a revenue surplus by 2014-15.\n\n2. A target of 68 per cent of GDP for the combined debt of the Centre and states should be\nachieved by 2014-15. The fiscal consolidation path embodies steady reduction in the\naugmented debt stock of the Centre to 45 per cent of GDP by 2014-15, and of the states to less\nthan 25 per cent of GDP, by 2014-15.\n\n3. The Medium Term Fiscal Plan (MTFP) should be reformed and made a statement of\n\n\ncommitment rather than a statement of intent. Tighter integration is required between the multi-\nyear framework provided by MTFP and the annual budget exercise.\n4. The following disclosures should be made along with the annual Central Budget / MTFP:\n\n(i) Detailed breakup of grants to states under the overall category of non-plan and plan grants\n\n(ii) Statement on tax expenditure to be systematised and the methodology to be made explicit\n\n(iii) Compliance costs of major tax proposals to be reported\n\n(iv) Revenue Consequences of Capital Expenditure (RCCE) to be projected in MTFP\n\n(v) Fiscal impact of major policy changes to be incorporated in MTFP\n\n(vi) Public Private Partnership (PPP) liabilities to be reported along with MTFP\n\n(vii) MTFP to make explicit the values of parameters underlying projections for receipts and\nexpenditure and the band within which they can vary while remaining consistent with\ntargets\n\n5. Transfer of disinvestment receipts to the public account to be discontinued and all\n\ndisinvestment receipts to be maintained in the consolidated fund\n\n6. Gol to list all public sector enterprises that yield a lower rate of return on assets than a norm,\n\nto be decided upon by an expert committee\n\n7. The FRBM Act to specify the nature of shocks that would require a relaxation of FRBM\n\ntargets\n\n8. In case of macroeconomic shocks, instead of relaxing the states’ borrowing limits and letting\n\nthem borrow more, the Centre to borrow and devolve the resources using the Finance\nCommission tax devolution formula for inter se distribution between states\n9. Structural shocks such as arrears arising out of Pay Commission awards to be avoided by, in\n\nthe case of arrears, making the pay award commence from the date on which it is accepted\n\n10. An independent review mechanism to be set-up by the Centre to evaluate its fiscal reform\nprocess. The independent review mechanism should evolve into a fiscal council with\nlegislative backing over time\n\n11. Given the exceptional circumstances of 2008-09 and 2009-10, the fiscal consolidation\nprocess of the states was disrupted. It is expected that states would be able to get back to their\nfiscal correction path by 201 1-12, allowing for a year of adjustment in 2010-11.\n\n(i) States that incurred zero revenue deficit or achieved revenue surplus in 2007-08 should\neliminate revenue deficit by 2011-12 and maintain revenue balance or attain a surplus\nthereafter. Other states should eliminate revenue deficit by 2014-15.\n\n(ii) The General Category States that attained a zero revenue deficit or a revenue surplus in\n2007-08 should achieve a fiscal deficit of three per cent of Gross State Domestic Product\n(GSDP) by 2011-12 and maintain such thereafter. Other general category states need to\nachieve three per cent fiscal deficit by 2013-14.\n\n(iii) All special category states with base fiscal deficit of less than three per cent of GSDP in\n2007-’08 could incur a fiscal deficit of three per cent in 2011—12 and maintain it thereafter.\nManipur, Nagaland, Sikkim and Uttarakhand should reduce their fiscal deficit to three per\ncent of GSDP by 2013-14.\n\n(iv) Jammu & Kashmir and Mizoram should limit their fiscal deficit to three per cent of GSDP\nby 2014-15.\n\n\n20.\n\n. States to amend/enact FRBM Acts to build in the fiscal reform path worked out. State-specific\n\ngrants recommended for a state should be released upon compliance\n\n. Independent review/monitoring mechanism under the FRBM Acts to be set up by states\n. Borrowing limits for states to be worked out by MoF using the fiscal reform path, thus acting\n\nas an enforcement mechanism for fiscal correction by states\n\n. Loans to states from National Small Savings Fund (NSSF) contracted till 2006-07 and\n\noutstanding at the end of 2009-10 to be reset at nine per cent rate of interest, subject to\nconditions prescribed\n\n. National Small Savings Scheme to be reformed into a market-aligned scheme; state\n\ngovernments also required to undertake relevant reforms at their level\n\n. Loans from Gol to states and administered by ministries/departments other than MoF,\n\noutstanding as at the end of 2009-10, to be written off, subject to conditions prescribed\n\n. A window for borrowing from the Central Government to be available for fiscally weak\n\nstates that are unable to raise loans from the market\n\n. For states that have not availed the benefit of consolidation under the Debt Consolidation and\n\nRelief Facility (DCRF), the facility, limited to consolidation and interest rate reduction, to be\nextended, subject to enactment of the FRBM Act\n\nThe benefit of interest relief on NSSF and the write-off should be made available to states\nonly if they bring about the necessary amendments/enactments of FRBM\n\nVII. Local Bodies\n\n1.\n\nArticle 280 (3) (bb) & (c) of the Constitution should be amended such that the words ‘on the\nbasis of the recommendations of the Finance Commission of the State’ are changed to ‘after\ntaking into consideration the recommendations of the Finance Commission of the State’.\n\n. Article 243(I) of the Constitution should be amended to include the phrase ‘or earlier’ after\n\nthe words ‘every fifth year’.\n\n. The quantum of local body grants should be provided as per the specified scheme.

State governments will be eligible for the general performance grant and the special areas\n\nperformance grant only if they comply with the prescribed stipulations. These grants will be\ndisbursed in the manner specified.\n\n. The states should appropriately allocate a portion of their share of the general basic grant and\n\ngeneral performance grant, to the special areas in proportion to the population of these areas.\nThis allocation will be in addition to the special area basic grant and special area\nperformance grant recommended by the Commission.\n\n. State governments should appropriately strengthen their local fund audit departments through\n\ncapacity building as well as personnel augmentation.\n\n. The state governments should incentivise revenue collection by local bodies through methods\n\nsuch as mandating some or all local taxes as obligatory at non-zero rates of levy, by deducting\ndeemed own revenue collection from transfer entitlements of local bodies, or through a system\n\nof matching grants.\n\n. To buttress the accounting system, the finance accounts should include a separate statement\n\nindicating head-wise details of actual expenditures under the same heads as used in the budget\nfor both Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and Urban Local Bodies (ULBs).

Balances as on 31 March, 2010 under state CRFs and the NCCF should be transferred to the\n\nrespective SDRFs and NDRF.\n\n. Budgetary provisions for the NDRF need to be linked to expenditure of the previous year from\n\nthe fund. With cesses being subsumed on introduction of the GST, alternative sources of\nfinancing need to be identified.\n\n.

Mitigation and reconstruction activities should be kept out of the schemes funded through FC\ngrants and met out of overall development plan funds of the Centre and the states.\n\n8. The list of disasters to be covered under the scheme financed through FC grants should remain\nas it exists today. However, man-made disasters of high-intensity may be considered for\nNDRF funding, once norms have been stipulated and the requisite additional allocations made\nto the NDRF.\n\n9. The administrative mechanism for disaster relief should be as prescribed under the DM Act,\nie., the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA)/National Executive Council\n(NEC) at the Centre and the State Disaster Management Agency (SDMA)/State Executive\nCouncil (SEC) at the state level; financial matters should be dealt with by the Ministry of\nFinance as per the existing practice.\n\n10.
