Concept of Limited Government, Fundamental Rights, Natural Law, Higher Law, and the Impact on Judicial Review of Constitutional Courts

The very notion that judicial verdicts can instigate sweeping social transformations rests on the premise that courts do not merely interpret existing laws; their interpretative function also encompasses the responsibility to declare laws, effectively shaping and creating them in the process. This intricate mechanism of constitutional interpretation, often referred to in legal terms as judicial review, holds particular significance within the Indian legal framework, primarily due to the presence of a codified Constitution that includes an explicit chapter dedicated to fundamental rights. These critical attributes of the Constitution engender the prevailing paradigm of limited government.

At its core, the Indian Constitution is founded upon three fundamental principles which constitute the essence of constitutionalism:

1. A written Constitution
2. A dedicated chapter on fundamental rights
3. The concept of limited government

The framework of limited government arises logically from the other two foundational principles. This model is rooted in the key assertion that governmental powers are restricted by law. Consequently, both the executive and legislative branches must operate within the established legal limits.

Article 73 of the Constitution provides that, in adherence to the Constitution, the executive authority of the union is confined to those matters where Parliament is authorized to legislate. Similarly, Article 162 imposes identical constraints on the executive powers of state governments. Here, it becomes apparent that executive power is inherently aligned with legislative authority, signifying a structured equilibrium vital for governance.

Thus, the notion that government operates via laws rather than the whims of individuals is a fundamental tenet of representative democracies. This principle, which traces its origins back to the Constitution of Massachusetts in 1780, found expression in the renowned Supreme Court case of Marbury v. Madison. In this landmark decision, Chief Justice John Marshall asserted: 'The Government of the United States has been emphatically termed a government of laws and not of men.' This doctrine, foundational to American legal thought, resonates in the poignant observation by Woodrow Wilson: 'The history of liberty is a history of the limitation of governmental power, not the increase of it.'

In the Indian context, the discussions surrounding the concept of parliamentary omnipotence as articulated by Dicey are fundamentally misconceived. The parliamentary democracy enshrined in our Constitution is subject to several critical limitations. Chief among these is the constitutional oversight regarding the distribution of legislative power. Article 245 articulates that Parliament may legislate but only 'subject to the other provisions in the Constitution'. This reveals the layered nuances of constitutional limitations, delineating legislative powers on the basis of three distinct lists—union, concurrent, and state—articulated in Article 246 and its subclauses. These provisions clarify which laws shall prevail in cases of conflicting legislation, favoring union laws due to the Constitution's dominant unitary inclination while still maintaining that each legislative body possesses supremacism in its sphere.

Moreover, Article 245 implies that the scope of legislation, while vast, remains contingent upon other constitutional provisions, notably Part III, which delineates fundamental rights.

The term ‘fundamental right’ first emerged in the U.S. Supreme Court context when Justice Washington, presiding over the case of Corfield v. Coryell, articulated its importance in safeguarding basic privileges integral to individuals in a free society. His assertion underscored that these rights are inherent, universal, and unassailable, forming the cornerstone of just governance.

However, significant development in the understanding of fundamental rights occurred in 1937 when Justice Benjamin Cardozo, in Palko v. Connecticut, enunciated a more refined doctrine, positing that certain rights are foundational, encapsulating principles of justice deeply embedded in our societal consciousness.

The architects of the Indian Constitution emerged from a historical backdrop marked by oppression, exploitation, and racial discrimination, endured over two centuries of foreign dominance. They recognized the critical importance of enshrining fundamental rights within the Constitution as a vital protective measure against any possible resurgence of tyranny. This sentiment resonates closely with the experience of the American colonies under British rule, leading to the adoption of the Bill of Rights designed to safeguard individual freedoms. Ivor Jennings astutely noted that the Indian Bill of Rights was significantly influenced by the British rule, reminiscent of the American experience. During the rigorous debates of the Constituent Assembly, members evaluated the essence of fundamental rights, expressing a consensus on their intrinsic character as permanent, inalienable human rights crucial for the survival of a free democracy.

In these debates, B.R. Ambedkar articulated that these rights are not merely legal constructs but rather represent the foundational ethos of society, forming the silent premise of the collective outlook. S. Radhakrishnan voiced a profound commitment to these rights, characterizing their declaration as a solemn promise to the Indian people and a moral bond with the international community.

Fundamental rights, recognized globally, are often misconstrued as privileges granted by the state, whereas they are intrinsic natural rights. These innate rights stem from the fundamental human instinct for selfdetermination and morality. Their universality implies that they predate the establishment of any governmental system, which might restrict their exercise in the interest of social order. Thus, every civilized state is compelled to recognize these rights within the bounds of collective societal interest and legal governance. The distinction can be epitomized in the popular adage: 'I have the right to swing my arm, but I have to do so without hitting someone’s nose.’

Part III of the Indian Constitution encapsulates six fundamental rights under Article 19 that reflect this intrinsic nature of human rights while allowing for reasonable restrictions as delineated in Articles 19(2) through 19(6). These rights are recognized not as concessions from the state but as fundamental entitlements of each individual. Consequently, legislative power is subject to the preeminence of these rights, as many of them are rooted in natural law doctrine.

The inquiry persists whether these fundamental rights are preexisting inalienable rights, existing prior to statehood, as they embody the essential conditions for human freedom. These rights transcend localised legal statutes, establishing themselves as higher laws commensurate with universal human rights principles.

Historically, thinkers like Alexander Hamilton have asserted that these rights are inscribed in the very essence of human nature. He posited: 'The sacred rights of mankind are not to be rummaged for, among old parchments or musty records. They are written, as with a sunbeam, in the whole volume of human nature, by the hand of the divinity itself; and can never be erased or obscured by mortal power.'

Additionally, John Adams articulated these principles succinctly, emphasizing the antecedent nature of rights over any form of governance, proclaiming them to be immutable, sourced from the overarching divine structure underpinning human society.

It is imperative to draw a distinction between natural rights and civil rights. While natural rights exist inherently and universally, civil rights are often constructed within the framework of societal structures. Thomas Paine aptly noted that civil rights, while foundationally rooted in natural rights, rely on governance systems to secure their enforcement and protection.

Thus, William Blackstone elucidated the nuanced relationship between natural and civil laws, asserting that the law of nature—deemed superior due to its divine and universal origins—binds all societies across all times and takes precedence over humanmade laws.

Historically, natural laws have substantially influenced the evolution of positive legislation across multiple jurisdictions. They fueled the development of equitable frameworks in English law and profoundly impacted the drafting of both the U.S. Constitution and the legal frameworks of numerous states. Such fundamental concepts also serve as the bedrock for modern international law, encompassing various treaties, conventions, and declarations.

Confined within the broader narrative of constitutionalism with a limited government ethos ensconced within a written constitution, it becomes evident that such a document draws its philosophical foundations from the principles of natural law and the idea of a ‘higher law.’ This higher law gained prominence following the ratification of the American Constitution in 1787, recognized as the first comprehensive written Constitution establishing a true confederation.

In the wake of extensive deliberations and discussions in the Constituent Assembly, India's written Constitution was adopted, embedding the provision for judicial review and promoting a framework of limited governance. Any assertion prior that parlance sovereignty is unquestioned would fundamentally negate the very essence of constitutionalism within India. The Supreme Court emphatically upheld this notion in Golaknath v. State of Punjab, declaring that 'No authority under the Constitution is supreme: the Constitution is supreme and all authorities function under its supreme law.'

In the English legal sphere, parliamentary sovereignty traditionally rested upon the prudence of the populace within a responsible governance framework. As reflected upon by Lord Wright in Liversidge v. Anderson, the safeguarding of British liberty relied heavily upon the collective wisdom of its citizens operating within this developed system.

In modern judicial thought, however, many jurists in England are recognizing the necessity for imposed restrictions on parliamentary sovereignty. Richard O'Sullivan, in his Hamlyn Lecture titled 'The Inheritance of the Common Law' (1950), suggested that allowing the actions of the legislature to supersede fundamental ethical principles may be detrimental to the health of political communities. He further argued that a constitutional guarantee of fundamental human rights is essential, asserting the peculiar irony of relying solely on external declarations of international law for the protection of domestic rights.

Recent developments in the legal landscape of England significantly shifted following the implementation of the Human Rights Act (HRA) on October 2, 2000, coinciding with the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi, a historical figure prominent in the battle for human rights in India. The HRA has fundamentally altered the landscape of administrative justice in England, leading Lord Irvine to remark that 'No measure of law reform has had such wide and profound effects on administrative law as has the HRA.'

Upon its enactment, the HRA was heralded by Home Secretary Jack Straw as ‘the first Bill of Rights this country has seen for three centuries,’ embodying a transformative approach to rights protection: Section 3 mandates that courts interpret all regulations in a manner compatible with conventional rights, while Section 4 empowers courts to issue declarations of incompatibility whenever any legislative provisions contravene these rights. The provisions outlined in Schedule 1 of the HRA categorize specific human rights enforceable within domestic statutes, allowing for interpretive conformity.

The interpretative powers thus conferred upon the courts have been accurately termed a "strong adjuration," applying retroactively to laws pre and postHRA. Article 13 of the Indian Constitution echoes this principle, asserting that laws enacted prior to or after the Constitution's ratification cannot contravene fundamental rights; thus, any such law would be rendered null and void.

Sections 2, 3, and 4 establish guiding parameters on how courts should address incompatibility questions, taking into consideration precedents and advisory opinions from the European Convention on Human Rights. However, while these judicial declarations do not inherently nullify the validity of the contested laws, they have spurred potential legislative remedies.

Section 10 provides parliamentary mechanisms for addressing declarations of incompatibility, whereby ministers can enact amendments to rectify any identified conflicts. Moreover, Section 19 stipulates that ministers may signal the compatibility of legislative proposals with human rights during parliamentary introduction, thereby contributing to a climate of accountability and oversight.

This evolution of the HRA has transformed the English judicial framework into an avenue of constitutional law, elevating the courts' profiles and enhancing their authority in public law matters. It reinforces the dual principles of limited governance and adherence to the higher law within British jurisprudence.

Lord Chancellor Irvine articulated this philosophical pivot, asserting the necessity of court compatibility with the Convention, extending beyond interactions with public authorities to encompass developments within common law involving private disputes. Such inquiries have been profoundly examined by legal scholars; Professor Wade noted that the integration of human rights principles into the common law framework highlights the need for courts to navigate conflicts between legislative statutes and the established rights framework.

In the United States, the judiciary's power has often encompassed the authority to perform judicial review, striking down unconstitutional acts of Congress. This concept revolves around the premise that any legislation lacking constitutional grounding is devoid of legal force, as emphasized by Alexander Hamilton in his Federalist Papers. He argued for judicial interpretation to ascertain the Constitution's supremacy over any contradictory parliamentary action, underscoring that neither executive nor legislative authority can void the people's will as articulated in the Constitution.

Consequently, the judiciary functions as the guardian of constitutional limitations over legislative power, being the sole authority responsible for asserting when statutory actions contravene the established Constitutional framework. Hamilton articulated this necessity with exceptional clarity, elucidating that effective checks on legislative overreach can only be achieved through the courts, which hold the responsibility for declaring laws that counter the Constitution as void—failing to do so would render the rights and privileges sought under the Constitution meaningless.

In India, this framework embodies a commitment to a system rooted in limited government through the lens of judicial review, reinforcing the higher law principles articulated in Part III of the Constitution. Article 13 establishes that the state cannot craft any laws that ‘take away’ or ‘abridge’ the fundamental rights enshrined, rendering any violation thereof void ab initio. This conferred power uniquely resides with the judiciary, illustrating a critical dimension of the Indian constitutional paradigm.

Further, Article 19 facilitates the imposition of reasonable restrictions on fundamental rights, leaving the determination of such reasonableness squarely within the purview of judicial interpretation. Article 32 solidifies the judiciary's capacity to enforce fundamental rights, as any individual has the authority to approach the Supreme Court for redressal, establishing it as a fundamental right in itself. Dr. Ambedkar's reflections on this article emphasized its pivotal role in maintaining the Constitution's integrity and functional efficacy.

Article 226 empowers the High Courts to implement judicial review concerning violations of fundamental rights or other legal rights. The expanse of this power has been articulated clearly by the Supreme Court, which, as early as 1955, established that both the Supreme Court and High Courts possess extensive authority to issue various orders, writs, or directives essential for enforcing fundamental rights.

The scope of judicial review is consequently more robust in India than in England, where recent judicial trends have shown a gradual strengthening of these powers. Articles 141 and 142 position the Supreme Court uniquely, permitting it to declare legal precedents that hold binding authority across all Indian courts. This jurisdiction extends beyond mere legislative enactment, indicating a distinctive aspect of the Indian legal framework.

The interplay between lawmaking and judicial authority is encapsulated in President Franklin D. Roosevelt's insights, which poignantly reflected the judicial capacity to influence the legislative landscape through interpretation—a process that inherently reshapes societal norms and ideologies.

In summation, Article 142 empowers the Supreme Court to enact necessary orders and decrees required for achieving complete justice in pending matters, in conjunction with Article 136, granting it vast discretionary powers in exercising judicial review. This unique feature of the Indian Constitution fortifies the judiciary's role and its substantial influence in shaping societal frameworks.

The landmark ruling in Kesavananda Bharati established judicial review as a basic structure of the Constitution—a sentiment echoed in subsequent rulings, including L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India, consolidating the understanding that judicial review is an inherent characteristic of constitutional governance.

In light of this constitutional mandate, the jurisprudential contributions of the Supreme Court of India have significantly shaped legislative developments and fundamentally altered aspects of Indian social life. These judgments, rendered in a nation with a populace exceeding 1.2 billion, represent not only the apex of constitutional adjudication within the world's largest democracy but also serve as influential precedents in shaping global legal standards and doctrines.

In the pursuit of understanding the landmark judgments that have significantly transformed India, I have opted to categorize these monumental decisions into distinct groups. The primary group focuses on the contentious debate concerning the Parliament's authority to amend the Constitution versus the Supreme Court's power of judicial review over such amendments. Central to this debate is a pivotal question: can Parliament, under the guise of constitutional amendment, obliterate the fundamental features embedded within the Constitution? This important debate prominently emerged in at least six seminal judgments, which are worthy of detailed examination:

1. Sri Shankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India and State of Bihar (AIR 1951 SC 458)
   
2. Sajjan Singh v. State of Rajasthan (AIR 1965 SC 845)

3. I.C. Golaknath and Ors v. State of Punjab and Anr (AIR 1967 SC 1643)

4. Kesavananda Bharati Sripadagalvaru and Ors v. State of Kerala and Anr ([1973] 4 SCC 225)

5. Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Shri Raj Narain and Anr (1975 Supp SCC 1)

6. Minerva Mills Ltd and Ors v. Union of India and Ors (AIR 1980 SC 1789)

The capacity to amend a Constitution often reflects its fundamental nature. For instance, the Constitution of England, largely unwritten, resembles an intricate tapestry crafted over centuries, with monarchy as its warp and the indefatigable spirit of the descendants of the first AngloSaxon invaders as its woof. This constitutional framework is influenced by a mix of constitutional values and doctrines, permitting amendments through a simple majority of the legislature or through judicial rulings unobstructed by the state. Additionally, international treaties, customs, and longstanding practices that have attained constitutional significance can also facilitate amendments. A contemporary example is the Human Rights Act (HRA) of 1998, which, articulating the rights enshrined in the European Convention, has recently assumed the status of a constitutional document and plays a crucial role in shaping English constitutional law.

Conversely, the American Constitution incorporates a rigorous amendment process outlined in Article 5, which necessitates the concurrence of twothirds of both houses of Congress for proposed amendments, or a twothirds majority of state legislatures mandating a constitutional convention. Such amendments must then receive ratification from threefourths of state legislatures or conventions, ensuring that no alteration can undermine a state’s equal voting rights in the Senate without their explicit consent.

In Australia, the Constitution stipulates under Chapter 8 that proposed amendments must initiate from an absolute majority in both houses. After the proposal passes, a national referendum is required if only one house approves it. The necessity for a dual majority—both a national majority and a majority in four out of six states—renders constitutional amendments a challenging endeavor.

Within the Indian Constitution, several provisions address amendments, specifically Article 368, which mandates a majority of the total membership of both houses of Parliament and a twothirds majority of members present and voting. Ratification by at least half of the state legislatures is necessary for certain segments of the Constitution. Over the years, the Indian Constitution has been amended over a hundred times. Notably, Parts III and IV exclusively—pertaining to fundamental rights and the directive principles of state policy—are amendable without requiring state ratification. This situation has invariably fueled significant controversy since the initial discussions surrounding constitutional amendments, starting with the Shankari Prasad case.

Notably, Article 13(2), found in Part III of the Constitution, asserts that the state—including Parliament—cannot enact any law that abridges or cancels the rights conferred by Part III. Any law made in contravention is deemed void.

The crux of the question arises as to whether a constitutional amendment qualifies as ‘law’ within the context of Article 13. In the Shankari Prasad judgment, Justice Patanjali Shastri observed that “in the absence of clear indications to the contrary,” it would be challenging to assert that fundamental rights are "immune from Constitutional Amendment." He also affirmed that Article 368's language is broad and empowers Parliament “to amend the Constitution without exceptions.” Based on this reasoning, the Supreme Court unanimously concluded in Shankari Prasad that under Article 13, the term ‘law’ does not encompass constitutional amendments made in the exercise of constituent powers.

In resolving the apparent conflict between Articles 368 and 13(2), the Supreme Court relied on the doctrine of harmonious construction. This doctrine facilitated the upholding of the First Amendment of the Constitution, which led to the addition of the 9th Schedule. A similarly framed question arose in the Sajjan Singh case concerning the constitutional validity of the Constitution (17th Amendment) Act of 1964. Chief Justice Gajendragadkar's judgment notably emphasized that the dictionary definition of ‘amend’ should not dictate the interpretation of the term in Article 368. It was reasoned that the power to amend, in the context of Article 368, is expansive and cannot be constrained by mere literal definitions.

It is important to note that while the Chief Justice made sweeping assertions, his reasoning did not follow a clear, discernible trajectory beyond the rationale provided in Shankari Prasad, which had previously upheld the First Amendment.

On reflection, some may argue that the analysis rendered in Shankari Prasad lacks cognitive strength. In referencing the analysis of legal scholar A.V. Dicey, the reasoning adopted by the learned judge conveys a rather superficial understanding of constituent power. Many critics, including Mr. Nariman, identified a deficiency in the approach adopted by the learned judge, highlighting an absence of a 'positivist perspective’ wherein the exploration of constitutional nuances was neglected. The judge’s constant lamentation for clearer legislative intent likely clouded judgment and contributed to the conclusion that fundamental rights lack inherent immunity from constitutional amendments. The conflict between Articles 13 and 368 was, rather dubiously, resolved through the lens of harmonious construction, a method more suited for statutory interpretation than for constitutional analysis.

Regrettably, it appears that the learned judge did not adhere to the contemporary approach proposed by Justice Vivian Bose regarding constitutional interpretation. Justice Bose asserted that the words of the Constitution should not be seen as “dull, lifeless words static and hidebound like some mummified manuscripts, but as living flames... dynamic expressions capable of guiding the present and molding the future.” Similarly, Justice Felix Frankfurter, in the Steel Seizure Case, argued against a “narrow conception of American Constitutional Law" that disregards the evolving meanings that life has inscribed upon constitutional texts.

Legal scholar Lawrence H. Tribe posited that a genuine interpretation of the Constitution must reflect a thorough understanding of its inherent complexities. This assertion underscores the notion that the Indian Constitution, like its counterparts across the globe, cannot be reduced to simplistic interpretations that overlook its intended spirit and broader implications.

In the Sajjan Singh case, the Supreme Court established that the Parliament's constituent power may be exercised both prospectively and retrospectively. By adhering to the conclusions reached in Shankari Prasad, the majority opinion in Sajjan Singh reinforced that the term ‘law’ in Article 13 is not to include constitutional amendments executed under Article 368, given their reliance on constituent authority. Despite the upholding of the 17th Constitutional Amendment Act by Justice Hidayatullah, he clearly articulated his dissent regarding the reasoning established in Shankari Prasad. He contended that fundamental rights transcend mere legislative considerations and thus should not become subjects of malleable parliamentary whims or special majorities.

Justice Hidayatullah’s rejection of the notion that the chapter on fundamental rights could rest on shakier ground than other constitutional provisions demanding ratification cannot be overlooked. Just as importantly, he emphasized the absurdity of ratifying an amendment pertaining to Article 226 while not doing so for Article 32, ultimately declining to take on the role of a “grammarian" in discerning the Constitution. Thus, he refrained from articulating a conclusive stance on whether the amendment law is indeed outside the purview of Article 13(2).

Justice Mudholkar, while supporting the validity of the 17th Constitutional Amendment Act, distinctly asserted that the perspective taken in Shankari Prasad should not be viewed as absolute. He was among the first to raise the critical inquiry surrounding the Constitution's basic framework and insisted on preserving its “permanence,” arguing that any amendments that compromise this integrity effectively lead to the rewriting of the Constitution itself.

Consequently, the seeds for the later doctrine of unamendability of fundamental rights took root in the opinions expressed by Justices Hidayatullah and Mudholkar.

The tensions between legislative power and judicial protection of fundamental rights reached a final resolution in the majority ruling in the landmark case of I.C. Golaknath v. State of Punjab and Ors. Here, the Chief Justice leaned heavily on a lecture delivered by the German scholar Dieter Conrad, which dealt with the “Implied Limitations of the Amending Power."

In a narrowly divided court session, the Golaknath verdict was delivered by a slim majority of six to five. The validity of the 1st, 4th, and 17th Constitutional Amendment Acts came under scrutiny during this case. The majority opinion concluded that these amendments curtailed the scope of fundamental rights. Nevertheless, recognizing that prior Supreme Court rulings had deemed those amendments valid, they determined that these amendments would remain valid in light of the principle of prospective overruling; however, with the ruling in Golaknath, it was established that Parliament could no longer make amendments to any provisions in Part III of the Constitution, nor could it ‘abridge or take away the fundamental rights enshrined therein.’

The ruling in Golaknath marked a watershed moment in India's political, social, and constitutional trajectory. It became evident that the Supreme Court, by revising its interpretative methods, was stepping into a role resembling that of a legislative authority. The majority opinion in Golaknath effectively overturned the precedents established by Shankari Prasad and Sajjan Singh, asserting that constitutional amendments qualify as ‘law’ as defined under Article 13(2) and thus become void if they violate fundamental rights. This pivotal decision initiated a profound confrontation between the authority of Parliament and the supremacy of the judiciary, a conflict much more substantial than the earlier disputes evidenced in Sajjan Singh.

The majority judgment within Golaknath asserted that the amending power lies not within Article 368 itself, which merely delineates the procedure but derives from Entry 97 in List I of Schedule VII. Consequently, any amendment to the Constitution constituted ‘law’ for purposes of Article 13(2).

Nevertheless, the underlying rationale established in Golaknath clearly placed restrictions on Parliament's amending powers and imposed constraints on legislative majorities. The implications of this ruling were inherently countermajoritarian, rooted in the belief that fundamental rights equate to natural rights, which should remain inviolable and not be subject to majoritarian decisions. The implications of the Golaknath verdict favored a literal and positivist interpretation of Articles 13(2) and 368. Despite this, the thencentral government viewed the decision in Golaknath as a hindrance to its progress towards achieving socialist ideals.

In a strategic attempt to circumvent the implications of the Golaknath verdict, the Constitution (24th Amendment) Act, 1971, was swiftly enacted, which included significant modifications to Article 368. This amendment unequivocally declared that Article 13(2) would not be applicable in the context of constitutional amendments and modified the marginal note to Article 368. As a result, Parliament was granted authority to either curtail or abolish fundamental rights, thereby bestowing unrestricted powers to its amending capacity.

In 1970, His Holiness Swami Kesavananda Bharati, head of a monastic institution in Kerala, took legal action against the Kerala government’s land reform policies by petitioning the Supreme Court under Article 32, seeking to protect the fundamental rights of religious institutions concerning property management. As the writ petition progressed, the constitutional landscape shifted with the introduction of the 24th Constitution Amendment Act, subsequently followed by the Constitution (25th Amendment) Act, 1971, and the Constitution (29th Amendment) Act, 1972.

The 29th Constitution Amendment Act saw the Kerala Land Reforms Act incorporated into the 9th Schedule. The legitimacy of these amendments was contested during ongoing Article 32 proceedings among five judges. By August 1972, the matter had escalated, landing before a thirteenjudge bench at a time when the Supreme Court was comprised of fifteen judges. This momentous case was deliberated from November 1972 to April 1973.

In Kesavananda Bharati, from the thirteen judges, ten opined that Golaknath had been wrongly decided and needed to be overruled— a consensus that, indeed, came to fruition. In stark contrast, Chief Justice Sikri and Justice Shelat, two judges previously aligned with the majority in Golaknath, reached differing conclusions.

In the ruling of Kesavananda Bharati, the prevailing majority established that the amending power of Parliament distinguishes itself from legislative power and is sufficiently extensive to encompass every aspect of the Constitution. Nevertheless, this proposition was refined by asserting the unamendability of the Constitution's basic structure. This judgment notably introduced the concept of constitutional entrenchment, designed to safeguard specific sections of the Constitution from amendments. Essentially, the majority opinion articulated that intrinsic moral principles undergird the Constitution, suggesting there exist boundaries to permissible change that prevent any alteration from undermining constitutional values. Thus, the constitution's basic structure is fundamentally interwoven with constitutionalism as opposed to being purely democratic.

The Kesavananda Bharati decision emerges as a monumental contribution, as thirteen judges rendered eleven separate opinions. A shared perspective was established regarding the amending powers asserted in the 24th Constitutional Amendment Act. Notably, six judges—among them Chief Justice Sikri, Justice Shelat, Justice Grover, Justice Hedge, Justice Mukherjee, and Justice Jagmohan Reddy—while upholding the Parliament's power to amend the Constitution, expressed the view that this authority should not be invoked in a manner that undermines the Constitution's core structures, which fundamentally include the preservation of fundamental rights.

Despite the lengthy and segmented opinions in Kesavananda Bharati, which unfortunately left many crucial questions open to interpretation, the ruling itself constituted a pivotal moment in the evolution of constitutional law in India. It is a landmark decision that must be recognized as a significant contribution from the Supreme Court to constitutional jurisprudence. In this case, the Court not only acknowledged Parliament's plenary amending powers but also effectively dismantled the limitations imposed by Article 13, as previously established in Golaknath. Concurrently, the ruling expanded the scope of judicial review in relation to the basic structure, positing that any valid exercise of amending power must align with the core constitutional integrity, as articulated by esteemed legal scholar Upendra Baxi.

The notion of implied limitations on the amendment powers of the Constitution, as elucidated in Kesavananda Bharati, some legal scholars contend, may have inadvertently reinforced the foundational principles established by the Golaknath verdict.

Upon examining the amended powers outlined in the Constitution, it becomes apparent that beyond Article 368, the term ‘amendment’ occurs within various provisions, such as Articles 4(1), 107, 111, 161(2), and 372, as well as in Paragraph 7 of Part D of the 5th Schedule and Paragraph 21(1) of the 6th Schedule. These provisions differ from Article 368 and are intricately linked to the concept of basic structure, which is specifically attributable to the powers granted to Parliament under Article 368.

The doctrine of basic structure, while not explicitly articulated in the Constitution, is deeply rooted within the framework of implied limitations associated with the amendment powers under Article 368. Justice Vivian Bose once remarked that the language of the Constitution should not recognize “dull, lifeless words static and hidebound as in some mummified manuscripts,” but rather embrace words as “living flames intended to breathe life into a great nation—dynamic forces capable of shaping the immediate future while guiding the present."

In conjunction, Chief Justice Sikri emphasized that the interpretation of constitutional language cannot occur independently from its socioeconomic and political contexts, underscoring the importance of various influential judicial authorities in upholding this principle. The arguments and observations made by Justice Holmes further reinforced the idea that the meaning of constitutional language is mutable, colored by evolving circumstances and contemporary understandings.

In analysis, the concept of implied limitations on Parliament's amending authority under Article 368 emerges as a nuanced interpretation—a recognition that the Constitution’s silences speak volumes. As Michael Foley articulately put forth in his work “The Silence of Constitutions,” both the spoken and unspoken implications of constitutional text wield considerable influence over its practical application.

In the context of the majority ruling in Kesavananda Bharati, Chief Justice Sikri underscored that the term 'amendment' should not be permitted to embrace an excessively extensive interpretation.

By firmly advocating for the Theory of Implied Limitations, the Chief Justice asserted that unchecked amending powers could lead, unchecked, to totalitarian governance and the subjugation of the populace, ultimately perpetuating a situation where the Constitution itself becomes resistant to necessary adaptations. His perspective remained rooted in the original aspirations and scope of the Constitution. While endorsing the 24th Amendment, he cautioned against using it to alter the fundamental features that define the Constitution’s identity, particularly regarding fundamental rights.

While Chief Justice Sikri did not regard the directive principles of state policy as integral to the Constitution's essential structure, upon examining the 25th Amendment, he ruled that Article 31C was unconstitutional. In doing so, he embraced a rightscentric viewpoint, contending that it was inappropriate for directive principles to take precedence over fundamental rights; nonetheless, he upheld the legitimacy of Article 31(2).

Justices Shelat and Grover concurred with the notion of implied limitations on the amending powers. They held that India's Constitution was designed to foster an egalitarian society that promotes development in social, economic, and political dimensions, without encroaching upon essential freedoms. They upheld the 25th Amendment Act, save for its Section 3, which introduced Article 31C. This article, they deemed unconstitutional as it negated the fundamental rights protected under Articles 14, 19, and 31, asserting that the exclusive power to amend should not devolve to any alternate legislative body.

Both Justices Shelat and Grover recognized the structural unity of the Constitution, siding with Chief Justice Sikri in maintaining that powers of amendment cannot be solely confined by the proviso to Article 368. They insisted that Article 368 warrants a narrow construction, demanding that other “aids of interpretation,” particularly the Preamble, significantly inform any analysis of amendments. They expressed that the scope of constitutional authority and its representative nature should not be conflated with the people's original power to confer the Constitution, emphasizing that the basic theory of our Constitution is rooted in the people, who exercised their will as guided through the Constituent Assembly.

Justices Shelat and Grover posited the following as basic features of the Constitution:

1. The supremacy of the Constitution.
  
2. The republican and democratic form of government and the sovereignty of the country.
  
3. The secular and federal character of the Constitution.
  
4. The clear demarcation of authority among the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary.
  
5. The dignity and rights of individuals safeguarded by the array of freedoms enshrined in Part III and the directive to create a welfare state outlined in Part IV.
  
6. The unity and integrity of the nation.

However, they appropriately noted that the enumerated basic features were not exhaustive.

Justices Hegde and Mukherjee advanced the perspective that no limitations should exist around the amending power under Article 368, emphasizing it could encompass any segment of the Constitution. They stressed that the interpretation of ‘law’ in Article 13(2) must be harmonized with Article 368; they reasoned that the identity and essence of the Constitution must remain intact, and any concession to limitless amending power could threaten democratic principles.

They underscored that the fundamental structure of the Constitution—permanent in nature—should not be diminished by amendments. Their reasoning was buttressed by Article 60, detailing the President's oath to preserve and protect the Constitution, implying that no amendment could be sanctioned that disrupted the Constitution's foundational elements. Consequently, Justices Hegde and Mukherjee also invalidated the clause (c) of the 25th Amendment, which introduced Article 31C.

They turned to the concept of ‘popular sovereignty’, indicating that the Preamble expressed a foundational truth: the Indian populace conferred the Constitution upon themselves. Thus, challenges to this conferred authority could not be contested in courts that themselves are creations of this Constitution. They concluded that while Parliament was endowed with amending powers, the ultimate sovereignty—and moral authority—resides with the people. 

The judges articulated, "When a power to amend the Constitution is allocated to the people, its scope is inherently broader than that granted to an institution established by the Constitution."

Additionally, the judges recognized that the Constitution must be anchored in a social philosophy, and that essential aspects of this philosophy—much like religious tenets—include nonnegotiable fundamental features. Some features are so integral to the Constitution’s identity that they cannot be dismantled from within.

Justice Jagmohan Reddy, while generally in alignment with Chief Justice Sikri, sought to address the central question regarding the scope of Parliament’s amending powers under Article 368. He proposed that the court might consider two contrasting interpretations: the first viewed the amending power as ‘omnisovereign’, reflecting Justice Holmes' views, while the second favored a structural and teleological interpretation, contrasting with an analytical or literal approach. Reddy ultimately leaned toward the latter, advocating that interpretations of constitutional provisions should encapsulate national aspirations, objectives debated within the Constituent Assembly, essential individual rights, state duties, legislative power distribution, and the state's amending powers. He concluded, “Our Constitution is supported by numerous props; remove any of these, and the structure will collapse. These props encompass: (1) Sovereign Democratic Republic; (2) Justice—social, economic, and political; (3) Liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith, and worship; and (4) Equality of status and opportunity."

Justice H.R. Khanna's opinion has garnered notable recognition in framing the majority in Kesavananda Bharati. His insights, while not fully embraced by the other judges, have nonetheless become established law. The common thread between Justice Khanna and the other advocates for citizens’ rights is the conviction that Parliament, when amending the Constitution, cannot alter its essential framework, including the fundamental democratic character of the republic, nor can it undermine the integrity of India or obliterate its states.

Justice Khanna identified specific inherent limitations within the concept of amendment. He elucidated that certain limitations are implicit in the interpretation of the term ‘amendment’ itself and are interrelated with its contextual understanding. At this juncture, he emphasized that the process of amending the Constitution cannot engage in abrogation, as it entails the loss of the Constitution's essential identity. He firmly opined:

"Engagement with the question of what constitutes amendment should not infer a quarterly inquiry into whether the power under Article 368 includes the authority to entirely dissolve and replace the Constitution with a new one. I would respond to this inquiry in the negative. Amendments entail revisions that preserve the surviving essence of the Constitution while accommodating changes."

Justice Khanna further elaborated that maintaining the old Constitution entails safeguarding its basic structure or framework.

His pronouncements also clarified that the language of Article 368 reinforces the position that one cannot, while acting under that Article, seek to repeal the Constitution and replace it with a new one. Furthermore, he ruled that the second part of Article 31C, which precludes judicial review, contradicted the Constitution’s fundamental architecture and exceeded the permissible confines of amendment under Article 368. However, his judgment also recognized that the right to property should not be considered part of the Constitution's basic structure.

Justice Khanna's jurisprudence stemmed from a distinguished moral reasoning, introducing what could be described as a morally inclined interpretation of the Constitution, advocating for both procedural and substantive reviews. A procedural review considers the propriety of procedures taken in decisionmaking, while a substantive review delves deeper into the substantive impact of decisions.

Justice Khanna conclusively acknowledged the nonnegotiable nature of the basic structure of the Constitution. He advocated that the Constitution is sovereign, adopted by the people whose sovereignty merges with constitutional authority, endowing it with inherent moral features that are beyond alteration through amendments under Article 368.

To grasp the jurisprudence underpinning the majority view in Kesavananda Bharati requires an essential distinction to be made between mere interpretation of constitutional text and the creative construction of that text to generate innovative approaches to constitutional values.

While interpretative efforts must maintain fidelity to the text, they cannot merely exist to extract hidden meanings. This nuanced approach in Kesavananda Bharati differentiates itself from prior judicial inclinations, such as those seen in A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras, Shankari Prasad, and Sajjan Singh. A judicial statesman requires a valuedriven perspective rather than a reliance solely on rigid textualism. 

The construction of constitutional provisions should lead to an enrichment of the constitutional fabric, making it a creative process distinct from straightforward textual interpretation.

A reference to Ronald Dworkin’s theories illuminates this perspective, suggesting judicial review doesn't inherently present countermajoritarian concerns. His assertion describes constitutionalism as protective against populist excesses: “The Constitution, particularly the Bill of Rights, serves to safeguard individuals and minority groups against majoritydriven decisions.” He emphasizes that impactful protection is encouraged by the moral rights individuals possess against the majority.

Dworkin, in “Law’s Empire,” advances a vision of rights tied intrinsically to a commitment to democracy—though not confined merely to majoritarian principles.

This assertion reflects a fundamental truth underpinning any democratic constitution, which typically harbors latent countermajoritarian elements. The Indian Constitution aligns with this structure, through the acknowledgment of universal fundamental freedoms, extending protection even to noncitizens—a trait positioning it as a charter for human rights. Furthermore, it guarantees a range of provisions for minority rights.

In upholding core constitutional values, the judiciary must derive principles from a countermajoritarian framework. To satisfactorily adjudicate constitutional challenges, the apex court melds the original intent of the Constitution with a broader sense of constitutionalism that fosters a just social framework. Thus, judicial engagement requires transcending apparent barriers of meaning through the nuanced unraveling of constitutional text. In this vein, Alexander M. Bickel aptly noted, “The root difficulty lies in the realization that judicial review is a powerful countermajoritarian influence within our system.

The justification for the basic structure doctrine finds firm roots in Article 38, which imposes a duty on the state, including the judiciary, to promote the welfare of the citizenry through the assurance of a just social order. In turn, this reflects the guiding vision of the Preamble. Larry Simon's view resonates here as well; he suggests that evaluative criteria supporting differing interpretative methodologies must prioritize the promotion of a just society, drawing from political and moral theoretical perspectives.

The evolution of a reformed approach in Kesavananda Bharati emerged from a judicial acknowledgment that while the Parliament's powers are extensive, they are not unlimited. On certain occasions, the highest court may recognize that the constitutional text is "incurably incomplete," following H.L.A. Hart's insights regarding the complexities surrounding constitutional interpretation. Hart highlighted the emergence of issues at the fringes, arguing that judicial interpretation alone cannot adequately address perceived gaps in the law—filling such gaps requires an active interpretative function, a role distinct from jurisprudential analysis.

In handling these gaps, the silences of the Constitution play a significant role in conferring essential discretion upon judges. Both Dworkin and Hart suggest that such judicial reasoning demands an integration of natural law principles into the realm of positive law. Through this lens, the judge—or judicial authority—must engage moral principles to augment the law in a coherent manner.

This monumental task of establishing jurisdiction over the basic structure of the Constitution was undertaken by the Supreme Court in Kesavananda Bharati. The consequential philosophy and interpretative framework can trace its roots to these juristic notions.

Subsequently, the doctrine of basic structure continued to resurface in the compelling case of Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj Narain, commonly known as the Election Case. The factual matrix is significant in the context of India’s political and social history. Indira Gandhi, then Prime Minister, challenged a judgment delivered on June 12, 1975, by the Allahabad High Court, which implicated her in electoral misconduct. Contingent upon the Supreme Court's hearing of the appeal, Justice Krishna Iyer granted interim relief, barring her from voting or participating in parliamentary debates, pending the outcome of the case. Just a few days later, on June 26, 1975, a national Emergency was declared throughout India.

In the interim prior to the appeal's adjudication, Parliament enacted the Election Laws Amendment Act, effective from August 6, 1975. This was closely followed by efforts on August 7, 1975, to amend Article 71 with the introduction of the Constitution (39th Amendment) Act, which purported to empower Parliament with special provisions relating to electoral disputes for the Prime Minister and Speaker. The swift progression saw this bill receive approval from both houses and subsequent ratification by several state legislatures within a mere span of five days.

This marked a watershed moment, as for the first time in any democracy—globally—this expeditious constitutional amendment served a single litigant's interests, thus parodying the integrity expected of constitutional procedure.

The amendment, for the first time, ventured into establishing an intersection where Parliament attempted to wield judicial authority by resolving a pending electoral dispute through constitutional means. 

Upon adjudication, the Supreme Court unanimously declared the Allahabad High Court’s judgment void. However, in assessing the validity of Article 329A introduced through this amendment, the Supreme Court invalidated the provisions as they clashed with the fundamental structure of the Constitution, although differing judicial perspectives informed their reasoning. Nonetheless, all five judges acknowledged the binding nature of the majority view established in Kesavananda Bharati regarding the basic structure, regardless of their previous dissenting opinions on that issue.

Chief Justice A.N. Ray recognized inherent shortcomings in clause (4) of Article 329A, raising concerns about its conflict with the rule of law. He also identified that this clause represented an undue wielding of judicial power. 

Justice Khanna, a key member of the majority from the Kesavananda Bharati judgment, reiterated the stance that no constitutional amendment could compromise the Constitution's basic structure. Justice Khanna's ruling emphasized that democracy itself constitutes a fundamental structure of the Constitution; thus, he deemed all clauses under subarticle (4) of Article 329A introduced through the 39th Constitutional Amendment Act unconstitutional. Justice Khanna declared:

“I strike down clause (4) of Article 329A as it violates the principle of free and fair elections, an essential component of democracy, which is itself intertwined with the Constitution's basic structure as it seeks to eliminate forums for legal disputes relating to election validity while simultaneously declaring the election's validity as absolute, devoid of any avenue for challenge.”

Justice Mathew affirmed that the consensus evident within the Kesavananda Bharati opinion holds that Parliament's powers conferred by Article 368 do not span unlimited reach. He further opined that there existed a consensus on democracy's foundational role within the Constitution's basic structure.

Following these assertions, Justice Mathew determined that clause (4) of Article 329A improperly assumed functions traditionally reserved for judicial authority by rendering the Prime Minister’s election immune to legal scrutiny. He deemed this approach as legislation crafted ‘ad hominem,’ a direct interference with judicial determinations intended for the Supreme Court.

Justice Beg, in his thorough analysis, posited that arguments supporting the impugned amendment were untenable and in direct contradiction to the principles outlined in the Kesavananda Bharati choice. He specifically articulated that it could not simply assign judicial power to legislative authority, a proposition contrary to the constitutional principles enshrined within India's democratic framework.

Justice Chandrachud, while also invalidating clauses (4) and (5) of Article 329A, argued that while democracy is integral to the Constitution, its mere existence does not eliminate the essential democratic integrity encapsulated by the Constitution. He critiqued the amendment for establishing a classification that failed the Doctrine of Reasonable Classification, suggesting that it effectively perpetrated favored treatment, directly undermining the equitable tenets supporting democracy.

The election case's significance lies not just in its immediate legal implications but in reinforcing the validity of the majority opinion expressed in Kesavananda Bharati while augmenting the discourse on constituent authority by reaffirming the hierarchy of constitutional integrity.

The Minerva Mills case represents yet another landmark decision, as it firmly prevented Parliament’s attempts to bypass the basic structure doctrine articulated in Kesavananda Bharati through the enactment of the Constitution (42nd Amendment) Act of 1976. This amendment, substantiated on January 3, 1977, sought to dismantle the vital principles upheld by the earlier ruling.

Minerva Mills, a textile company, opposed the nationalization of its operations, unable to contest the constitutional validity post42nd Amendment since this nationalization was immediately included within the 9th Schedule as per the provisions outlined therein. Through an Article 32 writ, Minerva Mills sought to challenge the constitutionality of sections 4 and 55 of the 42nd Amendment, directly invoking the precedence of the basic structure doctrine as a basis for their argument.

Key points of contention emerge from sections 4 and 55 of the Amendment:

 Section 4 mandates the modification of Article 31C, replacing earlier protections with a more comprehensive scope, thus potentially compromising elemental rights. 

 Section 55 stipulates that amendments made under Article 368, regardless of prior or subsequent enactment, shall remain beyond judicial scrutiny.

The Supreme Court, in the majority ruling delivered by Chief Justice Chandrachud alongside Justices Gupta and Kailasam on July 30, 1980, found both Sections 4 and 55 unconstitutional. Justice Bhagwati concurred with the majority judgment regarding the unconstitutionality of Section 55 while dissenting on Section 4’s validity.

Notably, Chief Justice Chandrachud, despite earlier dissenting views, strongly reinforced that Parliament's authority cannot, under Article 368, be wielded to undermine the Constitution's basic structure. His legal reasoning reverberated with the foundational principles articulated in Kesavananda Bharati.

In articulating the majority ruling, the Court deemed the amendments introduced in the 42nd Amendment Act as ultra vires Parliament's amending powers, primarily because they sought to remove constraints previously established by the Kesavananda Bharati ruling. The language within Clause (4) was seen as wholly undermining fundamental rights at the expense of the judiciary, positioning them as secondary to the legislative process—a stark contradiction to constitutional philosophy.

Furthermore, the court clarified that Clause (4) of the amendment violated Articles 14 and 19, fundamentally eroding the protections provided by these critical provisions.

Justice P.N. Bhagwati, while dissenting on Section 31C, posited that protections afforded by this clause necessitated a direct relationship with their intended outcomes, thus providing the courts a more defined role in ensuring such protections did not infringe upon basic human rights. His position illuminated the court's implicit policymaking role, a dimension contrary to earlier rulings.

Ultimately, the Minerva Mills judgment enlarged the interpretation of basic structure principles, infusing them with elements of both core conscience and the overarching scheme of the National Charter. Despite previous dissenting opinions, Chief Justice Chandrachud's ruling reasserted that judicial review remains an inextricable component of constitutional amendment processes. 

This decision thereby solidified the foundational precedence that judicial interventions cannot be dismissed, even within the expanse of constitutional amendments. Through this, the principles of due process became deeply entrenched, fortifying judicial access while affirming the primacy of fundamental rights over directive principles.

The Supreme Court's ruling in Minerva Mills proved to be a robust assertion of the established norms intended to preserve the sanctity of the Constitution, thereby enhancing its moral authority as a protector of citizens' fundamental rights against potential legislative excesses. In affording a clear precedence to fundamental rights, it fortified the structure of constitutional law in a manner that adroitly upholds procedural fairness and values enshrined within the Indian constitutional framework. 

As the narrative unfolds within the realm of constitutional jurisprudence, these landmark cases reflect a deep interplay between legislative authority and judicial oversight, reiterating the significance of safeguarding the Constitution's foundational tenets and the inalienable rights of individuals through a meticulous, balanced approach. Thus, the ongoing dialogue surrounding these principles remains crucial in preserving the integrity of India's democratic fabric.

ADM JABALPUR V. SHIVKANT SHUKLA ET AL.

The significance of the judgment in ADM Jabalpur v. Shivkant Shukla lies prominently in the remarkable dissent articulated by Justice Hans Raj Khanna. In an era often referred to as the "phony Emergency," wherein the rights and freedoms of citizens faced unprecedented encroachment, Justice Khanna emerged as a steadfast torchbearer, illuminating the path for individual liberty. His dissent did not merely challenge the majority opinion but also provided a critical foundation for the subsequent evolution of the ‘Due Process’ doctrine as underscored in the landmark case Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India and Others. This doctrine asserts that arbitrary action stands in stark contradiction to the principle of equality guaranteed under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. Furthermore, Justice Khanna’s dissent was instrumental in catalyzing profound constitutional changes, which ultimately culminated in the enactment of the Constitution (44th Amendment) Act, 1978 (hereafter referred to as the 44th Amendment Act), clarifying that the enforcement of rights under Articles 20 and 21 of the Constitution cannot be suspended by a Presidential Declaration under Article 359, even during periods of declared Emergency.

 Context and Background of the Case

The roots of this case can be traced back to a grim reality faced by numerous individuals who were detained under Section 3 (1) of the Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA). In their quest for freedom, these individuals approached various High Courts, filing petitions for habeas corpus to challenge their detention. However, the state governments promptly raised preliminary objections, contending that since the petitions relied heavily on Article 21, and given that the rights under this article had been suspended through a Presidential Order dated June 27, 1975, issued under Article 359 as a consequence of the Emergency, the petitions were essentially untenable. This argument effectively sought to dismiss the petitions at the outset.

This scenario led to a division amongst the High Courts. The High Courts of Allahabad, Bombay, Delhi, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, and Rajasthan ruled in favor of the detenues, affirming that they could contest the legality of their detention if they made a compelling case that their detention was ultra vires MISA or that the authorities had failed to adhere to the conditions stipulated within the Act. Conversely, the High Courts of Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, and Madras upheld the preliminary objections put forward by the state governments.

The various states and the Union of India subsequently approached the Supreme Court, seeking to overturn the High Courts' decisions. During the pendency of this appeal, another Presidential order was issued on January 8, 1976, under Article 359(1). This order further declared that the right to seek relief through the courts for enforcement of rights under Article 19 was also suspended, alongside any proceedings that had been initiated for these rights during the ongoing Emergency.

The matter was deliberated by a fivejudge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court, which included Chief Justice A.N. Ray and Justices H.R. Khanna, M. Hameedullah Beg, Y.V. Chandrachud, and P.N. Bhagwati. Each judge delivered separate judgments; however, the majority opinion, articulated by Chief Justice A.N. Ray, Justices M.H. Beg, Y.V. Chandrachud, and P.N. Bhagwati, upheld the government’s preliminary objection. They concluded that following the Presidential Order of June 27, 1975, no individual possessed the right to file a writ petition under Article 226 before a High Court for habeas corpus or any writ challenging the legality of a detention order that could be deemed noncompliant, illegal, or tainted by malafide intentions or extraneous considerations.

 Justice Khanna’s Dissent

In stark contrast, Justice Khanna's dissenting opinion articulated a compelling defense of constitutional values and individual liberties. He contended that Article 226, which empowers the High Court to issue writs of habeas corpus, constituted an indelible component of the Constitution. He strongly asserted that no constitutional authority was endowed with the power to suspend the High Court's jurisdiction concerning habeas corpus during an Emergency situation. His Lordship made it clear that while a Presidential Order under Article 359(1) could indeed suspend the right to seek enforcement of fundamental rights, rights emanating from statutory provisions—though not classified as fundamental rights—could still be asserted during the Emergency, irrespective of the Presidential order.

Justice Khanna further articulated that Article 21 should not be regarded as the singular authority for the right to life and personal liberty. Even in the absence of Article 21, it remains a foundational tenet of the rule of law that a state lacks the power to deprive an individual of their life or liberty without the mandate of law. This principle, deeply enshrined in the fabric of every civilized society, predates the Constitution itself, remaining intact in light of Article 372.

In a similar vein, Justice Khanna had previously highlighted these principles in his dissent in Kesavananda Bharati, contending that amendments to the Constitution that would infringe upon fundamental rights must not result in the erosion of inherent human dignity and the fundamental values of life itself. Upholding the proliberty stance espoused by the nine High Courts, Justice Khanna reiterated that the Presidential Order of June 27, 1975, could not impinge upon the maintainability of a habeas corpus petition. Notably, he refrained from determining the validity of Section 16A (9) of MISA since the matters related to habeas corpus were still subject to resolution based on merits in the High Courts.

 Aftermath and Legacy

Reflecting on the majority judgment, Chief Justice M.N. Venkatachaliah expressed, in his H.R. Khanna Memorial Lecture delivered in New Delhi on February 25, 2009, that it deserved to be "confined to the dustbin of history." In this context, he likened Khanna's dissent to that of Lord Atkins in the British case Liversidge v. Sir John Anderson. Renowned jurist Fali S. Nariman captured the gravity of the situation by characterizing the majority judgment as one of the "most deplorable decisions" of the Supreme Court, further qualifying it as "judicial pusillanimity at its worst."

The Supreme Court subsequently recognized that Justice Khanna's dissent transformed into the law of the land following the 44th Constitution Amendment Act, which modified Article 359 to make explicit that the right to seek judicial intervention for the enforcement of Articles 20 and 21 could not be suspended. This amendment overturned the earlier stipulations under Article 359, which barred access to courts concerning rights enshrined in Part III of the Constitution.

An important additional note regarding the implications of this case is that among the judges who supported the majority opinion, all but Chief Justice A.N. Ray eventually ascended to the role of Chief Justice of India. Justice Khanna, who was senior enough for this designation following Justice Ray's retirement, sadly recognized the implications of his dissent. He reportedly stated to his younger sister, “I have prepared a judgment that is going to cost me the Chief Justiceship of India,” a prescient acknowledgment of the monumental shift he had set in motion.

Justice Khanna’s dissent served not only as a monumental statement against the erosion of liberties during the Emergency but also established a legal framework ensuring access to justice. The censoring of his dissenting opinions, as noted by H.M. Seervai, reaffirms the extent to which government sought to suppress dissenting voices during that turbulent period.

Justice Khanna’s extraordinary dissent was ultimately a reinforcement of the principle of rule of law, standing resolute against arbitrary state actions. He powerfully articulated that, even in the absence of Article 21, the state carries no authority to deprive a person of life or liberty without the backing of law. Moreover, he argued persuasively that life and liberty themselves are invaluable assets that cannot be relegated to mere whims of human decisionmaking. Such interventions in the realm of life and liberty must be grounded robustly in the laws of the land.

Justice Khanna delineated the contours of the rule of law as a substantive concept, emphasizing that essential components include maintaining an absence of arbitrariness and necessitating legal authority behind actions taken adversely against individual rights. He outlined that the court’s power to protect against such arbitrary actions should be normalized in a society governed by law, where executive power derives from and is limited by law itself.

In articulating these views, Justice Khanna’s dissent not only signaled accountability and transparency but also foreshadowed the expansive interpretation of rights that would later manifest in the Supreme Court's ruling in Maneka Gandhi's case, where arbitrariness was deemed antithetical to the rule of law.

Furthermore, Khanna’s dissent heralded a significant discourse on access to justice. By affirmatively recognizing that detainees possessed the locus standi to seek judicial intervention, he significantly strengthened the notion of procedural due process, thereby illuminating the path for individuals whose liberties had been unjustly curtailed. By contrast, the majority's decision resulted in an unyielding restriction on access to justice, demonstrating a narrow interpretation of liberty during the Emergency.

Justice Khanna's dissent would later influence the formulation of the 44th Constitution Amendment Act as expressed in its Statement of Objects and Reasons, which sought to safeguard against the misuse of Emergency provisions. It underscored that the right to seek judicial recourse concerning fundamental rights, particularly those tied to life and liberty, would remain secure from suspension.

In summation, Justice Khanna’s dissent was not merely an opposing viewpoint; it was an appeal to the very spirit of the law, championing the recognition of individual liberties even amidst governmental suppression. His invocation of Chief Justice Hughes's reflection on dissent in the courts aptly encapsulates the enduring legacy of his judgment: that dissent, especially in the highest court, serves as a harbinger of legal correction and reiteration of fundamental rights. In reflecting upon the trajectory of democratic values, both the judgments of the Supreme Court and the subsequent 44th Amendment illuminated a crucial lesson: that the unyielding protection of civil liberties stands as a hallmark of democratic governance. 

It is particularly noteworthy that scholars like F.S. Nariman have drawn parallels between the majority decision in ADM Jabalpur and the infamous Dred Scott case from 1857, which ruled that a black person could not be a citizen of the United States. Just as the dissenting voices of the past, such as that of Abraham Lincoln against Dred Scott, reshaped the contours of American democracy, Justice Khanna’s dissent too would ultimately reverberate through the corridors of Indian jurisprudence, illuminating the intrinsic interconnections among civil rights, democracy, and the rule of law. The continuing discourse surrounding these judgments emphasizes the vigilance necessary in guarding against governmental overreach and the imperative to uphold the values enshrined in constitutional law.

The evolution of the Supreme Court's jurisprudence in India offers a fascinating examination of the trajectory of constitutional interpretation, particularly as it transitioned from the landmark ruling in A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras, delivered by the Constitution Bench in 1950, to the pivotal case of Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India and Ors, which saw its judgment rendered in January 1978. This journey encompasses approximately twentyeight years of legal and constitutional development that profoundly reflects the shifting paradigms in judicial thought and practice regarding fundamental rights.

At the outset, the judgments in Gopalan and Maneka Gandhi epitomize a significant swing in the judicial pendulum—from a strict, blackletter law approach in Gopalan to a more expansive and dynamic interpretation of the concept of “due process” in Maneka Gandhi. This shift not only impacted the lives of countless Indians but also reverberated through legal systems in various countries, influencing a broader global discourse on civil liberties and human rights.

The decisions arising from Maneka Gandhi and its associated cases do not primarily revolve around the nuances of constitutional amendments. Instead, they unveil a substantial paradigm shift in how the Supreme Court interpreted the fundamental guarantees enshrined within the Constitution, particularly in its chapter on fundamental rights. Fundamental rights are seen as higher laws; they mandate that all legislation enacted by the state must be in conformity with these rights post the adoption of the Constitution. If any law contradicts these rights, it is rendered void (Article 13[2] of the Constitution). Furthermore, even legislation in place before the Constitution came into effect must align with these fundamental rights and can only persist to the extent that they do not violate these rights (Article 13[1]).

Thus, the evolving interpretation of fundamental rights is central to our legal framework, impacting not only the establishment of statutory laws but also the administration of justice.

In the Gopalan case, the validity of the Preventive Detention Act of 1950 was contested primarily on two fronts:

1. Whether the Act infringed upon the guarantees enshrined in Article 21.
2. Whether it transgressed the freedoms guaranteed by Article 19.

One pivotal argument brought forth was that the procedural provisions outlined in the Act did not satisfy the requirement of "procedure established by law" as articulated in Article 21, contending that such procedures must adhere to principles of natural justice. However, Chief Justice Kania rebuffed this argument, stating unequivocally:

“The Courts are not at liberty to declare an Act void because in their opinion it is opposed to a spirit supposed to pervade the constitution but not expressed in words. Where the fundamental law has not limited, either in terms or by necessary implication, the general powers conferred upon the Legislature, we cannot declare a limitation under the notion of having discovered something in the spirit of the constitution which is not even mentioned in the instrument.”

This assertion established a precedent wherein the Court declined to scrutinize the fairness of the procedures involved, given the absence of the term "due" in Article 21. Chief Justice Kania maintained that the Constitution afforded the Legislature the ultimate authority to define the law.

On the matter of the interrelationship between Articles 19 and 21, the majority view firmly established that these articles were to be interpreted as mutually exclusive. They contended that since Article 19 made no mention of the right to life, it could not be read in conjunction with Article 21. Justice Fazl Ali, however, presented a dissenting opinion that reflected a more progressive understanding of the relationship between these rights. He argued:

“To my mind, the scheme of the chapter dealing with the fundamental rights does not contemplate what is attributed to it, namely, that each article is a code by itself and is independent of the others. In my opinion, it cannot be said that Articles 19, 20, 21 and 22 do not to some extent overlap each other.”

Justice Ali’s dissent presaged the eventual evolving consensus within the Supreme Court and provided an intellectual anchor that would later influence subsequent rulings, such as in Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India (hereinafter referred to as Cooper’s case).

On January 11, 1952, within a year and a half following the Gopalan judgment, another significant decision emerged from the Supreme Court, now with a bench of seven judges in State of West Bengal v. Anwar Ali Sarkar. This case examined the constitutionality of the West Bengal Special Courts Act, 1950, particularly noting that Section 5(1) of the Act was ultra vires the Constitution, primarily because it allowed the state government to designate any case for trial by a special court.

Justice Vivian Bose, while supporting the majority opinion, introduced an interpretation that insinuated the need for a “due process” requirement. When evaluating the validity of legislative classifications, he asserted:

“However much the real ground of decision may be hidden behind a screen of words like ‘reasonable,’ ‘substantial,’ ‘rational’ and ‘arbitrary’, the fact would remain that judges are substituting their own judgment of what is right and proper and reasonable and just for that of the legislature; and up to a point that, I think, is inevitable when a judge is called to crystallize a vague generality like Article 14 into a concrete concept.”

This perspective starkly contrasted with the rigidity of Chief Justice Kania’s earlier interpretations in Gopalan. Justice Bose emphasized that the Constitutional provisions are not mere static phrases within a relic of antiquity, but rather are “living flames” capable of shaping the future. He acknowledged the necessity of constitutional elasticity to address the evolving circumstances of society and the law.

The foundational seeds of future jurisprudential interpretations of fundamental rights began to germinate in Justice Bose's judgment as early as January 1952. However, the principles laid out in Gopalan held firm until they faced a decisive challenge during the expansive ruling in Cooper’s case. 

In Cooper, the petitioner, who held substantial shares in multiple banks and served as a director of the Central Bank of India, contested the constitutionality of the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Ordinance and its successor Act of 1969. He raised multiple challenges, including claims that these legislative instruments violated his fundamental rights under Articles 14, 19(1)(f) and (g), and 31(2), and encroached upon his rights under Article 301.

Delivering the majority opinion, Justice Shah articulated a significant shift in constitutional interpretation, declaring that Articles 19(1)(f) and 31(2) were not to be viewed as mutually exclusive. In detailing the rationale for this conclusion, Justice Shah specifically departed from established precedent, including Gopalan, by asserting:

“In determining the impact of State action upon constitutional guarantees, which are fundamental, it follows that the extent of protection against impairment of a fundamental right is determined not by the object of the Legislature nor by the form of the action, but by its direct operation upon the individual’s rights.”

Thus, the approach shifted from an objectbased test, as seen in Gopalan, to an effectsbased test in Cooper. The learned judge identified a common thread running through the rights articulated in Part III of the Constitution, emphasizing that they collectively serve to protect individual and group rights against state infringing actions.

The approach continued to evolve through subsequent Supreme Court decisions, notably two pivotal Constitution Bench cases—the preEmergency decision in E.P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu and the postEmergency ruling in Maneka Gandhi. 

In E.P. Royappa, the petitioner, previously the Chief Secretary of Tamil Nadu, contested a transfer to a lesser post, alleging it was politically motivated due to his disagreements with the Chief Minister. While dismissing the petition, the Court introduced a novel interpretation of Article 14, further refined in Maneka Gandhi. Justice Bhagwati's concurring opinion, resonating with Chief Justice Ray’s thoughts, laid significant emphasis on a standard of reasonableness regarding Article 14.

Justice Bhagwati posed critical questions concerning the scope and implications of Article 14 and articulated a profound understanding of equality:

“It is a founding faith, to use the words of Bose, J., a ‘way of life’, and it must not be subjected to a narrow pedantic or lexicographic approach. We cannot countenance any attempt to truncate its allembracing scope and meaning, for to do so would be to violate its activist magnitude. Equality is a dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions and it cannot be ‘cribbed, cabined and confined’ within traditional and doctrinaire limits.”

His expansive interpretation went beyond the prevailing understanding that confined Article 14 to a rigid structure based on intelligible differentia as laid down in previous rulings. 

Interestingly, despite addressing a seemingly less severe matter, Justice Bhagwati propounded an expansive doctrine regarding Article 14. In contrast, he later diverged from this perspective during the significant ADM Jabalpur v. S.S. Shukla case when faced with questions that carried greater implications for personal liberty and access to justice. Notably, in ADM Jabalpur, it was Justice Khanna's dissent that advocated for a protective stance on individual rights.

The essential underpinnings of reasonableness and scrutiny of arbitrariness that Justice Bhagwati articulated in Maneka Gandhi indeed owe much to the earlier dissenting voices, notably that of Justice Vivian Bose in Anwar Ali, who advocated against a narrow reading of Article 14.

In Maneka Gandhi, the case hinged on critical issues surrounding the impounding of a passport. The Regional Passport Authority communicated to Maneka Gandhi that her passport had been confiscated, ordering her to surrender it within seven days. Challenging this order through an Article 32 petition, she raised several arguments, significantly asserting that the right to travel abroad is intrinsically linked to the Right to Life and Personal Liberty articulated in Article 21.

Gandhi argued that she was denied this right without due process, claiming her right was denied without proper hearing or valid justification. While the Supreme Court ultimately concluded that Section 10(3)(c) of the Passport Act was not violative of Article 14, it ruled that the impounding order contravened the principles of natural justice. This acknowledgement of a postdecisional hearing allowed the Court to sidestep the initial procedural impropriety.

In Maneka Gandhi, Chief Justice Beg espoused a viewpoint that tacitly aligned with Justice Khanna’s dissent in ADM Jabalpur, suggesting both the rights of personal security and liberty encapsulated within Article 21 are integral to the broader conception of justice. Furthermore, he posited that Articles dealing with different fundamental rights are interwoven within the constitutional fabric, creating a cohesive scheme that necessitates an integrated understanding of justice.

Expanding on his earlier proposition from Royappa, Justice Bhagwati, in Maneka Gandhi, reinforced that the Court should strive towards broadening the reach of fundamental rights rather than restricting their interpretation through judicial construction. He articulated that Article 14 serves as an omnipresent principle within the constitutional framework, and the procedures mandated by Article 21 must reflect fairness, rationality, and adherence to just principles, eschewing any semblance of arbitrariness.

This marked a paradigm shift in the history of Indian jurisprudence, as it acknowledged the need for an inherent standard of fairness within the Right to Life and Personal Liberty. Despite the founding fathers’ decision to exclude the principle of “due process” from the Constitution, the Supreme Court recognized that fundamental rights demand adherence to principles of reasonableness.

However, it is vital to delineate the distinctions between Justice Khanna's dissent in ADM Jabalpur, rooted in natural law, and Justice Bhagwati's interpretation in Maneka Gandhi, which directly referred to the Constitution's text—primarily Article 14. By employing a flexible and evolving interpretation of fundamental rights, Justice Bhagwati laid the groundwork for a more expansive understanding that resonated through subsequent rulings, creating a ripple effect that would continue shaping Indian jurisprudence in the years to come.

The subsequent landmark ruling which revitalized the foundations of democracy in India came from a ninemember Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in the case of S.R. Bommai and Others v. Union of India and Others. This decisive judgment played a pivotal role in shaping the interplay between the central and state governments, providing an essential interpretation of Article 356 of the Indian Constitution, which is part of the Emergency Provisions outlined in Part XVIII. 

Article 356 grants the President of India the authority to impose President’s Rule in a state when there is a perceived failure in the constitutional machinery, effectively dismissing the elected government. Historical precedents demonstrate that this provision has deep roots, having originated from Section 93 of the Government of India Act, 1935. The architects of the Constitution, aware of the challenges of the colonial period, nonetheless opted to include a similar clause, anticipating serious crises that could jeopardize governance during India's tumultuous transition in 194748. The founding fathers believed in the palpable existence of potential emergencies that could undermine the democratic fabric of the country. Yet, they also cherished the hope that this provision would remain a "dead letter," to be invoked solely in extraordinary circumstances.

However, this hope was significantly dashed as independent India witnessed the recurrent and, in some cases, outrageous misuse of Article 356. Prior to the Bommai judgment, the article had been invoked over a hundred times, often resulting in the unjustifiable ousting of democratically elected governments. In light of this flagrant abuse, the Supreme Court's ruling in Bommai established crucial safeguards to deter further misuse of Article 356’s powers, underscoring the significance of this landmark decision for the continuity and integrity of Indian democracy.

Before Bommai, the question of whether a presidential proclamation dissolving a state assembly could be contested in court was debated across various High Courts in India. Courts in Kerala, Calcutta, Punjab and Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, and Orissa amongst others ruled overwhelmingly that such proclamations were not subject to judicial scrutiny. 

This question morphed into a formal legal challenge under the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction in the case of State of Rajasthan v. Union of India. The case arose in April 1977 when the Union Home Minister sent letters to the chief ministers of states where the Congress party had faced electoral setbacks, requesting the governors of these states to dissolve their assemblies and call for fresh elections. This was compounded by a subsequent broadcast from the Union Law Minister claiming that the state governments had lost the confidence of the people and remained in power undemocratically. 

Six of the affected states sought recourse from the Supreme Court under Article 32, arguing that the actions of the Home Minister and the Law Minister posed a grave threat to the stability of state assemblies and were unrelated to the legitimate grounds for invoking Article 356. The Supreme Court, however, dismissed the idea that judicial review of such presidential proclamations was inappropriate. Notably, justices Bhagwati and Gupta established that neither political context nor the nature of questions raised could prevent the Court from performing its constitutional duty when faced with matters of constitutional significance. The court asserted that while the scope of judicial review under Article 356 may be narrow, it became imperative when the President's exercise of power rested on insincere, irrelevant, or extraneous criteria.

In a subsequent ruling in A.K. Roy v. Union of India, the Constitution Bench clarified that the earlier understanding associated with clause (5) of Article 356, which precluded judicial review, had become inapplicable due to its repeal by the 44th Amendment of the Constitution. 

During the Bommai case deliberations, the Supreme Court produced six judgments, reflecting a range of views, with a majority opinion consisting of Justices Sawant, Kuldip Singh, Jeevan Reddy, Aggarwal, and Pandyan, while dissenting opinions were rendered by Justices Ahmadi, Verma, Dayal, and K. Ramaswamy.

The Bommai verdict significantly advanced India's constitutional jurisprudence by reinforcing foundational values such as the parliamentary system, federalism, secularism, and judicial oversight of executive action. A critical aspect of the ruling hinged on the majority view that the circumstances necessitating the invocation of Article 356 must indicate a situation of genuine impasse. Justice Sawant, in his assessment, emphasized that the term "cannot" within Article 356 inferred a physical impossibility that warranted presidential intervention. This stringent interpretation bolstered the democratic underpinnings of the nation, with the Supreme Court defining the invocation of power under Article 356 as permissible solely during actual or imminent disruptions to constitutional governance.

This established principle of reviewability regarding presidential powers affirmed in Bommai can be compared to facets of human rights jurisprudence contextualized by European legal frameworks. The European Court of Human Rights has recognized the existence of public emergencies as subject to judicial review, setting a significant precedent that the Supreme Court echoed in its ruling. The Court determined that the President's satisfaction in invoking Article 356 was indeed open to scrutiny. 

Notably, there was some divergence within the bench regarding the extent of this judicial review. Justice Sawant articulated that invoking Article 356 without providing a state government prior notice or an opportunity for rectification fell short of upholding natural justice principles. Conversely, Justices Jeevan Reddy and Aggarwal took a more lenient stance, asserting that the President's satisfaction under Article 356 could be deemed subjective, thereby excluding natural justice requirements from the analysis.

The distinguishing import of the Bommai ruling became evident through the Justices' reliance on the doctrine of basic structure, which had hitherto primarily been a benchmark for evaluating constitutional amendments. In this context, the validity of presidential proclamations was adjudicated through the same critical lens. The judgment underscored the necessity of judicial review of Article 356’s proclamations, grounded in federalism and pluralist democracy. 

Another vital aspect of the Bommai verdict was the court’s use of the Constitution’s Preamble to frame the essential structure of the test. Here, the judicial body upheld President's actions regarding the dismissal of specific state governments based on the inability of those governments to align with the secularism principle, enshrined within the Preamble—an addition formalized by the 42nd Amendment.

The understanding from an earlier case, State of Rajasthan, which suggested that a presidential proclamation under Article 356 was valid irrespective of Parliamentary approval, was significantly altered by Bommai. The new ruling established that if a proclamation is not ratified by both Houses of Parliament within a stipulated time frame, it lapses automatically. This modification directly impacts the dissolution processes of legislative assemblies, ensuring that removal does not occur automatically following a presidential proclamation.

The ramifications of the Bommai decision are evident in the reduced instances of invoking Article 356, providing a framework that fortifies the democratic integrity of the country. A notable application of these principles emerged during the 2005 dissolution of the Bihar Assembly when the Supreme Court upheld that Article 356's use could not be justified by mere assertions, whims, or unforeseen biases by the Governor, thereby reaffirming the principles set in Bommai.

Following this landmark ruling, the Supreme Court further solidified the democratic architecture of India through two consequential decisions delivered by a threejudge bench: Union of India v. Association for Democratic Reforms & Another and People’s Union for Civil Liberties & Another (PUCL) v. Union of India & Another. Both cases evoked a transformative overhaul in the election laws, a critical aspect of any thriving democracy.

In Union of India v. Association for Democratic Reforms & Another, the central government contested a directive from the Delhi High Court that mandated the Election Commission secure essential information related to candidates seeking election. Subsequently, petitioners approached the Supreme Court seeking analogous statutory directions grounded in Article 141 of the Constitution, which warranted consideration of the 170th Report of the Law Commission of India.

Rendering its verdict, the Supreme Court underscored the paramount importance of the voter's choice in any election, asserting that informed decisionmaking necessitates comprehensive understanding of candidates’ backgrounds. The Court traced this "right to vote" as an inherent right, associated with the fundamental right to free speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution, as well as the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights. By correlating voting with core principles of expression and participation, the Court expanded the notion of electoral rights, arguing that access to vital information is requisite for voters to exercise their agency effectively. 

Thus, through the exercise of its authority under Article 324 of the Constitution, the Supreme Court sanctioned directives compelling candidates to provide detailed affidavits encompassing essential information such as criminal convictions, pending accusations, asset disclosures, liabilities, and educational qualifications. 

These directions marked a pivotal moment for India's electoral process, steering it toward greater transparency and accountability. Following the judgment in Union of India v. Association for Democratic Reforms & Another, amendments were made to the Representation of the People Act. However, the amendment process led to the introduction of Section 33A under the "Right to Information," which curtailed aspects of the Supreme Court's initial directives by mandating limited disclosure of candidate antecedents. 

Moreover, Section 33B, introduced during the same amendment, imposed a restrictive ban on revealing additional information, contradicting various judicial opinions and orders. This prompted the People's Union for Civil Liberties to challenge this amendment in People’s Union for Civil Liberties v. Union of India.

In addressing this challenge, the Supreme Court concluded that the amendments, particularly Section 33, were ultra vires, stifling free and fair electoral processes. The ensuing opinions of the three judges illustrated a concensus around the argument that the right to know a candidate's information transcended statutory limitations, anchored firmly within the fundamental rights framework. 

Justice Shah reinforced that Section 33B contravened the established verdict affirming a voter's fundamental right to be informed about candidates, cementing this principle as integral to the democratic process. Justice Venkatrama Reddy echoed this sentiment, asserting that voting rights encapsulate more than statutory frameworks, embodying fundamental freedom rooted in Article 19(1)(a). Justice Dharmadhikari also largely concurred with the judgments presented, fortifying the stance for candidates’ information clarity.

Together, these consequential rulings have significantly started reshaping the election landscape, aiming to enhance transparency, accountability, and participatory democracy in the world's largest democratic setup. The essence of democracy lies not just in holding elections but ensuring they are conducted in a manner that upholds integrity, fairness, and informed consent of the electorate—principles that these landmark decisions work diligently to establish and reinforce.

The judgment delivered by the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in T.M.A. Pai Foundation v. State of Kerala represents a pivotal moment that has placed significant constraints on the right to education for everyday citizens of India. At its core, this ruling has profound implications for access to higher education, pushing it beyond the financial reach of many. The rationale adopted in T.M.A. Pai is troubling for its constitutional authenticity; it raises questions about its alignment with the foundational principles of justice and equality espoused in the Indian Constitution.

The ruling recognized the right to establish an educational institution—whether for charitable purposes or for profit—as a fundamental right protected under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution. This interpretation has opened the floodgates to the commercialization of education, suggesting that such institutions can exist primarily as economic ventures. Furthermore, the court found that imposing any form of reservation of seats in unaided professional institutions amounted to a serious infringement on the rights and autonomy of these institutions. Such a stance has serious ramifications; it undermines the state's role in regulating admission to educational institutions in a manner that serves the public good.

However, in a fortunate turn of events, this detrimental position was tempered by the introduction of the 93rd Amendment to the Constitution in 2005, which incorporated clause (5) into Article 15. This amendment specifically empowers the state to formulate special provisions for the admission of students to educational institutions, thereby establishing a necessary safeguard against the backdrop of unfettered commercial interests in education.

The principles articulated in T.M.A. Pai were subsequently echoed in subsequent judgments by the Supreme Court, notably in Islamic Academy of Education and Another v. State of Karnataka and PA. Inamdar and Others v. State of Maharashtra and Others. These cases reiterated the court's findings regarding the rights afforded to individuals seeking to establish educational institutions under Article 19(1)(g) and the regulatory framework that needs to be in place to balance institutional autonomy with the right to access education.

A significant aspect of T.M.A. Pai’s ruling is the stipulation that both religious and linguistic minority status must be determined based on the population of each state, rather than by a national metric. This approach seems to disconnect minority rights from national identity, potentially diluting protections meant for vulnerable populations. The Supreme Court also ruled that transitioning the subject of education from the state list to the concurrent list in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution did not alter the legal landscape in any consequential way.

Critically, this interpretation by the Supreme Court appears to conflict with the objectives enshrined in Article 30 of the Constitution, which specifically protects the rights of minorities—not of every citizen. The protection afforded to minorities is grounded in the need to shield them from marginalization and disenfranchisement. This has led to a situation where an entrepreneur who is part of the majority community in one state may suddenly find themselves considered a minority—and thus eligible for constitutional protections—simply by crossing state lines.

To further delineate the protections afforded to educational institutions established by minorities, Article 30(1A) outlines that the state must ensure that any compulsory acquisition of property belonging to such institutions does not infringe upon their fundamental rights. This implies that state intervention in acquiring educational properties necessitates a compensation framework that respects and upholds the rights assured under Article 30(1).

In light of these interpretations, it is apparent that by classifying the right to establish educational institutions as a fundamental right of every citizen—under Article 19(1)(g)—the T.M.A. Pai ruling effectively reintroduced aspects of the right to property that had been eliminated from constitutional protections. This creates a paradox where the rights granted to nonminorities are on a similar footing as those granted specifically for minorities under Articles 30(1) and 30(1A). 

The concept of educational entitlement as articulated by the Supreme Court in T.M.A. Pai has drawn criticism for equating education with a commercial endeavor. It contends that while entrepreneurship in education is acceptable, the court emphasized that profitmaking should not lead to exploitation. This distinction is becoming increasingly blurred in a climate of commercialization that tends to prioritize profitability over accessibility. 

The subsequent decisions in Islamic Academy and Inamdar were prompted by the need to address the fallout from T.M.A. Pai, particularly the issue of excessive fee structures at private educational institutions, many of which are minorityrun. The Supreme Court took corrective measures by forming committees to oversee these fee structures and ensure compliance with the principles of fairness and transparency in admission processes.

Then came the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act (RTE) 2009, bolstered by the 93rd Amendment, which was enacted to realize the fundamental right to education for children between the ages of six and fourteen. This legislation seeks to enhance access, providing a legal framework to support educational equity across socioeconomic strata, particularly reflecting the values rooted in social justice as articulated in the Constitution.

The landmark judgment in Society for Unaided Private Schools of Rajasthan v. Union of India further solidified the right to education by affirming the constitutional validity of Article 15(5), thereby nullifying key provisions of earlier rulings in PA. Inamdar that attempted to limit reservations in private educational institutions. 

The Supreme Court observed that educational institutions play an essential role in reinforcing the democratic fabric of society by ensuring equal opportunities for all citizens, echoing the sentiment that education should not serve as a luxury but rather as a fundamental pillar of societal progress.

Ultimately, the court recognized that the right to life under Article 21 encapsulates the right to access education, asserting that exorbitant costs associated with education must not obstruct this access. 

In essence, even though T.M.A. Pai significantly constrained educational access, subsequent constitutional amendments and judicial judgments have worked to incrementally restore and enhance the rights to education in India. The continued struggle against the commercial exploitation of education remains at the forefront of safeguarding equitable opportunities for all citizens. To ignore this would impede human development and undermine the stability of social harmony—an idea poignantly reiterated in historical discourses on education, including Adolf Hitler’s vehement opposition to universal education, which was aptly cited in the Supreme Court case of Unnikrishnan, J.P. and Others v. State of Andhra Pradesh and Others. 

In summary, the trajectory of legal discourse surrounding educational rights reveals a complex interplay of rights and interests that continues to evolve. The journey of transforming education from a commercial enterprise back into a public good remains critical in ensuring that all citizens, regardless of their socioeconomic status, have fair access to quality education, thus fostering a more equitable society.

A comprehensive understanding of the constitutional mandate regarding reverse discrimination in favor of Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), and Other Backward Classes (OBCs) requires a contextual appreciation of this imperative against the backdrop of India’s national freedom movement. This historical struggle, which officially began in 1885 and culminated in 1947, provides the legitimacy and foundation for the concepts of equality and social justice entrenched in our Constitution.

The evolution of constitutionalism in India is deeply intertwined with this independence movement. The ideals that inspired our National Charter were born from the collective yearning for justice, equity, and the eradication of deeprooted social inequalities prevalent in our society. The chapters outlining fundamental rights and directive principles within the Constitution offer a visionary depiction of an egalitarian future, where every citizen, irrespective of caste, class, or gender, can access opportunities for personal and collective growth.

Historically, the caste system, particularly the rigid classifications within Hindu society, created a divisive framework that dictated a person's status based on lineage. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, a pivotal architect of the Indian Constitution, personally witnessed the debilitating effects of castebased discrimination during the British colonial rule. The oppression was twofold; it came not only from British imperial authority but also from the entrenched Brahminical order which perpetuated societal inequalities. This conjunction of colonialism and casteism disadvantaged the vast majority of Indians for decades. Consequently, the Constitution was crafted as a tool to dismantle these injustices, asserting India's sovereign ethos while endeavoring to establish a new social order that ensured justice across all dimensions—social, economic, and political.

India, as envisioned by the framers of the Constitution, is a welfare state with an activist role bound to uplift its marginalized citizens. Through articles such as 16(4), 16(4A), 17, 23, 24, 38, and 46, the Constitution mandates the state to actively promote and safeguard the educational and economic interests of SCs, STs, and other weaker sections. This statutory obligation aims not only to shield these communities from social injustices and exploitation but also to facilitate their advancement through reservation of civil service posts to correct historical underrepresentation. This is a reflection of the Constitution’s endorsement of an affirmative approach towards achieving social equality.

The framework established by our Constitution can be contrasted with the provisions for racial preferences found in the American Constitution. In the United States, preference for certain racial groups operates more as a policy initiative than a constitutionally protected right. As Ronald Dworkin articulated, it is beneficial for universities to adopt policies that promote diversity; however, such practices were introduced long after the Constitution's adoption without any amendments to its text.

In stark contrast, the Indian Constitution integrated provisions for reservation from its inception, and subsequent amendments expanded these provisions’ scope. Reservations are categorized mainly into two types: mandatory provisions, such as Article 330 (which mandates reservation of seats in the Lok Sabha for SCs and STs), and enabling provisions like Article 16(4). Over time, the distinction between these two types has become less pronounced due to the evolving emphasis on social justice.

The issue of reservation as a means of affirmative action has also been addressed by the Supreme Court of the United States through landmark decisions such as Oliver Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Metro Broadcasting Inc. v. Federal Communications Commission, and others. The analysis presented in these cases has supported the notion that affirmative actions implemented by the state are vital to mitigating the enduring effects of historical discrimination. Such measures enhance access and representation for historically marginalized communities, thus promoting their active participation in governance, which is deemed essential for a balanced democratic society.

India’s Supreme Court reinforced the notion of historical discrimination by referencing U.S. principles in the landmark case of Indra Sawhney v. Union of India. The court recognized that the chronic nature of discrimination in Indian society is arguably more severe than that which has been addressed in the United States. However, in Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. Union of India, the Supreme Court highlighted the structural differences between the Indian and American legal systems. For instance, our Constitution lacks certain frameworks, such as the principles of 'suspect legislation' or 'strict scrutiny' that exist in the U.S. Constitution. In India, every law enacted by a legislative body is presumed valid until proven otherwise, emphasizing the intent to provide equal footing for all social groups within the governance apparatus.

The prioritization of social justice has been profoundly reinforced in various Supreme Court judgments, notably in the case of State of Kerala and Anr v. N.M. Thomas and Ors, delivered by Justice K.K. Mathew. Justice Mathew articulated that the directive principles outlined in Article 46 are obligatory not only for lawmakers but serve as guiding principles for the judiciary as well. The court emphasized the necessity of an affirmative governmental obligation to eradicate discrimination, as articulated by the positive language of Article 16, which contrasts with the more prohibitive tone of Article 14.

Additionally, Judge Mathew drew from the works of American scholar Daniel P. Moynihan to discuss the nuanced understanding of equality of opportunity, suggesting that its meaning may vary significantly across social groups. For marginalized individuals, equality is not merely about freedom but also about sharing in relative achievements alongside more privileged communities.

The reservations debate has undergone extensive scrutiny in various judicial decisions, with the Indra Sawhney case standing out as a significant turning point. In this landmark verdict, a ninejudge Constitution Bench evaluated and ruled on complex questions concerning the interpretation of Articles 15(4) and 16(4). The court delivered a 6:3 majority ruling that ultimately upheld the principle of reservation for backward classes while invalidating certain expansions to reservation percentages laid out in subsequent government memorandums, notably rejecting the application of a 10% reservation for economically weaker sections.

The court astutely recognized that caste encompasses a broad and identifiable social group that merits consideration in the allocation of affirmative actions. However, the court also clarified that caste alone should not dictate social and educational backwardness and underscored the importance of differentiating between less and more backward categories within SEBCs. Furthermore, the court emphasized the exclusion of the 'creamy layer'—the more affluent strata within backward classes—from the benefits of reservation, positing that such exclusions are essential for maintaining the efficacy and intent of reservation policies.

Significantly, the court ruled that provisions under Article 16(4) allow for executive agencies to create reservation provisions, bearing in mind that these reservations must not exceed specified limits, typically suggested to be a 50% cap on total reservations. However, the court acknowledged that due to the unique demographic and social landscape across different states, certain exceptions might warrant slight deviations from this cap.

In a consequential development, the Supreme Court tackled the issue of reservation in promotions in the Indra Sawhney judgment concluding that such reservations would not be applicable. This prompted the introduction of the Constitution (77th Amendment) Act in 1995, allowing for reservations in promotions for SC and ST candidates. Furthermore, subsequent amendments include provisions that consolidate these concepts and extend their application.

In M. Nagaraj and Others v. Union of India, the Supreme Court carefully examined the validity of these amendments, resisting critiques that suggested they undermined the Constitution's basic structure. The court accentuated the necessity of understanding constitutional provisions with a flexible and adaptive perspective that can respond to evolving social contexts while remaining anchored in the fundamental principles of justice, equity, and integrative governance.

The ruling established that the principle of basic structure, while foundational, should not impede the progression of social justice efforts through reservations, particularly in view of their importance in achieving equity. The essence of these decisions reiterates that the Constitution provides room to balance individual rights with the need for collective upliftment, ensuring that marginalized communities have access to not only representation but also opportunities for growth within the sociopolitical fabric of the nation.

Moreover, the M. Nagaraj verdict reinforced that any distributions of reservations must exclude the creamy layer, thus crystallizing this criterion as an essential consideration for future legislation.

Furthermore, in Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. Union of India, the Supreme Court took significant steps towards expanding educational opportunities for SCs, STs, and OBCs, specifically regarding policy decisions related to unaided educational institutions. By introducing Article 15(5) through the 93rd Amendment, the government aimed to facilitate access to higher education for these historically marginalized groups. The amendment and associated legislation faced challenges questioning their constitutional validity, particularly concerning the basic structure doctrine. The Supreme Court, however, upheld these provisions, emphasizing that modern society's dynamic needs warranted an adaptable interpretation of constitutional provisions aimed at promoting equality and justice.

Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan and fellow justices stated that while reservations are a tool for promoting equality, the government has a responsibility to ensure their implementation is based not solely on caste but also on other socioeconomic indicators, thereby refining the criteria for identifying backward classes. The court highlighted the critical distinction between social classes and castes, advocating a more nuanced understanding of these terms.

In conclusion, both the Indra Sawhney and M. Nagaraj judgments have set forth robust frameworks that govern the application of affirmative action and reservations in India, effectively mandating the exclusion of the creamy layer from the benefits of reservation policies. The recognition of the need for evidencebased approaches regarding backwardness and representation serves to enhance the legitimacy and effectiveness of such policies as India continues to strive toward a more equitable society for all its citizens.

In the face of ongoing international initiatives aimed at completely abolishing the death penalty, or at the very least imposing a partial moratorium, the fact remains that this punitive measure is still widely practiced in numerous countries around the globe. The death penalty has remained a contentious issue throughout history, sparking vital discussions regarding fundamental values and human rights ever since the Enlightenment period. The current global landscape surrounding the death penalty suggests an urgent need for continued dialogue, examining whether it should be abolished or retained. This discussion must be approached from various angles—international, normative, empirical, and comparative—to foster a rich discourse on human rights across nations.

In India, the Law Commission undertook an exhaustive examination of the death penalty, culminating in the issuance of its 35th Report in 1967, which was directed to the central government. Within this report, the Commission expressed a cautious perspective, noting several factors relevant to India's unique sociocultural context. The report emphasized that the diverse social upbringing and moral standards of its citizens, combined with the vastness and variety of India's geography and the pressing necessity to maintain law and order, rendered the abolition of capital punishment a risky proposition. The Commission acknowledged the complex realities of Indian society as justifying the continuation of the death penalty, albeit with the understanding that this perspective may not remain constant over time.

The death penalty in India is governed by several laws, with multiple sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) stipulating provisions for capital punishment. The most prevalent legal reference for awarding the death penalty is Section 302 of the IPC, which has its origins in the preconstitutional colonial era. Falling under Chapter XVI of the IPC, which pertains to crimes against the human body, Section 302 treats individuals perpetrating offenses and the victims as mere abstractions—an approach that fails to address the concept of personhood, a vital element highlighted under Article 21 of the Constitution. The apparent disconnection between the law and the essence of personhood raises fundamental questions about the ethical foundations of the death penalty itself.

Critically, the constitutionality of this provision was called into question in the case of "Jagmohan Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh." The challenge centered on the argument that Section 302 granted absolute discretion to judges regarding the awarding of the death penalty, thereby violating Article 14 of the Constitution, which guarantees equality before the law and thus impinges on an individual's right to life. Nonetheless, the Constitution Bench deliberated on these concerns and ultimately dismissed them, citing the recommendations from the Law Commission's earlier report as a guiding rationale for their judgment.

Following this, a pivotal case concerning female offenders, "Ediga Anamma v. State of Andhra Pradesh," attracted attention to the changes instituted by the Criminal Procedure Code of 1973 (the Code). Justice Krishna Iyer, representing the twojudge bench in this case, highlighted the inclusion of Section 354(3), a statutory requirement mandating that judges provide special reasons when imposing a death sentence. He observed that this provision fundamentally altered the landscape of sentencing, establishing life imprisonment as the primary option and characterizing the death penalty as an exception. This represented a notable shift from the earlier legal framework under Section 367(5) of the Code of 1898, which had placed the onus on courts to explain why the death penalty was not imposed in instances where capital punishment was a permissible option.

Justice Iyer poignantly articulated how this legislative modification signified a broader intention to humanize the justice system within India, symbolizing a gradual move toward caution and a potential retreat from the absolute retention of capital punishment. Despite the momentum toward abolition or reform in many parts of the world—approximately 121 countries have enacted measures abolishing the death penalty entirely—debates on its legitimacy persist vigorously within India against the backdrop of its constitutional framework and human rights considerations.

Subsequent rulings from the Supreme Court of India have generally affirmed the constitutional validity of the death penalty, yet the pressing nature of the debate demands its continuation. The issues surrounding capital punishment cannot be easily resolved by the mere adherence to the doctrine of stare decisis, which promotes ruling according to established precedents. This discourse must remain dynamic, returning to the fore as societal standards of decency continue to evolve within an advancing democratic context.

The constitutionality of capital punishment was further scrutinized in "Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab," where a narrow majority ruling of 4:1 upheld its legality. The call for review arose in light of significant legal and jurisprudential developments, including the amendment incorporating Section 354(3) into the Code, which explicitly characterized the death penalty as an exception rather than the rule. Additionally, this case was heavily influenced by the landmark decision in "Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India and Others," which reshaped the meaning and implications of fundamental rights articulated within Articles 14, 19, and 21 of the Constitution. Here, the adopted doctrine of "due process" enforced a higher threshold for the justification of laws, mandating that they must be just, reasonable, and equitable.

In the judgment of "Bachan Singh," the Supreme Court elaborated on the evolution of Article 21 in light of the Maneka Gandhi decision, leading to a new interpretation that emphasized the necessity for laws, especially those impacting life and liberty, to adhere to principles of fairness and justice. This redirected the focus towards ensuring that any restrictions on individual rights, including the imposition of capital punishment, occur strictly as part of a legitimate procedure established under the law.

In this prevailing legal atmosphere, Justice Bhagwati, in a notable dissent in "Bachan Singh," contended that the death penalty was indeed unconstitutional, provoking further discourse on its ethical implications. The ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) by the Indian government signified a commitment to advancing the progressive abolition of the death penalty. Moreover, in "Sunil Batra v. Delhi Administration," the Supreme Court opined that preconstitutional laws must be harmonized with constitutional values, asserting that both Section 302 of the IPC and Section 354(3) of the Code ought to reflect the humane orientation derived from the Constitution's guiding principles.

The necessity of a presentencing hearing, as outlined in Section 235(2) of the Code, becomes apparent as the Court articulated its potential to ensure a more equitable and informed sentencing process. This would allow courts to consider vital evidence regarding the socioeconomic context of the accused, thus providing essential safeguards against arbitrary applications of the death penalty.

The Joint Committee of Parliament recognized the critical nature of the death sentence as the ultimate penalty, urging the necessity for courts to provide detailed justifications when opting for capital punishment over life imprisonment. In its 48th Report, the Law Commission emphasized the imperative for comprehensive understanding of offenders' backgrounds—pointing out that a rational approach to sentencing necessitates addressing existing system deficiencies, particularly in understanding the circumstances of offenders.

The Supreme Court has consistently reiterated the significance of presentence hearings across numerous rulings, correlating with modern penology's trends that increasingly prioritize rehabilitation over retribution. Such hearings should facilitate a thorough evaluation of aggravating and mitigating factors—including the criminal’s background, age, emotional and mental condition, and potential for rehabilitation.

Additionally, in the aftermath of the Maneka Gandhi landmark judgment, the legal discourse on the death penalty further evolved, leading to new conclusions in cases such as "Sunil Batra." The assertive commentary in "Bachan Singh" regarding procedural safeguards—including the requirement for high court confirmation prior to executing a death sentence—illustrates ongoing legal safeguards intended to prevent arbitrary imposition of the ultimate penalty. 

The evolving legislative landscape and judicial attitudes towards the death penalty reflect a complex interplay between safeguarding human dignity and ensuring societal justice. While the Supreme Court identified that life imprisonment ought to be viewed as the default punishment, significant sentiments within the judiciary and the legislature call for a critical assessment of capital punishment according to the principle of lenity.

Nonetheless, the application of the 'rarest of rare' doctrine has been a topic of contention in subsequent judgments, with some benches diverting from the established principles outlined in "Bachan Singh." The landmark judgment in "Machhi Singh and Others v. The State of Punjab" saw the introduction of additional criteria for death sentences, seemingly diluting the stringent requirements initially characterizing capital punishment as exceptional.

In subsequent cases, the trend towards diminishing the rigidity of the 'rarest of rare' doctrine has been observed, with newer judgments reinforcing a social demand for harsher penalties. This evolving jurisprudence has sparked concerns over the court's consistency and adherence to constitutional safeguards.

Most notably, the Supreme Court's acknowledgment in "Bariyar" that prior judgments deviated from established legal standards and did not adequately consider mitigating circumstances represents a pivotal moment in contemporary sentencing discussions. The court explicitly stated that the prosecution bears the burden of proving that the accused is irredeemably beyond rehabilitation—a criterion aimed at refining the application of the death penalty and ensuring constitutional compliance.

The emphasis on judicial clarity, principled reasoning, and adherence to comprehensive sentencing guidelines are evidently necessary for recalibrating the legal framework surrounding capital punishment in India. The supreme aim should be a cohesive approach that adequately aligns with the constitutional guarantees of human rights and dignity, reflecting contemporary humanitarian standards in jurisprudence.

In light of all these considerations, it is apparent that the Law Commission of India needs to conduct an indepth examination of the death penalty that surpasses superficial discussions about the methodology of execution. The topics concerning the death penalty intersect profoundly with vital constitutional values—highlighting a critical area in dire need of legislative reform. It is incumbent upon Parliament to grasp the gravity of this societal issue and devise a comprehensive, statutory framework aimed at structuring the sentencing process. This urgent reform is essential to uphold the principles of human dignity and the right to life enshrined within the Constitution. A timely and comprehensive review of such matters cannot be overstated, as it holds the potential to reshape the very foundations of the justice system in India.

The provision outlined in Article 72 of the Indian Constitution bestows upon the President the authority to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or the remission of punishment. This includes the power to suspend or commute the sentences of individuals convicted of any offense, particularly in cases where the punishment is awarded by a court martial. The scope of this article further extends to all offenses against laws that fall under the jurisdiction of the Union of India, particularly in instances where the sentence may result in death. Similarly, Article 161 assigns comparable responsibilities to the governors of states, allowing them to exercise similar clemency powers. However, it is vital to note that the governor's authority is constrained to matters within the ambit of state executive power, which undeniably incorporates the ability to grant pardons or remissions regarding death sentences.

The evolving interpretation of this clemency power, exercised by either the President or state governors, has sparked significant discourse, particularly due to a series of conflicting decisions emerging from the Supreme Court of India. This discourse is rooted in public interest, particularly within critical domains of crime and punishment, raising substantial legal queries and concerns regarding the balance of power and liberty.

A landmark ruling in this context arose from the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in Maru Ram Etc. Etc. v. Union of India and Another. In this case, the Bench meticulously examined the implications of an amendment introduced to the Code of Criminal Procedure in 1978, specifically the insertion of Section 433A. This provision mandates that certain categories of prisoners—including those sentenced to death as well as those whose death sentences had been commuted to life imprisonment—must serve a complete term of fourteen years before becoming eligible for release under the clemency powers enshrined in Articles 72 or 161 of the Constitution.

The Supreme Court, through the Maru Ram judgment, affirmed that while the application of Section 433A is significant, it does not infringe upon the pardon powers vested by Articles 72 and 161. The bench asserted that the President and the governors must not utilize their clemency powers based on personal judgment alone; instead, they are obligated to act in line with the advice of their respective councils of ministers. Such powers must be exercised judiciously and cannot be implemented arbitrarily, thus aligning with constitutional standards. Justice Krishna Iyer articulated this principle eloquently, stating that the considerations guiding the exercise of clemency are diverse and must pertain to legitimate governmental interests. However, he cautioned that any considerations that are wholly irrelevant, arbitrary, or malafide can be subject to judicial review.

Furthermore, the Supreme Court emphasized that, until formal regulations governing pardons are established, Section 433A would serve as a guiding framework. This guidance mirrors practices observed in many jurisdictions that maintain the death penalty, whereby clemency may be sought even while appeal processes remain active, or after a final judgment has been rendered. The Privy Council, in Neville Lewis v. The Attorney General of Jamaica and Others, underscored that prerogative mercy should be applied through fair and transparent procedures, mandating the disclosure of relevant materials to the applicant for review and permitting judicial oversight. Such principles closely mirror those affirmed in Maru Ram. The jurisprudence on clemency in the United States follows suit, as illustrated by the case of Herrera v. Collins, which described clemency as an essential mechanism designed to avert miscarriages of justice within exhausted judicial processes.

A subsequent yet significant ruling from the Supreme Court in Swamy Shraddananda @ Murali Manohar Mishra v. State of Karnataka further explored the complexities surrounding the remission of sentences. In this case, the Supreme Court referred back to its earlier ruling in Subash Chander v. Krishan Lal and Ors., where the Court had previously determined that life imprisonment, when imposed, should explicitly indicate that the convict would not be eligible for commutation under various provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure or any relevant statutory frameworks. The findings in Shraddananda clarified that a prisoner's extended incarceration term does not afford them a right to claim remission.

The Supreme Court faced an argument in Shraddananda that mandated the government to remain open to considering remission requests. It was asserted that sentencing was an intrinsic judicial function, yet the enforcement of punishments fell under executive jurisdiction, which warrants that courts should not interfere in the execution of sentences.

However, the judiciary, addressing this argument headon, arrived at a groundbreaking conclusion regarding the systemic issues within the process of granting remission for life sentences. The Court posited a necessity to establish a specific category of cases where life sentences exceeding a fourteenyear period should not be eligible for remission. They argued that when an appellant contests a death sentence at the Supreme Court level and the Court finds that such a case does not warrant the “rarest of rare” categorization for death sentences, the court should convert the death sentence into what has been characterized as a "special category" of punishment.

Respectfully, this interpretation appears fundamentally flawed from a legal standpoint. The Indian Penal Code (IPC) under Section 302 delineates the punishment for murder as being either a death sentence or life imprisonment, with no provision allowing for substitution between the two. Treating these as interchangeable ignores their qualitative and quantitative differences. The law maintains that these two forms of punishment represent distinct categories, each carrying its own implications and enforcement conditions. 

Judicial interpretations, as observed in both Bachan Singh and Maru Ram, established a position that these sentences should be regarded as qualitatively distinct. Thus, the idea of substituting one for the other contravenes established legal principles. In the context of Section 302 of the IPC, the Criminal Procedure Code specifically mandates that any decision to impose a death sentence requires substantial and explicit justifications. Furthermore, Section 53 of the IPC distinctly categorizes death penalties and life imprisonment as belonging to different classifications, placing the death penalty in a separate legal domain.

Consequently, the strategy proposed in Shraddananda to designate a "special category" of punishment based upon the substitution of death sentences with life imprisonment devoid of remission conflicts with deeply rooted principles of constitutional law and established practices of penology. Viewing these two types of punishment as interchangeable would compromise the integrity and precision of the sentencing framework, introducing elements of uncertainty and arbitrariness to what should be a structured judicial process.

The trajectory initiated in Shraddananda set a precedent followed by subsequent Supreme Court judgments. The case of Haru Ghosh saw the Court asserting that life imprisonment must equate to a minimum period of thirtyfive years of actual incarceration. In a related judgment involving Sandeep v. State of Uttar Pradesh, the Bench invoked the principles laid out in Shraddananda, mandating that the individual serve a minimum of thirty years in prison without remission.

However, in a divergence in judicial opinion noted in Sangeet and Anr v. State of Haryana, a twojudge bench arrived at a contrasting conclusion. They stated that the government cannot be precluded from exhibiting discretion over granting remissions, nor can the prisoner be barred from applying for remission, irrespective of circumstances. The bench clearly articulated that convicts do not have an inherent right to receive remission but do possess the right to have their cases considered for such clemency.

In a pivotal development, the Supreme Court concluded in Sangeet that the statutory framework governing remissions contains provisions designed to counter arbitrary exercises of authority; it is incumbent upon the legislature to ensure these checks are upheld faithfully. This constitutes a legally plausible stance regarding the architecture of sentencing.

When scrutinizing the principles articulated in Shraddananda and the subsequent related cases from a fundamental rights perspective, they reveal substantial shortcomings. Underpinned in Article 20(1) of the Constitution is a fundamental principle that safeguards individuals from ex post facto laws, asserting that no individual should face punishment not outlined by law at the time when the offense was committed. This foundational legal precept signifies not merely a protection against retroactive laws but a holistic framework of fairness that binds the judiciary's decisions.

In cases related to murder, the laws governing punishment, such as Section 302 of the IPC, categorically define two possible outcomes—death or life imprisonment. Notably, these sentences cannot be construed as substitutes for one another, as legal frameworks are designed to provide distinct pathways corresponding to different circumstances of the crime.

In each of the aforementioned cases—Shraddananda, Haru Ghosh, and Sandeep—the judgments arose from appeals by individuals contesting death sentences. The Court observed that the circumstances did not elevate them into the "rarest of rare" category. Rather than merely rejecting the death penalty in these instances, the court proceeded to award a distinctive form of punishment, classified as a "special category" with stringent limitations on potential remissions. The paramount question that emerges from this judicial behavior is whether an authority can intentionally disregard established statutory provisions and constitutional safeguards while reformulating sentencing norms.

In essence, the fundamental guarantees outlined in Articles 20(1) and 21 of the Constitution are breached by this reinterpretation of available sentencing options. Life imprisonment naturally encompasses the potential for remission as defined by statutory provisions, including Section 55 of the IPC and Sections 432, 433, and 433A of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Hence, when a convict seeks remission against a life sentence, they invoke a right that is firmly grounded in established legal procedure.

The procedural guarantees under both Article 20(1) and Article 21 stand violated by the judicial discretion exercised in these scenarios. Courts, in such instances, must adhere to statutory provisions that encapsulate the safeguards inherently designed to benefit a convict when serving life sentences. This aligns with the precedent established in Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, purporting that the procedural frameworks established under law are akin to due process in our legal system. Henceforth, the designation of a "special category of sentence" can be seen as infringing upon the protections guaranteed by due process.

The provisions of Articles 20(1) and 21 are integral components of the Constitution's basic structure and cannot be susceptible to legislative infringement, as stipulated under Article 13(2). Such rights are safeguarded even in a state of emergency, as articulated by the 44th Amendment of 1978, which specifically articulates that, while other rights may be curtailed, those enshrined in Articles 20 and 21 shall remain intact. These fundamental rights, which extend to all persons regardless of citizenship status, embody principles akin to "jus cogens" within the purview of international law.

Despite this robust framework, the rights of the appellants in the discussed cases have seemingly been compromised by excessive judicial discretion. If these convicts seek clemency through appeals to the President or governor under Articles 72 and 161, their cases might be significantly hindered due to the Supreme Court's mandates surrounding life sentences. This scenario raises fundamental questions regarding justice, fairness, and the rule of law.

In conclusion, the inconsistencies and discrepancies introduced by the Supreme Court's decisions in cases such as Shraddananda necessitate a thorough reevaluation by a larger Constitutional Bench. This inquiry emerges not only from a constitutional standpoint but from a broader public interest perspective, reflecting the essential need to preserve a coherent and equitable sentencing structure grounded in constitutional integrity and the fundamental rule of law. 

Justice Black's observations in Williams v. People of State of New York resonate profoundly in this context. A sentencing judge's obligation extends beyond merely determining guilt; it encompasses the responsibility to establish a fitting sentence within set statutory limitations postverdict. Adequate and comprehensive information regarding an offender's background and circumstances is vital for ensuring that the selected punishment is just and appropriate. Modern principles advocating for personalized sentencing underscore the necessity for judges to access relevant information without being constrained by rigid evidentiary rules that might apply to criminal trials.

Moreover, recent jurisprudential shifts within the Supreme Court, such as in Devendra Pal Singh Bhullar v. State of NCT, Delhi, signify a departure from emerging penological trends. The court ruled that the prolonged pendency of mercy petitions does not inherently warrant commutation, particularly in light of the gravity of the offenses involved. In stark contrast, developments noted in Shatrughan Chauhan and Another v. Union of India reinforced that the power to pardon is not merely a privilege but an obligation defined by the Constitution, allowing for limited judicial review over its exercise.

The ongoing evolution of clemency procedures within the Indian legal framework is thus indicative of an increasingly nuanced understanding of justice, humanity, and constitutional obligations, while paving the way to reconcile traditional values with contemporary human rights principles. This ongoing judicial dialogue seeks to align India's legal system with universal norms, reaffirming the intrinsic dignity and rights of every individual within its ambit. The development of sentencing policies postBachan Singh remains pivotal in ensuring that the specter of capital punishment does not overshadow the quest for justice and fairness within the system.

The Supreme Court's decision in the case of Vishaka v. The State of Rajasthan, articulated by Chief Justice J.S. Verma, represents a transformative milestone in Indian jurisprudence and a crucial reference point for the nation's legal framework. Significantly, this ruling tackled a deeply entrenched social issue—namely, the harassment of women and female workers in their workplaces—a pervasive problem that had previously operated without any explicit legal recourse or protective measures.

The impact of the Vishaka judgment extends beyond its immediate purpose; it revitalized our legal system by embedding fundamental human rights principles within the broader context of constitutional law. Through this ruling, the Court asserted the vital principle that, in the absence of contradictory domestic legislation, Indian law must reflect and incorporate the values articulated by the international community through various covenants and treaties. This approach aims to create a cohesive global jurisprudence anchored in shared human values.

To fully appreciate the significance of the Vishaka decision, one might recall the insightful observations of Justice Benjamin Cardozo, who posited that "the judge interprets the social conscience and gives effect to it in law." By doing so, he argued, judges simultaneously shape and influence the conscience they interpret—an intriguing dance of discovery and creation.

In the Vishaka ruling, the Court's interpretation of social conscience was particularly profound. The judgment aimed to secure a safe and dignified working environment for women, explicitly recognizing their entitlement to such protection under the fundamental rights enshrined in the Indian Constitution.

The case emerged in response to a writ petition filed as a class action by a group of social activists and a nongovernmental organization (NGO). This petition sought to uphold the rights of working women under Articles 14 (the right to equality), 19 (the right to freedom of speech and expression), and 21 (the right to life and personal liberty) of the Constitution. The petition highlighted alarming conditions within workplaces where the rights of women were routinely violated. Its impetus stemmed from a horrifying incident—the brutal gang rape of a social worker in a rural Rajasthan village.

Upon examining the petition, the Supreme Court determined that the infringement of women's rights was not merely a matter for criminal prosecution; it also represented a violation of the rights guaranteed under Articles 14, 15, 19(1)(g), and 21. Recognizing that the right to petition under Article 32 of the Constitution is itself a fundamental right, the Court saw it as a valuable mechanism for redressing grievances.

The Vishaka judgment unequivocally stated that gender equality and the right to a safe working environment are integral components of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution. It articulated the judiciary's duty to ensure that the state upholds these rights, emphasizing that the judiciary acts as a pillar of constitutional machinery. Additionally, it asserted that our legal framework should align with global human rights protections by incorporating relevant international treaties and conventions.

In praiseworthy clarity, the Court set forth several key principles in paragraph 14 of the Vishaka judgment:

1. The scope of fundamental rights enshrined in the Indian Constitution is expansive enough to encompass all aspects of gender equality, including the prevention of sexual harassment or abuse.
2. The independence of the judiciary is a cornerstone of our constitutional structure.
3. International conventions and norms should be integrated into domestic law when no existing legislation occupies that space and there are no conflicting provisions. The judiciary is required to consider these international guidelines when interpreting domestic laws, particularly in the absence of domestic legislation addressing a specific issue.

Recognizing a critical gap in domestic legislation to safeguard the rights of women in the workplace, the Supreme Court exercised its authority under Article 32 to establish interim guidelines and norms aimed at addressing this deficiency. In doing so, it paid particular heed to the definition of 'human rights' under Section 2(d) of the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993.

The Court also referenced the objectives laid out during the 1995 Conference of the Chief Justices of Asia and the Pacific in Beijing, which included:

1. Ensuring that every individual can live securely under the rule of law.
2. Promoting the observance and attainment of human rights within the appropriate limits of judicial function.
3. Administering justice impartially among individuals and between individuals and the state.

In its deliberation, the Court also referred to the provisions of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), emphasizing the government's commitment to these international norms.

Considering the preceding circumstances and the established positions in international covenants, the Court formulated specific guidelines to protect women from sexual harassment at their workplaces. It mandated that these guidelines remain effective until an appropriate law is enacted.

As a direct consequence of the Vishaka ruling, the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Bill, 2012, was introduced in the Indian Parliament. Although the bill faced minimal debate upon its introduction on September 3, 2012, it was ultimately passed and received presidential assent on April 22, 2013, and was gazetted the following day. This piece of legislation, representing a significant stride towards social welfare, ultimately secured the rights of women to work in dignity and safety, stemming directly from the judicial intervention invoked by the Vishaka case.

Additionally, in another pivotal case, Apparel Export Promotion Council v. A.K. Chopra, the principles set forth in the Vishaka ruling were reaffirmed amidst issues of sexual harassment faced by female employees. 

In this case, a female employee serving as a clerkcumtypist had repeatedly rebuffed unwelcome sexual advances from her superior. Following her formal complaint, the male supervisor faced departmental action and was ultimately dismissed from his position. However, attempts were made to challenge this dismissal. A judge from the Delhi High Court noted that while the supervisor had attempted to molest the employee, he had not succeeded in completing the act, and thus quashed the dismissal order. However, the Supreme Court intervened after that decision, reinforcing the principles of Vishaka.

Chief Justice Dr. Anand, who delivered this judgment, articulated that every instance of sexual harassment constitutes a violation of the female employee's fundamental right to gender equality while also infringing upon her right to life and liberty. He cited an International Labour Organization (ILO) seminar held in Manila, asserting that sexual harassment at the workplace fundamentally undermines the dignity and honor of female employees. In his judgment, he referenced the tenets of CEDAW and various international guarantees on economic, social, and cultural rights. Importantly, he underscored the necessity for courts to remain responsive to international codes of conduct and to apply those standards uniformly in cases lacking contradiction between international norms and domestic laws.

Subsequently, in the case of Chairman Railway Board and Others v. Chandrima Das and Others, the Supreme Court further extended its protective mantle by delivering a broad interpretation of the right to 'life' in alignment with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948.

Briefly summarized, this case involved a Bangladeshi national who, while navigating the bustling Howrah railway station, was misled by railway employees. Ultimately, she was taken to a prearranged room at the Railway Yatri Niwas, where she was sexually assaulted by the railway staff. Following her ordeal, she was again victimized by a different railway employee in a rented room. Her eventual rescue prompted Ms. Chandrima Das, an advocate at the Calcutta High Court, to file a public interest litigation (PIL) petition seeking compensation for the victim. The Calcutta High Court ruled in favor of the victim, awarding her ₹10 lakh (approximately $13,000) to be paid by the Union of India, representing the railways.

Dissatisfied, the Chairman of the Railway Board escalated the case to the Supreme Court. However, the higher court upheld the Calcutta High Court's judgment, asserting that the expanding interpretation of Article 14, when read alongside other Articles, now subjects all executive actions of the government to writ jurisdiction oversight by both the High Courts and the Supreme Court, where appropriate.

Furthermore, the Supreme Court concluded that the writ jurisdiction not only extends to issues of fundamental rights but also accommodates situations involving public officials implicated in violations of those rights. It reiterated that a case of rape is not merely a violation of an individual's rights but constitutes an infringement upon the fundamental right to life as protected under Article 21 of the Constitution.

In reaching its conclusions, the Supreme Court leaned on precedents established in the case of Bodhisattwa Gautam v. Subhra Chakraborty, reinforcing the principle that international covenants and declarations agreed upon by signatory states must be venerated and that their meanings must bolster the effective implementation of recognized rights. This led to the pivotal ruling stipulating that the principles encapsulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights should be integrated into India's domestic legal framework whenever possible.

In support of its position, the Supreme Court also drew upon legal precedents stated in Salomon v. Commissioner of Customs and Excise and Brind v. Secretary of State for the Home Department. The Supreme Court emphasized that when a domestic legal provision is vague and does not conflict with an international convention, it should be assumed that Parliament intended to legislate in accordance with those international norms.

Upon this foundation, the Court determined that the term 'life' appears prominently in the context of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 and posited that the fundamental rights enshrined in the Indian Constitution resonate with the rights specified in that declaration, as well as those recognized in the Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Consequently, the right to life is acknowledged as a universal human right and should align with the interpretations regularly applied by the Supreme Court regarding 'life' as expressed in its previous decisions.

The Supreme Court emphasized that the definition of 'life' cannot be constricted and illustrated a significant interpretive leap by first examining an international covenant through the lens of India's constitutional jurisprudence. This momentous ruling underscores the growing trend of internationalizing Indian laws, thereby establishing a cohesive framework of human rights principles that transcend borders.

The ramifications of this judgment extend far beyond the courtroom, marking a pivotal convergence between domestic laws and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, often dubbed the Magna Carta for humanity. In essence, this landmark decision advances the jurisprudential paradigm set forth in the Vishaka case, seeking to fuse constitutional law with universal human rights concepts, which remain integral and fundamental to the evolution of a just and equitable democracy.
