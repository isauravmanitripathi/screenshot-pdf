Over the last year, commodity\nprices have been buffeted by a wide range of\ndevelopments, including shifting expectations\nabout supply management, surges in conflict-\nrelated risk, trade restrictions, and weather-related\nsupply shocks.\n\nIn energy markets, geopolitical tensions have\nremained a critical driver of short-term price\nmovements. Oil markets have responded to\ngeopolitical flare-ups, with prices surpassing $90/\nbbl in October 2023 and April 2024. Anticipated\noil price volatility approached its highest levels\nsince Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in early\nOctober 2024, as oil prices surged by 10 percent\nin just three days (figure 1.D). Prices have tended\nto subsequently fall back, however, reflecting a\n\nconfluence of underlying longer-term factors.\nFirst, global oil consumption is decelerating,\ncontinuing the secular decline in the oil intensity\nof global GDP. Second, global oil supply\ncontinues to diversify, with the market share of\nnon-OPEC+ producers gradually increasing.\nThird, following successive rounds of output cuts,\nOPEC:+ holds spare oil capacity equivalent to\nslightly more than 7 percent of current global\nproduction (figure 1.E). This amounts to about\ndouble the average spare capacity in 2017-19,\nwhen the Brent oil price averaged $63/bbl.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the price of Brent oil\ndipped to a three-year low in September due to\nconcerns that OPEC+ might soon increase oil\nexports, despite an already well-supplied market. A\nsubsequent price spike, while sudden, saw prices\npeak below average 2024Q2 levels.

Below is an excerpt from my book titled 'Commodity Pricing', specifically from Chapter 'Commodity Market\nDevelopments and Outlook', Section 'Risks'. The original text is: 'In the near term, heightened tensions in the\nMiddle East present significant upside risks to oil\nprices, as conflict-driven disruptions of the\nregion\u2019s exports could push the price well above\nthe forecast. Other upside risks include U.S. shale\noil producers not meeting expected output and\nstronger oil consumption in China. However, over\n\nthe full forecast period, risks are tilted slightly to\n\nthe downside, in view of the potential for a\nsustained period of excess oil supply. Key\ndownside risks include weaker-than-expected\neconomic growth and a steady unwind of OPEC+\nsupply cuts\u2014broadly in line with the announced\nschedule\u2014which could generate a larger supply\nsurplus.\n\nUpside risks\n\nGeopolitical developments. The _ significant\nswings in oil prices over the last year have been\ndue partly to geopolitical developments, particu-\nlarly events related to the current conflict in the\nMiddle East. The baseline forecast accounts for\nthe continuation of relatively small-scale conflict-\nrelated disruptions, such as limited attacks toward\nships in the Red Sea, which are expected to have\nonly short-lived impacts on oil prices. However,\nsince the forecast does not factor in a major\nescalation of ongoing conflicts, any significant\nbroadening of hostilities to oil-producing\ncountries in the Middle East could pose a major\nupside risk, leading to a sharp and sustained rise in\noil prices.\n\nConflict escalation scenario. The potential oil\nmarket repercussions of the conflict in the Middle\nEast are assessed by quantifying the impact of a\nconflict-related shock decreasing global oil\nproduction by 2 mb/d. In line with recent insights\ninto the effect of different sources of supply\nshocks, this scenario assumes that oil prices are\nmore responsive to conflict-driven oil supply\nreductions than to other shocks reducing oil\noutput.2 The magnitude of the shock, which is\nassumed to take place in late 2024, is roughly\nequivalent to 2 percent of global oil production.\n\nA shock of this size, which is consistent with oil\nexports from the Middle East being severely\n\nencumbered, leads to a sharp rise in oil prices,\nwith the Brent price close to $92/bbl at peak\nimpact within a couple of months. Under this\nscenario, unaffected oil producers are expected to\nrespond to higher prices by increasing supply, as\nhas typically occurred following past conflict-\nrelated declines in global production. The Brent\noil price would then be expected to gradually\ndecrease, while remaining above the pre-escalation\nlevel. This would result in an average price of $84/\nbbl in 2025, 15 percent above the baseline\nforecast, but only 5 percent above the average\n2024 price (figure 5.B). At the current juncture,\nhigh levels of spare capacity held by OPEC+\nmembers could be a key factor defining the size\nand timing of a supply response to an oil price\nincrease.\n\nNorth American oil output. The price forecast\nassumes that U.S. oil production will increase by\nabout 0.6 mb/d in 2025. However, U.S. output\nhas recently stagnated, and the Dallas Federal\nReserve Energy Survey\u2019s business activity index\ncontracted in 2024Q3, indicating potential\nheadwinds that may slow the expansion of shale\noutput.\u2018 Apart from uncertainty about the\ntrajectory of OPEC+ production, factors curbing\nthe growth of U.S. oil supply include rising input\nand capital costs, a declining number of both\nactive and drilled but uncompleted (DUC) wells,\nworkforce constraints, and the financial discipline\nimposed by a recent wave of mergers and\nacquisitions in the industry. If these restraining\nconditions persist amid increasing global demand\nand no supply increase from OPEC+, a shortfall in\nthe market could result.\n\nRobust consumption in China.

Other upside risks include U.S. shale\noil producers not meeting expected output and\nstronger oil consumption in China. However, over\n\nthe full forecast period, risks are tilted slightly to\n\nthe downside, in view of the potential for a\nsustained period of excess oil supply. Key\ndownside risks include weaker-than-expected\neconomic growth and a steady unwind of OPEC+\nsupply cuts\u2014broadly in line with the announced\nschedule\u2014which could generate a larger supply\nsurplus.\n\nUpside risks\n\nGeopolitical developments. The _ significant\nswings in oil prices over the last year have been\ndue partly to geopolitical developments, particu-\nlarly events related to the current conflict in the\nMiddle East. The baseline forecast accounts for\nthe continuation of relatively small-scale conflict-\nrelated disruptions, such as limited attacks toward\nships in the Red Sea, which are expected to have\nonly short-lived impacts on oil prices. However,\nsince the forecast does not factor in a major\nescalation of ongoing conflicts, any significant\nbroadening of hostilities to oil-producing\ncountries in the Middle East could pose a major\nupside risk, leading to a sharp and sustained rise in\noil prices.\n\nConflict escalation scenario. The potential oil\nmarket repercussions of the conflict in the Middle\nEast are assessed by quantifying the impact of a\nconflict-related shock decreasing global oil\nproduction by 2 mb/d. In line with recent insights\ninto the effect of different sources of supply\nshocks, this scenario assumes that oil prices are\nmore responsive to conflict-driven oil supply\nreductions than to other shocks reducing oil\noutput.2 The magnitude of the shock, which is\nassumed to take place in late 2024, is roughly\nequivalent to 2 percent of global oil production.\n\nA shock of this size, which is consistent with oil\nexports from the Middle East being severely\n\nencumbered, leads to a sharp rise in oil prices,\nwith the Brent price close to $92/bbl at peak\nimpact within a couple of months. Under this\nscenario, unaffected oil producers are expected to\nrespond to higher prices by increasing supply, as\nhas typically occurred following past conflict-\nrelated declines in global production. The Brent\noil price would then be expected to gradually\ndecrease, while remaining above the pre-escalation\nlevel. This would result in an average price of $84/\nbbl in 2025, 15 percent above the baseline\nforecast, but only 5 percent above the average\n2024 price (figure 5.B). At the current juncture,\nhigh levels of spare capacity held by OPEC+\nmembers could be a key factor defining the size\nand timing of a supply response to an oil price\nincrease.\n\nNorth American oil output. The price forecast\nassumes that U.S. oil production will increase by\nabout 0.6 mb/d in 2025. However, U.S. output\nhas recently stagnated, and the Dallas Federal\nReserve Energy Survey\u2019s business activity index\ncontracted in 2024Q3, indicating potential\nheadwinds that may slow the expansion of shale\noutput.\u2018 Apart from uncertainty about the\ntrajectory of OPEC+ production, factors curbing\nthe growth of U.S. oil supply include rising input\nand capital costs, a declining number of both\nactive and drilled but uncompleted (DUC) wells,\nworkforce constraints, and the financial discipline\nimposed by a recent wave of mergers and\nacquisitions in the industry. If these restraining\nconditions persist amid increasing global demand\nand no supply increase from OPEC+, a shortfall in\nthe market could result.\n\nRobust consumption in China. The baseline\nprice forecast assumes modest oil consumption\ngrowth in China, reflecting weak economic\nactivity and the continued penetration of electric\nand hybrid vehicles. Recently announced stimulus\nmeasures and the possible introduction of new\nexpansionary fiscal policies could lessen headwinds\nin the property market, increase business and\nconsumer confidence, and lift economic growth.\n\nThis could result in higher demand from the\n\nindustrial and transportation sectors, giving rise to\noil consumption growth considerably higher than\nthe annual increases embedded in the baseline\nforecast.\n"}], "max_tokens": 12000}}

Below is an excerpt from my book titled 'Commodity Pricing', specifically from Chapter 'Commodity Market\nDevelopments and Outlook', Section 'Outlook'. The original text is: 'Following an expected 9 percent decline in 2024,\nthe World Bank\u2019s food price index is projected to\nease by an additional 4 percent in 2025 before\nstabilizing in 2026 (figure 8.E). Grain prices are\nforecast to soften by 5 percent in 2025, driven by\nincreasing global grain supplies, before leveling\nout in 2026 (figures 8.F and 9.A).\n\nWheat prices, which are set to drop by 21 percent\nin 2024, are forecast to edge lower by a further 2\npercent in 2025. Production in the 2024-25\nseason is expected to match the previous season\u2019s\nlevel, with the stock-to-use ratio (a measure of\nsupply availability relative to demand) declining\nbut remaining adequate (figures 9.B and 9.C). In\n2026, wheat prices are projected to rise by a\nmodest 1 percent as stocks become somewhat\ntighter. Global maize supply in 2024-25 is\nexpected to be roughly unchanged from 2023-24.\nAfter tumbling an expected 26 percent in 2024,\nmaize prices are forecast to fall by just 1 percent in\n2025, then edge up 2 percent in 2026 as global\nsupply remains steady. Strong maize yield pro-\nspects in the United States for the 2024-25\nseason, which more than offset a 4-million-acre\nreduction in planted area, are being counterbal-\nanced by poor growing conditions in southeastern\nEurope and parts of Russia and Ukraine.\n\nFollowing an expected 8 percent increase in 2024,\nrice prices are forecast to fall by 11 percent in\n2025 and 2 percent in 2026, as global output\nreaches a new high in the 2024-25 season and\nIndia eases its rice export restrictions. Ample\nmonsoon rains have expanded rice sowings in\nIndia for the 2024-25 season, while the probable\nemergence of La Nifia weather conditions, which\ntypically bring more rainfall to South Asia, is\nexpected to improve yields and boost inventories.\nProduction in other major exporters across Asia\nand the United States is expected to hold steady in\n2024-25.\n\nAfter declining by 11 percent in 2024, the oils and\nmeals price index is forecast to soften a further 4\npercent in 2025, driven by favorable global oilseed\nsupplies, before flattening out in 2026 (figures\n9.D and 9.E). Following an anticipated 24 percent\ndrop in 2024, soybean prices are projected to\ndecrease by a further 6 percent in 2025, with\nglobal production projected to rise by 9 percent in\nthe 2024-25 season to reach a new record. Among\nmajor exporters, soybean production is set to\nincrease by 10 percent in Brazil and the United\nStates and 6 percent in Argentina, driven by a\ncombination of larger acreage and improving\nyields.

However, the index remained 65 percent\nhigher than a year ago, following surges earlier this\nyear in prices for Robusta coffee and cocoa, and more\nrecently, Arabica coffee. After a 58 percent gain in\n2024, the index is expected to fall by 9 percent in\n2025 and slide a further 3 percent in 2026 as coffee\n\nand cocoa production recover.\n\nCoffee prices reached multi-year highs in 2024Q3.\nArabica prices rose by 11 percent in 2024Q3, to\nstand more than 40 percent higher than a year\nearlier, while Robusta prices gained 16 percent in\nthe quarter to reach a level in September double\nthat of a year earlier (figure 12.A). There remain\nsignificant risks to global coffee supply: while\nweather conditions in East Asia have improved,\neasing pressures on Robusta prices, recent con-\ncerns over Brazil\u2019s Arabica production, arising\nfrom adverse weather in August, have reduced\nexpectations of a bumper crop this year. Global\ncoffee production, which increased to an estimated\n170 million bags in 2023-24, is expected to reach\n173 million bags next season (figure 12.B).\n\nHowever, this will still be considerably lower than\nglobal coffee production in 2020-21. The linger-\ning impact of a major production shortfall in 2021\n-22, combined with steady demand growth of\naround 1 percent annually, has kept prices elevat-\ned. Following a projected 20 percent increase in\n2024, Arabica prices are forecast to decline by 8\npercent in 2025 before stabilizing in 2026.\nRobusta prices, which are expected to rise by more\nthan two-thirds in 2024, are projected to drop by\na similar magnitude as Arabica in 2025, with a\nfurther 7 percent decrease in 2026. Key risks to\nthis outlook, particularly for 2025, include\nworsening weather conditions in South America,\nwhich could damage Brazil\u2019s crop, and the poten-\n\ntial emergence of La Nifia, which could adversely\naffect production in South America and East Asia.\n\nCocoa prices fell by 20 percent in 2024Q3 but\nwere still nearly double their level in 2023Q3\n(figure 12.C). After reaching an all-time high of\nalmost $10/kg earlier in the year, cocoa prices have\ndropped significantly, trading around $6.5/kg in\nOctober. This decline has been partly driven by\nfavorable weather conditions in West Africa,\nwhich have improved supply expectations. Global\ncocoa production is estimated to have decreased\nby about 14 percent in the 2023-24 season, falling\nto 4.2 million metric tons (mmt) from 4.9 mmt in\n2022-23, mainly due to lower output in C\u00e9te\nd'Ivoire and Ghana, which account for almost 60\npercent of global cocoa production (figure 12.D).\n\nCocoa supply conditions are expected to improve\nin 2024-25, especially in C\u00e9te d'Ivoire, where\nbetter weather across key production zones could\nboost output by as much as 15 percent. Neverthe-\nless, with limited supply increases anticipated from\nother regions, cocoa prices will remain elevated.\nAfter a projected doubling of prices in 2024, cocoa\nprices are expected to ease in the coming years, by\naround 13 percent in 2025 and 2 percent in 2026.\nA return of unfavorable weather in West Africa is\na key upside risk to this price outlook.\n\nTea prices (three-auction average) rose by almost 4\npercent in 2024Q3 (q/q), reaching a level 20\npercent higher than a year earlier. A 16 percent\nincrease at the Kolkata auction was partly offset by\nmodest declines at the Colombo and Mombasa\nauctions (figure 12.E). The moderate rise in\naverage tea prices reflects, in part, lower produc-\ntion from South Asian producers, including India\n(down 13 percent in first half 2024, compared the\nfirst half of 2023), Bangladesh (-8 percent), and\nSri Lanka (-5 percent). Meanwhile, in Kenya\u2014the\nworld\u2019s leading tea exporter\u2014production in-\ncreased by 25 percent over the same period due to\nimproved weather conditions (figure 12.F).\nFollowing an estimated 13 percent increase in\n2024, tea prices are set to remain fairly flat in\n2025, as a limited recovery in supplies in South\nAsia (especially India) and East Africa (notably\nKenya) is balanced by subdued demand growth,\nparticularly in the Middle East.\n'.

After a 58 percent gain in\n2024, the index is expected to fall by 9 percent in\n2025 and slide a further 3 percent in 2026 as coffee\n\nand cocoa production recover.\n\nCoffee prices reached multi-year highs in 2024Q3.\nArabica prices rose by 11 percent in 2024Q3, to\nstand more than 40 percent higher than a year\nearlier, while Robusta prices gained 16 percent in\nthe quarter to reach a level in September double\nthat of a year earlier (figure 12.A). There remain\nsignificant risks to global coffee supply: while\nweather conditions in East Asia have improved,\neasing pressures on Robusta prices, recent con-\ncerns over Brazil\u2019s Arabica production, arising\nfrom adverse weather in August, have reduced\nexpectations of a bumper crop this year. Global\ncoffee production, which increased to an estimated\n170 million bags in 2023-24, is expected to reach\n173 million bags next season (figure 12.B).\n\nHowever, this will still be considerably lower than\nglobal coffee production in 2020-21. The linger-\ning impact of a major production shortfall in 2021\n-22, combined with steady demand growth of\naround 1 percent annually, has kept prices elevat-\ned. Following a projected 20 percent increase in\n2024, Arabica prices are forecast to decline by 8\npercent in 2025 before stabilizing in 2026.\nRobusta prices, which are expected to rise by more\nthan two-thirds in 2024, are projected to drop by\na similar magnitude as Arabica in 2025, with a\nfurther 7 percent decrease in 2026. Key risks to\nthis outlook, particularly for 2025, include\nworsening weather conditions in South America,\nwhich could damage Brazil\u2019s crop, and the poten-\n\ntial emergence of La Nifia, which could adversely\naffect production in South America and East Asia.\n\nCocoa prices fell by 20 percent in 2024Q3 but\nwere still nearly double their level in 2023Q3\n(figure 12.C). After reaching an all-time high of\nalmost $10/kg earlier in the year, cocoa prices have\ndropped significantly, trading around $6.5/kg in\nOctober. This decline has been partly driven by\nfavorable weather conditions in West Africa,\nwhich have improved supply expectations. Global\ncocoa production is estimated to have decreased\nby about 14 percent in the 2023-24 season, falling\nto 4.2 million metric tons (mmt) from 4.9 mmt in\n2022-23, mainly due to lower output in C\u00e9te\nd'Ivoire and Ghana, which account for almost 60\npercent of global cocoa production (figure 12.D).\n\nCocoa supply conditions are expected to improve\nin 2024-25, especially in C\u00e9te d'Ivoire, where\nbetter weather across key production zones could\nboost output by as much as 15 percent. Neverthe-\nless, with limited supply increases anticipated from\nother regions, cocoa prices will remain elevated.\nAfter a projected doubling of prices in 2024, cocoa\nprices are expected to ease in the coming years, by\naround 13 percent in 2025 and 2 percent in 2026.\nA return of unfavorable weather in West Africa is\na key upside risk to this price outlook.\n\nTea prices (three-auction average) rose by almost 4\npercent in 2024Q3 (q/q), reaching a level 20\npercent higher than a year earlier. A 16 percent\nincrease at the Kolkata auction was partly offset by\nmodest declines at the Colombo and Mombasa\nauctions (figure 12.E). The moderate rise in\naverage tea prices reflects, in part, lower produc-\ntion from South Asian producers, including India\n(down 13 percent in first half 2024, compared the\nfirst half of 2023), Bangladesh (-8 percent), and\nSri Lanka (-5 percent). Meanwhile, in Kenya\u2014the\nworld\u2019s leading tea exporter\u2014production in-\ncreased by 25 percent over the same period due to\nimproved weather conditions (figure 12.F).\nFollowing an estimated 13 percent increase in\n2024, tea prices are set to remain fairly flat in\n2025, as a limited recovery in supplies in South\nAsia (especially India) and East Africa (notably\nKenya) is balanced by subdued demand growth,\nparticularly in the Middle East.\n"}], "max_tokens": 12000}}

The original text is: 'Metal prices were bolstered in late September by\npolicy measures\u2014which included monetary\neasing, housing market support, and liquidity\ninjections for the stock market\u2014aimed at lifting\ngrowth and stabilizing the property sector in\nChina. However, metal prices have since softened\nagain amid uncertainty over the scale of future\npolicy support in China. Previously, base metal\nand iron ore prices had declined in 2024Q3,\nreflecting weaker-than-anticipated economic data\nreleases for China, coupled with signs of moderat-\ning growth in the United States and continued\nindustrial weakness in Europe (figure 15.A). These\ndevelopments were reflected in steep price declines\nfor some metals used intensively in construction\nand manufacturing, such as copper and iron ore.\nBase metal prices are projected to stabilize next\nyear before declining in 2026, as steady supply\ngrowth is counterbalanced by secular demand\ngrowth, including tailwinds from the energy\ntransition.\n\nAluminum prices dropped by 6 percent in\n2024Q3 (q/q), due to weak industrial activity\u2014\nnotably in China\u2014amid a buildup of inventories.\nPrices rose following stimulus announcements in\nChina in late September but softened again\n\nthereafter. An uptick in production growth in\nChina, aided by favorable weather that enabled\nsmelters in Yunnan province to resume operations,\ncontributed to downward price pressures earlier in\n2024Q3. Global aluminum demand is expected to\nremain resilient over the forecast horizon, driven\nby the expanding use of renewable energy technol-\nogies such as solar panels and electric vehicles, and\nincreased power-grid infrastructure needs. Rising\ndemand should be met with steady supply growth\nin Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, as well as a\nrecovery in major European smelters, which had\nreduced production because of high energy costs\nstemming from Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine\u2014\naluminum production in Europe fell by almost 15\npercent from 2021 to 2023. In addition, China\u2014\nthe world\u2019s largest aluminum producer\u2014is\nexpanding smelter operations in Southeast Asia as\nit approaches its self-imposed domestic annual\nproduction cap of 45 million tons. After an\nexpected 10 percent increase in 2024 (y/y),\naluminum prices are forecast to hold steady in\n2025 before rising by 4 percent in 2026, under-\npinned by resilient demand.\n\nCopper prices fell by 6 percent in 2024Q3 (q/q)\ndue to signs of decelerating industrial activity in\nsome major economies, with recent price increases\non the back of stimulus measures in China also\nproving short-lived (figures 15.B and 15.C).\nSupply concerns, including a speculative rally in\nlate May that pushed prices to near historic highs\nin 2024Q2, have eased due to increasing output\nfrom major producers\u2014including Chile, following\nthe resolution of labor disputes at the world\u2019s\nlargest copper mine. Global copper supply is\nexpected to rise steadily in the next few years, with\nadditional output from Africa, South America,\nand elsewhere coming online. Global demand for\ncopper is also likely to remain stable, despite the\nprolonged downturn in China\u2019s property sector.\nThis partly reflects the copper-intensive nature of\nmany energy-transition technologies, including\nelectric vehicles, renewable energy systems, and\ngrid infrastructure. Following an expected 9\npercent increase in 2024 (y/y), copper prices are\nforecast to edge up by almost 1 percent in 2025\nsupported by steady demand growth. In 2026,\ncopper prices are projected to fall by 9 percent\n\nowing to stronger supply growth.

Zinc is mainly used\nto galvanize steel for construction, manufacturing,\nand infrastructure, and demand is therefore\nsensitive to the global industrial cycle, particularly\nconditions in China. Production of refined zinc is\nexpected to grow steadily as major European\nproducers restart smelters that have been offline\nsince 2022 because of high energy costs, and as\nnew smelters come online in Russia.

Below is an excerpt from my book titled 'Commodity Pricing', specifically from Chapter 'Commodity Market\nDevelopments and Outlook', Section 'Risks'. The original text is: 'Risks to the price forecasts are broadly balanced.\nUpside risks to base metals and iron ore prices\ninclude more concerted stimulus policies in\nChina, including fiscal measures; unexpected\nproduction disruptions; and trade restrictions.\nWeaker-than-expected industrial activity in major\neconomies remains the main downside risk to the\nmetal price forecasts. For precious metals prices,\nescalating geopolitical tensions represent a key\nupside risk.\n\nUpside risks\n\nStronger-than-expected growth in China. In\nSeptember, China rolled out a monetary and\nregulatory stimulus package intended to counter\nslowing growth and stabilize the ailing property\nsector. Most metal prices, particularly construction\n-related metals such as iron ore, rose in response to\nthe stimulus measures, but prices retreated again\nin October amid uncertainty over the scale of\nfuture policy support. If policymakers in China\nimplement more aggressive stimulus measures,\nincluding additional fiscal support, it could\nsubstantially boost industrial output and help curb\nthe decline in the property sector. Under such\ncircumstances, metal demand could increase\nsignificantly\u2014especially in cases of tight supply\u2014\npushing prices above current forecasts.\n\nSupply disruptions. Mining operations and\nassociated processing could be constrained by\nvarious factors, including environmental issues,\nlabor disputes, constraints on power and water\navailability, and weather conditions. Unexpected\ndevelopments like these could raise prices above\nprojections. Prices for metals which are critical to\nthe energy transition, like copper and nickel,\nmight prove especially sensitive to supply outages.\n\nTrade restrictions. Several metals have become\nsubject to increasing trade restrictions, including\nimport curbs on aluminum from China and\n\nRussia by some advanced economies, an export\nban on nickel ore by Indonesia, and export taxes\non tin concentrate by Myanmar. Further prolifera-\ntion of such restrictions could reduce the volume\nof metals production and trade, effectively tighten-\ning supply and raising prices above forecast levels.\nAdditionally, China\u2019s aluminum production is\nclose to hitting a self-imposed limit of 45 million\ntons per year, introduced in 2017 to limit carbon\nemissions. Should the cap be enforced, aluminum\nsupply could be tighter in the coming years,\npushing prices higher.\n\nGeopolitical tensions. Gold\u2019s appeal as a safe-\nhaven asset tends to increase during times of\nheightened geopolitical tensions and policy\nuncertainty. A further escalation of conflicts,\nparticularly in Europe and the Middle East, could\ndrive gold prices beyond current projections.\n\nDownside risk\n\nWeaker-than-expected global industrial activi-\nty. Amid elevated interest rates and subdued\nglobal trade growth, weaker-than-expected indus-\n\ntrial activity across major economies could depress\n\nmetals demand in the coming years, resulting in\nsignificantly lower prices than anticipated. In\nparticular, the forecasts assume that China\u2019s GDP\ngrowth will remain above 4 percent per year on\naverage in 2025-26. However, if recent stimulus\nmeasures fail to gain traction and further stimulus\nis not introduced, domestic demand in China\ncould weaken further, with construction activity\ncontinuing to slow.

For precious metals prices,\nescalating geopolitical tensions represent a key\nupside risk.\n\nUpside risks\n\nStronger-than-expected growth in China. In\nSeptember, China rolled out a monetary and\nregulatory stimulus package intended to counter\nslowing growth and stabilize the ailing property\nsector. Most metal prices, particularly construction\n-related metals such as iron ore, rose in response to\nthe stimulus measures, but prices retreated again\nin October amid uncertainty over the scale of\nfuture policy support. If policymakers in China\nimplement more aggressive stimulus measures,\nincluding additional fiscal support, it could\nsubstantially boost industrial output and help curb\nthe decline in the property sector. Under such\ncircumstances, metal demand could increase\nsignificantly\u2014especially in cases of tight supply\u2014\npushing prices above current forecasts.\n\nSupply disruptions. Mining operations and\nassociated processing could be constrained by\nvarious factors, including environmental issues,\nlabor disputes, constraints on power and water\navailability, and weather conditions. Unexpected\ndevelopments like these could raise prices above\nprojections. Prices for metals which are critical to\nthe energy transition, like copper and nickel,\nmight prove especially sensitive to supply outages.\n\nTrade restrictions. Several metals have become\nsubject to increasing trade restrictions, including\nimport curbs on aluminum from China and\n\nRussia by some advanced economies, an export\nban on nickel ore by Indonesia, and export taxes\non tin concentrate by Myanmar. Further prolifera-\ntion of such restrictions could reduce the volume\nof metals production and trade, effectively tighten-\ning supply and raising prices above forecast levels.\nAdditionally, China\u2019s aluminum production is\nclose to hitting a self-imposed limit of 45 million\ntons per year, introduced in 2017 to limit carbon\nemissions. Should the cap be enforced, aluminum\nsupply could be tighter in the coming years,\npushing prices higher.\n\nGeopolitical tensions. Gold\u2019s appeal as a safe-\nhaven asset tends to increase during times of\nheightened geopolitical tensions and policy\nuncertainty. A further escalation of conflicts,\nparticularly in Europe and the Middle East, could\ndrive gold prices beyond current projections.\n\nDownside risk\n\nWeaker-than-expected global industrial activi-\nty.

In\nparticular, the forecasts assume that China\u2019s GDP\ngrowth will remain above 4 percent per year on\naverage in 2025-26. However, if recent stimulus\nmeasures fail to gain traction and further stimulus\nis not introduced, domestic demand in China\ncould weaken further, with construction activity\ncontinuing to slow.

Below is an excerpt from my book titled 'Commodity Pricing', specifically from Chapter 'SPECIAL FOCUS\n\nCommodity Price Synchronization:\n\nA New Era?', Section 'Introduction'. The original text is: 'Over the past five decades, commodity markets have experienced periods of heightened price synchronization,\nparticularly during times of global economic stress, such as the pandemic-induced recession and the Global\nFinancial Crisis (GFC). The record pace at which prices rebounded from pandemic lows in April 2020 gave\nway to broad-based declines starting in March 2022. Unlike the rebound after the global financial crisis, which\nwas primarily driven by economic recovery and strong growth in emerging market and developing countries, the\nrecent period has been marked by a series of disparate, commodity-specific shocks that have come from such\nsources as increased conflict in key commodity-producing regions and severe weather events. These shocks drove\ninflation higher and adversely affected global economic activity. In recent months, the commodity market effects\nof these shocks have largely subsided, leading to greater dispersion in price movements across commodities.\nHowever, the risk of synchronized price increases, due to an escalation in geopolitical tensions, remains\nsignificant. When price rises are broad-based across commodities, it limits consumers\u2019 ability to substitute\ntoward lower-priced goods, amplifying welfare losses and reducing the effectiveness of inflation mitigation\n\nefforts.\n\nThe widespread collapse in commodity prices in\nearly 2020, caused by the pandemic-induced\nglobal recession, was followed by a broad-based\nrebound, during which prices of several commodi-\nties recorded nominal all-time highs. This syn-\nchronized variation in commodity prices is not\nunprecedented in the post-World War II era. The\nmost recent preceding boom occurred in the early\n2000s, fueled by rising commodity demand\ntriggered by strong growth in emerging market\nand developing economies (EMDEs), especially\nChina (Alquist, Bhattarai, and Coibion 2020;\nBaffes and Haniotis 2010; World Bank 2015).\nThis upswing in prices was disrupted by the global\nfinancial crisis of 2007-09; having risen steadily\nfrom the mid-2000s to 2008, commodity prices\nthen declined in unison to early-2006 levels by the\nend of 2008.\n\nSeveral studies have examined common cycles in\ncommodity markets and their causes. A prevailing\nview attributes the phenomenon to fluctuations in\nthe global business cycle, which represents a\ncommon underlying component driving prices\n(Alquist, Bhattarai, and Coibion 2020; Byrne,\nSakemoto, and Xu 2020; Delle Chiaie, Ferrara,\nand Giannone 2022). However, developments\nspecific to individual commodities can also create\na \u201cperfect storm,\u201d in which distinct factors align to\ncause price comovement. During the post-\n\npandemic recovery, as commodity prices surged\nbecause of rebounding economic activity, a series\nof disparate shocks further intensified price\npressures. For example, geopolitical risks, such as\nthe Russian invasion of Ukraine, led to increased\ninventory demand for crude oil due to concerns\nabout supply disruptions. Meanwhile, extreme\nweather events, such as droughts and flooding,\nstrained agricultural yields and drove up prices of\nkey crops (World Bank 2022a).\n\nIn addition to direct shocks, spillover effects can\nfurther synchronize price movements in commod-\nity markets. Price fluctuations in energy, a key\ninput in metal production and _ agriculture,\nincrease costs across sectors, both directly (as fuel\ncosts) and indirectly (through chemical and\nfertilizer prices; World Bank 2016, 2019).!\nSimilarly, elevated crude oil prices can incentivize\nincreased production of biofuels, increasing\ndemand, and prices, for biofuel feedstocks such as\npalm oil, maize, soybean oil, and sugar.\n\nCommodity price synchronization depends on the\ntype of underlying shocks. A common underlying\ncause, such as a surge in productivity-driven global\ngrowth, might typically lead to a stronger comove-\nment in commodity prices than would result from\ndisparate shocks, which affect markets unevenly.\nThe effects on global economic activity and\ninflation also vary. For example, technological\n\nadvancements that increase productivity in non-\ncommodity sectors can boost demand for inputs\nsuch as energy and metals. Consequently, both\ncommodity prices and global output rise due to\nthis increased productivity. However, broader\nconsumer prices may decline due to lower produc-\ntion costs. In contrast, commodity price spikes\ndriven by geopolitical tensions may have a more\npronounced inflationary effect but result in a\nrelatively transitory drag on economic activity as\nthe shocks dissipate or alternative supply chains\nemerge (Kilian, Plante, and Richter 2024).\n\nThis Special Focus explores synchronized cycles in\ncommodity prices and their underlying drivers.\nSpecifically, it addresses the following questions:\n\n\u00a2 How has commodity price synchronization\nchanged over the past five decades?\n\n\u00a2 What are the key drivers behind synchronized\ncycles in commodity prices?\n\n\u00a2 How do synchronized commodity price\nmovements during the pandemic-induced\nglobal recession of 2020 compare with those\noccurring during the global financial crisis of\n2009?\n\nThis Special Focus builds on existing literature\nthat examines commonalities in commodity price\nmovements and their linkages to the global\neconomy (for example, Alquist, Bhattarai, and\nCoibion 2020; Delle Chiaie, Ferrara, and Gian-\nnone 2022). Unlike these studies, which focus on\npre-pandemic periods, this analysis extends the\ninvestigation to the period from the onset of the\npandemic in early 2020 through mid-2024,\nincorporating drivers of synchronized commodity\nprice cycles more relevant to the post-COVID-19\nperiod. More recent research on commodity\nmarket developments has primarily focused on\nspecific commodities. For instance, Baumeister,\nOhnsorge, and Verduzco-Bustos (2024) explore\nhow underlying demand and supply shocks drove\nmetal price swings during the global recession\ninduced by the pandemic. Other studies concen-\ntrate on the macroeconomic effects of individual\ncommodity shocks. Ha et al. (2023) assess the\nimpact of oil price shocks on global inflation,\n\nwhile Kilian, Plante, and Richter (2024) examine\nthe role of geopolitical risk in oil markets and its\nbroader effects on economic activity.\n\nThis Special Focus presents several key findings.\nFirst, there is a joint cycle in commodity prices\u2014\nover the past five decades, a common component\nhas explained price movements, such as in the\npandemic and the subsequent recovery period.\nFrom early 2020 through mid-2024, this shared\ncomponent has, on average, explained 61.4\npercent of fluctuations in base metal prices, 41.7\npercent of energy prices, and 26.4 percent of food\nprices. Price synchronization remained strongest in\nenergy and metals, much as it did during the\nglobal financial crisis\u2014reflecting the close rela-\ntionship between their consumption and industrial\nactivity. However, in the post-COVID period,\nprecious metals have also increasingly aligned with\nother commodities. Latterly, greater price disper-\nsion has started to return, tempering the peak\nsynchronization seen from the early 2020s to mid-\n2022.\n\nSecond, a one standard deviation global demand\nshock\u2014such as fiscal support or shifts in consum-\ner preferences that raise commodity demand\u2014can\nincrease commodity prices by up to 4.8 percent\nover six months before the effect fades. In contrast,\na one standard deviation global supply shock\u2014\nsuch as productivity gains from structural reforms\nin the global economy\u2014has a stronger and more\npersistent impact. So do commodity-specific\nshocks\u2014such as conflicts in key commodity-\nproducing regions that disrupt commodity supply\nor increase inventory demand. Global supply\nshocks raise prices by 10.3 percent, and commodi-\nty-specific shocks by 6.2 percent, within seven\nmonths, with effects lasting over a year.\n\nThird, during global recessions and their recover-\nies, global demand and supply shocks have been\nthe main drivers of price changes. However, in the\nrecovery from the global recession of 2020,\ncommodity-specific shocks, such as heightened\ngeopolitical tensions, also contributed sizably to\nthe rebound in commodity prices. This contrasts\nwith the price swings during the global recession\nof 2009 when commodity-specific shocks played a\n\nless important role.\n'.

The original text is: 'Evolution of synchronized commodity prices.\nSynchronized commodity prices, reflected by the\ncommon factor, typically mirror the global\nbusiness cycle. These prices peak before global\nrecessions\u2014such as those in 1975, 1982, 1991,\n2009, and 2020\u2014and decline during these\nperiods before recovering. However, this factor\ndoes not solely track changes in global economic\nactivity. Significant deviations arise because of\nspecific events within commodity markets\u2014such\nas the oil price spikes in 1973-74, 1978-79, and\n1990-91 (figure SF.1.A).\n\nAt the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early\n2020, commodity prices experienced a sharp and\nbroad-based decline, driven by a severe contrac-\ntion in demand as widespread lockdowns disrupt-\ned global economic activity. Subsequently, com-\nmodity prices surged in the second half of 2020,\nreflecting a recovery in economic activity as the\ninitial shock of the pandemic subsided.

For example, the common\ncommodity factor rose earlier than crude oil prices\nin the early 1970s, reflecting broad-based price\npressures in markets like copper and maize. These\n\npressures began before the 1973 oil price shock\ntriggered by the Arab-Israeli War, illustrating that\nthe global factor captures underlying trends across\nmultiple commodities, rather than simply re-\nsponding to oil-driven shocks (Cooper et al.\n1975). During the 2008-09 global financial crisis,\nthe common factor declined more gradually than\ndid copper prices, as the sharp fall in industrial\nmetals was offset by more stable agricultural\nprices, resulting in a smoother overall decline.\nSimilarly, during the COVID-19 recession, the\ncommon factor fell less sharply than oil prices,\nwhich were particularly volatile because of the\ncollapse in energy demand.\n\nSynchronization in commodity prices across\ncommodity groups. The role of a common\ncommodity factor is especially clear in explaining\nindustrial commodity price movements.

In contrast, it accounted for only 11\npercent of the variation in agricultural commodity\nprices, precious metals, and fertilizers (figure\nSE1.C). The stronger association with industrial\ncommodities reflects the close relationship be-\ntween metal and energy consumption and indus-\ntrial activity, a link established by several studies.\nMetal prices, particularly copper, are often seen as\nleading indicators of global economic activity\n(Baffes and Nagle 2022; Bernanke 2016; Hamil-\nton 2015). By contrast, agricultural commodities\nare more affected by supply shocks, primarily\ndriven by weather and policy changes, which\ndominate demand fluctuations.

Geopolitical developments in\nmajor commodity-producing regions, especially\nthe war in Ukraine in 2022, compounded previ-\nous upward pressure on commodity prices.\n\nThe differing nature of these shocks has led to\ndistinct dynamics between global economic\nactivity, inflation, and commodity prices across\nthe two periods. Unlike after the global financial\ncrisis, when productivity-driven global supply\nshocks sustained elevated commodity prices while\nsuppressing inflation, the post-pandemic surge in\ncommodity prices was primarily driven by global\ndemand and market-specific shocks (figure\nSF.3.B). This led to commodity price increases in\n2020-22 that were shorter-lived, but also more\ninflationary, with adverse implications for global\neconomic activity.\n"}], "max_tokens": 12000}}
