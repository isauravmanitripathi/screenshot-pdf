This coexistence of these two\nsectors is commonly referred to as \u2018financial dualism.\u2019 The formal financial sector is char-\nacterized by the presence of an organized, institutional, and regulated system which caters\nto the financial needs of the modern spheres of economy; the informal financial sector is an\nunorganized, non-institutional, and non-regulated system dealing with the traditional and\nrural spheres of the economy.\n\nThe informal financial sector has emerged as a result of the intrinsic dualism of economic\nand social structures in developing countries, and financial repression which inhibits the\ncertain deprived sections of society from accessing funds. The informal system is charac-\nterized by flexibility of operations and interface relationships between the creditor and the\ndebtor. The advantages are: low transaction costs, minimal default risk, and transparency of\nprocedures. Due to these advantages, a wide range and higher rates of interest prevail in the\ninformal sector.\n\nAn interpenetration is found between the formal and informal systems in terms of opera-\ntions, participants, and nature of activities which, in turn, have led to their coexistence. A high\npriority should be accorded to the development of an efficient formal financial system as it can\noffer lower intermediation costs and services to a wide base of savers and entrepreneurs.\n",

New channels of financial intermediation have come into existence as a result of information\ntechnology. Payment services enable quick, safe, and convenient transfer of funds and settlement of\ntransactions.\n\nLiquidity is essential for the smooth functioning of a financial system. Financial liquidity of financial\nclaims is enhanced through trading in securities. Liquidity is provided by brokers who act as dealers by\nassisting sellers and buyers and also by market makers who provide buy and sell quotes.\n\nFinancial services are necessary for the management of risk in the increasingly complex global econ-\nomy. They enable risk transfer and protection from risk. Risk can be defined as a chance of loss. Risk\ntransfer of services help the financial market participants to move unwanted risks to others who will\naccept it. The speculators who take on the risk need a trading platform to transfer this risk to other specu-\nlators. In addition, market participants need financial insurance to protect themselves from various types\nof risks such as interest rate fluctuations and exchange rate risk.\n\nGrowing competition and advances in communication and technology have forced firms to look for\ninnovative ways for value creation. Financial engineering presents opportunities for value creation. These\nservices refer to the process of designing, developing, and implementing innovative solutions for unique\nneeds in funding, investing, and risk management. Restructuring of assets and/or liabilities, off balance\nsheet items, development of synthetic securities, and repackaging of financial claims are some examples\nof financial engineering.\n\nThe producers of these financial services are financial intermediaries, such as, banks, insurance com-\npanies, mutual funds, and stock exchanges. Financial intermediaries provide key financial services such\nas merchant banking, leasing, hire purchase, and credit-rating. Financial services rendered by the finan-\ncial intermediaries bridge the gap between lack of knowledge on the part of investors and the increasing\nsophistication of financial instruments and markets. These financial services are vital for creation of\nfirms, industrial expansion, and economic growth.\n\nBefore investors lend money, they need to be reassured that it is safe to exchange securities for\nfunds. The financial regulator who regulates the conduct of the market and intermediaries to protect the\ninvestors\u2019 interests provides this reassurance. The regulator regulates the conduct of issuers of securities\nand the intermediaries to protect the interests of investors in securities and increases their confidence\nin markets which, in turn, helps in the growth and development of the financial system. Regulation is\nnecessary not only to develop a system, but a system once developed needs to be regulated. The RBI\nregulates the money market and the SEBI regulates the capital market. The securities market is regulated\n\n\nby the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), the Department of Company Affairs (DCA), the RBI,\nand the SEBI. A high-level committee on capital and financial markets coordinates the activities of these\nagencies.\n",

They are interdependent\nand interact continuously with each other. Their interaction leads to the development of a smoothly\nfunctioning financial system.\n\nFinancial institutions or intermediaries mobilize savings by issuing different types of financial\ninstruments which are traded in the financial markets. To facilitate the credit-allocation process, these\ninstitutions acquire specialization and render specialized financial services.\n\nFinancial intermediaries have close links with the financial markets in the economy. Financial institu-\ntions acquire, hold, and trade financial securities which not only help in the credit-allocation process but\nalso make the financial markets larger, more liquid, stable, and diversified. Financial intermediaries rely\non financial markets to raise funds whenever the need arises. This increases the competition between\nfinancial markets and financial intermediaries for attracting investors and borrowers. The development\nof new sophisticated markets has led to the development of complex securities and portfolios. The evalu-\nation of these complex securities, portfolios, and strategies requires financial expertise which financial\nintermediaries provide through financial services.\n\nFinancial markets have also made an impact on the functioning of financial intermediaries such as\nbanks and financial institutions. The latter are, today, radically changed entities as the bulk of the service\nfees and non-interest income that they derive is directly or indirectly linked to financial market-related\nactivities.\n\nMoreover, liquid and broad markets make financial instruments a more attractive avenue for sav-\nings, and financial services may encourage further savings if the net returns to investors are raised or\nincreased.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "FUNCTIONS OF A FINANCIAL SYSTEM\n\nOne of the important functions of a financial system is to link the savers and investors and, thereby, help\nin mobilizing and allocating the savings efficiently and effectively. By acting as an efficient conduit for\nallocation of resources, it permits continuous upgradation of technologies for promoting growth on a\nsustained basis.\n\nA financial system not only helps in selecting projects to be funded but also inspires the operators to\nmonitor the performance of the investment. Financial markets and institutions help to monitor corporate\nperformance and exert corporate control through the threat of hostile takeovers for underperforming\nfirms.\n\nIt provides a payment mechanism for the exchange of goods and services and transfers economic\nresources through time and across geographic regions and industries. Payment and settlement systems\nplay an important role to ensure that funds move safely, quickly, and in a timely manner. An efficient\npayment and settlement system contributes to the operating and allocation efficiencies of the financial\nsystem and thus, overall economic growth. Payment and settlement systems serve an important role in the\neconomy as the main arteries of the financial sector. Banks provide this mechanism by offering a means\nof payment facility based upon cheques, promissory notes, credit and debit cards. This payment mecha-\nnism is now increasingly through electronic means. The clearing and settlements mechanism of the stock\nmarkets is done through depositories and clearing corporations.\n\nOne of the most important functions of a financial system is to achieve optimum allocation of risk\nbearing. It limits, pools, and trades the risks involved in mobilizing savings and allocating credit. An\nefficient financial system aims at containing risk within acceptable limits. It reduces risk by laying down\nrules governing the operation of the system. Risk reduction is achieved by holding diversified portfolios\nand screening of borrowers. Market participants gain protection from unexpected losses by buying\nfinancial insurance services. Risk is traded in the financial markets through financial instruments such as\nderivatives. Derivatives are risk shifting devices, they shift risk from those who have it but may not want\nit to those who are willing to take it.\n\nA financial system also makes available price-related information which is a valuable assistance to\nthose who need to take economic and financial decisions. Financial markets disseminate information\nfor enabling participants to develop an informed opinion about investment, disinvestment, reinvestment,\n\n\nor holding a particular asset. This information dissemination enables a quick valuation of financial assets.\nMoreover, by influencing the market price of a firm\u2019s debt and equity instruments, this process of valua-\ntion guides the management as to whether their actions are consistent with the objective of shareholder\nwealth maximization. In addition, a financial system also minimises situations where the information is\nasymmetric and likely to affect motivations among operators when one party has the information and the\nother party does not. It also reduces the cost of gathering and analysing information to assist operators in\ntaking decisions carefully.\n\nA financial system also offers portfolio adjustment facilities. These are provided by financial markets\nand financial intermediaries such as banks and mutual funds. Portfolio adjustment facilities include\nservices of providing a quick, cheap and reliable way of buying and selling a wide variety of financial\nassets.\n\nA financial system helps in the creation of a financial structure that lowers the cost of transactions.\nThis has a beneficial influence on the rate of return to savers. It also reduces the cost of borrowing. Thus,\nthe system generates an impulse among the people to save more.\n\nA well-functioning financial system helps in promoting the process of financial deepening and broad-\nening. Financial deepening refers to an increase of financial assets as a percentage of the Gross Domestic\nProduct (GDP). Financial depth is an important measure of financial system development as it measures\nthe size of the financial intermediary sector. Depth equals the liquid liabilities of the financial system\n(currency plus demand and interest-bearing liabilities of banks and non-bank financial intermediaries\ndivided by the GDP). Financial broadening refers to building an increasing number and variety of par-\nticipants and instruments.\n",

Hence, a strong legal system is the\nmost fundamental element of a sound financial system.\n\nStable money is an important constituent as it serves as a medium of exchange, a store of value\n(a reserve of future purchasing power), and a standard of value (unit of account) for all the goods and\nservices we might wish to trade in. Large fluctuations and depreciation in the value of money lead to\nfinancial crises and impede the growth of the economy.\n\nSound public finance includes setting and controlling public expenditure priorities and raising rev-\nenues adequate to fund them efficiently. Historically, these financing needs of the governments world over\nled to the creation of financial systems. Developed countries have sound public finances and public debt\nmanagement practices, which result in the development of a good financial system.\n\nA central bank supervises and regulates the operations of the banking system. It acts as a banker to\nthe banks, banker to the government, manager of public debt and foreign exchange, and lender of the last\nresort. The monetary policy of the central bank influences the pace of economic growth. An autonomous\ncentral bank paves the way for the development of a sound financial system.\n\nA good financial system must also have a variety of banks both with domestic and international opera-\ntions together with an ability to withstand adverse shocks without failing. Banks are the core financial\nintermediaries in all countries. They perform diverse key functions such as operating the clearing and\npayments system, and the foreign exchange market. The banking system is the main fulcrum for transmit-\nting the monetary policy actions. Banks also undertake credit risk analysis, assessing the expected risk\nand return on the projects. The financial soundness of the banking system depends on how effectively\nbanks perform these diverse functions.\n\nAnother foundational element is information. All the participants in a financial system require infor-\nmation. A sound financial system can develop only when proper disclosure practices and networking of\ninformation systems are adopted.\n\nSecurities markets facilitate the issue and trading of securities, both equity and debt. Efficient securi-\nties markets promote economic growth by mobilizing and deploying funds into productive uses, lowering\nthe cost of capital for firms, enhancing liquidity, and attracting foreign investment. An efficient securities\nmarket strengthens market discipline by exerting corporate control through the threat of hostile takeovers\nfor underperforming firms.\n",

Different designs of financial systems are found in different\ncountries. The structure of the economy, its pattern of evolution, and political, technical, and cultural dif-\nferences affect the design (type) of financial system.\n\n\u2018Two prominent polar designs can be identified among the variety that exists. At one extreme is the\nbank-dominated system, such as in Germany, where a few large banks play a dominant role and the\nstock market is not important. At the other extreme is the market-dominated financial system, as in\nthe US, where financial markets play an important role while the banking industry is much less concen-\ntrated. The other major industrial countries fall in between these two extremes (Figure 1.2).\n\nDemirguc Kunt and Levine (1999) have provided explanations of bank-based and market-based\nfinancial systems. In bank-based financial systems, banks play a pivotal role in mobilizing savings,\nallocating capital, overseeing the investment decisions of corporate managers, and providing risk-\nmanagement facilities. In market-based financial systems, the securities markets share centre stage\nwith banks in mobilizing the society\u2019s savings for firms, exerting corporate control, and easing risk\nmanagement.\n\nBank-based systems tend to be stronger in countries where governments have a direct hand in indus-\ntrial development. In India, banks have traditionally been the dominant entities of financial intermedia-\ntion. The nationalization of banks, an administered interest rate regime, and the government policy of\nfavouring banks led to the predominance of a bank-based financial system.\n\nDemirguc Kunt and Levine, using a database of 150 countries, have classified countries according to\nthe structure and level of financial development (Table 1.1).\n\nTheir comparison of financial systems across different income groups reveals several patterns. First,\nfinancial systems are, on an average, more developed in rich countries. There is a tendency for a finan-\ncial system to become more market-oriented as the country becomes richer. Second, countries with a\ncommon-law tradition, strong protection of shareholders\u2019 rights, and low levels of corruption tend to be\nmore market-based and have well-developed financial systems.\n\nArnold and Walz (2000) have attempted to identify factors leading to the emergence of bank-based or\nmarket-based financial systems. When problems relating to information persist but banks are competent\n\n\nTABLE Classification of Financial Structure and Level of Development of Select Economies\n\nExtent of Development Bank-based Market-based\nDeveloped Japan, Germany, France, Italy US, UK, Singapore, Malaysia, Korea\nUnder-developed Argentina, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh Brazil, Mexico, the Philippines, Turkey\n\nand Mar)\n\nSource: Demirguc Kunt, A. and R.

Conversely, if banks are initially incompetent and\nfail to improve themselves by experience, the bank-based system gives way to the growth of a market-\nbased financial system.\n\nGiven these two types of financial systems, questions arise about the advantages and disadvantages\nof a bank-based financial system vis-a-vis a market-based financial system. Some researchers sug-\ngest that markets are more effective at providing financial services while some tout the advantages of\nintermediaries.\n\nProponents of the market-based view argue that efficiency is associated with the functioning of\ncompetitive markets. Financial markets are attractive as they provide the best terms to both inves-\ntors and borrowers. Stock markets facilitate diversification and allow efficient risk-sharing. They\nprovide incentives to gather information that is reflected in stock prices and these prices, in turn,\nprovide signals for an efficient allocation of investment. An important area in which financial mar-\nkets perform differently from financial intermediaries is in situations where a diversity of opinion is\nimportant, such as the financing of new technologies or when an unusual decision has to be made.\nHence, in emerging industries with significant financial and technological risks, a market-based\nsystem may be preferable.\n\nThe drawbacks of the market-based system are that it is more prone to instability, its investors are\nexposed to market risks, and that there is a free-rider problem. The last drawback arises when no indi-\nvidual is willing to contribute towards the cost of something but hopes that someone else will bear the\ncost. This problem arises whenever there is a public good and separation of ownership from control. For\nexample, shareholders take little interest in the management of their companies, hoping someone else will\nmonitor the executives. In a market-based system, the free-rider problem blunts the incentives to gather\ninformation.\n\nOn the other hand, a bank-based system is perceived to be more stable, as the relationship with parties\nis relatively close. This leads to the formation of tailor-made contracts and financial products and efficient\ninter-temporal risk-sharing. Financial intermediaries can eliminate the risks that cannot be diversified at a\ngiven point of time but can be averaged over time through inter-temporal smoothing of asset returns. This\nrequires that investors accept lower returns than what the market offers in some periods in order to get\nhigher returns in other periods. This provides an insurance to investors who would otherwise be forced to\nliquidate assets at disadvantageous prices.\n\nThe banking system avoids some of the information deficiencies associated with the securi-\nties markets. The free-rider problem is eliminated as private incentives to gather information are\nhigher in the case of a bank-based system. Moreover, banks can perform screening and monitoring\nfunctions on behalf of the investors; these functions, left to themselves, can be undertaken only at a\nhigh cost.\n\nThe greatest drawback of a bank-based system is that it retards innovation and growth as banks have\nan inherent preference for low-risk, low-return projects. Moreover, powerful banks may collude with firm\nmanagers against other investors, which, in some cases, could impede competition, effective corporate\ncontrol, and entry of new firms.\n\nThe current trend is a preference for the market-based system. France and Japan have reformed their\nmarkets to make them more competitive. It is partly due to the growing volume of banking activity in\nthe financial markets. The European Union is moving towards a single unified market to increase its\nglobal competitiveness. In India also, the role of stock markets has gained prominence. The govern-\nment has put in substantial efforts to reform the financial markets. The Indian equity market, now, is at\npar with some of the developed markets of the world. Moreover, the ratio of market capitalization to\n\nassets of scheduled commercial banks has risen sharply from 28.4 per cent in March 1991 to 79.3 per\ncent in March 2000. The relative share of banks in the aggregate financial assets of banks and financial\ninstitutions taken together, which stood at nearly three-fourths in the early 1980s, is now hovering\naround the two-thirds mark since the 1990s. This implies that there is considerable potential for growth\nin market financing.\n\nAllen and Gale (2000) have put forward two explanations for the universal popularity of financial\nmarkets: (i) government intervention is regarded as a negative factor and government failures are as\nimportant a problem as market failures, (ii) economic theory, pertaining to firms, stresses the effective-\nness of markets in allocating resources.\n\nEmpiral analysis in various researches do not emphatically suggest the superiority of one system over\nthe other. Whatever be the type of financial system, both financial intermediaries and financial markets\nplay a crucial role in the development of a sound financial system. Both systems can coexist as they\nencourage competition, reduce transaction costs, and improve resource allocation within the economy,\nleading to the development of a balanced financial system.\n",

If finance were to be described as the circulatory system of the economy, financial\ninstitutions are its brain, They make decisions that tell scarce capital where to go and ensure that it is used\nmost efficiently. It has been confirmed by research that countries with developed financial institutions\ngrow faster and countries with weak ones are more likely to undergo financial crises.\n\nLenders and borrowers differ in regard to terms of risk, return, and terms of maturity. Financial institu-\ntions assist in resolving this conflict between lenders and borrowers by offering claims against themselves\nand, in turn, acquiring claims on the borrowers. The former claims are referred to as indirect (secondary)\nsecurities and the latter as direct (primary) securities.\n\nFinancial institutions provide three transformation services:\n\n+ Liability, asset, and size transformation consisting of mobilization of funds, and their allocation by\n\n1g large loans on the basis of numerous small deposits.\n\n+ Maturity transformation by offering the savers tailor-made short-term claims or liquid deposits and\nso offering borrowers long-term loans matching the cash-flows generated by their investment.\n\n+ Risk transformation by transforming and reducing the risk involved in direct lending by acquiring\ndiversified portfolios.\n\nThrough these services, financial institutions are able to tap savings that are unlikely to be acceptable\notherwise. Moreover, by facilitating the availability of finance, financial institutions enable the consumer\nto spend in anticipation of income and the entrepreneur to acquire physical capital.\n\nThe role of financial institutions has undergone a tremendous transformation in the 1990s. Besides\nproviding direct loans, many financial institutions have diversified themselves into areas of financial ser-\nvices such as merchant banking, underwriting and issuing guarantees.\n",

The surplus savings that they have is held in the form\nof cash balances or financial assets. The acquisition of financial assets or making of loans\nis, in fact, lending for productive investment. Such lending by the surplus-spending sector\ncan be termed as demanding financial assets or supplying loanable funds. In India, the\nhousehold sector is a net-surplus spending economic unit. The household and other sectors\nare discussed in detail in the flow of funds analysis.\n\nDeficit-spending Economic Units These are units whose consumption and planned\ninvestment exceeds income. The deficit-spending economic units have negative savings; they\nfinance their needs by borrowing or by decreasing their stock of financial assets. Borrowing\nby deficit-spending units creates a supply of financial securities or demand for loanable\nfunds. In India, the government and the corporate sector are deficit-spending economic units.\n\nThe surplus savings of the surplus-spending household units have to be transferred to\nthe deficit-spending economic units. A link in the form of a financial system is necessary to\ntransfer surplus savings to deficit units. The surplus and deficit units can be brought together\neither directly through external financing or indirectly through intermediation (banks and\nother financial institutions).\n\nFigure 2.1 illustrates how surplus-spending economic units lend funds to financial\nintermediaries and financial markets\u2014two important components of the financial system.\nFinancial intermediaries issue secondary securities like deposits, insurance policies, and units\nto the ultimate lenders. The ultimate borrowers may acquire funds either by issuing primary\nsecurities to financial intermediaries or by issuing primary securities in the financial markets.\nThis transfer of funds from the surplus-spending sector to the deficit-spending sector through\nthe financial system leads to capital formation and economic growth. Economic growth, in\nsimple terms, is the increase in the real national product or output over time.\n\nBesides linking savings and investment, the financial system helps in accelerating the rate\nof savings and investment by offering diversified financial services and instruments. This pro-\nmotes a larger production of goods and services in the economy, leading to economic growth.\n\nSecondary Securities Primary Securities\n\nFinancial Intermediaries (+/-)\n(Banks and Financial Institutions)\n\nand\n\nFinancial Markets |\u00ab Primary Securities\n\n!\n\nt\nUttimate Lenders (+) {Financial System |\u2014_\u2014\u2014\u2014-[ Ultimate Borrowers (-)\ni J i\n\nPrimary Securities. \u00ab\u2014\n\nSurplus-spending Economic| | Capital Formation Deficit-spending\nUnits \u00a5 > (C +1) Economic Units Y < (C+!)\n+ Householder Sector * Government\n\u2018* Rest of the World * Corporates\nEconomic Growth\nNote: + (Surplus) Where: Y = Income\n~ (Deficit) C = Consumption\n\n| = Planned Investment\n\nFigure 2.1 Financial System and Economic Growth\n",

The main tools of analysis are as follows.\n\nNational Income Accounts National income accounts extend the accounting concept to the economy\nas a whole. National income accounts of the sector-of-origin reveal the contribution made by different\nsectors of the economy to the national income and the portion of the national income they consume.\n\nFlow of Funds Accounts The savings and investment process creates a flow of funds among sectors.\nMoreover, many transactions in the economy that are not included in the national income accounts\ntake place as well. Hence, an analysis of the flow of funds accounts becomes necessary. Flow of funds\nbrings out patterns of financing economic activities and the financial relations among various sectors\nof the economy. The national income accounts are combined with the flow of funds accounts to form\na framework for describing the transfer of funds and supply and demand in the securities market. This\nframework helps to grasp the saving-investment process in the economy, essential for comprehending the\nworking of the financial system.\n\nTrends in Saving and Investment One of the basic influences of financial development on growth\nis the saving and investment rate. Among the many roles of the financial system is the augmenting and\nchannelizing of savings into productive avenues for economic growth.

The GDP is a broad measure of the output\nof goods and services in an economy. It is not merely a sum total of the value of all of the output but a\nsum total of \u2018value-added\u2019 of output. There are two ways in which the GDP can be measured. It can be\nmeasured at the production stage or as the sum total of consumption. Both the methods should yield the\nsame result. When measured from the production side, the GDP is broadly divided with three sectors:\nagriculture, industry and services. In measuring output from the consumption side, the GDP is equal to\nthe sum of private consumption, government consumption, investment and net exports.\n\nGDP, as a statistical indicator, is used to describe and quantify the process of value addition in the\neconomy.

This is important because as an\neconomy develops, growth in value added comes from improvements in the per unit value addition rather\nthan in growth of volume.\n\nAs per international practices, industry-wise estimates are now presented as Gross Value Added (GVA)\nat basic prices instead of factor cost, while \u2018GDP at market prices\u2019 is referred to as GDP.\n\nThe Net National Product (NNP) is the net production of goods and services in a country during the\nyear. It is simply the GNP adjusted for depreciation charges. The NNP gives an idea of the net increase\nin the total production of the country. It is helpful in the analysis of the long-run problem of maintaining\nand increasing the supply of physical capital in the country.\n\nThe growth rate of the GDP in the 1990s at 6.9 per cent was distinctly higher than that of the 1980s.\nThe industrial and service sectors experienced high growth rates in the 1990s while agriculture regis-\ntered a low growth rate in comparison with the 1980s. This reflects a major structural shift in the Indian\neconomy in the 1990s wherein economic growth has become less vulnerable to agricultural performance\nand to the vagaries of the monsoon.\n\nThere was a marked difference in the sectoral composition of growth within the industrial sector. The\nmajor impetus to growth came from manufacturing while the services sector experienced a higher growth\nin sectors such as trade, hotels, restaurants, financing/insurance, real estate and business services. This\nindicates an increase in finance-related activities and financial intermediation.\n\nIndia recorded one of the highest growth rates in the world: 9.6 per cent in 2006-07, second only to\nChina among the emerging market economies. A rebound in agriculture, increased investment and output\nin the manufacturing sector, a turnaround in electricity generation, buoyant software exports, and growth\nin new economy services such as trade, hotels, transport and communication contributed to this increase\nin the GDP. Competition, fall in interest rates, better infrastructure facilities and a growth in exports led\nto a manufacturing boom and made manufacturing grow faster than services.\n\nInvestment led growth in the manufacturing and services sectors, coupled with comfortable foreign\nexchange reserves and a robust increase in exports continued till 2007. The pace of GDP growth rate\nslowed down in 2008 on account of the decelerating growth in the industrial sector, international price\nincreases in oil and commodity prices, increasing inflation, increasing cost of funds, moderating capital\ninflows, depreciation in the rupee against the dollar and the impact of global financial crisis. After sharp\nrecovery from the global financial crisis, the GDP growth rate accelerated to 8.4 per cent in 2009-10. But\nthis growth rate slowed down to 6.5 per cent\u2014a nine year low\u2014during 2011-12.\n\nThe new series (with 2011-12 as the base year) reveals that there was noticeable improvement in some\nof the macro-aggregates of the economy in 2013-14, which got further strengthened in 2014-15. Agricul-\nture sector supported growth rate in GDP in 2013-14 and accounted for 16.1 and 15.4 per cent of GVA\nduring 2014-15 and 2015-16, respectively. The decline in agriculture growth rate was due to delayed\nmonsoon. The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) picked up in 2014-15, reversing the stagnating trend\nof the last two years while the services sector remained the major driver of economic growth contributing\n72.4 percent of the GDP in 2014~15. The manufacturing sector grew by 2 per cent during 2015-16 aided\nby robust growth in petroleum refining, automobiles, wearing apparels, chemicals, electrical machinery\nand wood products and furniture. The growth in GVA in the services sector slowed down to 8.2 per cent\nduring the year (9.4 per cent in 2014\u201415). The services sector accounted for 61.87 per cent of the GVA for\n2015-16, We can aim at achieving a higher GDP growth rate by enhancing growth in all the three sectors.\n\nThe national income accounts present macro-economic data such as GDP, GNP, NNP, savings, and\ninvestment. With the help of this data, surplus and deficit sectors can be identified but it does not provide\ninformation on issues such as inter-sectoral fund flows, linkages and instruments. For this the national\nincome accounts have to be used in combination with the flow of funds accounts in order to have an\nunderstanding of the financial inter-relationship among various sectors of the economy.\n\n",

The flow of funds accounts reflect the diversified savings and investment flows from the\nbroad sectors of an economy through various credit and capital market instruments. In other words, the\naccounts bring out the pattern of financing economic activities and the financial inter-relationship among\nvarious sectors of the economy.\n\nThe flow of funds accounts are essential for any comprehensive analysis of financial market behav-\niour. They help identify the role of finance in the generation of income, savings, and expenditure. They\nalso help identify the influence of economic activities on financial markets. A temporal and cross-section\ncomparison of these accounts provides an insight into the changing pattern and degree of development\nin the process of intermediation. The channel through which savings find a way into the investment sec-\ntors is highlighted through these accounts. The volume of financial flows with respect to the index of\neconomic activities, say the GNP, the NNP, or capital formation, provides a reliable indicator of the grow-\ning use of financial instruments. The flow of funds accounts are also employed as an important tool for\nfinancial planning and forecasting. By utilizing historical flow of funds, emerging trends in the economy\nand changes in financial patterns can be tracked. This, in turn, can help in forecasting the flow of funds\nfor the economy for a coming period of time. In short, they are very useful in understanding the financial\ninstitution structure, assets structure, financial inter-relationships, and the nature of financial development\nin the country.\n\nThe flow of funds accounts disclose the level, depth, and nature of financial activities in the economy.\nThey are organised along two dimensions\u2014economic sectors and financial instruments\u2014to provide sector\nwise and instrument-wise financial flows. The FoF accounts are now prepared by the RBI by correspond-\ning it to the new series of national accounts as well as in its \u2018Sequence of Accounts\u2019 by the Central Statistics\nOffice (CSO). The FoF accounts divide the economy into five institutional sectors, namely (i) the financial\ncorporations sector, which includes the Central Bank (CB), Other Depository Corporations (ODCs)-com-\nmercial banks, co-operative banks, Deposit-taking Non-banking Financial Companies (NBFCs-D) and\nDeposit-taking Housing Finance Companies (HFCs-D)\u2014and Other Financial Corporations (OFCs) that\nmainly comprise all-India financial institutions, Non-Deposit taking Non-banking Financial Companies\n(NBFCs-ND), Non-Deposit taking Housing Finance Companies (HFCs-ND), insurance corporations,\nprovident funds and pension funds and mutual funds; (ii) non-financial corporations, including both public\nincluding central public sector non-departmental non-financial enterprises, state power utilities and port\ntrusts and privatenon-financial corporations including both public and private limited non-financial com-\npanies; (iii) General Government (GG) that comprises the central government and the state governments;\n(iv) the House Hold (HH) sector; and (v) Rest of the World (RoW).\n\nThese sectors participate in the financial activities through borrowing (issuing claims on themselves)\nand lending (accepting claims on others). If the borrowing exceeds the lending, the sector is termed as a\ndeficit sector; in the reverse case, it is a surplus sector.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are classified under ten major categories of financial instruments. Finan-\ncial instruments across sources and uses of funds of the various institutional sectors include currency and\ndeposits, debt securities, loans and borrowings, equity, investment funds (such as mutual funds), insur-\nance, pension and provident funds, monetary gold, other accounts (including trade debt) and other liabili-\nties/assets Not Elsewhere Classified (NEC). The instrument-wise analysis of financial flows reveals the\naggregate preference pattern of various sectors for different financial instruments.\n\nFinancial claims are divided into two categories: (i) primary issues or securities signifying all forms\nof debt, marketable or otherwise, issued by the ultimate borrowers; and (ii) secondary issues or indirect\nsecurities reflecting debt and claims issued by financial intermediaries in order to acquire and hold pri-\nmary securities. The total flow of finance in the economy is represented by the total financial issues, which\nis the aggregation of funds raised by primary and secondary issues.\n\nThis system is designed as a matrix. The matrix is prepared by examining the balance sheets of the\nvarious sectors at the beginning and at the end of a period. The net increase in assets is treated as uses\nof funds and increase in liabilities as sources of funds. Tables 2.2 and 2.3 show changes or flow of funds\nbetween two points of time. They include only the inter-sectoral flows and not the intra-sectoral flow of\nfunds. In other words, the flow of funds accounts present a net flow of funds between sectors and between\ntwo points of time.\n\nTable 2.2 exhibits financial flows by different sectors. The RBI publishes this data and it is available\nupto 2014-15.\n\nThe overall financial resource balance in the eeonomy\u2014measured by the net acquisition of financial\nassets less net increase in liabilities\u2014as a proportion to Net National Income (NNI) at current market\n\n\nTABLE 2.2 _ Sectoral Financial Resource Balance\n\n(% of NNI at current market prices)\n2011-12 2012-13 2013-14 2014-15\n1 None-Financial Corporations 9.0 7.6 6.6 5.2\n1.a Public Non-Financial 0.6 0.9 1.9 11\nCorporations\n1.b Private Non-Financial 84 6.7 48 44\nCorporation\n2.

This improvement was primarily driven by a reduction in net borrowings\nof non-financial corporations, which benefited from saving on input costs due to decline in commodity\nprices, and general government reflecting the ongoing fiscal consolidation at the central government\nlevel. Net lending by financial corporations declined mainly on account of the slowdown in bank credit\non asset quality concerns in an environment of subdued investment activity. Deposits constitute the larg-\nest source of funds for the banks and they were mobilised primarily from the household sector which\nremained the largest supplier of finance to the economy. The RoW sector has played an important role\nin flow of funds since 1993-94. There was a significant capital flow through the direct as well as port-\nfolio between 2003-04 to 2007-08. There was a substantial financial flow in India from the RoW sector\nduring 2014-15 and 2015-16 on account of easing of foreign direct investment and allowing portfolio\ninvestors to invest coupons from government securities outside the residual maturity limit of three years\nset in July 2014 (which was subsequently extended to corporate bonds). In the case of private non-finan-\ncial corporations, their major source of finance was RoW sector, insurance companies and non-banking\nfinancial companies.\n\nIn terms of financial flows by instruments, as usual, currency and deposits were the preferred finan-\ncial instruments. The share of loans and borrowings declined steadily over 2011 to 2014-15 on account\nof decline in credit by banks and financial institutions to private corporate sector. Deposits and loans and\nborrowings accounted for more than 60 per cent of total liabilities issued during 2011-12 to 2014-15.\nWhile the share of \u2018equity and investment fund shares\u2019 and \u2018insurance, pension and provident funds\u2019\nincreased to 17 per cent and 6.1 per cent, respectively in 2014-15.\n\nThe total sources of funds or the total issues can be segregated into primary issues (i.e., funds which\ndirectly flow from surplus to deficit sectors) and secondary issues (.e., funds which flow through financial\nintermediaries, such as banks and other financial instruments). Table 2.4 reveals a rise in the total issues\nfrom %46,384 bn. in 2011-12 to %58,255 bn. in 2014-15. There was a steady increase in both the primary\nand secondary issues.\n\n",

The financial development of a country is studied by examining changes in\nthe following ratios which were constructed by Goldsmith (1969):\n\nFinance Ratio (FR) It depicts the process of financial deepening in the economy. It is an indicator of\nthe rate of financial development in relation to economic growth. It is a ratio of the total issues consisting\nprimary and secondary claims in relation to the national income.\n\nTotal financial claims Total issues\n\nFR - >\nNet income Net national product at factor cost\n\nFinancial Inter-relation Ratio (FIR) It reflects the proportion of financial issues with respect to net\ncapital formation in the economy. It reflects the relationship between the financial structure and the real-\nasset structure of the economy. In other words, the relationship between financial development and capital\nformation is best captured by this ratio.\n\nFinancial assets Total issues\nPhysical assets Net domestic capital formation\n\nFIR =\n\nNew Issue Ratio (NIR) _ It is the ratio of primary issues to net domestic capital formation. It measures the\nproportion of primary claims issued by non-financial institutions to net capital formation. In other words,\nNIR indicates how far direct issues to the savers have financed the investment by the investing sectors.\n\nPrimary issues Primary issues\n\nNIR = =\nNet physical investments Net domestic capital formation\n\nIntermediation Ratio (IR) It is the ratio of secondary issues to primary issues and indicates the\nimportance of financial intermediaries in channelizing financial resources.

The FR increased from 0.401 in\n1990-91 to 0.53 in 2014-15 indicating a deepening of the financial markets leading to a marked rise in\nthe institutionalization of financing investment. It also reflects separation between the acts of saving and\ninvestment.\n\nThe FIR significantly increased in the 1990s, the range being 1.75 to 2.87. This indicates that the\nfinancial structure in India grew more rapidly than the national income and there was a higher level of\nparticipation of the financial system in capital formation.

Economic objec-\ntives like price stability, maintaining high levels of income and employment, and high rates of economic\ngrowth have a close relationship with the concepts of saving and investment.\n\nSaving is income minus expenditure. In other words, saving is the income that exceeds consumption.\nInvestment involves the sacrifice of current consumption and the production of investment goods which\nare used to produce commodities. It includes the accumulation of inventories. Investment refers to invest-\nment in real assets and includes investment in expenditure for plant and equipment, residential and other\nconstruction, and additions to inventories. In other words, investment is capital formation, one of the most\nimportant factors that determines the rate of economic growth of a country. Capital formation is the net\ninvestment in fixed assets. In the national accounts, investment is the sum of Gross Fixed Capital Forma-\ntion and the physical change in stocks and work in progress. Gross Fixed Capital Formation includes\ndepreciation while Net Capital Formation excludes it.\n\nBoth saving and investment are flow concepts and refer to the addition of the stock of capital (wealth)\nthat occurs over a period of time. The stock concept \u2018savings\u2019 refers to the holding of wealth in some form,\nusually financial claims. Savings refers to financial capital at a point of time and saving refers to addition\nto the capital over a period of time.\n\nMany changes in the economy issues such as fluctuation in supply of money, creation of new capital,\nsurplus/deficit of the government sector, and introduction of new types of claims determine the supply\nand demand for securities. These changes are essential to the study of financial markets. To understand\nthese changes, one needs to look at the flow concept of saving and investment.\n",

Moreover, the resources going into the productive process, i.e.,\ncapital formation, may have a direct relationship with economic growth. In other words, growth in economic\nactivity may result either from widening the application of capital (capital widening) or intensifying its\nuuser\u2014utilizing more capital per unit of labour and output (capital deepening). Lastly, all economic activi-\nties\u2014agricultural, industrial, or services\u2014depend on the availability of financial resources. These resources\nneeded for economic growth must be generated. The amount of financial resources and the volume of capi-\ntal formation depend upon the intensity and efficiency with which savings are encouraged, gathered, and\ndirected towards investment. An institutional mechanism\u2014the financial system\u2014performs this role to aid\neconomic growth. As more saving moves through the financial system, financial depth increases.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Saving and Investment in India\n\nEstimates of savings are prepared by the CSO. The organization defines saving as the excess of current\nincome over current expenditure. It is the balancing item on the income and outlay accounts of producing\nenterprises and households, government administration, and other final consumers.\n\nFor the purpose of estimating the domestic saving, the economy has been divided into three broad\ninstitutional sectors: (i) household, (ii) private corporate, and (iii) public.\n\nThe household sector comprises heterogenous entities such as individuals, unincorporated business\nenterprises (sole proprietorships and partnership concerns), farm production units, and a number of non-\nprofit institutions. Household saving equals income of households not allocated to current expenditure.\n\nThe saving of the household sector is measured as the total of financial saving and saving in the form\nof physical assets. Financial saving involves possession of currency, net deposits, investment in shares\nand debentures, net claims on government in the form of central and state government securities and\nsmall savings, net increase in the claims of life insurance, and provident funds. Physical assets include\nconstruction machinery and equipment and stocks held by individuals, firms, and other institutions con-\nstituting the household sector.\n\nThe private corporate sector comprises non-government, non-financial companies, private financial\ninstitutions, and co-operative institutions. The saving of the private corporate sector is the excess of its\nrevenues over expenditure.\n\nThe public sector comprises the government, administrative departments, and enterprises both depart-\nmental and non-departmental. The saving of the government administration is defined as the excess of\ncurrent receipts over current expenditure.\n\nThe term investment refers to domestic capital formation. Investment in an economy equals the savings\navailable to it. Its size in any country depends on the domestic saving and capital inflow. There are two\nbroad categories of investments: private and public. Public investment includes government's investment\nin infrastructure, health, and education. Private investment refers to investment in plant, machinery, and\nbuildings by firms, and households.\n\nThe trend in saving and investment rates reveals the following features:\n\n* The Gross Domestic Savings (GDS) rose as a proportion of the GDP from 16.6 per cent in the 1970s\nto 23.9 per cent in the 1990s (Table 2.5). In the same period, there was a simultaneous increase in the\nrates of financial savings of the household sector and the private corporate sector. The saving rate\nimproved in 2002-03 due to reduced public sector dissavings. The savings rate was still below the\npeak of 25.1 per cent achieved in 1995-96. The savings rate in the economy touched an all-time high of\n37.7 per cent of the GDP in 2007-08 (Table 2.6). Since 2008-09 there has been a decline in the\n\naverage saving rate. The rate of gross savings to gross national disposable income for 2014-15 stood\nat 32.3 per cent, the same level as in 2013-14. The rate of gross saving to GDP stood at 33.0 per cent\nfor 2014-15, the same level as in 2013-14.\n\nIn India, the bulk of the saving is sourced from the household sector (Table 2.7).\n\nFinancial saving started assuming importance as a result of financial deepening following bank\nnationalization in 1969. The GDS rate fell during the first half of the 1980s due to an increase in\nhousehold expenditure on consumer goods. During the 1990s, household sector saving and house-\nhold financial saving emerged as the single greatest contributor to the GDS.\n\nThe household sector accounts for over three-quarters of the total savings in India (Table 2.9). The\nincrease in the share of financial saving of the household sector, which has been surpassing physi-\ncal saving on a sustained basis, is indicative of increased financial intermediation, widening, and\ndeepening of the financial system, as well as the movement of relative rates of return on assets of\nthe household sector portfolio.\n\nThe household net financial saving rate increased to 7.7 per cent of Gross National Disposable\nIncome (GNDI) in 2015-16 from 7.5 per cent in 2014-15 and 7.4 per cent in 2013-14. The improve-\nment reflected a higher rate of increase in gross financial assets in relation to that in financial liabili-\nties. The increase in gross financial assets was driven primarily by a turnaround in small savings and\nincreases in investment in equities and mutual funds, tax-free bonds by public sector units and cur-\nrency holdings even as the growth in bank deposits held by the households slowed down. Financial\nliabilities also increased reflecting higher borrowings from banks and housing finance companies\nby the households during the year. (Table 2.10)\n\nThe greater preference of the household sector for financial assets as against physical assets could\nbe attributed to factors like removal of wealth tax on various forms of financial assets in the Union\nBudget 1992-93, growing financial intermediation and preference of households for less risky\nassets such as bank deposits, contractual savings, and small saving instruments. However, since\n2000-01, the investment in physical assets has been in the form of gold and real estate. The declin-\ning interest rates coupled with lackluster capital markets has led to a spur in physical assets like\nhousing, gold, and real estate.\n\n+ The government has been pre-empting an increasing proportion of the household sector's savings\nthrough the insurance and provident fund system, minimum investment recourse to banks under the\nStatutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR), and recourse to Reserve Bank through deficit financing.\n\n+ The saving rates of the private corporate sector exceeded that of the public sector in the 1990s. The pri-\nvate corporate sector\u2019s saving rate increased from 1 per cent in the 1950s to 1.7 per cent in 1980s and\n3.8 per cent in 1990s. The investment rate of the private corporate sector surpassed that of the public\nsector in 1995-96, This improved investment rate in the 1990s could be attributed to the liberalization\nmeasures introduced in the economy and the consequent impetus given to the private sector in the suc-\ncessive budgets in the 1990s. The saving rate of the private corporate sector, however, declined in the\nyear 2001-02 but improved marginally in 2003-04 and 2004-05. The gradual reduction in corporate\ntax rates and debt servicing costs more than doubled the private corporate saving rate from 3.4 per cent\nin 2001-02 to 8.8 per cent in 2007-08 and to 12.3 percent in 2014-15 (Table 2.6).\n\n+ The public sector saving rate declined tremendously in the 1990s. In the last two years of the\ndecade, it turned negative and touched \u20142.5 per cent in 2001-02 on account of increasing dissav-\ning by government administration. This negative public savings is a major constraint on domes-\ntic resource mobilization and has lowered the aggregate domestic saving. This dissaving reduced\nmarginally to -1.1 per cent in 2002-03 and further to -0.3 per cent in 2003-04. Savings of the\npublic sector touched 2.2 per cent of the GDP in 2004-05, the highest level since the late eight-\nies. The fast recovery from negative savings of 2 per cent of the GDP in 2001-02 was on account\nof the steady improvement in savings of the non-departmental enterprises\u2014other public sector\ncompanies\u2014from 1.5 per cent to 4.1 per cent of the GDP during 2003-04 to 2006-07. However,\nthe savings of the department enterprises-mainly railways and telecom remained largely stagnant\nat 0.5 per cent of the GDP during this period. The saving rate of the overall public sector was 4.5\nper cent in 2007-08 (Table 2.6). Howver, there was a reduction in the average public sector savings\nsince 2008-09 on account of decline in the contribution of non-departmental enterprises and fiscal\nstimulus measures.\n\n* Gross Domestic Capital Formation (investment) reached a peak of 26.9 per cent of the GDP in 1995\u2014\n96, but fell to 24 per cent in 2000-01. The fall in 2000-01 was due to a deterioration in the public sector\nsavings rate. The private corporate sector investment decelerated to 7 per cent in 2000-01 from a high\nof 9.4 per cent in 1995-96, but improved in the years 2001-02 and 2002-03 on account of increased\n\nprofits. The private sector investments exceeded the public sector investments during 2003-04 and\n2004-05. The investment was higher in fixed assets\u2014machinery and investments. Capital formation in\nthe public sector fell in the 1990s but rose to 6.9 per cent in 1999-2000. The rise was due to a buffer\nfood stock and was not related with investment in fixed assets. The gross domestic capital formation\nrate reached a peak of 32.9 per cent in 2007-08 due to improvements in both public and private cor-\nporate investments. However this rate started declining since 2008-09. The rate of decline in invest-\nments was more than savings. An upward trend was noticed in gross capital formation from 2011-12\non account of an increase in capital inflows from the RoW. The gross domestic capital formation\n\nremained subdued in 20015-16 but a possible turnaround in the capital expenditure (investments)\nis expected.\n\n* Gross Domestic Capital Formation rates remained higher than the Gross Domestic Saving till\n2000-01. This resulted in a saving-investment gap. This gap in the public sector represents a fis-\ncal deficit. The rise in the fiscal deficit was more than the rise in private savings, creating a gap\nwhich was filled in by bringing in foreign savings. Foreign savings can be explained better if we\nunderstand two measures, external current account deficit and external capital account surplus. A\ncurrent account deficit means that the country\u2019s exports are not sufficient to fully pay for its imports.\nThis results in a gap which can be covered by sale of assets, equity or debt securities to foreigners.\nCapital account surplus is a result of large inflows of foreign savings in the form of foreign invest-\nment and remittances. Thus, current account deficit equals capital account surplus.\n\nDomestic saving has traditionally financed over 90 per cent of investment in India. The recourse to external\nsaving has averaged less than one per cent of the GDP since 1991-92. There was an increased flow of foreign\nfunds in the form of foreign capital and remittances. However, there was a deceleration of the investment\nrate in 2000-01 which reflected a failure of the investment demand to absorb the available resources. This\nled to a saving-investment surplus of 0.6 per cent of the GDP for the first time in 2001-02 after the period\n1975-78 (Table 2.6). This surplus was mirrored in the current account surplus of the balance of payments.\n\u2018The current account balance has turned negative since 2004-05 on account of a higher investment rate as\ncompared to savings rate.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Household Sector Financial Saving\n\nThe household sector saves in the form of currency, bank deposits, non-banking deposits, life insurance\nfunds, provident and pension fund claims on government, shares and debentures including units of the\nUnit Trust of India.\n\nFor economic growth, it is necessary that saving is held in financial assets such as deposits, shares and\ndebentures, and in the form of contractual savings rather than in currency. If savings are held in the form\nof currency, it is probable that they might be invested in unproductive assets like gold. Hence, an analysis\nof the composition of household sector savings was undertaken.\n\nThis analysis indicated that households held a large portion of their savings in the form of deposits\n(both banking and non-banking). Rapid expansion of the commercial banking sector was one of the\nimportant factors in mobilizing savings.\n\nContractual savings or savings under provident fund schemes, pension and life insurance funds were\nthe next preferred form of savings by households. Funds raised from contractual savings are employed\nfor long-term investment. An increase in household sector savings in the years 1999-2000 and 2000-01\nwas due to an increase in long-term contractual savings. In India, there is a great need for infrastructure\nprojects and these projects can be financed through long-term contractual savings. Besides, contractual\nsaving also has the potential of reviving the capital market and acting as a social security.\n\nFinancial saving in the form of shares and debentures showed a marked increase from 0.8 per cent\nduring the period 1970-71 to 1973-74 to 3.9 per cent during the period 1993-94 to 1998-99, emerging\nas the third most popular financial asset (Table 2.9). This was due to reforms in the financial market\nundertaken by the government in July 1991 which led to a boom in new issues of shares and a rise in\nthe Sensex. Besides this, the depth, size, and liquidity of financial markets had a significant impact on\nthe household saving in financial assets. In 2005-06, financial saving in the form of shares and deben-\ntures declined to 0.1 per cent of the financial assets and further to -0.7 percent of the financial assets\nin 2011-12. Financial saving in the form of shares and debentures increased to 0.7 percent of GNDI\nin 2015-16 (Table 2.10).\n\n\u2018Small investors are the pillars of Indian capital markets. A large and active small investor base helps\nin price discovery and serves as a counterweight to large powerful investors such as foreign institutional\ninvestors (FIIs). Recurrent scams, price volatility, fraudulent company management, and poor corporate\ngovernance have contributed to the diminishing faith of the individual investor in the stock market. How-\never, the proportion of investment in shares and debentures has increased since 2011-12 on account of\nbuoyant stock markets and strong macro-economic fundamentals.\n\nHence, the household sector\u2019s saving is increasingly distributed between financial assets such as depos-\nits, insurance policies, and shares and debentures rather than in the form of currency. This is indicative of\nan increasing preference of the household sector for financial intermediaries and productive investment\nof the saving mobilized by financial intermediaries.\n\nHousehold Sector's Liabilities As shown in Table 2.10, a study of the household sector's liabilities\nshows that it borrows the majority of its funds from banks. In the years 1999-2000 and 2000-01,\nthe borrowings from banks increased by 40 per cent as compared to the year 1998-99. To compare\nfigures, the borrowings from banks increased sixfold from %43,354 crore in 2001-02 to %2,64,991\ncrore in 2011-12. This was due to a decline in interest rates. Taking advantage of this, the household\nsector purchased durables and real estate. The second preferred source of finance of the household\nsector is loans and advances from other financial institutions. Table 2.6 also reflects that the household\nis a net surplus sector in the sense that the excess of saving and investment exceeds its financial\nliabilities.\n\nIna nutshell, the household sector in India has emerged as the single most important contributor to the\nGDS. The performance of the private sector improved in terms of both saving and investment, but there\nwas a negative saving on the part of the government. The public sector was the largest deficit sector due\nto its large fiscal deficits and the government has had to resort to market borrowings on a large scale to\nfill up the gap.\n\nAn analysis of trends in savings and investment reveals that financial development and intermediation\nhave led to improvement in the saving rate of the country.\n",

The GDP\ngrowth rate further rose to 7.3 per cent between 2000-01 and 2007-08 which was distinctly high and a\nremarkable achievement. The GDS as a percentage of the GDP rose substantially in the 1990s at an average\nof 23.9 per cent of the GDP. It further improved to 33.8 per cent in 2009-10 but declined to 32.3 per cent\nin 2010-11 (Table 2.6). The household sector savings had been generally in favour of financial assets as\ncompared to physical assets.\n\nThe average investment (Gross Domestic Capital Formation) rate of 29.8 per cent of GDP was achieved\nin the tenth plan. The private corporate sector investment responded enthusiastically to the changes in the\neconomic policies.\n\nThis post-reforms performance was achieved in the middle of both domestic and international uncer-\ntainties such as the South-east Asian crisis, uncertainties of the economic prospects of Japan and the\neconomies of Europe, political uncertainty, economic sanctions imposed by several industrial countries\nfollowing India\u2019s nuclear test, suspension of fresh multilateral lending (except for some sectors), down-\ngrading by international rating agencies, and reduction in investment by Flls. India was in a position to\nwithstand all these uncertainties only with the help of domestic savings (Table 2.11). Again, domestic\nsavings helped Indian markets recover in the turbulent global crisis. The Columbia University economist\nRagnar Nurkse, in 1953, rightly said, \u2018capital is made at home.\u2019\n\nToday the Indian economy has positioned itself amongst the top two fastest growing economies in\nthe world. We are now aiming for 8 per cent GDP growth rate in the next five years and this can be\nachieved.\n\nIn the case of domestic savings, the public sector needs to generate positive savings. Foreign savings in the\nform of foreign direct investment (FDI) can be attracted only when macro-economic fundamentals are strong\nand there is a well-developed and sound financial system. The latter is a prerequisite for mobilizing higher\ndomestic and foreign savings and allocating them efficiently for economic growth.\n",

The growth of\nfinancial structure is a precondition to economic growth. In other words, markets, institutions, and instru-\nments are the prime movers of economic growth. The financial system of a country diverts its savings\ntowards more productive uses and so it helps to increase the output of the economy.\n\nBesides mobilizing savings, the financial system helps accelerate the volume and rate of savings by provid-\ning a diversified range of financial instruments and services through intermediaries. This results in an increased\ncompetition in the financial system which channelises resources towards the highest-return investment for a\ngiven degree of risk. This lowers financial intermediation costs and stimulates economic growth.\n\nA sophisticated financial system makes innovation least costly and most profitable, thereby enabling\nfaster economic growth. Countries whose financial systems encourage diverse financing arrangements\nare able to maintain international competitiveness through updating their productive capacities.\n\nIn addition to affecting the rate as well as the nature of economic growth, a financial system is useful\nin evaluating assets, increasing liquidity, and producing and spreading information.\n\nFinancial systems often develops in response to changing patterns of demand for funds. In the 1970s,\nthere was a worldwide increase in the demand for risk management services. Many financial systems met\nthis demand by increasing trading activity and by the development of many new risk management prod-\nucts. Hence, economic growth can also stimulate growth of the financial system.\n\nFinancial markets represent the deep end of the financial system; the deeper the system, greater its\nstability and resilence. A well-developed money and government securities market helps the central bank\nto conduct monetary policy effectively with the use of market-based instruments. Well-developed finan-\ncial markets are also required for creating a balanced financial system in which both, financial markets\nand financial institutions play important roles. An imbalance between the two leads to financial crisis, as\nit happened in South-east Asia.\n\nThe financial system plays an important role in disciplining and guiding management companies,\nleading to sound corporate governance practices. The domestic financial system when linked to the inter-\nnational financial system increases capital flow with the help of financial markets. This link reduces risk\nthrough portfolio diversification and helps in accelerating economic growth.\n\n\u2018There has been much theorising about a two-way and symbiotic relationship between the financial system\nand economic growth. A sophisticated and sound financial system accelerates the rate of economic growth,\nand the financial system, in turn, develops more with higher economic growth. This relationship between a\nfinancial system and economic growth has received considerable attention in empirical literature also.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Empirical Research Evidence on Relationship Between the Financial\nSystem and Economic Growth\n\nHistorical evidence of the relationship between the financial system and economic growth can be traced\nto observations by Gurley and Shaw (1955,1960) and Goldsmith (1969) which indicate that self-financed\n\ncapital investment, as economies develop, first gives way to bank-intermediated debt finance and later to\nthe emergence of equity markets as an additional instrument for raising external finance.\n\nAccording to Hicks (1969), new technological inventions did not set off the industrial revolution in\nEngland in the eighteenth century. Rather, more liquid financial markets made it possible to develop pro-\njects that required large capital injections for long periods before the projects ultimately yielded results.\nThe industrial revolution, therefore, had to wait for the financial revolution.\n\nMcKinnon and Shaw (1973) laid the theoretical grounds for the relationship between financial devel-\nopment and economic growth. According to them, government restrictions on the banking system (such\nas interest rate ceilings, high reserve requirements, and directed credit programmes\u2014defined as financial\nrepression) impede the process of financial development and, consequently, reduce economic growth.\nHence, they advocated liberalization of financial markets and it was their work which encouraged finan-\ncial liberalization in developing countries as part of economic reforms.\n\nMcKinnon and Shaw\u2019s views were further extended by Cho (1986), who argued that financial mar-\nket liberalization may remain incomplete without an efficient market for equity capital as a means of\nspreading risk. The development of both bank and equity market is a necessary condition for financial\nliberalization.\n\nKumar and Tsetseko (1992) argued that substitutability and complementarity between banks and secu-\nrities market appear to be sensitive to the level of economic growth. According to them, an economic\nenvironment with a flourishing private sector and well-established banking system is conducive to the\ngrowth and expansion of equity market.\n\nA study by Atje and Jovanovic (1993) concluded that stock markets on their own can raise a typical\ndeveloping country\u2019s economic growth by an outstanding 2.5 per cent per annum.\n\nKing and Levine (1993) used several measures for the level of development of financial intermediaries\nfor a cross-section of 77 countries for the period 1960-89. They found a statistically and economically\nsignificant relationship between the measures of financial development and growth variables.\n\nLevine and Zervos (1995) explored the effects of liberalization of capital control. They indicated that\ncountries which liberalized restriction on capital and dividend flows showed a marked improvement in the\nfunctioning of their stock exchanges.\n\nGreenwood and Smith (1996) showed that large stock markets can lower the cost of mobilizing savings\nand thereby facilitate investment in the most productive techniques.\n\nDemiriguc Kunt and Levine (1996) found that in the long-term, stock return volatility is lower in\ncountries with more open capital markets. They concluded also that as countries grow and reach middle\nincome (about $2,000 per capita in 1990), the level of stock market development is positively correlated\nwith the development of financial intermediaries. Thus, stock markets and financial institutions are gener-\nally complementary; they grow simultaneously.\n\nDemitriade and Hussein (1996) found little to support the view that finance is a leading sector in the\nprocess of economic development. However, they found evidence that in quite a few countries, economic\ngrowth systematically causes financial development. On balance, however, most of the evidence seems to\nfavour the view that the relationship between financial development and economic growth is a two-way\none. The data provide support to the view that reforms, where they are able to contribute to the process of\nfinancial deepening, may also contribute to the more general process of economic development.\n\nLevine and Sara Zervos (1996) focused on two measures of liquidity\u2014the value traded ratio and the\nturnover ratio for a broad cross-section study of 49 countries over the period 1976-93 with the objective\nto measure the degree to which agents can cheaply, quickly, and confidently trade ownership claims of\na large percentage of the economy's productive technologies. The researchers then assessed the strength\nof the empirical relationship among each liquidity measure and the three growth indicators\u2014economic\ngrowth, capital accumulation, and productivity. Their results are consistent with views that the liquidity\nservices provided by stock markets are independently important for long-term growth and that stock mar-\nkets and financial intermediaries are complementary to one another and not substitutes. The research also\nshows that liberalization of cash flows opening to foreign investment enhances stock market development\nand liquidity.\n\nLevine (1997) stressed the importance of stock markets in stimulating the financing of investment\nin less liquid investment projects. He constructed an endogenous growth model with a two-way relation\nbetween the financial system and economic growth. According to Levine, the financial system influences\nreal sector activities through its functional ability. A need for reduction in information and transaction\ncosts leads to the development of financial markets and intermediaries. Financial markets, through their\nfunctions (services), influence the rates of capital accumulation and technological innovations which are\nprerequisites for economic growth (Figure 2.2).\n\nMarket Frictions\n* Information Costs\n* Transaction Costs\n\n'\nFinancial Markets and Intermediaries\n\nt\nFinancial Markets Functions (Services)\n+ Transaction Costs\n\n+ Risk Diversification\n\n* Rapid Information\n\n* Corporate Control\n\n* Savings Mobilization\n\nChannels to Growth\n+ Capital Accumulation\n+ Technological Innovations\n\n'\nEconomic Growth\n\nSource: Levin, \u2018Financial Development And Economic Growth: Views And Agenda,\u2019 Journal Of Economic Literature, Vol. 35,\nJune 1997, P 691\n\nFigure 2.2 Relationship Between the Financial System and Economic Growth\n\nSingh (1997) concentrated his research on the stock exchanges of developing countries between\n1982 and 1992 and found that the total market capitalization of companies quoted on stock exchanges\nincreased by a factor of 20, thereby highlighting the importance of the issue of financing through stock\nmarkets.\n\nHowever, some researchers have found evidences contrary to the above. A cross-country study by\nMayer (1990) covering the period 1970-85, concluded that internal savers finance bulk of corporate\ninvestment in major developed countries like the US, UK, Germany, Japan, Italy, Canada, and Finland\nand that the role of the stock market is very limited. Stigilitz (1994) criticized the financial liberalization\nthesis on the grounds that financial markets are prone to market failures.\n\nNagaraj (1996) compiled and analyzed some useful direct evidence for India for the period 1950\u2014\n91. He concluded that capital market growth has changed domestic financial savings composition from\nbank deposits to shares and debentures, without favourably influencing the domestic savings rate or its\nshare in financial assets. Equity capital's share in total market capitalization has declined since a bulk\nof such mobilization is in the form of debt. Capital market has little relation to the corporate invest-\nment rate and output growth rate. Corporate profitability declined in the 1980s, when the capital market\nboomed.\n\nSingh (1997), while examining the implications of the rapid growth of market capitalization in devel-\noping countries between 1982 and 1992, concluded that financial liberalization, by making the financial\nsystem more fragile, is not likely to enhance long-term growth in developing countries.\n\nLevine et al. (2000), on exploring the relationship between financial structure and economic develop-\nment, find that financial structure does not help in understanding economic growth, industrial perfor-\nmance, or firm expansion. Instead, there was overwhelming evidence that legal and accounting reforms\nthat strengthen creditors\u2019 rights, contract enforcement, and accounting practices boost financial interme-\ndiary development and, thereby, economic growth.\n\nFrom the above empirical research evidences, we can conclude that there is a close, if not imperfect, rela~\ntionship between the effectiveness of an economy's financial system and the level of its economic growth.\n\nMany of the above studies have employed cross-section regression methodology to draw causal\ninferences. Moreover, their findings demonstrate that causality patterns vary across countries. There-\nfore, statistical inference based on cross-section studies which implicitly treat different economies as\nhomogenous entities may not always be correct. In view of the above, empirical studies of individual\ncountries are needed to determine the impact of the relationship between financial system and eco-\nnomic growth.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "BACKGROUND\n\nThe pre-reforms period, i.e., the period from the mid-1960s to the early 1990s was char-\nacterized by administered interest rates, industrial licensing and controls, dominant public\nsector, and limited competition. This led to the emergence of an economy characterised by\nuneconomic and inefficient production systems with high costs. This inefficient allocation\nand use of resources resulted in high capital-output ratios. Despite a rise in saving rates,\nthere was greater dependence on aid and assistance from abroad to meet urgent situations.\nFor 40 years, which by any count is a long period, India\u2019s growth rate averaged less than\n4 per cent per annum, while other less-developing countries achieved a growth rate of\nover 5 per cent per annum. Moreover, countries such as Japan and other East Asian coun-\ntries were able to catch up with the industrialized countries of the West by adopting a\nmarket-oriented pattern of industrialization. The Indian government, therefore, initiated\nderegulation in the 1980s by relaxing the entry barriers, removing restrictive clauses in the\nMonopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices (MRTP) Act, allowing expansion of capaci-\nties, encouraging modernization of industries, reducing import restrictions, raising the\nyield on long-term government securities, and taking measures to help the growth of the\nmoney market. These measures resulted in a relatively high growth in the second half of\nthe 1980s, but its pace could not be sustained.\n\nIn the beginning of the 1990s, an increase in world oil prices due to the Gulf war cou-\npled with a sharp drop in the remittances of migrant workers in the Gulf created a foreign\nexchange crisis in India. This crisis became aggravated as there was an outflow of foreign\ncurrency owing to a fear of default by the Indian government on its external commitments.\nThe roots of the crisis, however, lay in the increasing deficit of the central government and\nan insular economic strategy that caused persistent macro-economic imbalances. Thus, the\ntask before the government was twofold: to restore macro-economic stability by reducing\nthe fiscal as well as the balance of payments deficit and to complete the process of economic\nreforms which had been initiated in the 1980s.\n\nThe government initiated economic reforms in June 1991 to provide an environment of\nsustainable growth and stability. Economic reforms were undertaken keeping in view two\nbroad objectives.\n\n1. Reorientation of the economy from one that was statist, state-dominated, and highly\ncontrolled to one that is market-friendly. In order to achieve this, it was decided to\nreduce direct controls, physical planning, and trade barriers.\n\n2. Macro-economic stability by substantially reducing fiscal deficits and the govern-\nment\u2019s draft on society's savings.\n\nBoth stabilization and the Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) needed liberalization\nand globalization as the principal instruments for achieving these goals. The government,\ntherefore, adopted a phased approach to liberalize the various sectors of the economy.\n\nThe reform package included the liberalization of domestic investment, opening up of key\ninfrastructure areas for private sector participation, opening the economy to foreign competi-\ntion by reducing protective barriers such as import controls and high tariffs, deregulation of\ninterest rates, encouraging direct foreign investment as a source of technology upgradation\nand non-debt finance for investment, reform of the public sector to impart greater efficiency,\n\n\ndisinvestment of public sector undertakings (PSUs), and reform of the tax system to create a broader base\nof taxation by moderating tax rates.\n\nThe deregulation of industry, liberalization of foreign exchange markets and convertibility of currency\nrequire an efficient financial system. Hence, the steps to improve the financial system were an integral part\nof the economic reforms initiated in 1991. The improved financial system is expected to increase the effi-\nciency of resource mobilization and allocation in the real economy, which, in turn, would induce a higher\nrate of economic growth. Moreover, the soundness of the financial system is one of the fundamentals for\njudging the health of an economy and these measures will impart it health as well as strength.\n\nIn August 1991, the government of India appointed a high level committee under the chairmanship of\nM. Narasimham, former governor of the Reserve Bank of India, to look into all aspects of the financial\nsystem and make comprehensive recommendations to reform it. The committee submitted its report in\nNovember 1991, recommending reforms in both the banking sector and in the financial markets. These\nrecommendations were gradually implemented in the beginning of 1992.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "INDIAN FINANCIAL SYSTEM IN THE PRE-REFORMS PERIOD\n\nFinancial systems in developing countries, some two decades ago, were viewed primarily as tools in the\nhands of the government to be used in the development process. Financial institutions, on the one hand,\nwere tapped for funds to finance government and public expenditure and, on the other hand, used to direct\ncredit to the priority sector. Such a view of the functions of the financial system has changed. In many\ndeveloping economies, the emphasis has now shifted from the government and public sector to private\nsector due to the government's failure to attain social objectives. The private sector, in order to survive\nand grow, has to rely on a developed financial system. Moreover, in this era of globalization and intense\ncompetition, a continuous flow of funds is needed, from within the country and from abroad. To attract\nthis flow of funds, a developed domestic financial system is a prerequisite.\n\nThe role of the financial system in the development process has changed not only in the developing\n\u2018economies, but worldwide as well. The emphasis in the approach to the financial system in the growth\nprocess has moved from channelizing of resources to efficient credit allocation, which is largely deter-\nmined by market forces. Since the South-east Asian financial crisis, financial stability occupies as impor-\ntant a place in the system as does efficiency of allocation.\n\nAfier independence, India adopted a state-dominated development strategy wherein all allocation\ndecisions were made by the government and its agencies. Accelerated capital accumulation by increas-\ning domestic savings was considered to be the key to development. An increase in domestic savings was\nachieved by levying high taxes, suppressing consumption, and appropriating profits through ownership\nof commercial enterprises. The role of the financial system was limited in this state-dominated environ-\nment. Banks were the dominant financial institutions for accumulation of savings and financing of trade\nand industrial activities. The financial system had a limited role in capital accumulation, since it could\nnot provide incentives for higher savings as interest rates were not only controlled but also repressed.\nMoreover, the government pre-empted household saving through high levels of statutory and cash reserve\nrequirements. Banks and financial institutions merely acted as deposit agencies.\n\n\u2018The resource mobilization in the primary capital market was also subject to several controls which pre-\nvented the process of price discovery. The allocation decisions were made by the government, limiting the\nallocative efficiency of the financial system. Banks and financial institutions directed credit to priority sec-\ntors at subsidized rates decided by the government. In order to offset the subsidized rates, banks charged\nhigher interest rates from other borrowers and paid lower rates to depositors. These interest rate controls and\nhigh regulations inhibited proper pricing of resources and limited the allocative efficiency. Thus, the Indian\nfinancial system till the early 1990s was a closed, restricted, highly regulated, and segmented system.\n\nIn the 1990s, there was a paradigm shift in development from a state-dominated to a market-determined\nstrategy. This shift was a result of the government's failure in achieving a higher growth rate. On the one\nhand, the government could not generate resources for investment or public services; on the other, there was\nan erosion in public savings. Thus, a failure of the government's restrictive and regulating policies and a\nneed to adopt a market-determined strategy of development were the causes for undertaking reforms in the\nfinancial system. Reforms aimed at improving operational and allocative efficiency of the financial system.\n\n",

This would greatly augment\nthe accumulation of capital funds.\n\nThe basic priority in the early reforms period was to remove structural rigidities and inefficiencies\nin the financial system. The financial system, in the 1980s and early 1990s, was characterized by con-\ntrols over the pricing of financial assets, restrictions on flows or transactions, barriers to entry, low\nliquidity, and high costs. These characteristics hindered the development of the financial system into\nan efficient conduit for channelizing and allocating resources. Hence, the reforms primarily aimed\nat structural transformation in the financial system to improve efficiency, stability, and integration of\nvarious components of the financial system. Some of the structural changes initiated are free pricing\nof financial assets, relaxation of quantitative restrictions, removal of barriers to entry, new methods\nand instruments of trading, and greater participation and improvement in clearing, settlement, and\ndisclosure practices.\n\nThe structural transformation process is now almost complete.

An efficient\nfinancial system is one which allocates savings to the most productive uses. Besides allocating financial\nresources, it also ensures the following:\n\n+ Information arbitrage efficiency, i.e., whether market prices reflect all the available information.\n+ Fundamental valuation efficiency, i.e., whether company valuations are reflected in stock prices.\n+ Full insurance efficiency, i.e., whether economic agents can insure against all future contingencies.\n\nFinancial markets and financial institutions are the two important components of a financial system.\nA financial system\u2019s efficiency is reflected in the efficiency of both financial markets and financial institu-\ntions. Several steps have been undertaken to improve the efficiency of financial institutions and markets.\nLiberalization of interest rates, reduction in reserve requirements, increasing competition by allowing\nnew private sector players, advances in technology, introduction of prudential norms such as income rec-\nognition, provisioning, and capital adequacy, and laying down of standards for corporate governance are\nsome of the steps undertaken to improve the efficiency of the banking sector. In case of financial markets,\nrepealing of the Capital Issues (Control) Act, 1947, free pricing, rationalization of the process of price\ndiscovery in the form of book building and auctions, enhancing transparency through strict disclosure\nnorms, improved trading and settlement practices, enlarging the number of participants, introduction of\na transparent takeover code, encouraging the growth of firms both at home and abroad, rationalized tax\nstructures, encouraging good market practices, introduction of real time gross settlement (RTGS) and\nother electronic payment mechanisms are some of the measures which have helped in improving informa-\ntion efficiency and bringing down transaction costs.\n\nFinancial stability has been an important goal for the regulators after the South-east Asian currency\nand financial crisis. Financial stability is crucial in this era of globalization, which has increased mobility\nof international capital flows, and the risk of contagion of financial crisis among countries. Liberalization\nand deregulation also pose several risks to financial stability. Financial instability arises due to weak fun-\ndamentals and institutional failures, resulting in panic or information asymmetry. As stated in the RBI's\nReport on Currency and Finance (2004), financial stability in India would mean (a) ensuring uninter-\nrupted financial transactions, (b) maintenance of a level of confidence in the financial system amongst all\nthe participants, and (c) absence of excess volatility that adversely affects real economic activity. In order\nto ensure financial stability, the government has adopted a three-fold strategy.\n\n1. Strengthening linkages across institutions and markets.\n2. Promoting soundness of financial institutions through prudential regulation and supervision.\n3. Ensuring the overall macro-economic balance.\n\nThe Reserve Bank has followed a three-pronged strategy to maintain financial stability.\n\n1. Maintaining the overall macro-economic balance, especially through the twin objectives of price\nstability and growth.\n\n2. Enhancing the macro-prudential functioning of institutions and markets.\n\n3. Strengthening micro-prudential institutional soundness through regulation and supervision.\n\nThe Reserve Bank maintains orderly conditions in various financial markets by adopting flexible operating\nprocedures and instruments of monetary policy. The LAF operations coupled with open market operations\n\nhelp in absorbing liquidity to maintain financial stability. The Reserve Bank instituted the Market Stabilization\nScheme (MSS) to absorb persistent capital flows. The stock markets and market participants could withstand\nthe volatility that occurred on May 17, 2004 when the results of the general elections were declared.\n\nThe operation of a financial system is influenced by overall economic activity and macro-economic\nchanges. Hence, assessment of financial soundness and stability requires the development of macro-\nprudential indicators. These indicators are quantitative variables, which comprise both micro-prudential\nindicators of the health of individual financial institutions, and macro-economic variables related with\nfinancial system soundness. Macro-prudential indicators can help a country to assess its banking system's\nvulnerability to crisis; they can be extended even to financial markets. The Reserve Bank monitors macro-\nprudential indicators and makes them publicly available through its reports to enhance the disclosure of key\nfinancial information to markets. Macro-economic indicators include sets of indicators on the real econ-\nomy, trends in balance-of-payments level and volatility of inflation, interest and exchange rates, growth of\ncredit, correlation among financial markets, trades spillover, and contagion from investor behaviour. Micro\nprudential indicators include indicators on capital adequacy, asset quality of lending and borrowing entities,\nmanagement soundness, liquidity, sensitivity to market risk, and some market-based indicators, such as\nmarket prices, ratings of financial instruments, and financial institutions. To ensure financial stability, the\ngovernment replaced ad hoc T-bills with the system of ways and means advances to raise funds.\n\nIntegrated markets are unified markets wherein participants in one market have unrestricted access\nto other markets. This brings about an overall equality of returns over markets. The money market, the\ncapital market, and the foreign exchange market remained segmented till the early 1990s due to high level\nof regulation and restrictions. An integration of markets is necessary for effective transmission and imple-\nmentation of policies and for facilitating better functioning of markets. To enable integration, interest rates\nwere freed, foreign capital flows and foreign participants were allowed entry, domestic companies were\npermitted to raise funds from outside, and participants were allowed to operate in different markets simul-\ntaneously. Besides, introduction of new products such as repos and derivatives, and improvements in tech-\nnology and payment and settlement infrastructure have facilitated integration of financial markets in India.\nThe integration of the domestic financial markets within themselves and with the foreign exchange market\nis reflected in trends in turnover and prices of securities in financial markets. Besides this, an analysis of\nthe transmission of volatility in one market to other markets also helps in knowing the extent of integration\nof financial markets. The linkage between the call money market and foreign exchange market is found\nduring times of volatility in foreign exchange market as commercial banks have a dominant presence in\nboth the markets. An increase in foreign investment flows increases cross-border financial integration. As\na result, the sensitivity of the Indian technology stocks to movements in the NASDAQ composite index\nwas high in 1999-2000. The movements in the Indian stock indices are correlated with the movements\nin the global stock indices. The domestic integration of various segments of financial markets has been\nfacilitated by the expansion of the online operations of two major stock exchanges\u2014the BSE and the NSE.\nThe regional stock exchanges have been integrated with the Interconnected Stock Exchange of India Ltd\n(ISE). In addition, many regional stock exchanges have become members of both the BSE and the NSE.\n\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Conclusion\n\nThe Indian financial system is fairly integrated, stable, and efficient. There are weaknesses in the system\nwhich need to be addressed. These include a high level of non-performing assets in some banks and finan-\ncial institutions, disciplinary issues with regard to non-banking financial companies, government's high\ndomestic debt and borrowings, volatility in financial markets, absence of a yield curve, and co-operative\nbank scams.\n\nThe reforms in the financial system have been more capital market-centric in nature. The crisis in\nfinancial institutions such as UTI, IFCI, and IDBI unfolded the failure of prudential regulations and the\ngovernment had to bail them out by refinancing them. This eroded investor confidence in public sector\ninstitutions, leading to a deceleration in the rate of domestic saving. Foreign capital flows and foreign\nexchange reserves have increased but the actual absorption of foreign capital is quite low. The fiscal defi-\ncit has expanded, leading to a deteriorating fiscal scene. The spreading of the sub-prime mortgage crisis,\nhigh inflation and depreciating rupee has put a pressure on the GDP growth rate.\n\nThe growth rate of GDP has increased since 2003-04 but it needs to be sustained. India has still a long\nway to go. We can achieve a growth rate of 8 per cent for which we need reforms in key areas such as agricul-\nture, power and labour. Greater consolidation and competition among banks and other financial intermediaries\nsuch as mutual funds and insurance companies is needed to lower the costs of intermediation and expand the\navailability of credit and insurance in the rural areas. Reforms in sectors such as retailing, manufacturing,\nmining, and insurance should be carried forward. The sectoral caps for FDI should be relaxed to attract large\nforeign capital inflows especially in the financial services sector.\n\nBox 3.1 Twenty five Years of Reforms\n\nThe economic reform process of liberalization and globalization was introduced in the 1990s to improve performance of all sectors and mak-\ning India globally competitive. Structural reforms, encompassing all sectors of the economy, involved reorientation towards a market-based\neconomy for fostering sustainable growth and stability.\n\nThe reforms have transformed India from a closed and trailing economy toa liberalized and steady economy. The financial sector reforms\nhave aided growth, avoided crisis, enhanced efficiency and imparted resilience to the system. This could be achieved, as the reform process\nwas gradually implemented, coordinated with other economic policies and sequenced with international trends. Reforms in the financial\nsector created a deregulated environment and enabled free play of market forces.\n\nThe growth rate of the economy had collapsed to only 0.8 per cent in 1991. However, with the advent of continuous economic reforms,\nthe economy has recorded an average growth rate of around 6 per cent in the last decade. India has been able to break free from the dismal\nHindu rate of growth of 3.5 per cent and is now on a 8 per cent growth trajectory. The Indian economy grew at 9.6 per cent in 2006-07,\nmaking it one of the world\u2019s fastest growing economies.\n\nThe abolishment of license raj and bottlenecks of control have given a lot of freedom to the Indian industry. The lowering of taxes,\ncustoms, and excise duties have triggered investments in manufacturing, improved margins, and given a greater choice to the consumer. A\nhost of foreign players have entered the manufacturing sector leading to a significant increase in competition.\n\nThe economic fundamentals are improving. Exports are increasing and India is a destination for software services and business pro-\ncess outsourcing. New areas such as generic pharmaceuticals auto and ancillary and engineering products are contributing towards\nexport growth. The Indian industry underwent a restructuring phase and is now moving into the investment cycle for expansion\nand modernization. Indian industries have built world class size manufacturing capacities, acquired companies, improved quality and\nefficiency, and become globally competitive.\n\nThe core objectives of the financial sector reforms are strengthening of the financial sector and improving the functioning of the finan-\ncial markets. Indian stock markets are one of the most exciting and vibrant markets of the world. They have the highest number of listed\ncompanies with a 300-million strong investor community. The average trading volume in these markets is now around a trillion dollars a\nday. The liquidity in the stock markets has increased. The return on equity in India is one of the highest in the world. Shares are trading at\na price-earnings multiple of 15. A large number of foreign institutional investors (Flls) have setup separate India sections for trading in\nthese markets. In the US alone, there are more than 5,000 India\u2014dedicated mutual fund schemes. The stock market index reached a peak of\n21,000 in January 2008. Indian markets have come a long way since the 1992 scam. A lot of infrastructural issues such as on-line trading,\ndemat, rolling settlement, and disclosures have been taken care of. Moreover the time period between issue closure and listing has been\nreduced to six days as against the earlier 15 days.\n\nIndia\u2019s financial sector is integrating with that of the rest of the world. The interest rates have been freed, the statutory provisions\nhave been reduced and prudential norms have been strengthened for players in the financial sector. Reforms have altered the organization\nstructure, ownership pattern, and domain of operations of financial institutions and infused greater competition.\n\nRegulators came up in telecom, power, hydrocarbons and insurance and to oversee competition. The RBI acquired autonomy beyond\nthe remit of its statute. India\u2019s information technology (IT) industry and the IT-enabled industry, along with the telecom revolution, have\nmade the Indian growth story illustrious, achieving an average growth of 4.1% per annum in the first three decades of independence com-\npared to 6.3% in the last three and a half decades. The source of \u201cnew\u201d growth has been rooted in the spread of construction, townships,\nurban development, IT parks, commercial centres and other service sector activities. Much of this has happened in and around urban and\nsemi-urban areas.\n\nThe setting up of the National Payments Corporation of India in 2008 paved the way, in conjunction with the Aadhaar project, for\ncountry-wide electronic banking and financial inclusion.\n\nThe impact of the deeper reforms of the 1990s took time to materialise which is best reflected in the fact that the growth rate of the\neconomy in the 13 years 2003-04 to 2015-16 averaged 7.7%, much higher than that achieved in the pre-reform period and despite two\nexternal shocks, the financial crisis in 2008 and the Eurozone crisis in 2011. This is also a period when poverty fell much faster from 2004-05\nto 2011-12 (the latest period for which data are available) than in the earlier periods.\n\nNumbers Tell the Story\n\nTHEN (1991) (NOW) (2016)\nGDP %10.8 lakh crore %135,7 lakh crore\nReal GDP Growth (% growth) 1.4 77\nUrban Households ('000) 40,418.1 93,559.2\nRural Households ('000) 411,591.38 1,80,207.9\nConsumer Expenditure as % of GDP 68 63\nUrban Consumer Expenditure (& million current prices) 15,88,084 4,42,48,425\nRural Consumer Expenditure (& million current prices) 29,07,463 5,03,70,467\n\u2018Average Gross Income (& current prices) 10,110 1,55,622\nDisposable Income (\u00a5 million current prices) 51,50,776 13,67,11,449\nMiddle Class Households ('000) 58,816 76,011\nTelephone Subscribers 0.5 million 979.2 million\nPassenger Cars Sold 0.18 million 2.7 million\nAir Passengers 10 million 400 million\n\nSource: Euromonitor/RB!

The existence of an efficient money market is a precondi-\ntion for the development of a government securities market and a forward foreign exchange market.\n\nTrading in forwards, swaps, and futures is also supported by a liquid money market as the certainty of\nprompt cash settlement is essential for such transactions. The government can achieve better pricing on\nits debt as it provides access to a wide range of buyers.

The money market consisted of the inter-bank call market,\ntreasury bills, commercial bills, and participation certificates.\n\nSeveral steps were taken in the 1980s and 1990s to reform and develop the money market. The reforms\nin the money market were initiated in the latter half of the 1980s.\n\nIn the 1980s A committee to review the working of the monetary system under the chairmanship of\nSukhamoy Chakravorty was set up in 1985, It underlined the need to develop money market instruments.\nAs a follow up, the Reserve Bank set up a working group on the money market under the chairmanship\nof N. Vagul which submitted its report in 1987. This committee laid the blueprint for the institution of a\nmoney market. Based on its recommendations, the Reserve Bank initiated a number of measures.\n\n+ The Discount and Finance House of India (DFHI) was set up as a money market institution jointly\nby the Reserve Bank, public sector banks, and financial institutions in 1988 to impart liquidity to\nmoney market instruments and help the development of a secondary market in such instruments.\n\n* Money market instruments such as the 182-day treasury bill, certificate of deposit, and inter-bank\nparticipation certificate were introduced in 1988-89. Commercial paper was introduced in January\n1990.\n\n+ To enable price discovery, the interest rate ceiling on call money was freed in stages from October\n1988. As a first step, operations of the DFHI in the call/notice money market were freed from\nthe interest rate ceiling in 1988. Interest rate ceilings on inter-bank term money (10.5 per cent to\n11.5 per cent), rediscounting of commercial bills (12.5 per cent), and inter-bank participation with-\nout risk (12.5 per cent) were withdrawn effective May 1989. All the money market interest rates\nare, by and large, determined by market forces. There has been a gradual shift from a regime of\nadministered interest rates to market-based interest rates.\n\nIn the 1990s The government set up a high-level committee in August 1991 under the chairmanship of\nM. Narasimham (the Narasimham Committee) to examine all aspects relating to structure, organization,\nfunctions, and procedures of the financial system. The committee made several recommendations for the\ndevelopment of the money market. The Reserve Bank accepted many of its recommendations.\n\n+ The Securities Trading Corporation of India was set up in June 1994 to provide an active secondary\nmarket in government dated securities and public sector bonds.\n\nBarriers to entry were gradually eased by: (a) setting up the primary dealer system in 1995 and satel-\nlite dealer system in 1999 to inject liquidity in the market; (b) relaxing issuance restrictions and sub-\nscription norms in respect of money market instruments; (c) allowing the determination of yields\nbased on the demand and supply of such paper; (d) enabling market evaluation of associated risks;\nby withdrawing regulatory restriction such as bank guarantees in respect of commercial papers; and\n(c) increasing the number of participants by allowing the entry of foreign institutional investors\n(Fils), non-bank financial institutions, and mutual funds.\n\nSeveral financial innovations in instruments and methods were introduced. Treasury bills of vary-\ning maturities and RBI repos were introduced. Auctioned treasury bills were introduced leading to\nmarket-determined interest rates.\n\nThe development of a market for short-term funds at market-determined rates has been fostered by a\ngradual switch from a cash-credit system to a loan-based system, shifting the onus of cash manage-\nment from banks to borrowers.\n\nAd hoc and on-tap 91-day treasury bills were discontinued in April, 1997. They were replaced by\nWays and Means Advances (WMA) linked to the bank rate. The introduction of WMA led to the\nlimiting of the almost automatic funding of the government.\n\nIndirect monetary control instruments such as the bank rate\u2014reactivated in April 1997, strategy of\ncombining auctions, private placements, and open market operations\u2014in 1998-99, and the liquidity\nadjustment facility (LAF)\u2014in June 2000 were introduced. The LAF helped to develop interest rate\nas an important instrument of monetary transmission.\n\n+ The minimum lock-in period for money market instruments was brought down to 7 days.\n\nThe inter-bank liabilities were exempted from the cash reserve ratio and the statutory liquidity ratio\n(SLR) stipulations for facilitating the development of a term money market.\n\nNew money market derivatives such as forward rate agreements (FRAs) and interest rate swaps\n(IRSs) were introduced in 1999.\n\nMoney market instruments such as certificate of deposits and commercial paper are freely acces-\nsible to non-bank participants.\n\nThe payment system infrastructure was strengthened with the introduction of the negotiated dealing\nsystem (NDS) in February 2002, setting-up of the Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL) in\nApril 2002 and the implementation of real time gross settlement (RTGS) system from April 2004.\nCollateral Borrowing and Lending Obligation (CBLO) was operationalized as a money market\ninstrument through the CCIL on January 20, 2003.\n\nTransformation of Call Money Market into a pure inter-bank market by August, 2005.\n\nWidening of collateral base by making state government securities eligible for LAF operations since\nApril, 2007.\n\nOperationalization of a screen-based negotiated system (NDS-CALL) for clearings in the call/\nnotice and term money markets in September, 2006. The reporting of all such transactions made\ncompulsory through NDS-CALL in November, 2012.\n\n+ The repo in corporate banks allowed in March 2010.\n* Operationalization of a reporting platform for secondary market transuctions in CPs and CPs in\nJuly 2010.\n\nThe development and profile of the money market has changed in the nineties. A basic objective of\nmoney market reforms in the recent years has been to facilitate the introduction of new instruments and their\nappropriate pricing. The Reserve Bank has endeavoured to develop market segments which exclusively deal\nin specific assets and liabilities as well as participants. Accordingly, the call/notice money market is now a\npure inter-bank market. In order to ensure systemic stability, prudential limits on exposures to the call money\nmarket have been imposed. Standing liquidity support to banks from the Reserve Bank and facilities for\nexceptional liquidity support have been rationalized. The various segments of the money market have inte-\ngrated with the introduction and successful implementation of the LAF. The NDS and CCIL have improved\nthe functioning of money markets. They have facilitated a speedier conversion of notice/call money market\ninto a pure inter-bank money market and enabled the growth of a buoyant repo market outside the LAF.\n\n",

They were discontinued from April 1, 1997, as they had lost much of\ntheir relevance.\n\nAd hoc Bills Ad hoc bills were introduced in 1955. It was decided between the Reserve Bank and the\nGovernment of India that the government could maintain with the Reserve Bank a cash balance of not\nless than 50 crore on Fridays and %4 crore on other days, free of obligation to pay interest thereon, and\nwhenever the balance fell below the minimum, the government account would be replenished by the\ncreation of ad hoc bills in favour of the Reserve Bank. Ad hoc 91-day T-bills were created to replenish the\ngovernment's cash balances with the Reserve Bank. They were just an accounting measure in the Reserve\nBank\u2019s books and, in effect, resulted in automatic monetization of the government's budget deficit. A\nmonetized deficit is the increase in the net Reserve Bank credit to the central government which is the\nsum of the increase in the Reserve Bank\u2019s holdings of: (a) the government of India\u2019s dated securities;\n(b) 91-day treasury bills; and (c) rupee coins for changes in cash balances with the Reserve Bank.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, a large proportion of outstanding ad hocs were converted into long-term\ndated and undated securities of the Government of India. This conversion is referred to as \u2018funding.\u2019\nTheir expansion put a constraint on the Reserve Bank conduct of monetary policy and hence they were\ndiscontinued from April 1, 1997. The outstanding ad hoc T-bills and tap bills as on March 31, 1997 were\nfunded on April 1, 1997 into special securities without any specified maturity at an interest rate of 4.6 per\ncent per annum. A system of Ways and Means Advances from April 1, 1997 was introduced to replace ad\nhoc bills and to accommodate temporary mismatches in the government of India receipts and payments.\n\nAuctioned T-Bills Auctioned T-bills, the most active money market instrument, were first introduced in\nApril 1992. The Reserve Bank receives bids in an auction from various participants and issues the bills\nsubject to some cut-off limits. Thus, the yield of this instrument is market determined. These bills are\nneither rated nor can they be rediscounted with the Reserve Bank. At present, the Reserve Bank issues\n\u2018bills of three maturities\u201491-days, 182-days, and 364-days.\n\nImportance of T-Bills\n\n\u2018The development of Ebills is at the heart of the growth of the money market. Pbills play a vital role in the\ncash management of the government. Being risk free, their yields at varied maturities serve as short-term\nbenchmarks and help in pricing different floating rate products in the market. The T-bills market is the\npreferred central bank tool for market intervention to influence liquidity and short-term interest rates. The\ndevelopment of the T-bills market is a pre-condition for effective open market operations.\n",

These bills were introduced to replenish on an\nautomatic basis, the central government's cash balance with the Reserve Bank so that only the minimum\nrequired level was maintained. These bills opened up an era of uncontrolled monetization of the central\ngovernment's deficit. Before the 1960s, there was an active T-bills market owing to the weekly auctions\nof the 91-day T-bills.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, the auction system for the issue of 91-day T-bills was replaced by on-tap bills. Till\n1974, the tap bills rate changed with changes in the bank rate which sustained the interest of the par-\nticipants in the T-bills market. However, after 1974, the discount rate on ad hoc and tap bills was fixed\nuniformly at 4.6 per cent. The T-bills market lost lustre due to the administered rate regime.\n\nHowever, the interest in T-bills revived with the introduction of the 182-day T-bills on an auction basis\nin November 1986. It also revived because of the constitution of the Discount and Finance House of India\nin 1988 as a money market institution.\n\nThe 182-day T-bills were discontinued in 1992 and replaced by the 364-day auction T-bills in April\n1992 as part of reform measures. Subsequently, the 91-day auction T-bills were introduced in January\n1993. The parallel existence of the 91-day tap T-bills and ad hoc T-bills continued till March 1997.\n\nThereafter, the 14-day intermediate T-bills and auction T-bills were introduced in April 1997 to provide\nan alternative avenue to state governments and to facilitate some foreign central banks to invest surplus\nfunds.\n\nThe 182-day T-bills were reintroduced to provide variety in treasury bills. However, both the 182-\nand 14-day T-bills were discontinued from March 2001. The 182-day T-bills were reintroduced in April\n2005.\n\nThe Reserve Bank\u2019s purchase and holding of T-bills have become totally voluntary with the discon-\ntinuation of the ad hoc and on-tap 91-day T-bills. Before the introduction of the auctioned T-bills, a\nsubstantial majority of the T-bills used to be held by the Reserve Bank. With the introduction of auc-\ntioned T-bills, more than 25 per cent of T-bills are held by investors other than the Reserve Bank. The\nauction procedures have been streamlined with notified amounts for all auctions being specified in case\nof competitive bids and non-competitive bids being accepted outside the notified amount. A uniform\nprice-based auction for 91-day T-bills was introduced on an experimental basis in 1998-99. It has been\nsuccessfully adopted.\n",

The method helps in price discovery, a process\nwherein prices in the market reflect the relative cost of production and consumption utilities with a view\nto achieving the optimum allocation of resources in the economy. In case of auctions, competitive bids\nare submitted by the participants to the Reserve Bank and the bank decides the cut-off yield/price and\nmakes the allotment on such a basis. For an auction to be meaningful, it is necessary that auctions are\nconducted on a competitive bidding basis. For this purpose, the participation should be large and varied\nin nature. A wider participation in auctions results in increased competition, yielding better prices and\nimproving the auction results. Primary dealers, banks, corporates, mutual funds, and others participate in\nthe competitive bids.\n\nBesides allotting T-bills through auction, the Reserve Bank accepts non-competitive bids from state\ngovernments, non-government provident funds, and other central banks. Non-competitive bids are\naccepted to encourage participants who do not have expertise in bidding. Such bids are a more efficient\nway of encouraging retail participation instead of having a large number of retail investors bidding\ncompetitively on their own. The Reserve Bank also participates on a non-competitive basis to primarily\ntake up the under-subscribed issues. Non-competitive bidders are allotted T-bills at a weighted aver-\nage price of the successful competitive bids. Non-competitive bids are accepted outside the notified\namount.\n\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Types of Auctions\n\nThere are two types of auctions: (i) multiple-price auction and (ii) uniform-price auction.\n\nMultiple-price Auction The Reserve Bank invites bids by price, ie., the bidders have to quote the\nprice (per 2100 face value) of the stock which they desire to purchase. The bank then decides the cut-off\nprice at which the issue would be exhausted. Bids above the cut-off price are allotted securities. In other\nwords, each winning bidder pays the price it bid.\n\nThe advantage of this method is that the Reserve Bank obtains the maximum price each participant is\nwilling to pay. It can encourage competitive bidding because cach bidder is aware that it will have to pay\nthe price it bid, not just the minimum accepted price. The disadvantage is that bidders bid more cautiously\n(\u00e9e., offer lower prices) in these auctions. This is so because it may happen that bidders who paid higher\nprices could face large capital losses if the trading in these securities starts below the marginal price set at\nthe auction. This is known as the \u2018winner's curse.\u2019 The winner's curse can be a problem in those markets\nwhere price volatility is high. In order to eliminate the problem, the Reserve Bank introduced uniform\nprice auction in case of 91-day T-bills.\n\nUniform-price Auction _ In this method, the Reserve Bank invites bids in descending order and accepts\nthose that fully absorb the issue amount. Each winning bidder pays the same (uniform) price as decided by\nthe Reserve Bank. In other words, all winning bidders are awarded the au ed amount at the same price.\n\nThe advantages of the uniform price auction are that they tend to minimize uncertainty and encourage\nbroader participation. On the other hand, it may be possible that uniform price auctions could reduce the\nneed to prepare for the auction as allotment at a uniform price reduces the incentive to bid. Moreover,\nthere are dangers of irresponsible bidding or of collusion in a uniform price auction.\n\nMost countries follow the multiple-price auction. However, now the trend is a shift towards the uni-\nform-price auction.\n\nUniform-price auction was introduced on an experimental basis on November 6, 1998 in case of\n91-day T-bills. Since 1999-2000, 91-day T-bill auctions are regularly conducted on a uniform price basis.\n\nThere exists a fixed calendar for auctions of all types of T-bills. The Reserve Bank issues a press com-\nmunication, two to three days prior to the auction and invites bids, indicating the date of the auction and\nterms such as the amount of auction and type of auction.\n\nThe T-bill auction module was operationalized on October 22, 2003 on the Public Debt Office\u2014\nNegotiated Dealing System (PDO-NDS). The auction is announced and processed on-line in a\nStraight-Through-Process (STP) on the system.\n\n",

The difference between the sale price and the redemption value is\nthe return on the treasury bills or the treasury bill rate. This rate was increased to 4.60 per cent in 1974\nfrom 2.25 per cent in 1955-56. The rate was not only administered but it was the lowest rate of interest\nprevalent till 1993. Since 1993, the treasury bill rate is market-determined and has been much higher than\n4.6 per cent per annum, leading to a higher yield to investors.\n\nThe yield is the rate of return on a particular instrument. Implicit yield is the yield on an instrument if\nit is held till its maturity. This yield is calculated as follows.\n\nIfa T-bill with a face value of 2100 is issued at 298, then the implicit yield is\n\n- (3e* 100) - 100] x4\n\n= 8.164 per cent\n\nThe Reserve Bank publishes implicit yields in its weekly bulletins.\n\nA drawback of implicit yields is that they may not be exactly market-determined. Primary dealers are\nrequired to bid for a minimum amount of treasury bills in auctions; this may influence yields. Moreover,\nthe Reserve Bank takes devolvement in order to maintain yields and give signals on interest rates to the\nmarket. Hence, as treasury bills yields are dependent on and influenced by the level of liquidity in the\nmoney market, they are not preferred as benchmark rates.

The\nReserve Bank has made substantial efforts to develop the treasury bills market. The bank has discontinued\non-tap and ad hoc treasury bills and introduced auctioned treasury bills which have not only helped in\ndeveloping the treasury bills market but have also gone a long way in enhancing the popularity of this\ninstrument by making the yield market-determined. The primary dealer and satellite dealer systems were\nset up to activate the treasury bills market. This market has the potential to develop further if the market\nis broadened even more by increasing the number of players and instruments.

The tenure,\nnotified amount and date of issue of the CMBs depends upon the temporary cash requirement of the\nGovernment. The announcement of their auction is made by Reserve Bank of India through a Press\nRelease which is issued one day prior to the date of auction. The settlement of the auction is on T+1\nbasis. The non-competitive bidding scheme has not been extended to the CMBs. However, these instru-\nments are tradable and qualify for ready forward facility. Investment in CMBs is also reckoned as an\neligible investment in Government securities by banks for SLR purpose under Section 24 of the Banking\nRegulation Act, 1949, First set of CMBs were issued on May 12, 2010.\n\nCash Management bills are also issued under market stabilization scheme for liquidity management.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "COMMERCIAL PAPER\n\nThe Working Group on Money Market in 1987 suggested the introduction of the commercial paper (CP)\nin India. The Reserve Bank introduced commercial papers in January 1990. Commercial papers have\nbeen in vogue in the United States since the nineteenth century and have become popular in money mar-\nkets all over the world since the 1980s.\n\nA commercial paper is an unsecured short-term promissory note, negotiable and transferable by\nendorsement and delivery with a fixed maturity period. It is generally issued at a discount by the lead-\ning creditworthy and highly rated corporates to meet their working capital requirements. Depending upon\nthe issuing company, a commercial paper is also known as a finance paper, industrial paper, or corporate\npaper.\n\nInitially only leading highly rated corporates could issue a commercial paper. The issuer base has\nnow been widened to broad-base the market. Commercial papers can now be issued by primary deal-\ners and all-India financial institutions, apart from corporates, to access short-term funds. Effective Sep-\ntember 6, 1996 and June 17, 1998, primary dealers and satellite dealers were also permitted to issue\ncommercial papers to access greater volume of funds to help increase their activities in the secondary\nmarket.\n\nA commercial paper can be issued to individuals, banks, companies, and other registered Indian cor-\nporate bodies and unincorporated bodies. Non-resident Indians can be issued a commercial paper only on\na non-transferable and non-repatriable basis. Banks are not allowed to underwrite or co-accept the issue\nof a commercial paper. Foreign institutional investors (FIls) are eligible to invest in commercial papers\nbut within the limits set for their investments by the SEBI.\n\n\u2018A commercial paper is usually privately placed with investors, either through merchant bankers or banks.\nA specified credit rating of P2 of CRISIL or its equivalent is to be obtained from credit rating agencies.\n\nA commercial paper is issued as an unsecured promissory note or in a dematerialized form at a dis-\ncount. The discount is freely determined by market forces. The paper is usually priced between the lend-\ning rate of scheduled commercial banks and a representative money market rate.\n\nCorporates are allowed to issue CPs upto 100 per cent of their fund-based working capital limits. The\npaper attracts stamp duty. No prior approval of the Reserve Bank is needed to issue a CP and underwriting\nthe issue is not mandatory.\n\nMost CPs were issued by manufacturing companies for a maturity period of approximately three\nmonths or less. During 2001-02, manufacturing and related companies issued 67.4 per cent of total CPs,\nwhereas 21.5 per cent of the total was issued by leasing and finance companies and the balance of 11.1 per\ncent by financial institutions. However, the share of manufacturing companies in the aggregate amount of\nCPs outstanding declined to an average of 56 per cent during 2002-03 and further to 28.9 per cent during\n2008-09 and the share of leasing and finance companies markedly increased from 13 per cent in 2001-02\nto 76.5 per cent in March 2008 but declined to 61.5 per cent during 2008-09. The share of manufacturing\ncompanies has gone down substantially due to enhanced efficiency in their operations, longer internal\naccruals, and better cash management. Leasing and finance and manufacturing companies remain the\nmajor issuers of CPs.\n\nThe CP market is dominated by corporates having tangible net-worth of 250 crore and above. The recent\nRBI guidelines on investment in non-SLR securities for banks exempted CPs from the purview of such\nguidelines. This enabled financial institutions to raise a higher amount through CPs in 2004 and thereafter.\n\n",

The CP issue then has to\nbe rated by a credit rating agency. The rating is usually completed within two to three weeks of receipt of\nnecessary information. The company has to select an Issuing and Paying Agent (IPA), which has to be a\nscheduled bank. The IPA verifies all the documents submitted by the issuer viz., copy of board resolution,\nsignatures of authorized executant and then issues a certificate that documents are in order. It also ensures\nthat the issuer has the minimum credit rating as stipulated by the Reserve Bank and amount mobilized\nthrough issuance of the CP within the guarantee indicated by the credit rating agency for the specified rat-\nings. It has also to certify that it has a valid agreement with the issuer. All the certified copies of original\ndocuments verified by it are held in its custody.\n\nThe company then has to arrange for dealers such as merchant banks, brokers, and banks for placement\nof the CPs which has to be completed within two weeks of opening. Every CP issue has to be reported to\nthe Reserve Bank through the IPA.\n\nScheduled commercial banks are the major investors in commercial papers and their investment is\ndetermined by bank liquidity conditions. Banks prefer a commercial paper as an investment avenue\nrather than sanctioning bank loans. These loans involve high transaction costs and money is locked\nfor a long time period whereas in a commercial paper which is an attractive short-term instrument,\nallows banks to park funds during times of high liquidity. Some banks fund commercial papers by\nborrowing from the call money market. Usually, the call money market rates are lower than the com-\nmercial paper rates. Hence, banks book profits through arbitrage between the two money markets.\nMoreover, the issuance of commercial papers has been generally observed to be inversely related to\nthe money market rates.\n",

The outstanding amount of commercial papers increased considerably in the initial years. The\namount of commercial papers issued by corporates increased significantly from 8577 crore in March 1993\n\nto a peak of 23,264 crore in March 1994 accompanied by a decline in the average discount rate from 15.5\npercent to 11 per cent during 1993-94, But in 1994-95 and 1995-96, however, the outstanding amount of\nCPs declined sharply. This decline was attributed to the withdrawal of the stand-by facility of the paper in\nOctober 1994, coupled with rising interest rates and a shrinking of short-term surplus funds with banks.\n\nSince 1996-97, the commercial paper market has picked up as it can be accessed at rates lower than\nthe short-term PLRs of commercial banks; CPs have become an attractive source of working capital funds\nas their rates are less than the sub-prime lending rates. Hence, commercial papers prove to be cheaper for\ncorporates, The CP market has also become an attractive avenue for banks to park their credit funds. This\nmarket has been growing at a rate of 12-14 per cent, since 2000-01.\n\nThe outstanding amount of CPs as on March 31, 2017 was %3979.7 billion and the rate of interest\nbetween 5.99 to 13.33 percent.\n\nThe CP rates are dependent on ratings, a company\u2019s standing, and the demand-supply position of the\nmarket.\n\nCorporates with the highest rating (P1+, PR1+, Al+) who regularly access the CP market are BPCL,\nHPCL, IPCL, IOC, ACC, Telco, L&T, Tata Coffee, Dabur, 1L&FS, M&M Finance, GE Caps, EID Parry,\nElectrosteel Castings, and Ashok Leyland Ltd.\n\nNationalized banks invest in CPs as a primary market instrument. They prefer to invest in CPs only\nduring low credit off-take period.\n\nLeasing and finance companies were the predominant issuers of CPs partly reflecting the Reserve\nBank's policy of phasing out the access of these companies to public deposits.\n\nMutual funds have emerged as big investors as the SEBI regulations impose a ceiling of 10 per cent\nin investment in unlisted paper but CP investments are excluded. Hence, a large amount of money from\nmutual funds is flowing to CPs. As a result, interest rates dipped to a low of 6.33 per cent in February\n2005. The corporates get a direct and quick access to the institutional investors through issuance of CPs.\nIt is a cheaper option as compared to the customary bank credit route. Moreover, the decline in stamp\nduty has made CPs attractive.\n",

The reasons are as follows.\n\n1.\n\nEven though the minimum size of investment is %5 lakh, retail investors see little scope in invest-\ning their money.\n\n. CP issues involve administrative difficulties and complex procedural formalities which inhibit the\n\ngrowth of this market.\n\n. The non-bank institutional investors such as LIC, UTI, and GIC are not big buyers in this market\n\nbecause of a Reserve Bank directive limiting their short-term investments in the money market to\ntreasury bills and as majority of their investment is either in equities or other long-term investments.\n\n}. There is no active secondary market for CPs even though efforts have been made by the DFHI in\n\nthis direction.\n\n. The CP market has witnessed ups and downs. Corporates too find it hard to enter as there is nei-\n\nther an underwriting facility nor a roll-over facility in case of CPs.\n\n. Stamp duty levy make CPs less attractive than short-term credit for corporates.\n, Stamp duty has been reduced substantially by the central government but still disparity exists\n\nbetween stamp duty payable by banks and non-bank entities. Banks as investors pay only one-fifth\nof what non-bank entities pay for subscribing to a CP. This distortion in the stamp duty rates has\nforced non-bank entities to buy the paper in the secondary market through banks to save on stamp\nduty. The stamp duty applicable to non-bank entities should be on par with banks. Moreover, the\nstamp duty structure inhibits a reduction in the minimum maturity period of CP.\n\n8. The minimum maturity period of 7 days inhibits the growth of the CP market. In developed coun-\ntries such as USA and France, CPs are issued with an overnight maturity. This is possible because\nthere is no stamp duty on CP and settlement of CP takes place on the same day (i.e., at T+0 basis).\nIn India, the minimum maturity period can be reduced only when stamp duty is abolished and a\nfull-fledged real time gross settlement (RTGS) system is in place.\n\n9. The big corporates in the last few years could borrow money at base rates from banks which were\ncost-effective as compared to commercial paper rates. Moreover, corporates also generated a sub-\nstantial amount of internal funds to meet their credit demand which reduced the need to issue CPs.\n",

According to the Indian\nNegotiable Instruments Act, 1881, a bill of exchange is a written instrument containing an unconditional\norder, signed by the maker, directing to pay a certain amount of money only to a particular person, or to\nthe bearer of the instrument. Bills of exchange are negotiable instruments drawn by the seller (drawer) on\nthe buyer (drawee) for the value of the goods delivered to him. Such bills are called trade bills. When trade\nbills are accepted by commercial banks, they are called commercial bills. The bank discounts this bill by\nkeeping a certain margin and credits the proceeds. Banks, when in need of money, can also get such bills\nrediscounted by financial institutions such as LIC, UTI, GIC, ICICI, and IRBI. The maturity period of the\nbills varies from 30 days, 60 days, or 90 days, depending on the credit extended in the industry.\n\nCommercial bills were introduced in the money market in 1970.

A\ndemand bill is payable on demand, i.e., immediately at sight or on presentation to the drawee. A usance\nbill is payable after a specified time. If the seller wishes to give some time for payment, the bill would be\npayable at a future date. These bills can either be clean bills or documentary bills. In a clean bill, docu-\nments are enclosed and delivered against acceptance by the drawee, after which it becomes clear. In the\ncase of a documentary bill, documents are delivered against payment accepted by the drawee and docu-\nments of the file are held by bankers till the bill is paid.\n\nCommercial bills can be inland bills or foreign bills. Inland bills must (a) be drawn or made in India\nand must be payable in India; or (b) drawn upon any person resident in India. Foreign bills, on the other\nhand, are (a) drawn outside India and may be payable in and by a party outside India, or may be payable\nin India or drawn on a party in India; or (b) it may be drawn in India and made payable outside India. A\nrelated classification of bills is export bills and import bills. While export bills are drawn by exporters in\nany country outside India, import bills are drawn on importers in India by exporters abroad.\n\nThe indigenous variety of bill of exchange for financing the movement of agricultural produce, called\na \u2018hundi,\u2019 has a long tradition of use in India. It is in vogue among indigenous bankers for raising money\nor remitting funds or to finance inland trade. A hundi is an important instrument in India; so indigenous\nbankers dominate the bill market. However, with reforms in the financial system and lack of availability\nof funds from private sources, the role of indigenous bankers is declining.\n\nWith a view to eliminating movement of papers and facilitating multiple rediscounting, the RBI intro-\nduced an innovative instrument known as \u2018Derivative Usance Promissory Notes,\u2019 backed by such eligible\ncommercial bills for required amounts and usance period (up to 90 days). The government has exempted\nstamp duty on derivative usance promissory notes. This has simplified and streamlined bill rediscounting\nby institutions and made the commercial bill an active instrument in the secondary money market. This\ninstrument, being a negotiable instrument issued by banks, is a sound investment for rediscounting insti-\ntutions, Moreover, rediscounting institutions can further discount the bills anytime prior to the date of\nmaturity. Since some banks were using the facility of rediscounting commercial bills and derivative\nusance promissory notes for as short a period as one day, the Reserve Bank restricted such rediscounting\nto a minimum period of 15 days. The eligibility criteria prescribed by the Reserve Bank for rediscounting\ncommercial bills are that the bill should arise out of a genuine commercial transaction showing evidence\nsale of goods and the maturity date of the bill should not exceed 90 days from the date of rediscounting.\n\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Size of the Commercial Bills Market\n\nThe size of the commercial bills market is reflected in the outstanding amount of commercial bills dis-\ncounted by banks with various financial institutions.\n\nThe activity in the bills rediscounting market remained subdued and came down from %4,612 crore\nin 1991-92 to 2906 crore at the end of March 2002. This depicts the small size and volume of the bills\nrediscounting market. Even though the number of participants has been increased by the Reserve Bank,\nthe volume of activity is quite low.\n\nThe total monthly average amount of bills rediscounted by commercial banks with non-bank financial\ninstitutions worked out to 71,131 crore during 2001-02, with the Small Industries Development Bank of\nIndia (SIDBI) accounting for the major share of 63.7 per cent.\n\nThere was a substantial decline in the market for bills rediscounting in the year 2002-03. The SIDBI is\na major participant in this market as it accounts for 75 per cent of the total transactions in this market. A\nrise in the rediscounting activity of the SIDBI led to an increase in the volumes of this market in 2003-04.\n\nBanks prefer discounting inland bills and purchasing foreign bills. The share of bill finance in the total\nbank credit increased from 1993-94 to 1995-96 but declined subsequently. This reflects the underdevel-\noped state of the bills market. The reasons for the underdevelopment are as follows.\n\n+ The Reserve Bank made an attempt to promote the development of the bill market by rediscounting\nfacilities with itself till 1974. Then, in the beginning of the 1980s, the availability of funds from the\nReserve Bank under the bill rediscounting scheme was put on a discretionary basis. It was altogether\nstopped in 1981. The popularity of the bill of exchange as a credit instrument depends upon the avail-\nability of acceptance sources of the central bank as it is the ultimate source of cash in times of a shortage\nof funds. However, it is not so in India. The Reserve Bank set up the DFHI to deal in this instrument and\nextends refinance facility to it. Even then, the business in commercial bills has declined drastically as\nthe DFHI concentrates more on other money market instruments such as call money and treasury bills.\nIt is mostly foreign trade that is financed through the bills market. The size of this market is small\nbecause the share of foreign trade in national income is small. Moreover, export and import bills are\nstill drawn in foreign currency which has restricted their scope of negotiation.\n+ A large part of the bills discounted by banks are not genuine. They are bills created by converting\nthe cash-credit/overdraft accounts of their customers.\n* The system of cash-credit and overdraft from banks is cheaper and more convenient than bill\nfinancing as the procedures for discounting and rediscounting are complex and time consuming.\n\n+ This market was highly misused in the early 1990s by banks and finance companies which\nrefinanced it at times when it could not be refinanced. This led to channelizing of money into\nundesirable uses.\n\nThe Reserve Bank issued new guidelines to banks on January 24, 2003 regarding purchasing/dis-\ncounting/negotiating/rediscounting of genuine commercial/trade bills. The important features of the\nrevised guidelines are as follows.\n\n+ Banks are presently required to open letters of credit (LCs) and purchase/discount/negotiate bills\nunder LCs only in respect of genuine commercial and trade transactions of their borrower constitu-\nents who have been sanctioned regular credit facilities by them. Accommodation bills should not be\npurchased/discounted/negotiated by banks.\n\nThe practice of drawing bills of exchange claused \u2018without recourse\u2019 and issuing letters of credit\nbearing the legend without recourse should be discouraged because such notations deprive\nthe negotiating bank of the right of recourse it has against the drawer under the Negotiable\nInstruments Act.\n\nBills rediscounting should be restricted to usance bills held by other banks. Banks should not redis-\ncount bills earlier discounted by non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) except in respect of\nbills arising from sale of light commercial vehicles and two/three wheelers.\n\nWhile discounting bills of the services sector, banks should ensure that actual services are rendered and\naccommodation bills are not discounted. Service sector bills should not be eligible for rediscounting.\n\nBanks should not enter into repo transactions using bills discounted/rediscounted as collateral.\n",

Financial institutions\nwere permitted to issue certificates of deposit within the umbrella limit fixed by the Reserve Bank in 1992.\n\nCertificates of deposit are time deposits of specific maturity similar to fixed deposits (FDs). The big-\ngest difference between the two is that CDs, being in bearer form, are transferable and tradable while FDs\nare not. Like other time deposits, CDs are subject to SLR and CRR requirements. There is no ceiling on\nthe amount to be raised by banks. The deposits attract stamp duty as applicable to negotiable instruments.\nThey can be issued to individuals, corporations, companies, trusts, funds, associates, and others.\n\nNRIs can subscribe to the Deposits on a Non-repatriable Basis.\n\nCDs are issued by banks during periods of tight liquidity, at relatively high interest rates. They\nrepresent a high cost liability. Banks resort to this source when the deposit growth is sluggish but credit\ndemand is high.

Since these deposits were subject to reserve requirements,\na bank-wise limit on their issue of CDs was prescribed. With time, the bank-wise limits were raised. From\nOctober 16, 1993, these limits were abolished. In April 1993, scheduled commercial banks were permit-\nted to raise CDs without any ceiling on the interest rate. This not only enabled banks to raise resources\nat competitive rates of interest but also enabled CDs to emerge as a market-determined instrument.\nThe deposits serve as relationship instruments, issued by banks on a discretionary basis to high net worth\nclients.\n\nIn 1992, six financial institutions\u2014IDBI, IFCI, ICICI, SIDBI, IRBI, and EXIM Bank\u2014were permit-\nted to issue CDs. These institutions could issue CDs with a maturity of more than one year and upto three\nyears for an aggregate amount of \u00a32,500 crore.\n\nEffective from May 3, 1997, an umbrella limit for the mobilization of resources by way of term\nmoney borrowings, CDs, term deposits, and inter-corporate deposits was prescribed for three finan-\n\ncial institutions\u2014IDBI, ICICI, and IFCI\u2014supplanting the instrument-wise limits stipulated earlier.\nThe overall ceiling for the umbrella limit was set equal to the net owned funds of the financial insti-\ntutions. A similar umbrella limit was also prescribed for EXIM Bank and SIDBI in June and August\n1997, respectively.\n\nCDs are issued by commercial banks on a discount to face value basis; the CDs of development finan-\ncial institutions can be coupon bearing. The discount rate of a CD is market-determined. Coupon rates on\nthe deposits issued by banks and financial institutions are published by the Reserve Bank on a fortnightly\nas well as monthly basis.\n\nIn 2000-01, the minimum maturity of a CD was reduced to 15 days to bring them at par with other\nshort-term instruments like commercial papers and term deposits.\n\nWith a view to broadening the CD market, the minimum size of an issue was gradually scaled down\nfrom 25 lakh to @1 lakh in June 2002. From June 30, 2002, banks and financial institutions were required\nto issue CDs only in the dematerialized form.\n\nBanks/Fls are also allowed to issue CDs on a floating rate provided the methodology of compiling\nthe floating rate is objective, transparent and market-based. The issuing bank/FI is free to determine\nthe discount/corporate. The interest rate on floating rate CDs is reset periodically in accordance with a\npre-determined formula that indicates the spread over a transparent benchmark.\n\nBanks/Fls cannot issue loans against CDs.

Introduction Certificate of Deposit (CD) is a negotiable money market instrument and issued in\ndematerialized form or as a Usance Promissory Note against funds deposited at a bank or other eligible\nfinancial institution for a specified time period.\n\n2. Eligibility CDs can be issued by (i) scheduled commercial banks (excluding regional rural banks and\nlocal area banks); and (ii) selected All-India Financial Institutions (FIs) that have been permitted by RBI\nto raise short-term resources within the umbrella limit fixed by RBI.\n\n3. Aggregate Amount\n3.1 Banks have the freedom to issue CDs depending on their funding requirements.\n3.2. Financial Institutions can issue CDs within the overall umbrella limit prescribed in the master\ncircular/direction on resource raising norms for Fls, issued by Department of Banking Regula-\ntion, Reserve Bank of India and updated from time-to-time.\n\n4, Minimum Size of Issue and Denominations Minimum amount of a CD should be @1 lakh, i.e., the\nminimum deposit that could be accepted from a single subscriber should not be less than %1 lakh, and in\nmultiples of @1 lakh thereafter.\n\n5. Investors CDs can be issued to individuals, corporations, companies (including banks and PDs),\ntrusts, funds, associations, etc. Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) may also subscribe to CDs, but only on\nnon-repatriable basis, which should be clearly stated on the Certificate. Such CDs cannot be endorsed to\nanother NRI in the secondary market.\n\n6. Maturity\n6.1 The maturity period of CDs issued by banks should not be less than 7 days and not more than\n\u2018one year, from the date of issue.\n6.2 Fis can issue CDs for a period not less than | year and not exceeding 3 years from the date of\nissue.\n\n7. Discount/Coupon Rate CDs may be issued at a discount on face value. Banks/Fls are also allowed\nto issue CDs on floating rate basis provided the methodology of compiling the floating rate is objective,\ntransparent and market-based. The issuing bank/FI is free to determine the discount/coupon rate. The\ninterest rate on floating rate CDs would have to be reset periodically in accordance with a pre-determined\nformula that indicates the spread over a transparent benchmark. The investor should be clearly informed\nof the same.\n\n8. Reserve Requirements Banks have to maintain appropriate reserve requirements, i.c., Cash Reserve\nRatio (CRR) and Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR), on the issue price of the CDs.\n\n9. Transferability CDs in physical form are freely transferable by endorsement and delivery. CDs in\ndemat form can be transferred as per the procedure applicable to other demat securities. There is no lock-\nin period for the CDs.\n\n10. Trades in CDs\n(a) All OTC trades in CP shall be reported within 15 minutes of the trade to the Financial Market\nTrade Reporting and Confirmation Platform (\u201cF-TRAC\u201d) of Clearcorp Dealing System (India)\nLtd. (CDSL).\n(b) The requirement of exchange of physical confirmation of trades matched on F-TRAC is waived\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\n(i) Participants entering into one time bilateral agreement for eliminating the exchange of con-\nfirmation or multilateral agreement drafted by the Fixed Income Money Market and Deriva-\ntives Association (\u201cFIMMDA\u201d) ;\n\nParticipants adhering to the extant laws such as stamp duty as may be applicable; and\n\n(iii) Participants ensuring adherence to a sound risk management framework and complying\nwith all the regulatory and legal requirements and practices, in this regard.\n\n(c) The list of entities, which have signed the multilateral agreement, will be published by FIMMDA\nand the Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL) on their websites.\n\n11. Settlement All OTC trades in CDs shall necessarily be cleared and settled under DVP I mechanism\nthrough the authorised clearing houses [National Securities Clearing Corporation Limited (NSCCL),\nIndian Clearing Corporation Limited (ICCL) and MCX Stock Exchange Clearing Corporation Limited\n(CCL)] of the stock exchanges.\n\n12. Loans/Buy-backs Banks/Fls cannot grant loans against CDs. Furthermore, they cannot buy-back\ntheir own CDs before maturity. However, the RBI may relax these restrictions for temporary periods\nthrough a separate notification.\n\n13. Format of CDs _Banks/Fls should issue CDs only in dematerialized form. However, according to\nthe Depositories Act, 1996, investors have the option to seek certificate in physical form. Accordingly, if\nan investor insists on physical certificate, the bank/FI may inform the Chief General Manager, Financial\nMarkets Regulation Department, Reserve Bank of India, Central Office, Fort, Mumbai - 400 001 about\nsuch instances separately, Further, issuance of CDs will attract stamp duty. There will be no grace period\nfor repayment of CDs. If the maturity date happens to be a holiday, the issuing bank/FI should make\npayment on the immediate preceding working day. Banks/Fls, therefore, should fix the period of deposit\nin such a manner that the maturity date does not coincide with a holiday to avoid loss of discount/interest\nrate.\n\n14. Security Aspect Since CDs in physical form are freely transferable by endorsement and delivery, it\nwill be necessary for banks/Fls to sce that the certificates are printed on good quality security paper and\nnecessary precautions are taken to guard against tampering with the document. They should be signed by\ntwo or more authorized signatories.\n\n15. Payment of Certificate\n\n15.1 Since CDs are transferable, the physical certificates may be presented for payment by the last\nholder. The question of liability on account of any defect in the chain of endorsements may\narise. It is, therefore, desirable that banks take necessary precautions and make payment only\nby a crossed cheque. Those who deal in these CDs may also be suitably cautioned.\n\n15.2 The holders of dematted CDs will approach their respective Depository Participants (DPs) and\ngive transfer/delivery instructions to transfer the security represented by the specific Interna-\ntional Securities Identification Number (ISIN) to the \u2018CD Redemption Account\u2019 maintained by\nthe issuer. The holders should also communicate to the issuer by a letter/fax enclosing the copy\nof the delivery instruction they had given to their respective DP and intimate the place at which\nthe payment is requested to facilitate prompt payment. Upon receipt of the demat credit of CDs\nin the \u201cCD Redemption Account\u201d, the issuer, on maturity date, would arrange to repay to hold-\ners / transferors by way of banker\u2019s cheque/high-value cheque, etc.\n\n16. Issue of Duplicate Certificates\n\n16.1 In case of loss of physical certificates, duplicate certificates can be issued after compliance with\nthe following:\n(a) Notice is required to be given in at least one local newspaper;\n(b) Lapse of a reasonable period (say 15 days) from the date of the notice in the newspaper; and\n(c) Execution of an indemnity bond by the investor to the satisfaction of the issuer of CDs.\n\n16.2 The duplicate certificate should be issued only in physical form. No fresh stamping is required\nas a duplicate certificate is issued against the original lost CD. The duplicate CD should clearly\nstate that the CD is a duplicate one stating the original value date, due date, and the date of issue\n(as \u201cDuplicate issued on \u201d).\n",

Stringent conditions in the\nmoney market and firm call money rates rekindled the interest of banks in CDs in 1994-95 to 1997-98.\n\nSince 1998-99, the banks\u2019 reliance on the relatively high-cost CDs declined due to downward trend in\nthe rates of other money market instruments and strong growth in bank deposits coupled with a deceleration\nin non-food bank credit. Moreover, interest rate deregulation in term deposits and reduction in the maturity\nperiod to 15 days facilitated better management of liabilities by banks and reduced their need to issue CDs.\n\nHowever, there was a surge in CD issues in 2003-04 on account of reduction in the stamp duty on CDs,\nwithdrawal of the facility of premature closure of deposits in respect of CDs and exemption of invest-\nments in CDs by banks from the instructions on non-SLR investments below one year. These develop-\nments led to greater demand for investment in CDs by mutual funds.\n\nSince 2004-05, the demand for investment in CDs was further pushed by private sector banks as they are\ncost attractive vis-a-vis fixed deposits. Moreover, as compared to fixed deposits, CDs do not carry prepayment\nor premature closure and tax deducted at source (TDS). Also, the reduction in the minimum maturity period\nfrom 15 days to 7 days made CDs an attractive investment avenue for both private sector banks and mutual\nfunds. The outstanding CDs constituted 4.8 per cent of the aggregate deposits of issuing banks as at end-March\n2008. The weighted average discount rate of CDs was 8.94 per cent at the end-March 2008, 9.31 per cent\nat the end-March 2009 and 11.13 percent in 2011-12. During 2011-12, the spike was due to tight liquidity\nconditions in the money market and the reluctance of mutual funds to rollover back CDs after asset manage-\nment companies (AMCs) were made accountable for fair valuation on mark-to-market basis.\n",

With banks offering\nhigher interest rates on these deposits, investors find it profitable to hold them till maturity.\n\n+ The reliance of financial institutions on CDs has decreased.

                        "extracted-text": "Why Call Money\n\nCall money is required mostly by banks. Commercial banks borrow money without collateral from other\nbanks to maintain a minimum cash balance known as the cash reserve requirement (CRR). This inter-\nbank borrowing has led to the development of the call money market.\n\nCRR is an important requirement to be met by all commercial banks. The Reserve Bank stipulates\nthis requirement from time to time. CRR is a technique for monetary control effected by the Reserve\nBank for achieving specific macro-economic objective/s such as maintaining desired levels of inflation,\ngrowth, and exchange rates. CRR refers to the cash that banks have to maintain with the Reserve Bank\nas a certain percentage of their total demand and time liabilities (DTL). CRR, a primary instrument\nof monetary policy, has been brought down from 15 per cent in March 1991 to 5 per cent in January\n2009.\n\nPrior to May 2000, banks were required to maintain 85 per cent of their fortnightly reserve require-\nment on a daily basis. The networking among various branches of banks was not developed enough for the\nbranches to report their respective net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) positions to the main branch\non the first day of the fortnight itself. The NDTL of a bank is the sum of its liabilities to the banking sys-\ntem and its liabilities to the public.\n\nWith a view to providing further flexibility to banks and enabling them to choose an optimum strat-\negy of holding reserves depending upon their intra-period cash flows, several measures were under-\ntaken recently. In November 1999, a lagged reserve maintenance system was introduced under which\nbanks were allowed to maintain reserve requirements on the basis of the last Friday of the second\n(instead of the first) preceding fortnight. From May 6, 2000, the requirement of minimum 85 per cent\nof the CRR balance on the first 13 days to be maintained on a daily basis was reduced to 65 per cent.\nWith effect from August 11, 2000, this was reduced to 50 per cent for the first seven days of the report-\n\n\ning fortnight while maintaining the minimum 65 per cent for the remaining seven days including the\nreporting Friday. The daily minimum CRR was reduced to enable the smooth adjustment of liquidity\nbetween surplus and deficit segments and better cash management to avoid sudden increase in over-\nnight call rates.\n\nHence, once every fortnight on a reporting Friday, banks have to satisfy reserve requirements which\noften entails borrowing in the call/notice money market. It is a market in which banks trade positions to\nmaintain cash reserves. It is basically an over-the-counter (OTC) market without the intermediation of\nbrokers. Inter-bank trading accounts for more than 80 per cent of the total transactions.\n",

When call money rates are lower, many banks fund commercial papers by borrowing\nfrom the call money market and earn profits through arbitrage between money market segments.\n\nA large issue of government securities also affects call money rates. When banks subscribe to large\nissues of government securities, liquidity is sucked out from the banking system. This increases the\ndemand for funds in the call money market which pushes up call money rates. Similarly, a rise in the\nCRR or in the repo rate absorbs excess liquidity and call rates move up.\n\nThe call money market and the foreign exchange market are also closely linked as there exist arbitrage\nopportunities between the two markets. When call rates rise, banks borrow dollars from their overseas\nbranches, swap them for rupees, and lend them in the call money market. At the same time, they buy\ndollars forward in anticipation of their repayment liability. This pushes forward the premia on the rupee\u2014\ndollar exchange rate.

Liquidity conditions are governed by deposit mobilization, capital flows and reserve\nrequirements on the supply side, and tax outflows, government borrowings programme, non-food credit\noff-take, and seasonal fluctuations on the demand side. When easy liquidity conditions prevail, call rates\nmove around the Reserve Bank\u2019s repo rate. During times of tight liquidity, call rates tend to move up\ntowards the bank rate.\n\nReserve Requirement Prescriptions and Stipulations Regarding Average Reserve Maintenance\nA cut in the CRR reduces call rates while an increase in the CRR increases call rates. Moreover, banks\ndo not plan the demand for funds to meet their reserve requirements which increases call rate volatility.\nTill April 1997, inter-bank transactions were included in the reserve calculation. This led to a halt in the\nmoney market activity every second Friday (reserve calculation day) when banks tried to reduce their\nreserve requirement by eliminating inter-bank borrowing. Due to this, the overnight call rates fell to zero\nper cent every second Friday. This inhibited the development of liquid money market yield curve beyond\n13 days.\n\nStructural Factors Structural factors refer to issues like government legislation, conditions of the stock\nmarkets which affect the volatility of the call money rate.\n\nLiquidity Changes and Gaps in the Foreign Exchange Market Call rates increase during volatile\nforex market conditions. This increase is a result of monetary measures for tightening liquidity\nconditions and short position taken by market agents in domestic currency against long positions in\nUS dollars in anticipation of higher profits through depreciation of the rupee. Banks fund foreign\n\n\ncurrency positions by withdrawing from the inter-bank call money market which leads to a hike in the\ncall money rates.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Measures for Curbing High Volatility\n\n\u2018The Reserve Bank has tried to curb or prevent the call rate volatility through various measures.\n\nThrough Repos The Reserve Bank is a major player and it moderates liquidity and volatility in the\nmarket through repos and refinance operations and changes in the procedures for maintenance of the\nCRR. The Reserve Bank resumed repo auctions in November 1996 to provide a reasonable floor to call\nmoney rates as also a short-term avenue for banks to park their surplus funds. Reverse repos are also\nemployed to inject liquidity in the call market. The liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) was introduced\nfrom June 5, 2000 onwards to modulate short-term liquidity under varied financial market conditions and\nto impart stability to market conditions.\n\nFreeing of Inter-bank Liabilities from Reserve Requirements _ Inter-bank liabilities were freed from\nreserve requirements in April 1997. This was expected to help generate a smooth yield curve and reduce\nvolatility in the call rates which, till then, depicted a cyclical pattern with troughs on the reporting Fridays.\n\nCall money rates have been volatile in the last 10 years and they rose sharply in 1995 and 1996 due to\ntight money market conditions. The major factors behind the overall tight conditions of call/notice money\nmarket were as follows.\n\n+ The mismatch between assets and liabilities of commercial banks arising out of massive demand for\nnon-food bank credit as against sluggish growth of bank deposits.\n\n+ The Reserve Bank\u2019s intervention in the forex market to prevent the usual depreciation of rupee.\n\n+ The temporary withdrawal of the money market support to stabilize the forex market first.\n\nThe call money market remained orderly in the late-1990s with bouts of volatility, The call money rate\nmoved within a limited range as the Reserve Bank conducted a series of reverse repo auctions under the\nLAF and brought about a monetary casing in the form of bank rate and CRR cuts. In general, the movement\nwas confined to repo reverse repo corridor. The repo rate effectively sets the floor for call market movements.\n\nSize of the Call Money Market The annual and average daily call money turnover indicate the size\nof the call money market. The annual turnover in the call money increased substantially. The average\ndaily turnover in the call/notice money market rose sharply to 247,543 crore during April 2002 from\n%39,808 crore during March 2002. However, the average daily turnover declined to 222,852 crore during\nJanuary 2005. Primary dealers (PDs), whose demand is related to the volume of the government's market\nborrowing programme, emerged as the largest class of borrowers in the call/notice money market in\n2003-04.\nThere was an upward trend in the call money market turnover due to the following factors:\n\n* Increase in the breadth and depth of the market leading to an increase in the number of players,\nowing to institutional reform measures taken during the 1990s.\n\n+ Growth in the activity of primary dealers supported by refinance facility from the Reserve Bank and its\nactive operations in the market through repos which provided a floor for call rates and enhanced liquidity.\n\nThe call rates remained stable in 2003-04 and were below the reverse repo rate (earlier the repo\nrate). However, the call rates increased during October and November 2004 on account of higher non-\nfood credit off-take. Increase in reserve requirement and seasonal festival cash demand which above the\nbanks towards higher borrowings in the call money market. The call money rate was later stabilized by\nthe Reserve Bank by switching to the LAF repo operations to inject liquidity in the system. Call rates\nedged up during the year 2005-06 with the increase in the fixed reverse repo rate and liquidity pressure.\nAgain, call rates edged up during 2008-09 and 2011-12 due to tight liquidity conditions.\n\nThe average daily turnover in the call money market increased from %14,170 crore during 2004-05\nto 217,979 crore in 2005-06 but subsequently declined to 21,394 crore in 2007-08 and to %13,824 crore\nduring December 2009. More than 70 per cent of the activity shifted to Collateralized Borrowing and\nLending Obligation (CBLO) segment as the CBLO rakes are lower than call money rates and non-bank\nentities have been phased out of this market with effect from August 6, 2005. The share of the call money\nmarket in the total overnight market transactions declined from 51 per cent in April 2005 to 20 per cent in\nMarch 2009. But during 201 1-12, share of call money in total overnight money market volume increased\nwhile that of CBLO declined.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Term Money Market\n\nBeyond the call/notice money market is the term money market. This money market is one beyond the\novernight tenor, with a maturity ranging between three months to one year. In other words, a term money\nmarket is one where funds are traded upto a period of three to six months. The term money market in India\nis still not developed. The turnover in this market remained mostly below %200 crore in 2001-02. The\naverage daily turnover in the term money market rose by 52 per cent to %526 crore in 2004-05 from %341\ncrore in 2003-04. The volumes are quite small in this segment as there is little participation from large\nplayers and a term money yield curve is yet to develop. Banks do not want to take a view on term money\nrates as they feel comfortable with dealing only in the overnight money market. Foreign and private sector\nbanks are in deficit in respect of short-term resources; hence they depend heavily on the call/notice money\nmarket. The public sector banks are generally in surplus and they exhaust their exposure limit to them\nthereby constraining the growth of the term money market. Corporates prefer \u2018cash credit\u2019 rather than\n\u2018loan credit\u2019 which forces banks to deploy a large amount of resources in the call/notice money market\nrather than in the term money market to meet their demands.\n\nThe Reserve Bank has permitted select financial institutions such as IDBI, ICICI, IFCI, IIBI, SIDBI,\nEXIM Bank, NABARD, IDFC, and NHB to borrow from the term money market for three- to six-months\nmaturity. In April 1997, banks were exempted from the maintenance of the CRR and SLR on inter-\nbank liabilities to facilitate the development of the term money market. However, market participants are\nreluctant to increase their exposure in the term money market as the market is too shallow.\n\nAs stated earlier, the Reserve Bank has converted the call/notice money market into a pure inter-bank\nmarket. Hence, many non-bank entities who have been phased out of the call money market have shifted\ntheir focus to the term money market. Moreover, banks have been forced to reduce their exposure to the\n\n\u2018overnight call money market. These surplus funds of banks may shift to the term money market. Increased\nparticipation and sufficient liquidity could lead to the development of the term money market.\n\nFrom April 30, 2005, all NDS members are required to report their term money deals on the NDS\nplatform.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "COLLATERALIZED BORROWING AND LENDING OBLIGATION (CBLO)\n\nThe Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL) launched a new product\u2014Collateralized Borrowing\nand Lending Obligation (CBLO)\u2014on January 20, 2003 to provide liquidity to non-bank entities hit by\nrestrictions on access to the call money market. CBLO is a discounted instrument available in electronic\nbook entry form for the maturity period ranging from 1 day to 19 days. The maturity period can range up\nto one year as per the RBI guidelines. The CBLO is an obligation by the borrower to return the borrowed\nmoney, at a specified future date, and an authority to the lender to receive money lent, at a specified future\ndate with an option/privilege to transfer the authority to another person for value received. The eligible\nsecurities are central government securities including treasury bills with a residual maturity period of\nmore than six months. There are no restrictions on the minimum denimination as well as lock-in period\nfor its secondary market transactions.\n\nBanks, Cooperative Banks, Financial institutions, Insurance Companies, Mutual Funds, and Primary\nDealers who are members of negotiated dealing system (NDS) are allowed to participate in CBLO trans-\nactions. Non-members like corporates, NBFCs, pension/provident funds, and trusts are allowed to partici-\npate by obtaining associate membership to CBLO segment. Associate members are entities not eligible to\nmaintain current account and SGL account with the Reserve Bank. Members can access CBLO Dealing\nSystem through INFINET connectivity whereas associate members can access CBLO Dealing System\nthrough internet. CBLO Dealing System is an automated order driven, online anonymous matching sys-\ntem provided by Clear Corp Dealing System (CCDS) to enable members to borrow and lend funds against\nCBLO. It also disseminates online information regarding deals concluded, volumes, rates, etc., and such\nother notifications as relevant to CBLO market. Associate members are required to open a current account\nwith a settlement bank designated by CCIL for settlement of funds.\n\n\u2018There are two types of markets available for trading in CBLO: the normal market and the auction market.\n\u2018The normal market is a continuous market where members can borrow and lend on an ongoing basis. The buy\nand sell orders in this market get executed online in accordance with order matching principles of time and\nyield priority. Under normal market, there are two settlement cycles available to members, viz, T+0 and T+1.\nNormal market is available for all members including associate members. The normal market can be accessed\nfor borrowing funds to the extent of their available borrowing limit. Members can also sell CBLOs held by\nthem to meet their funds requirement instead of holding till maturity. Members intending to sell CBLOs (bor-\nrow funds) place their offers directly through order entry form on the CBLO system indicating the amount\nand rate for a specific CBLO. Likewise, members willing to buy CBLOs (lend funds) place their bids through\norder entry form specifying the amount and rate for a particular CBLO. The matching of bids and offers takes\nplace on Best Yield\u2014Time Priority basis. Under the auction market, members based on the borrowing limits\nfixed by CCIL, enter borrow requests to CCDS through CBLO system indicating clearly the amount, maturity,\nand the cap rate before commencement of the auction session, i.e. from 10:30 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. These bor-\nrow requests are then bid for during the auction session. These \u2018bids\u2019-order for lending funds and \u2018offers\u2019 order\nfor borrowing funds are through an auction screen which remains open for a limited time on working days.\nAssociate members are not allowed to borrow and lend funds in auction market. Auction market is available\nonly to NDS members for overnight borrowing and settlement on T+0 basis. Currently the minimum order lot\nfor auction market is fixed at %50 lakh and in multiples of %5 lakh thereof. The minimum order lot for normal\nmarket is fixed at %5 lakh and in multiples of 85 lakh thereof. Order lot refers to the minimum amount that is\nrequired to constitute a successful trade in the auction and normal market.\n\n\u2018As the repayment of borrowing under CBLO segment is guaranteed by CCIL, all CBLO members\nhave to maintain collateral or cash margin with the CCIL as cover. CCIL sets up borrowing limits for\nthe members against their deposits of government securities as collaterals. Collateral means the physical\nsecurity which is given as a guarantee from an acceptable bank and delivered to the CCIL for a value to\nthe extent prescribed by CCIL for participating in the transactions. These collaterals are subject to hair-\ncuts and revalued on a daily basis. Hair-cut is stipulated by CCIL to protect itself from potential losses\narising on account of decline in market value of security held as collateral. Any shortfall in the value of\ncollateral (to cover outstanding borrowings) is collected through the end of the day margin call.\n\nThe interest rates on the CBLOs mirror call money rates. The borrowing costs in the CBLOs are low\nas compared to the call market.\n\nMutual funds and insurance companies have emerged as the largest supplier of funds as they are flush\nwith liquidity. The cooperative banks, public and private sector banks, and primary dealers are large borrow-\ners in this market on account of favourable borrowing cost in the CBLO segment vis-a-vis the call market.\n\nThe average daily turnover in the CBLO market has gone up on account of fall in the CBLO rates.\nRates on CBLOs fall when there is a fall in overnight call money rates. When CBLO rates fall, forex deal-\ners borrow rupees from the CBLO market to buy dollars and simultaneously agree to sell it a day later.\nThe money is then invested in overnight dollar deposits with banks abroad which give a higher return.\n\nThe daily average turnover in the CBLO segment increased from %2,506 crore in March 2004 to a peak\nof %1,09,125 crore in March 2009. Volumes in CBLOs have increased tremendously due to the Reserve\nBank\u2019s move to bar non-bank entities from the call money market. From August 6, 2005, non-banks\n(except PDs) were completely phased out from the call money market.\n\nThe CBLO market emerged as the preferred overnight market in 2005-06 since it offers anonymity to market\nparticipants and provides funds at a lower cost. The interest rates averaged 5.20 per cent in the CBLO segment\nduring 2007-08 as compared with 6.07 per cent in the call money market and 5.5 per cent in market repos (out-\nside the LAF). It is now the predominant segment of the money market and accounted for nearly 80 per cent\nof the total volume during 2007-08. Enchanced transparency and real time basis of deals have attracted a large\nnumber of market participants to this segment. During 2011-12, the volumes in the CBLO segment declined as a\nnew operating procedure of policy instruments was introduced by the RBI and call money rate stabilized.\n\nIn order to increase the depth and liquidity in the CBLO market, CCIL is planning to introduce an\ninternet-based trading platform for its CBLO product which would provide access to corporates and other\nnon-banking entities to the institutional lending and borrowing segment of money markets.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "LINK BETWEEN THE MONEY MARKET AND THE\nMONETARY POLICY IN INDIA\n\n\u2018The monetary policy represents policies, objectives, and instruments directed towards regulating money supply\nand the cost and availability of credit in the economy. In the monetary policy framework, broad objectives are\nprescribed and an operating framework of policy instruments to achieve them is prepared. The monetary policy\nin India is an adjunct of the economic policy. The objectives of the monetary policy are not different from those\nof the economic policy. The three major objectives of economic policy in India have been growth, price stabil-\nity, and social justice. The emphasis between the first two objectives has changed from year to year, depending\nupon the conditions prevailing in that year and the previous year. The objectives of the monetary policy are\nalso price stability and growth. The government of India tries to manipulate its monetary policy through the\nReserve Bank, the monetary authority in India. The objectives of the monetary policy are pursued by ensur-\ning credit availability with stabilit the external value of the rupee as well as an overall financial stability.\nMonetary policy actions are transmitted to the rest of the economy through changes in financial prices (e.g.,\ninterest rates, exchange rates, yields, asset prices, equity prices) and financial quantities (money supply, credit\naggregates, supply of government bonds, foreign denominated bonds). Worldwide, the interest rate channel is\nthe key channel of transmission. There is an intrinsic link between monetary policy and money market. It is\nthrough the money market that monetary policy affects the real economy.\n\nThe Reserve Bank seeks to influence monetary conditions through management of liquidity by operating\nin varied instruments. These instruments can be categorized as direct and indirect market-based instruments.\n\nIn an administered or controlled regime of money and financial markets, the Reserve Bank directly\ninfluences the cost, availability, and direction of funds through direct instruments. The management of\nliquidity is essentially through direct instruments such as varying cash reserve requirements, limits on\nrefinance, administered interest rates, and qualitative and quantitative restrictions on credit.\n\nSince 1991, the market environment has been deregulated and liberalized wherein the interest rates are largely\ndetermined by market forces. In such an environment, the Reserve Bank influences monetary conditions through\nmarket-based, indirect instruments such as open market operations and refinance (standing facilities) / discount\n(market-based discount windows)/repo windows. For example, if the Reserve bank desires to inject liquidity for\na short period, it could resort to repos-providing funds to the banks in exchange of securities at a predetermined\ninterest rate and reversing the transactions at a predetermined time. Similarly, if the Reserve Bank wants to\ninfluence liquidity on an enduring basis, it could resort to open market operations, involving outright purchase\n(or sale) of securities. The other indirect instruments such as standing facilities and market-based discount win-\ndow are used (operated) by the Reserve Bank at the discretion of market participants generally banks. Stand-\ning facilities provide limited liquidity to eligible market participants and market-based discount window makes\navailable reserves either through direct lending or through rediscounting or purchase of financial assets held by\nbanks.\n\n\nThe success of market-based indirect instruments depends upon the existence of a vibrant, liquid, and\nefficient money market that is well integrated with the other segments of financial markets such as govern-\nment securities market and foreign exchange market. The effectiveness of the monetary policy depends on\nthe market and institutional framework available for transmitting monetary policy impulses.\n\nThe financial sector in India is still in a state of transition because of ongoing reforms. However, a\ngrowing integration among the different segments of the financial markets has been witnessed. Still, the\nmarkets do not have adequate depth and liquidity\u2014a major constraint in the conduct of the monetary\npolicy. The Reserve Bank, therefore, still relies on the cash reserve ratio as an operating instrument. The\nbank activated the bank rate in 1997 as a reference rate and as a signaling device to reflect the stand point\nof the monetary policy. The interest rates on different types of accommodation from the Reserve Bank\nincluding refinance are linked to the bank rate. The announcement impact of bank rate changes has been\nmanifested in the prime lending rates (PLRs) of commercial banks.\n\n\u2018The Reserve Bank also set up a framework of the interim liquidity adjustment facility (ILAF) which helped\nin injecting liquidity through the collateralized lending facility (CLF) to banks, export credit refinance to banks,\nand liquidity support to primary dealers. All these facilities were formula-based and depended on the bank rate.\nThe ILAF was gradually converted into a full-fledged LAF. The liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) has evolved\nas an effective mechanism for absorbing and/or injecting liquidity on a day-to-day basis in a more flexible manner.\n\nWith the evolution of a regime of market-determined interest rates in the 1990s, new transmission chan-\nnels opened up. Indirect monetary control instruments gained importance. Open market operations and\nrepos operations emerged for the first time as instruments of monetary control. These operations have been\nincreasingly used to bring about a contraction of liquidity in the system and neutralize the expansion impact\nof capital inflows. Repo rates, apart from reflecting liquidity conditions, provide a floor for overnight call\nmoney rate. In the event of tight liquidity conditions, the Reserve Bank's liquidity support to primary dealers\nenables it to directly intervene in the market, thereby moderating pressures on the overall call money rates.\nLAF has also facilitated bringing down the CRR of banks without endangering liquidity pressure.\n\nFixed rate repos were introduced by the Reserve Bank to absorb liquidity. They were supplemented\nby open market operations in government dated securities and treasury bills. Both the LAF and the OMO\nwere effectively used by the Reserve Bank to manage liquidity till 2003-04. Owing to large inflow of dol-\nlars and high liquidity in the system, the stock of government securities available with the Reserve Bank\ndeclined and the burden of sterilization increasingly fell on the LAF operations. In order to absorb liquid-\nity of enduring nature, the Reserve Bank operated a new scheme Market Stabilization Scheme (MSS).\nThis scheme has provided further flexibility to the Reserve Bank in its market operations.\n\nThus, the Reserve Bank uses multiple instruments to ensure that appropriate liquidity is maintained in\nthe system.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "TOOLS FOR MANAGING LIQUIDITY IN THE MONEY MARKET\nReserve Requirements\n\nReserve requirements are of two types: (i) cash reserve requirements (CRR) and (ii) statutory liquid-\nity ratio (SLR). They are techniques of monetary control used by the Reserve Bank to achieve specific\nmacro-economic objectives. CRR refers to the cash that banks have to maintain with the Reserve Bank as\na certain percentage of their total demand and time liabilities (DTL) while SLR refers to the mandatory\ninvestment that banks have to make in government securities. CRR refers to the level of reserves banks\nneed to hold against their liabilities while SLR refers to liquid assets that banks have to hold.\n\nThe statute governing the CRR under section 42(1) of the Reserve Bank of India Act requires every bank in the\nsecond schedule to maintain an average daily balance with the Reserve Bank of India, the amount of which shall\nnot be less than 3 per cent of the total demand and time liabilities. CRR is an instrument to influence liquidity in\nthe system as and when required. SLR is the reserve that is set aside by the banks for investment in cash, gold, or\nunencumbered approved securities. It is mandatory under Section 24(2A) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, as\namended by the Banking Laws (Amendment) Act, 1983 for banks to maintain this reserve. The reserve is supposed\nto provide a buffer in case of a run on the bank. The CRR for non-scheduled banks and non-scheduled cooperative\nbanks is governed by provisions of Section 18 and 56, respectively, of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. These\nbanks have to maintain CRR equivalent to 3 per cent of their NDTL as on the last Friday of the preceding fortnight..\n\nThe CRR was brought down from 15 per cent in March 1991 to 4.75 per cent in October 2002 and to 4.5 per\ncent in April 2003, and subsequently raised to 7.00 per cent in August 2007, while the SLR was brought down\nfrom its peak of 38.5 per cent in April 1992 to 25 per cent on October 25, 1997. Thus, till the early 1990s, both the\nCRR and SLR were preempting around 63.5 per cent of the incremental deposits. Even though the SLR has been\nbrought down to 25 per cent, most banks currently hold a volume of government securities higher than required\n\n\nunder the SLR as the interest rate on government securities is increasingly market-determined. Commercial\nbanks\u2019 holdings of SLR securities were 27.8 of their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) at end-March 2008.\n\nThe CRR rate was hiked by 3 per cent between April 2007 and August 2008 to contain inflationary expec-\ntations and absorb excess liquidity. In order to ease the unprecedented liquidity crunch faced by banks due\nto the sub-prime mortgage crisis , the RBI cut the CRR by 250 basis points (2.5 per cent) with effect from\nOctober 11, 2008. This was the first time since June 2003 that the RBI reduced CRR. The RBI also allowed\nbanks to borrow short-term funds against their SLR bonds holding upto 1 per cent to infuse liquidity, thus\nbringing the SLR down to 24 per cent. On March 19, 2013 the CRR was brought down to 4 per cent of NDTL.\n\nThe daily minimum CRR was reduced from 85 per cent to 70 per cent of the average daily required reserves\nfor a reporting fortnight on all days of the fortnight to enable a smooth adjustment of liquidity between the\nsurplus and the deficit segment and better cash management to avoid a sudden increase in the overall call rates.\nBanks can maintain upto 70 per cent of reserve requirements towards the CRR during the reporting fortnight,\nprovided on the reporting Friday, they are able to square the CRR maintenance to 100 per cent. Banks report\ntheir net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) on alternate Fridays. A lag of one fortnight in the maintenance of\nstipulated CRR by banks has been introduced to enable banks to improve the cash management.\n\nA cut in the CRR increases the liquidity in the economy. It also means lower cost for the banks which\ntranslates into lower PLRs. It also sets a broad direction for interest rates in the future. Since October\n2001, the interest rate paid on eligible balances under the CRR was linked to the bank rate. From August\n11, 2001, the inter-bank term liabilities with an original maturity of 15 days and upto one year were\nexempted from the prescription of the minimum CRR requirement of 3 per cent.\n\nSection 3 of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 was amended in June 2006 and notified by the Gov-\nernment of India in March 2007. This amendment 's discretion to the Reserve Bank to decide the per-\ncentage of scheduled banks\u2019 demand and time liabilities as CRR without any ceiling or floor. From April\n1, 2007, the floor of 3 per cent and a ceiling of 20 per cent stipulated in case of CRR have been removed.\nAlso, the Reserve Bank is not required to make interest payment on CRR balances. The Banking Regula-\ntion Amendment Act, 2007 removed the floor rate of 25 per cent for SLR to be prescribed by the RBI and\nempowered it to determine the SLR eligible assets.\n\nThe Reserve Bank has announced that it would like to see the CRR level down to 3 per cent. The key constraint\nin reducing the CRRis the continuing high level of fiscal deficit which cannot be financed entirely by the market\nand, therefore, requires substantial support by the Reserve Bank.\n\nCRR is an inflexible instrument of monetary policy as it does not distinguish between banks having\nsurplus cash balances from those that are deficient. However, the CRR will continue to be used in both direc-\ntions for liquidity management in addition to other instruments.\n",

An administered interest rate structure was\nthe central feature of the Indian monetary and credit system during the 1980s. The rationale behind the admin-\nistered rate structure was to enable certain preferred or priority sectors to obtain funds at concessional rates\nof interest. This brought about an element of cross-subsidization resulting in higher lending rates for the non-\nconcessional commercial sector. The deposit rates also had to be maintained at a low level. This system became\ncomplex with the proliferation of sectors and segments to which concessional credit was to be provided.\n\nFollowing the recommendations of the Chakravarty Committee, set up in 1985, deposit rates were\nmade attractive to avoid financial repression associated with near zero real deposit rates. However, the\ninterest rate structure remained complicated. There were about 50 lending categories and a large number\nof stipulated interest rates depending on the loan size, usage, and type of borrowers.\n\nIn 1991, the Narasimham Committee recommended that concessional interest rates should not be a\nvehicle for subvention and there should be real interest rates. In view of this recommendation, interest rate\nreforms were undertaken in money, credit, and government securities market.\n\nSince the beginning of 1992-93, interest rates in the government securities market were progressively\nderegulated with the introduction of an auction system. The structure of interest rates for commercial\nbanks was simplified. The bank rate was reactivated in April 1997, linked with deposit rates (up to one\nyear maturity) initially. Since then it has become a signaling rate.\n\nMoreover, with a deregulation of interest rates, borrowings by the government since 1992 have been at\nmarket-related yields. Public sector undertakings and financial institutions which were largely dependent\non budgetary support for their resources, now resort to the market to raise their resource requirement.\n\nThus, with deregulation, the interest rate has emerged as a major instrument of resource allocation.\n",

It was expected to serve as the bench-\nmark rate for pricing of loan products by reflecting the actual cost of funds for banks and thereby bringing\ntransparency to lending rates. The BPLR system, however, fell short of its original objective of bringing\ntransparency to lending rates as banks started lending at rates below the BPLR known as the sub-BPLR\nsystem, however, fell short of its original objective of bringing transparency to lending rates as banks\nstarted lending at rates below the BPLR known as the sub-BPLR rates. The share of sub-BPLR lending\n(excluding export credit and small loans) of scheduled commercial banks was as high as 77 per cent in\nSeptember 2008, which dropped to 70 per cent during the quarter ended June 2010. As a result, it was dif-\nficult to assess the transmission of policy rates of the Reserve Bank to lending rates of banks. The Reserve\nBank constituted a Working Group (Chairman: Shri Deepak Mohanty) in the Annual Policy Statement of\n2009-10 to review the BPLR system and suggest changes to make credit pricing more transparent. The\nWorking Group submitted its Report in October 2009 and based on the recommendations of the Group and\nthe suggestions from various stakeholders, the Reserve Bank issued guidelines on the Base Rate system\nin April 2010. The system of Base Rate, that came into effect on July 1, 2010, replaced the BPLR system.\n\nUnder the new system, the actual lending rate charged to borrowers is the Base Rate plus borrower-\nspecific charges. The Base Rate is the minimum rate for all loans and banks are not permitted to resort to any\nlending below the Base Rate except some specified categories such as: (a) Differential Rate of Interest (DRI)\nadvances, (b) loans to banks\u2019 own employees, (c) loans to banks\u2019 depositors against their own deposits,\n(G) interest rate subvention given by government to agricultural loans and rupee export eredit, and (\u00a2) some\nspecific cases of restructured loans. The interest rates on small loans up to %2 lakh and rupee export credit\nhave been deregulated to increase the flow of credit to small borrowers and exporters at reasonable rates.\nWith these measures, the Reserve Bank achieved complete deregulation of interest rates relating to rupee\nlending by commercial banks. The Base Rate system has facilitated better pricing of loans, enhance trans-\nparency in lending rates and improve the assessment of the transmission of monetary policy.\n",

It should be ensured that the costs of\nproviding those services which are separately recovered by way of service charges do not form\npart of this component.\n\n(vi) Tenor premium: These costs arise from loan commitments with longer tenor. The change in\ntenor premium should not be borrower specific or loan class specific. In other words, the tenor\npremium will be uniform for all types of loans for a given residual tenor.\n\n(vii) Since MCLR will be a tenor linked benchmark, banks shall arrive at the MCLR of a particular\nmaturity by adding the corresponding tenor premium to the sum of Marginal cost of funds,\nNegative carry on account of CRR and Operating costs.\n\n(viii) Accordingly, banks shall publish the internal benchmark for the following maturities:\n\n(a) overnight MCLR,\n(b) one-month MCLR,\n(c) three-month MCLR,\n(d) six month MCLR,\n(ec) One year MCLR.\n\nIn addition to the above, banks have the option of publishing MCLR of any other longer maturity.\n\nb) Spread\n(i) Banks should have a Board approved policy delineating the components of spread charged to\na customer.

Banks will have the option\nto offer loans with reset dates linked either to the date of sanction of the loan/credit limits or to\nthe date of review of MCLR.\n\n(ii) The Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate (MCLR) prevailing on the day the loan is\nsanctioned will be applicable till the next reset date, irrespective of the changes in the bench-\nmark during the interim.\n\n(iii) The periodicity of reset shall be one year or lower. The exact periodicity of reset shall form part\nof the terms of the loan contract.\n\ng) Treatment of interest rates linked to Base Rate charged to existing borrowers\n(i) Existing loans and credit limits linked to the Base Rate may continue till repayment or renewal,\nas the case may be.\n(ii) Banks will continue to review and publish Base Rate as hitherto.\n(iii) Existing borrowers will also have the option to move to the Marginal Cost of Funds based\nLending Rate (MCLR) linked loan at mutually acceptable terms. However, this should not be\ntreated as a foreclosure of existing facility.\n",

It is also the rate charged by the central bank on advances on specified collateral to banks.\n\nThe bank rate is defined in Section 49 of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, as the standard rate at\nwhich the bank is prepared to buy or rediscount bills of exchange or other commercial papers eligible for\npurchase under this act.\n\nThe bank rate was revised only three times in the period between 1975-96. It was reactivated in April\n1997 with deposit rates (up to one year maturity) linked to it initially. With effect from April 16, 1997, the\nmaximum term deposit rate (up to one year) of scheduled commercial banks was set at 2 per cent below\nthe bank rate and all interest rates on advances from the Reserve Bank were linked to the bank rate. The\ndeposit rates were completely deregulated in October 1997; the other rates continued to be linked to the\nbank rate. From 1997, the bank rate emerged as a signaling rate to reflect the stance of the monetary policy.\n\n\u2018The interest rates on different types of accommodation from the Reserve Bank including refinance were\nlinked to the bank rate. The bank rate was the central bank\u2019s key rate signal, which banks used to price their\nloans. The impact of bank rate announcements was pronounced in the PLRs of commercial banks.\n\nThe bank rate was brought down from a high of 9.00 per cent in May 1998 to 6.5 per cent in October\n2001. The Reserve Bank cut the bank rate to 6.25 per cent in October 2002, its lowest level since 1973.\nThe bank rate was further brought down to 6.00 per cent in April 2003.\n\n\u2018The Bank Rate had remained unchanged at 6 per cent since April 2003. Since discounting/rediscounting\nof bills of exchange by the Reserve Bank has remained in disuse, the Bank Rate has not been active. Moreo-\nver, even for the conduct of monetary policy, monetary policy signalling was done through modulation in\nthe reverse repo rate and the repo rate under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) (till May 3, 2011) and\nthe policy repo rate under the revised operating procedure of monetary policy (from May 3, 2011 onwards).\n\nThe RBI revised the operating procedure of policy instruments and under it, the marginal standing\nfacility (MSF), instituted at 100 basis points above the policy repo rate, serves the purpose of the Bank\nRate. The Bank Rate is now aligned to the MSF rate from February 13, 2012. All penal interest rates\non shortfall in reserve requirements, which are specifically linked to the Bank Rate, also stand revised\naccordingly. The Bank Rate on May, 2017 was 6.5 percent.\n\nThe interest rate, as an instrument of monetary policy, is evolving. As interest rates in the economy\ncover credit, money, and securities markets, there should be linkages not only among these markets but\namong the rates as well. A low interest rate is the objective of the monetary policy. Low interest rates are\nsubject to stable inflationary expectations which, in turn, depend on price stability. There are many con-\nstraints which impede the lowering of interest rates, diminishing the effectiveness of this tool. The major\nconstraints are high intermediation costs of the banking system, large non-performing assets (NPAs) of\nthe banks, and the government's massive borrowing programme.\n",

The quantum and cost of the refinance facility provided\nto scheduled commercial banks depends upon the degree of liquidity in the banking system and the need\nfor ensuring credit flow to select sectors. Both the quantum and cost of the refinance facility reflect the\nstance of the monetary policy in response to market conditions. The Reserve Bank has directed certain\nsector-specific refinance facilities such as food credit, export credit, government securities, and discre-\ntionary standby refinance to scheduled banks. Currently, there are only two reference schemes: Export\nCredit refinance and Special Export credit refinance schemes avaibable to banks/PDs.\n\nExport Credit Refinance (ECR) Facility\n1.

Scheduled banks (excluding RRBs) have the option to access rupee refi-\nnance to the extent of the swap with RBI under a special export credit refinance facility. This Facility has\nbeen introduced on January 21, 2013.The salient features of the new swap facility are as under:\n\n(a) The swap facility is available to scheduled banks (excluding RRBs) from January 21, 2013 till June 28,\n2013 for fixed tenor of 3/6 months.

The limits would be\ncommunicated to eligible individual banks separately. The limits would be reviewed periodically\nbased on actual utilization and other relevant factors.\n\n(b) Under the swap arrangement, a bank can buy US Dollars, up to its eligible swap limit, from RBI and\nsimultaneously sell the same amount of US Dollar forward as per the term of the swap at the prevail-\ning market rates for swaps of similar tenor. At the end of the swap term, the bank will exchange with\nRBI the US Dollars against Rupee. Reserve Bank\u2019s decision regarding the pricing of the swap shall be\nfinal and no request for any modification/revision to the same would be entertained.\n\n(c) Banks desirous of availing the swap facility will have to furnish a declaration duly signed by their\nauthorized signatories that they have actually disbursed the eligible incremental PCFC during the\npreceding month (s).\n\n(d) The swap facility will be operationalized by the Financial Markets Department of the Bank at Mum-\nbai. Depending upon the prevailing market conditions, RBI would exercise the right to decide on the\nday of operation, number of banks that can avail of the facility on any particular day, the maximum\namount of swap that RBI would undertake with the banks on any particular day and the maximum\nquantum of swap that each bank can do on any particular day keeping in view the market conditions\nand other relevant factors.\n\n(e) Banks desirous of availing refinance under special export credit refinance facility may approach the\nRegional Office of the RBI at Fort, Mumbai with the required promissory note and a declaration indi-\ncating that they have availed the swap facility and the amount of refinance sought does not exceed the\namount of swap outstanding under the swap facility.\n\nMarginal Standing Facility-Scheme\u2014This facility is effective from May 9, 2011.\n\n1, Eligibility: All Scheduled Commercial Banks having Current Account and SGL Account with Reserve\nBank, Mumbai are eligible to participate in the MSF Scheme.\n\n2. Tenor and Amount: Under the facility, the eligible entities can avail overnight, up to one per cent of\ntheir respective Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL) outstanding at the end of the second preceding\nfortnight. But for the intervening holidays, the MSF facility will be for one day except on Fridays when\nthe facility will be for three days or more, maturing on the following working day. In the event, the banks\u2019\nSLR holdings fall below the statutory requirement up to one per cent of their NDTL, banks will not have\nthe obligation to seek a specific waiver for default in SLR compliance arising out of use of this facility in\nterms of notification issued under sub section (2A) of Section 24 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.\n\n3, Timing: The Facility is available on all working days in Mumbai, excluding Saturdays between 3.30 p.m.\nand 4.30 p.m.\n\n4, Rate of Interest:The rate of interest on amount availed under this facility is 100 basis points above the\nLAF repo rate, or as decided by the Reserve Bank from time to time.\n\n5, Discretion to Reserve Bank: The Reserve Bank reserves the right to accept or reject partially or fully, the\nrequest for funds under this facility.\n\n6. Mechanics of Operations:\n\n(i) The requests will be submitted electronically in the Negotiated Dealing System (NDS). Eligible\nmembers facing genuine system problem on any specific day, may submit physical requests in sealed\ncover in the box provided in the Mumbai Office, Reserve Bank of India, to the Manager, Reserve\nBank of India, Securities Section, Public Accounts Department (PAD), Mumbai.\n\n(ii) The NDS provides for submission of single or multiple applications by the member. However, as far\nas possible only one request should be submitted by an applicant.\n\n(iii) The MSF is conducted as \u2018Hold-in-Custody\u2019 repo, similar to LAF-Repo.\n\n(iv) On acceptance of MSF requests, the applicant's RC SGL Account will be debited by the required quan-\ntum of securities and credited to Bank\u2019s RC SGL Account. Accordingly, the applicant's current account\nwill be credited with the MSF application amount. The transactions will be reversed in the second leg. In\ncase the second leg falls on a holiday, the reversal date will be the next working day.\n\n(v) The MSF transactions between Reserve Bank and counter parties which would involve operation of the\nRC SGL Account would not require separate SGL forms.\n\n(vi) Pricing ofall securities including Treasury Bills will be at face value for MSF operations by Reserve Bank.\nAccrued interest as on the date of transaction will be ignored for the purpose of pricing of securities.\n\n7. Minimum Request Size: Requests will be received for a minimum amount of 21 crore and in multiples\nof 21 crore thereafter.\n\n8. Eligible Securities: MSF will be undertaken in all SLR-cligible transferable Government of India (Gol)\ndated Securities/Treasury Bills and State Development Loans (SDL).\n\n9. Margin Requirement: A margin of five per cent will be applied in respect of Gol dated securities and\nTreasury Bills. In respect of SDLs, a margin of 10 per cent will be applied. Thus, the amount of securities\noffered on acceptance of a request for \u00ae100 will be 2105 (face value) of Gol dated securities and Treasury Bills\nor 110 (face value) of SDLs.\n\n10. Settlement of Transactions: The settlement of all applications received under the MSF Scheme will take\nplace on the same day after the closure of the window for acceptance of applications.\n\n11. SLR and Securities held in Repo SGL Account: The extant instructions issued by the Department of\nBanking Operations and Development (DBOD) of the Reserve Bank will apply on the securities offered by\nscheduled commercial banks for MSF operations.\n\nThe Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) rate, determined with a spread of 100 basis points above the\nrepo rate, stands adjusted to 9.00 per cent with effect. from January 29, 2014.\n\nLiquidity Adjustment Facility The Narasimham Committee on Banking Sector Reforms (Report II,\n1998) recommended that the Reserve Bank provide support to the market through an LAF scheme. This\nfacility would help in the development of a short-term money market with adequate liquidity. As per the\ncommittee's recommendation, the Reserve Bank decided to introduce the LAF in phases.\n\nThe interim LAF, introduced in April 1999, provided a mechanism for liquidity management through\ncombination of repos, export credit refinance, supported by open market operations at set rates of inter-\nest. Banks could avail of a collateralized lending facility of up to 0.25 per cent of the fortnightly average\noutstanding aggregate deposits available for few weeks at the bank rate. Primary dealers were provided\nliquidity support against a collateral of government securities. These facilities were available subject to\nquantitative limits (formula-based) for a specific duration and at the bank rate. Additional limits could be\navailed by banks under the additional collateralized lending facility (ACLF) and by primary dealers at\n2 per cent points above the bank rate.\n\nThe interim LAF was gradually converted into a full-fledged LAF scheme. It was implemented in\nthree phases: in the first phase, the general refinance facility was replaced by the ACLF for banks and\nprimary dealers; in the second stage, CLF for banks and primary dealer was replaced by variable reverse\nrepo auctions; and in the final stage, with the operationalization of the real time gross settlement sysem_\n(RTGS), the LAF is operated at different timings of the same day if necessary.\n\nThe LAF was introduced from June 5, 2000 impart greater stability and facilitate the emergence of a\nshort-term rupee yield curve for pricing fixed income securities. The LAF is operated through repos and\nreverse repos. The LAF is a tool of day-to-day liquidity management through the injection or absorption\nof liquidity by way of sale or purchase of securities followed by their repurchase or resale under the repo/\nreverse repo operations. Repo/reverse repo auctions are conducted on a daily basis except on Saturdays. The\ntenor of repos is one day except on Fridays and days preceding holidays. Interest rates in respect of both\nrepos and reverse repos are decided through cut-off rates emerging from auctions conducted by the Reserve\nBank on a multiple price auction basis. The auction format for the LAF was changed from the uniform price\nauction method to the multiple price auction method to ensure more responsible bidding. Since February\n15, 2002, members of the NDS submit LAF bids in an electronic form instead of a physical form. In August\n2000, repo auctions of tenor ranging from three to seven days were introduced. In October 2003, repos for\na longer tenure of 28 days were also conducted for five consecutive days. The Reserve Bank also has the\noption of introducing long-term repos of up to 14 days as and when required and to switch over to fixed rate\nrepos on an overnight basis. The minimum bid size for the LAF was reduced from 210 crore to 25 crore to\nfacilitate the participation of small operators. LAF operations are conducted in the forenoon between 9.30\nam. and 10.30 a.m. Operations under the LAF require the availability of adequate stock of government\nsecurities with the Reserve Bank.\n\nThe Reserve Bank operationalized the second liquidity adjustment facility (SLAF), in November 28,\n2005, to provide market participants a second window to adjust their liquidity requirements. The SLAF\nwas withdrawn with effect from August 6, 2007. It was reintroduced on reporting Fridays with effect from\nAugust 1, 2008, where in the bids for SLAF were received between 4:00 p.m and 4:30 p.m. and discon-\ntinued it on May 9, 2011 with the introduction of MSF.\n\nLAF helps the RBI to adjust the structure of interest rates (through fixed rate repos) in response to\nevolving market conditions and moderate sudden liquidity shocks. LAF has facilitated systematic move-\nment of interest rates in the overnight call markets which, in turn, help reduce the volatility in the govern-\nment securities market making gilt funds more attractive. It helps the market participants to overcome\nmismatches in supply and demand from time to time. As this facility is available to market participants at\ndifferent timings, it enables them to undertake their own liquidity management. Banks can also structure\ntheir interest rates on a floating rate basis. Further, they are not required to undertake the market risk\ninvolved in purchase of securities.\n\nThe LAF operations combined with the judicious use of open market operations have emerged as the\nprincipal operating instrument of the monetary policy.\n\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Repos\n\n\u2018The major function of the money market is to provide liquidity. To achieve this function and to even out liquid-\nity changes, the Reserve Bank uses repos. Repo is a useful money market instrument enabling the smooth\nadjustment of short-term liquidity among varied market participants such as banks and financial institutions.\n\nRepo refers to a transaction in which a participant acquires immediate funds by selling securities\nand simultaneously agrees to the repurchase of the same or similar securities after a specified time at\na specified price. In other words, it enables collateralized short-term borrowing and lending through\nsale/purchase operations in debt instruments. It is a temporary sale of debt involving full transfer of\nownership of the securities, ie., the assignment of voting and financial rights. Repo is also referred to as\naready forward transaction as it is a means of funding by selling a security held on a spot basis and repur-\nchasing the same on a forward basis.\n\nReverse repo is exactly the opposite of repo\u2014a party buys a security from another party with a com-\nmitment to sell it back to the latter at a specified time and price. In other words, while for one party the\ntransaction is repo, for another party it is reverse repo. A reverse repo is undertaken to earn additional\nincome on idle cash. In India, repo transactions are basically fund management/SLR management devices\nused by banks.\n\nThe difference between the price at which the securities are bought and sold is the lender's profit or\ninterest earned for lending the money. The transaction combines elements of both a securities purchase/\nsale operation and also a money market borrowing/lending operation. It signifies lending on a collateral\nbasis. It is also a good hedge tool because the repurchase price is locked in at the time of the sale itself.\nThe terms of contract is in terms of a \u2018repo rate,\u2019 representing the money market borrowing/lending rate.\nRepo rate is the annual interest rate for the funds transferred by the lender to the borrower. The repo rate is\nusually lower than that offered on unsecured inter-bank rate as it is fully collateralized. The factors which\naffect the repo rate are the creditworthiness of the borrower, liquidity of the collateral, and comparable\nrates of other money market instruments.\n\nImportance of Repos Repos are safer than pure call/notice/term money and inter-corporate deposit\nmarkets which are non-collateralized; repos are backed by securities and are fully collateralized.\nOwnership titles of eligible securities is immediately transferred. Thus, the counter party risks are\nminimum. Since repos are market-based instruments, they can be utilized by central banks as an\nindirect instrument of monetary control for absorbing or injecting short-term liquidity. Repos help\nmaintain an equilibrium between demand and supply of short-term funds. The repos market serves as\nan equilibrium between the money market and securities market and provides liquidity and depth to\nboth the markets. By promoting greater integration between the money market and the government\nsecurities market, it helps in developing a short-term yield curve. It is a widely used instrument by\ncentral governments to adjust market liquidity. Monetary authorities can transmit policy signals\nthrough repos to the money market which has a significant influence on the government securities\nmarket and foreign exchange market. Hence, internationally, it is a versatile and the most popular\nmoney market instrument, In India too, it was a rapidly developing and thriving market until the\nscam of 1992-93, where this facility was grossly misused.\n\nTypes of Repos Two types of repos are currently in operation\u2014market repos and RBI repos.\n\n1, Market repos: The Reserve Bank itself, allowed banks to resort to repo transactions among themselves\nand with DFHI, and STCI. All government securities and PSU bonds were eligible for repos till 1988.\nBetween April 1988 and mid-June 1992, only Inter-bank repos were allowed in all government securities.\nMarket repos were popular in 1991-92 as banks did not wish to buy the securities outright because of the\nrisk of depreciation. Moreover, since there were not many money market instruments of different maturi-\nties, repos served as a hedge against interest rate fluctuations.\n\nRepos were misused by banks and brokers during the 1992 securities scam. Repo deals were sub-\nsequently banned in all securities except treasury bills. In June 1995, the ban was lifted, allowing\nrestricted eligible participants and instruments, i.e., repo deals were initially allowed in treasury bills\nand five dated securities on the NSE. Banks, along with primary dealers, were permitted to under-\ntake ready forward transactions. These transactions were allowed only in Mumbai provided they were\nrouted through the SGL accounts maintained by the Reserve Bank. These restrictions were liberalized\ngradually. Now, all central and state government dated securities and treasury bills of all maturities are\neligible for repo. The participants are required to actually hold the securities in their portfolio before\nundertaking repo transactions.\n\nBanks, along with primary dealers, were permitted to undertake ready forward transactions. These\ntransactions were allowed only in Mumbai provided they were routed through the SGL accounts main-\ntained by the Reserve Bank.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Market Repo Transactions in Government Securities Market\n\nThe RBI has permitted the following transactions:\n\nGilt account holders (GAH) may enter into a repo transaction with its custodian or another GAH of the\nsame custodian;\n\nCo-operative banks may enter into repo transactions with all eligible market participants, including\nNBFCs;\n\nListed companies may borrow or lend under repos with all eligible market participants (including banks)\nwithout the minimum tenor restriction of seven days;\n\nEligible unlisted companies may borrow from any eligible market participant against special Government\nof India securities issued to them;\n\nNBFCs registered with RBI, including Government companies as defined in sub-section (45) of section 2\nof the Companies Act, 2013 which adhere to the prudential norms prescribed for NBFCs by the Depart-\nment of Non-Banking Regulation, Reserve Bank of India, may borrow/lend under repos with all cligible\nmarket participants.\n\n2. RBI repos: It is a mechanism through which the Reserve Bank lends/borrows money to/from banks\nagainst government securities. Repo implies injection of liquidity and reverse repo absorption of liquidity.\nIn other words, repo is a mechanism through which the RBI lends money to the banks against govern-\nment securities (by repurchasing government securities from banks) to inject liquidity in the economy and\nthrough reverse repos, it borrows money by selling government securities to absorb excess liquidity in the\neconomy. The Reserve Bank conducts repo auctions to:\n\n1. provide banks with an outlet for managing short-term liquidity;\n2. even out short-term liquidity fluctuations in the money market; and\n3. optimise return on short-term surplus liquid funds.\n\nThe Reserve Bank provides liquidity support to primary dealers, and 100 per cent gilt mutual funds\nin the form of repo facility. The Reserve Bank also undertakes repo/reverse repo operations with primary\ndealers and scheduled commercial banks as part of its open market operations.\n\nThe Reserve Bank indirectly interferes in the call money market through LAF repo/reverse repo opera-\ntions to ease undue pressure on overnight call money rates and moderate liquidity conditions in the call\nmoney market. This also enables the repo market to forge close links between the money market and\nsecurities market.\n\nThe Reserve Bank introduced reverse repo operations (selling government securities to repur-\nchase later) on December 10, 1992 to influence short-term liquidity. It is a mechanism through\nwhich the Reserve Bank absorbs excess liquidity from the economy. This is apart from the liquidity\nsupport extended by the Reserve Bank to primary dealers through refinance/reverse repo facility\nat a fixed price.\n\nThese reverse repo auctions were introduced in December 1992. They were conducted for a\nperiod ranging from 1 day to 14 days between 1992 and 1995. From August 1993, the period of\nrepo stabilized at 14 days consistent with the reserve make up period for banks. In February 1995,\nauctions were discontinued due to lack of demand on account of tight money market conditions\nresulting from a decline in capital inflows and sharp expansion in non-food credit. Reverse repo\nauctions were reintroduced on November 4, 1996, to absorb excess liquidity in the economy. Auc-\ntions of a 3 to 4 day cycle were introduced again in early 1997. The Reserve Bank switched over\nfrom discriminatory price auction repos to a daily fixed rate repo auction system in November\n1997. In discriminatory price auctions, bidders submit multiple price quantity sealed bids. The\nauction results were announced on the same day; payment by the successful bidders at or below the\ncut-off repo rate was made the following day. Under the fixed rate repos system, the repo rates are\npre-announced and banks/financial institutions are required to submit bids indicating the volume of\nrepos. The results of fixed rate repos are announced on the date of submitting the bids.\n\nFixed rate repos indicate money market rates, bring down volatility in the foreign exchange market,\nand impart stability to short-term interest rates by setting a floor and ceiling for call money rates. The\nfixed rate auction reverse repo system was used to prevent speculative activity during foreign exchange\nvolatility and thereby to ward off the spread of that activity during the south-east Asian crisis. Initially,\nthe reverse repo rate was fixed at 4.5 per cent but was successively raised to reach 7 per cent with effect\nfrom December 11, 1997, and further to 9 per cent with effect from January 17, 1998. Subsequently, as\nthe forex market stabilized, the reverse repo rate was brought down in stages to 6 per cent with effect\nfrom March 1999 to 5.5 per cent in October 2002 and 4.5 per cent in August 2003 and then hiked to 5\nper cent on April 29, 2005 and 6 per cent on July 25, 2006. The reverse repos got integrated with the\nILAF introduced in April 1999. The absorption of liquidity was at fixed rate reverse repos and the sys-\ntem of injecting liquidity through various ways, including refinance, was at interest rates linked to the\nbank rate, which was reactivated in April 1997. With the introduction of the liquidity adjustment facility\nfrom June 5, 2000, the Reserve Bank has been injecting liquidity into the system through repos on a\ndaily basis at a fixed rate.\n\nThe Reserve Bank scrapped the 7 and 14 day repo in October 2004. At present, repo is only overnight\nto give banks greater flexibility in liquidity management. In case of tight liquidity conditions, the RBI\nconducts 2/3/7 day repo/reverse repo auctions under additional LAF. The repo auctions are conducted on\nall working days except Saturdays and restricted to scheduled commercial banks and primary dealers. A\nsystem of announcing the calendar of repo auctions was also introduced in January 1997. All forms of\nliquidity support except ways and means advances (WMA) are at the repo rate.\n\nThe reverse repo rate acts as the floor and the bank rate and repo rates as the cap for the money market.\nChanges in repo and reverse repo rates effect the movement of market interest rates and asset prices as\nthey convey information about future monetary policy and liquidity. The Repo along with the CRR has\nemerged as an important tool of liquidity and monetary managament.\n\n\u2018The RBI has issued the draft Tri-party repo (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2017 on April 11, 2017.\n\nTri-Party repo is a type of repo contract where a third entity (apart from the borrower or lender), called\na Tri-party agent, acts as an intermediary between the two parties to the repo to facilitate services like\ncollateral selection, payment and settlement, custody and management during the life of the transaction.\n\n1.

If any market participant parks money with the RBI in the form of\nreverse repo, where in, the RBI issues the government securities in return for funds parked with it. In case,\nthe market participant is in need of funds, then it can re-issue the securities received under reverse repo,\nwhich is called re-repo.\n\nRe-repo is permitted in government securities, including state development loans and treasury bills,\nacquired under reverse repo, subject to following conditions:\n\n(a) Scheduled commercial banks and Primary Dealers (PDs) maintaining Subsidiary General\nLedger (SGL) account with the Reserve Bank of India will be permitted to re-repo the securities\nacquired under reverse repo;\n\n(b) Mutual funds and insurance companies maintaining SGL account with the Reserve Bank of\nIndia will also be permitted to re-repo the securities acquired under reverse repo, subject to the\napproval of the regulators concerned;\n\n(c) Re-repo of securities can be undertaken only after receipt of confirmation/matching of first leg of\nrepo transaction;\n\n(d) Re-repo period should not exceed the residual period of the initial repo;\n\n(e) Eligible entities undertaking re-repo transactions should \u2018flag\u2019 the transactions as a re-repo on the\nauthorized reporting platform. Participants may review their systems and controls to ensure strict\ncompliance with the requirement of reporting of re-repo transactions.\n\nTo enable the re-repoing of securities received in the RBI reverse repo auctions, the participants would\nbe able to transfer the securities from their Reverse Repo Constituent (RRC) account to their SGL account.\n\nFor the purpose of re-repo, the participant would be able to withdraw securities from the RRC account\nup to two working days (i.e., days when G-Sec market is functional) prior to the 2nd leg settlement date\nof the concerned term reverse repo.\n\nRe-repo of securities received in overnight reverse repo auctions is not allowed.\n\nThe amount of securities which the participant can withdraw from its RRC account will be net of the\nmargin amount, ascertained at the Ist leg of the transactions (currently 4% for Central Govt. securities\nand 6% for SDLs). If multiple securities are provided in the RBI term reverse repo auctions, margin\nwould apply security-wise for withdrawal from the RRC account as illustrated below:\n\nIllustration A: Maximum amount of securities which can be withdrawn for Re-Repo. (i) On 06/09/2016,\na participant has offered %400 crore in a 8 day RBI term reverse repo auction (2nd leg settlement on\n14/09/2016) and has received \u00a594,54,80,000 F.V. of Central Govt. security 8.33% GS 2026, 2103,96,40,000\nEV. of Central Govt. security 6.97% GS 2026, %104,18,30,000 F.V. of 364 day treasury bill with residual\nmaturity of 10 days and %130,36,70,000 EV. of principal STRIP \u2018PS 02 JAN 2020\u2019, from RBI in the\n\nIst leg (the securities are the same as given at Annex-l).

(iii) The maximum amount\nof securities allowed to be withdrawn for the purpose of Re-Repo, during the tenor of the RBI Term\nReverse Repo after excluding applicable 4% margin and rounding-down in multiples of 210,000 would\nbe, %90,91,10,000 FV. of Central Govt. security 8.33% GS 2026, 299,96,50,000 FV. of Central Govt.\nsecurity 6.97% GS 2026, 100,17,50,000 FV. of 364 day treasury bill with residual maturity of 10 days\nand 125,35,20,000 FV. of principal STRIPS 02 JAN 2020\u201d.\n\nOperational Guidelines for Reckoning the Market Value of Collateral in Repo/Reverse Repo Trans-\nactions with RBI\n\n. The guidelines mentioned hereunder will be applicable to all types of repo/reverse repo trans-\nactions with RBI including Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF), variable rate operations and\nMarginal Standing Facility (MSF).\n\n2. All SLR-eligible Government of India dated Securities/ State Development Loans (SDL) and\nTreasury Bills (T-Bill) are eligible for repo/reverse repo transactions with RBI.\n\n. The valuation of securities used as collateral would be based on market value of the securities\nw.e.f. November 26, 2016.\n\n4. The data published by Fixed Income Money Markets and Derivatives Association of India (FIM-\nMDA) regarding price/yield of G-Secs/Treasury Bills on a daily basis (on all working days when\nthe G-Secs are traded) would be used for valuation.\n\n. For all the repo/reverse repo operations carried out on any day, the applicable prices for valuation\nof securities would be based on the FIMMDA prices published on the previous working day.\n\n6. For calculating the dirty price (clean price + accrued interest) of the G-Secs, \u201830/360\u2019 day count\nconvention would be used.\n\n. For calculating the price of the T-Bills, the \u2018Actual/365\u00b0 day count convention would be used.\n\n.. T-Bill prices for intermediate tenors would be derived using linear interpolation on the FIMMDA\n\u2018T-Bill yields data for the available tenors.\n\n9. The initial margin for Central Government Securities and SDLs will be at 4 per cent and 6 per\ncent respectively, subject to review in future.\n\n10. If for any reason the FIMMDA price/yield files of the day is not available, the latest available\nprevious data would be used for valuation.\n\n11. The yield/price would be approximated by rounding-off to 4 decimals. The collateral to be\nexchanged both in case of repos and reverse repos would be in multiples of 10,000 (after round-\ning up) to ensure that such transactions are not undercollateralized.\n\n12. Illustrative examples for valuation based on market value for Central Government Securities/\n\nDLs, T-Bills and STRIPS, respectively are furnished below.\n\nw\n\nw\n\non\n\nIlustration A: Valuation of Central Government Securities/SDLs.

(iii) Accrued Interest from 09/07/2016 (date of last coupon) to 06/09/2016 (date of Repo\ntransaction) for 57 days would be 81.3189 (8.33 x 57/360). (iv) Accordingly, the dirty price of the security\nwould be 2109.9981 (108.6792 + 1.3189). Therefore, the face value (F.V.) of securities to be debited from\nRepo Constituent (RC) account after applying 4% margin and rounding-up to multiples of 10,000 would\nbe %94,54,80,000 (1.04 x 100,00,00,000 x 100/109.9981). (v) The mechanism for computing the dirty\nprice for the SDLs would be on similar lines with the applicable initial margin.\n\nIlustration B: Valuation of T-Bills. (i) FIMMDA publishes benchmark yields (YTM & Discount\nYield) only for select tenors (7, 14, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210,240, 270, 300, 330 & 364 days).\nFor residual maturities, linear interpolation would be used to derive the yield. For example, if the yield\nof 10 days residual tenor (Tx) has to be derived, then the FIMMDA yields of 7 days (T1) and 14 days\n(12), respectively would be used. For residual tenor less than 7 days, the 7 day YTM would be used. (ii)\nFormula for linear interpolation of yield at tenor Tx (Tl < Tx <2) = Yield for T 1 + [{(Yield for T2 -\nYield for T 1)/ (T2-T1)} x (Tx \u2014T1)]. (iii) Price = 100/(1+ YTM in percentage x days to maturity of\nthe T-Bill/365). (iv) Example: For a successful bid of 2100 crore in a term repo auction on 06/09/2016,\na participant provides a 364 day T-Bill maturing on 16/09/2016 (residual maturity of 10 days). As per\n\ndata published in the FIMMDA on 02/09/2016 (3, 4 & 5/09/2016, GSec market was closed), the YTM for\n7 day tenor is 6.4138% and the YTM for 14 day tenor is 6.4232%. Based on linear interpolation for 10\ndays, the YTM would be 6.4178% and accordingly, the price can be derived as 799.8245. (v) Therefore,\nthe F.V. of the particular T-Bill to be debited from RC account of the participant after applying 4% margin\nand rounding-up to multiples of 10,000 would be %104,18,30,000 (1.04 x 100,00,00,000 x 100/99.8245).\n\nIllustration C: Valuation of STRIPS (i) FIMMDA publishes the prices of STRIPs on a daily basis.\n(ii) Example: For a successful bid of 2100 crore fund in RBI Term Repo auction on 06/09/2016, a\nparticipant provides a principal STRIP \u2018PS 02 JAN 2020\u201d (maturity - 02/01/2020). The FIMMDA price\non 02/09/2016 (on September 3, 4 and 5, 2016, GSec market was closed) is 79.7749. Therefore the FV.\nof securities to be debited from RC account of the participant after applying 4% margin and rounding-up\nto multiples of 10,000 would be 130,36,70,000 (1.04 x 100,00,00,000 x 100/79.7749).\n\nSecurity Substitution Facility for term repos conducted by Reserve Bank of India under the Liquid-\nity Adjustment Facility\n\nThe securities offered for substitution by the market participants shall be of similar market value based\non the latest prices published by the Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association of India\n(FIMMDA).\n\nIllustration: Substitution of securities in term repos under the liquidity adjustment facility\nApril 18, 2017\n\ni. For a successful bid of 8200 crore in 14 day term repo auction on April 18, 2017, a participant\nprovides a Central Government security 8.40% GS 2024 worth & 208 crore market value (includ-\ning 4% margin for Central Government security).\n\nii, The dirty price of the security is calculated based on the latest file published by FIMMDA, i.e. of\nApril 17, 2017. Assume the price to be 2110.\n\niii. Therefore, the face value of security 8.40% GS 2024, that is, debited from Repo Constituent (RC)\naccount (after rounding-up) would be %189.091 crore (208 x 100 /110).\n\nApril 20, 2017\n\niv. The participant chooses to substitute 2100 crore face value of the security 8.40% GS 2024 with\na new security 8.83% GS 2023 on April 20, 2017.\n\nv. The dirty price of 8.83% GS 2023 would be based on the latest available FIMMDA price in the\n\nsystem, i.e., the file published on April 19, 2017. Assume the price to be 115.\n\nThe amount of security 8.83% GS 2023 which has to be provided by the market participant in his\n\nRepo constituent in order to substitute the security 8.40% GS 2024 would be calculatedas follows:\n\nRequired face value of new security to be substituted = (Market value of the security intended\n\nto be withdrawn, icc., 8.40% GS 2024, based on April 17, 2017 price) x 100/(latest market\n\nprice of the security offered as substitution, i.c., 8.83% GS 2023, based on April 19, 2017 price\n\n= 110 * 100/115 = 95.652\n\nvii. Therefore, in order to substitute 7100 crore face value of security 8.40% GS 2024, the participant\nhas to provide 295.652 crore face value of new security 8.83% GS 2023.\n\nvi.\n\nState Government security\n\nviii. If a state government security is offered for substitution, then it would attract 6% margin as\nitherto.\n\nMarket Stabilization Scheme To manage the foreign exchange rate, the Reserve Bank intervenes\nin the forex market by buying dollars flowing into the economy. This leads to a release of large rupee\nsupply in the system which results in a flood of rupee liquidity. In order to dry off a part of this\nrise supply, the Reserve Bank then sells bonds to banks. In the year 2003-04, there was a sharp fall\nin the level of the Central Government's market borrowing programme which exhausted the stock of\nbonds with the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank\u2019s stock of government securities fell to %4,626 crore\nin 2003-04 from %1,67,308 crore in May 2001. There was a persistent flow of foreign exchange and\nthis was absorbed through the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) and the open Market Operations\n(OMOs) conducted by the Reserve Bank. However, a depletion in the stock of securities hampered\nthe LAF and the Open market operations of the Reserve Bank. To make up for this, the Reserve\nBank signed in March 2004, a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Government of India\nfor issuance of dated government securities of a maturity of less than two years and treasury bills\n\nincluding cash management bills under the MSS. The scheme came into effect from April 1, 2004.\nThe main purpose of introducing the scheme was to absorb surplus liquidity of a more enduring\nnature, thus reducing the burden of sterilization on the LAF window. These bonds have a tenor of two\nyears and the proceeds from them remain in a separate account of the Reserve Bank. This account is\nutilized solely for redeeming the principal amount of market stabilization bonds. The liability of the\ngovernment is restricted to interest payments.\n\nThe ceiling on the outstanding amount under MSS was fixed initially at 780,000 crore on\nOctober 14, 2004 but is subject to revision through mutual assessment of the liquidity in the\nsystem. The ceiling has been since enhanced to 22,50,000 crores in view of large and continuous\ncapital inflows. The Reserve Bank also issues an indicative schedule for the issuance of securities\nunder the MSS to provide transparency and stability in the financial markets. The MOU on the\nMSS was amended on February 26, 2009 to permit the transfer of the sequestered liquidity from\nthe MSS cash account to the normal cash account of the government. Liquidity management was\nsupported by an increase in the limit on securities under the market stabilisation scheme (MSS)\nfrom 20.3 trillion to %6 trillion on November 29, 2016.\n\nThis scheme has enabled the Reserve Bank to improve liquidity management in the system,\nmaintain stability in the foreign exchange market, and conduct monetary policy in accordance\nwith the stated objectives. Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) coupled with open market oper-\nations (OMOs) and Market Stabilization Scheme (MSS) has helped the transition from direct\ninstruments to indirect instruments, stabilization of short-term money market rates, enabled to\naffect demand for funds, and modulate the supply of funds on a daily basis to meet day-to-day\nliquidity mismatches.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "New Operating Procedure of Policy Instruments\n\nThe operating procedure of monetary policy in India has witnessed significant changes. In mid-\n1980s, reserve money was used as operating target and broad money (M3) as an intermediate\ntarget. With structural reforms in 1990s, interest rates were used to transmit policy signals. With\nchanges in liquidity conditions brought about by financial sector reforms, the LAF was intro-\nduced in June 2000 and emerged as the principal operating procedure of monetary policy, with the\nrepo and the reverse repo rates as the key instruments for signalling the monetary policy stance.\nLAF, was well supported by instruments such as the CRR, OMO and MSS in liquidity manage-\nment. The LAF operated through repo (during tight liquidity conditions) and reverse repo (dur-\ning surplus liquidity conditions) and the overnight interest rates were highly volatile in extreme\nconditions. This created a lot of confusion and uncertainty about the desired policy impact as\nthe policy rate alternated between repo and reverse repo rates. Moreover, in the last decade,\nlarge volatility in capital flows and sharp fluctuations in government cash balances posed several\nchallenges to liquidity management by the Reserve Bank and thereby, a need for new operating\nprocedure. It was decided to revise the LAF framework as there was a lack of a single policy rate\nand a firm corridor.\n\nThe Reserve Bank introduced a new operating procedure of monetary policy in May 2011 to\nhave an explicit operating target, a single policy rate and a formal corridor system with a 100 bps\nspread on either side of the policy rate to replace the earlier system of repo and reverse repo as policy\nrates without having an explicit target and a fixed-width formal corridor. Under the new operating\nframework,\n\n+ The weighted average overnight call money rate is now the operating target of monetary policy.\n\n+ The repo rate has acquired the status of being the only one independently varying policy rate.\n\n+ Anew marginal standing facily (MSF) has been instituted from which scheduled commercial banks\ncan borrow overnight up to 1.0 per cent of their respective NDTL at 100 basis points above the repo\nrate. This facility will provide a safety valve against unforeseen liquidity shocks.\n\nThe revised corridor has a fixed width of 200 basis points. The repo rate has been placed in the middle\nof the corridor, with the reverse repo rate 100 basis points below it and the MSF rate 100 basis points\nabove it. However, the Reserve Bank will have the flexibility to change the width of the corridor, should\nmonetary conditions so warrant. (Figure 4.2)\n\nIn April 2016, the liquidity management framework was revised to progressively move to a position\ncloser to neutrality. The policy rate corridor around the repo rate was narrowed to +/- 50 bps.\n\nWith the implementation of the new operating procedure of monetary policy, the call rate stabilized,\nhovered within the fixed corridor and moved with other money market rates, thereby bringing about a\ngreater integration of financial markets.\n\nRate of\ninterest\nX+ 100 bps\n[This standing facility is available unlimited against collateral of Bank Rate/Marginal Standing\ngoverment securities from excess SLR and up to 2 per cent of \u2014_Facity rate (Ceiling)\nbanks NDTL from required SLR].\n* Policy Rate (Repo Rat\n[Liquidity against excess SLR secutities and export credit Ovemight omer re)\nrefinance facility for banks and liquidity facility for PDs] Carget Rate)\nX-100ps Reverse Repo Rate (Floor)\n[Liquidity absorption by the Reserve Bank of India against govenment securities]\nLiquidity\n\nSource: Mohanty Deepak, Money Market and Monetary Operations in India, RBI Bulletin, December 2012.\nFigure 4.2 Revised LAF Farmework\n",

                        "extracted-text": "AN OVERVIEW OF THE MONEY MARKET\n\nThe development of a money market is a prerequisite for improving the operational effectiveness of the\nmonetary policy. The objective of reforms in the money market was to remove structural liquidities and\ninefficiencies so as to increase participation and strengthen inter-linkages between the money market seg-\nments and other financial markets. This called for the introduction of sophisticated financial instruments\nand innovations in market prices to ensure liquidity in various segments of the money market and for the\ndevelopment of a short-term yield curve.\n\nA review of the money market development and current efforts for further development show that a base\nhas been created with a variety of products introduced in the market. The treasury bills market has expanded\nin terms of size and volume of growth. The markets for commercial paper, certificates of deposit, and com-\nmercial bills are less liquid. The call money market has not only become more active but the call money\nrate has also become more volatile in recent years. With the deregulation of interest rates, the rates have\n\n\u2018emerged as an important mechanism for asset allocation. New indirect tools of managing liquidity like repos\nand liquidity adjustment facility operations have emerged and are increasingly used by the Reserve Bank.\nAgencies like the NSE and Reuters have taken the initiative in creating overnight Mibor rates as benchmark/\nrefinance rates. New players such as non-bank entities, foreign institutional investors, primary dealers, sat-\nellite dealers, and others have been permitted to operate in the money market. New hedging instruments\nsuch as interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements have been introduced to hedge the interest rate\nrisk.\n\nIn the second phase of reforms, the Reserve Bank\u2019s objective has been to develop a short-term rupee\nyield curve. To this end, a fourfold strategy has been adopted which includes conducting of LAF opera-\ntions with a view to keeping short-term interest rates within a corridor, development of the call money\nmarket as a pure inter-bank market, rationalization of the traditional, sector-specific refinance support,\nand developing the repo market so that non-bank participants get an access to this market.\n\nInspite of an increase in the number of instruments and players and the recent efforts as mentioned\nabove, the money market has not acquired the required depth in terms of volume and liquidity. Partly,\nit was the Reserve Bank's policy which inhibited the growth of the money market. The Reserve Bank\u2019s\ndecisions of banning repos after the securities scam of 1992, resorting to a tight monetary policy during\nthe busy season credit policy of 1995, and defending the rupee in the wake of the South-east Asian crisis\ntook a severe toll on the money markets and the institutions that operate in it.\n\nBesides this, there was delay in the technological upgradation of the money market. Technology is a\nprerequisite for the development of financial markets. The establishment of the VSAT network and elec-\ntronic dealing system will go a long way in expanding the market and help in bringing about transparency.\n\nThe money market cannot be liquid and deep without the necessary instruments to hedge the risk. The\nderivative market cannot flourish without a deep and liquid money market. This calls for the following\nmeasures.\n\nDevelopment of a transparent benchmark.\n\nDevelopment of term money market which will help in the development of benchmark inter-bank\nterm money market rate which is vital for integrating money and foreign exchange markets.\nDevelopment of policies that provide incentives for banks and financial institutions to manage risk\nand maximize profit.\n\nIncreasing secondary market activity in CPs and CDs: In case of CPs, underwriting should be\nallowed and revolving underwriting finance facility and floating rate CPs should be introduced. In\ncase of CDs, the tenure of those of the financial institutions CDs should be rationalized. Moreover,\nfloating rate CDs can be introduced.\n\nRationalization of the stamp duty structure. Multiple prescription of stamp duty leads to an increase\nin the administrative costs and administrative hassles.\n\nChange in the regulatory mindset of the Reserve Bank by shifting the focus of control from quantity\nof liquidity to price which can lead to an orderly development of money market.\n\nGood debt and cash management on the part of the government which will not only be complementary\nto the monetary policy but give greater freedom to the Reserve Bank in setting its operating procedures.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Primary Capital Market and Secondary Capital Market\nThe capital market comprises the primary capital market and the secondary capital market.\n\nPrimary Market This refers to the long-term flow of funds from the surplus sector to the government\nand corporate sector (through primary issues) and to banks and non-bank financial intermediaries (through\nsecondary issues), Primary issues of the corporate sector lead to capital formation (creation of net fixed\nassets and incremental change in inventories). The capital formation function enables companies to invest\nthe proceeds of a primary issue in creating productive capacities, increasing efficiency, and creating jobs\nwhich, in turn, generate wealth.\n\nThe nature of fund-raising is as follows:\n\nDomestic\nEquity issues by \u2014 Corporates (primary issues)\n\u2014 Financial intermediaries (secondary issues)\nDebt instruments by \u2014 Government (primary issues)\n\u2014 Corporates (primary issues)\n\u2014 Financial intermediaries (secondary issues)\nExternal\nEquity issues through issue of \u2014 Global Depository Receipts (GDR) and American\nDepository Receipts (ADR)\nDebt instruments through \u2014 External Commercial Borrowings (ECB)\nOther External Borrowings\nForeign Direct Investments (FDI) \u2014 in equity and debt form\nForeign Institutional Investments (FIT) \u2014 in the form of portfolio investments\nNon-resident Indian Deposits (NRI) | \u2014 in the form of short-term and medium-term deposits\n\nThe fund-raising in the primary market can be classified as follows:\n\n* Public issue by prospectus\n+ Private placement\n\n\u00ab Rights issues\n\n+ Preferential issues\n\nForeign Direct Investment (FDI) and Foreign Institutional Investment (FIl)\n\nFDI is an investor which picks up more than 10 per cent stake in a company\u2019s equity. India has had a long\nexperience with FDIs, with multinational corporations being significant players in many sectors of the\neconomy-pharmaceuticals, consumer durables, fast moving consumer goods, engineering, and finan-\ncial services. The sectors which were recently opened up for FDIs are telecom, banking and insurance.\nThese multinational corporations either set up their wholly owned subsidiary in India or enter into a joint\nventure with Indian entrepreneurs. FDI is a preferred route to bridge the large savings~investment gap\nowing to its beneficial effects such as access to modern technologies and export markets, and direct and\nindirect employment reaction. However, FDI crowds out domestic investment opportunities and hence\nsome conditions in the form of minimum level of local content, export commitment, technology transfer,\nand compulsory listing on the local stock-exchanges are generally imposed on FDIs. FDIs are stable by\nnature as they usually come into the picture only for long-term projects. They also help generate employ-\nment and bring in the latest technological innovations.\n\nThe government aims to attract FDI worth $150 billion over the next 10 years, with a thrust on infra-\nstructure, financial services and agriculture. This will be possible only if there is a stability of policies,\ntax laws and incentives and a minimum of red tape and a corruption-free environment. The government\n\nhas set up an investment commission to identify the problems of the potential investors and advise the\ngovernment.\n\nThe government has revised FDI caps to 100 per cent in airports, power trading, petroleum market-\ning, distillation and brewing of potable alcohol, captive mining in coal and lignite, industrial explosives,\nand hazardous chemicals. Investment in these areas would no longer require the approval of the Foreign\nInvestment Promotion Board.\n\nFils are in the form of portfolio investments both in the primary and secondary capital markets. They\nhelp in bridging the short-to medium-term savings-investment gap. FII flows help capital formation\neither by subscribing to quality issues in the primary market or by releasing the existing pool of risk capi-\ntal through the secondary market. FIls can invest only upto 24 per cent in a company. Further investments\nwould need special approval from the company\u2019s board and in any case cannot go beyond the foreign\ninvestment cap for the sector set by the government. FIIs usually help in developing capital markets.\nEntrepreneurs can tap the capital market by wooing Fils and can thereby setup new projects or use the\nfunds for expansion. However, FIl investment may not be stable as there can be sudden outflows, if capital\nmarkets perform adversely, or are expected to perform negatively.\n\nThe Secondary Market This is a market for outstanding securities. An equity instrument, being an\neternal fund, provides an all-time market while a debt instrument, with a defined maturity period, is\ntraded at the secondary market till maturity. Unlike primary issues in the primary market which result in\ncapital formation, the secondary market facilitates only liquidity and marketability of outstanding debt\nand equity instruments. The secondary market contributes to economic growth by channelizing funds into\nthe most efficient channel through the process of disinvestment to reinvestment. The secondary market\nalso provides instant valuation of securities (equity and debt instruments) made possible by changes in the\ninternal environment, ie., through companywide and industrywide factors. Such a valuation facilitates\nthe measurement of the cost of capital and rate of return of economic entities at the micro level. Secondary\nmarkets reduce the cost of capital by providing liquidity, price discovery and risk transfer capability.\nLiquidity is the ability to buy or sell an asset readily at a low cost and without a substantial impact on\nits price. Price discovery is the process whereby market participants attempt to find an equilibrium price\nwhich, in turn, is useful in making economic decisions. Both the government and business firms use this\ninformation to formulate future strategies. For instance, the derivatives trading reveals expected future\nprices of different commodities, currencies, precious metals, securities, and interest rates. Based on this\ninformation, both the government and business firms determine particulars like pricing commitments,\ntiming of issues and expansion of production facilities.\n\nThe secondary market creates a wealth effect. The bull run in the stock markets adds to the market cap-\nitalization which notionally accrues to all investors\u2014government, corporates, promoters, strategic holders\nof equity on listed companies, mutual funds and it dual investors and it makes them feel wealthier.\nInvestors also feel rich when they receive frequent dividend distribution from mutual funds or corporates.\nThis stock market created wealth does influence consumption and growth of the economy. The wealth\neffect suggests that an addition in financial wealth boosts consumer spending in the long run.\n\nThe Indian secondary market can be segregated into two.\n\n1. The secondary market for corporates and financial intermediaries. For trading in issues of corpo-\nrates and financial intermediaries, there are the following entities:\na. Recognized stock exchanges\nb. The National Stock Exchange of India Limited (NSE)\n\nc. The Over the Counter Exchange of India (OTCEI)\nd. The Interconnected Stock Exchange of India (ISE).\n\nThe participants in this market are registered brokers\u2014both individuals and institutions. They\n\noperate through a network of sub-brokers and sub-dealers and are connected through an elec-\n\ntronic networking system.\n\n2. The secondary market for government securities and public sector undertaking bonds. The\ntrading in government securities is basically divided into the short-term money market instru-\nments such as treasury bills and long-term government bonds ranging in maturity from 5 to 20\nyears.\n\nThe main participants in the secondary market for government securities are entities like\nprimary dealers, banks, financial institutions, and mutual funds.\n\nThe secondary market transactions in government securities have been conducted through\nthe subsidiary general ledger (SGL) since September 1994. Both the government securities and\npublic sector undertaking bonds are now traded in the wholesale debt market (WDM) segment of\nthe NSE, the BSE, and the OTCEI.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "HISTORY OF THE INDIAN CAPITAL MARKET\n\nThe history of the capital market in India dates back to the eighteenth century when the East India Com-\npany securities were traded in the country. Until the end of the nineteenth century, securities trading was\nunorganized and the main trading centres were Bombay (now Mumbai) and Calcutta (now Kolkata). Of\nthe two, Bombay was the chief trading centre wherein bank shares were the major trading stock. During\nthe American Civil War (1860-61), Bombay was an important source of supply for cotton. Hence, trading\nactivities flourished during the period, resulting in a boom in share prices. This boom, the first in the his-\ntory of the Indian capital market, lasted for nearly half a decade. The bubble burst on July 1, 1865, when\nthere was a tremendous slump in share prices.\n\n\u2018Trading was at that time limited to a dozen brokers; their trading place was under a banyan tree in front\nof the Town Hall in Bombay. These stock brokers organized an informal association in 1875\u2014the Native\nShares and Stock Brokers Association, Bombay. The stock exchanges in Calcutta and Ahmedabad, also\nindustrial and trading centres, materialized later. The Bombay Stock Exchange was recognized in May\n1927 under the Bombay Securities Contracts Control Act, 1925.\n\nThe capital market was not well-organized and developed during the British rule because the British\ngovernment was not interested in the economic growth of the country. As a result, many foreign compa-\nnies depended on the London capital market for funds rather than on the Indian capital market.\n\nIn the post-independence era also, the size of the capital market remained small. During the first and\nsecond five year plans, the government\u2019s emphasis was on the development of the agricultural sector and\npublic sector undertakings. Public sector undertakings were healthier than private undertakings in terms\nof paid-up capital but their shares were not listed on the stock exchanges. Moreover, the Controller of\nCapital Issues (CCI) closely supervised and controlled the timing, composition, interest rates, pricing,\nallotment, and floatation costs of new issues. These strict regulations demotivated many companies from\ngoing public for almost four and a half decades.\n\nIn the 1950s, Century Textiles, Tata Steel, Bombay Dyeing, National Rayon, and Kohinoor Mills were\nthe favourite scrips of speculators. As speculation became rampant, the stock market came to be known as\nthe satta bazaar. Despite speculation, non-payment or defaults were not very frequent. The government\nenacted the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act in 1956 to regulate stock markets. The Companies Act,\n1956 was also enacted. The decade of the 1950s was also characterized by the establishment of a network\nfor the development of financial institutions and state financial corporations.\n\n\u2018The 1960s was characterized by wars and droughts in the country which led to bearish trends. These\ntrends were aggravated by the ban in 1969 on forward trading and badla, technically called \u2018contracts for\nclearing\u2019. Badla provided a mechanism for carrying forward positions as well as for borrowing funds.\nFinancial institutions such as LIC and GIC helped revive the sentiment by emerging as the most important\ngroup of investors. The first mutual fund of India, the Unit Trust of India (UTI) came into existence in 1964.\n\nIn the 1970s, badla trading was resumed under the guise of \u2018hand-delivery contracts\u2014a group.\u2019 This\nrevived the market. However, the capital market received another severe setback on July 6, 1974, when.\nthe government promulgated the Dividend Restriction Ordinance, restricting the payment of dividend by\ncompanies to 12 per cent of the face value or one-third of the profits of the companies that can be dis-\ntributed as computed under Section 369 of the Companies Act, whichever was lower. This led to a slump\nin market capitalization at the BSE by about 20 per cent overnight and the stock market did not open\nfor nearly a fortnight. Later came a buoyancy in the stock markets when the multinational companies\n(MNCs) were forced to dilute their majority stocks in their Indian ventures in favour of the Indian public\nunder FERA in 1973. Several MNCs opted out of India. One hundred and twenty-three MNCs offered\nshares worth 2150 crore, creating 1.8 million shareholders within four years. The offer prices of FERA\nshares were lower than their intrinsic worth. Hence, for the first time, FERA dilution created an equity\ncult in India. It was the spate of FERA issues that gave a real fillip to the Indian stock market. For the first\ntime, many investors got an opportunity to invest in the stocks of such MNCS as Colgate, and Hindustan\nLever Limited. Then, in 1977, a little-known entrepreneur, Dhirubhai Ambani, tapped the capital market.\nThe scrip, Reliance Textiles, is still a hot favourite and dominates trading at all stock exchanges.\n\nThe 1980s witnessed an explosive growth of the securities market in India, with millions of investors\nsuddenly discovering lucrative opportunities. Many investors jumped into the stock markets for the\nfirst time. The government's liberalization process initiated during the mid-1980s, spurred this growth.\nParticipation by small investors, speculation, defaults, ban on badla, and resumption of badla continued.\nConvertible debentures emerged as a popular instrument of resource mobilization in the primary market.\nThe introduction of public sector bonds and the successful mega issues of Reliance Petrochemicals and\nLarsen and Toubro gave a new lease of life to the primary market. This, in turn, enlarged volumes in\nthe secondary market. The decade of the 1980s was characterized by an increase in the number of stock\nexchanges, listed companies, paid-up capital, and market capitalization.\n\n\nThe 1990s will go down as the most important decade in the history of the capital market of India.\nLiberalization and globalization were the new terms coined and marketed during this decade. The Capital\nIssues (Control) Act, 1947 was repealed in May 1992. The decade was characterized by a new industrial\npolicy, emergence of the SEBI as a regulator of the capital market, advent of foreign institutional inves-\ntors, euro-issues, free pricing, new trading practices, new stock exchanges, entry of new players such as\nprivate sector mutual funds and private sector banks, and primary market boom and bust.\n\nMajor capital market scams took place in the 1990s. These shook the capital market and drove away\nsmall investors from the market. The securities scam of March 1992 involving brokers as well as bank-\ners was one of the biggest scams in the history of the capital market. In the subsequent years owing to\nfree pricing, many unscrupulous promoters, who raised money from the capital market, proved to be fly-\nby-night operators. This led to an erosion in the investors\u2019 confidence. The M S Shoes case, one such scam\nwhich took place in March 1995, put a break on new issue activity.\n\nThe 1991-92 securities scam revealed the inadequacies of and inefficiencies in the financial system.\nIt was the scam which prompted a reform of the equity market. The Indian stock market witnessed a\nsea change in terms of technology and market prices. Technology brought radical changes in the trad-\ning mechanism. The Bombay Stock Exchange was subject to nationwide competition by two new stock\nexchanges\u2014the National Stock Exchange, set up in 1994, and the Over the Counter Exchange of India,\nset up in 1992. The National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) and the National Securities Deposi-\ntory Limited (NSDL) were set up in April 1995 and November 1996 respectively for improved clearing\nand settlement and dematerialized trading. The Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 was amended\nin 1995-96 for introduction of options trading. Moreover, rolling settlement was introduced in January\n1998 for the dematerialized segment of all companies. With automation and geographical spread, stock\nmarket participation increased.\n\nIn the late-1990s, Information Technology (IT) scrips dominated the Indian bourses. These scrips\nincluded Infosys, Wipro, and Satyam. They were a part of the favourite scrips of the period, also known\nas \u2018new economy\u2019 scrips, along with telecommunications and media scrips. The new economy companies\nwere knowledge intensive unlike the old economy companies that were asset intensive.\n\nThe Indian capital market entered the twenty-first century with the Ketan Parekh scam. As a result\nof this scam, badla was discontinued from July 2001 and rolling settlement was introduced in all scrips.\nTrading of futures commenced from June 2000, and Internet trading was permitted in February 2000.\nOn July 2, 2001, the Unit Trust of India announced suspension of the sale and repurchase of its flagship\nUS-64 scheme due to heavy redemption leading to a panic on the bourses. The government's decision\nto privatise oil PSUs in 2003 fueled stock prices. One big divestment of international telephony major\nVSNL took place in early February 2002. Foreign institutional investors have emerged as major players\non the Indian bourses. NSE has an upper hand over its rival BSE in terms of volumes not only in the\nequity markets but also in the derivatives market.\n\nIt has been a long journey for the Indian capital market. Now the capital market is organized, fairly\nintegrated, mature, more global and modernized. The Indian equity market is one of the best in the world\nin terms of technology. Advances in computer and communications technology, coming together on Inter-\nnet are shattering geographic boundaries and enlarging the investor class. Internet trading has become a\nglobal phenomenon. Indian stock markets are now getting integrated with global markets.\n\n",

                        "extracted-text": "CAPITAL MARKET SCAMS\nIntroduction\n\nThe post-economic liberalization era witnessed scams with cyclical regularity in the Indian capital\nmarket. The series of scams in the capital market may lead someone to believe that scams and liberaliza-\ntion are correlated phenomena.\n\nThe most infamous scam, known as the 1992 securities scam, was masterminded by Harshad Mehta\nand other bull operators, not without the connivance and collusion of banks. The consequences were so\nserious that the BSE remained closed for a month. This was followed by scams by unscrupulous promot-\ners mostly of finance companies who took advantage of free pricing to raise money by price rigging.\nSuch fly-by-night operators jolted both the stock exchange and investors. Besides price rigging, grey\nmarket activities were common where the share prices were quoted at a premium before they were listed\non the stock exchanges. For instance, a Morgan Stanley Mutual Fund unit worth {10 was commanding a\npremium of 218, ie., it was quoted at %28 during the subscription period. In March 1995, another scam\nknown as the M. S. Shoes scam masterminded by an exporter, Pavan Sachdeva, who rigged up prices of\nshares, leading eventually to a crash. Once again the market had to be closed for three days. In Decem-\nber 1995, the Reliance shares issue\u2014share switching scam\u2014sprung up in which Fair Growth Financial\nServices, Reliance Industries, and the stock exchange itself were involved. The Bombay Stock Exchange\nsuspended trading in the famous RIL scrip for three days.\n\nC. R. Bhansali, a chartered accountant, shook the country\u2019s financial system in May 1997. He identi-\nfied weaknesses in the regulatory framework of the country\u2019s financial system. By trimming the balance\nsheets of CRB capital markets, he positioned his company as a unique financial organization with excel-\nlent prospects. This created for him an almost unlimited supply of deposits with high interest rates on the\none hand, and provided him leverage to rig prices in the market on the other. The investors were lured to\npart with their money and risk their future.\n\nPrice rigging became a recurring ailment of the Indian capital market. This is clearly evident from the\nfact that, in 1998, the technique of price rigging was successfully applied in case of the BPL,Videocon,\nand Sterlite scrips, which created a payment crisis. Brokers, who acted in concert with Harshad Mehta,\nhad taken large positions in these scrips. As a consequence, these scrips had to be debarred from the mar-\nket for a couple of years. J. C. Parekh, the then president, and other key members on the board of the BSE\nwere sacked by the SEBI for price rigging and insider trading in this case. The history of insider trading\nwas repeated in March 2001 when Anand Rathi, the then president of the BSE, was caught red-handed\nand thereafter sacked by the SEBI alongwith six other broker directors. Ketan Parekh, the new big bull,\nonce again exploited the loopholes and the Anand Rathi bear cartel hammered the market. The hammer-\ning rocked the stock market once again.\n\nAll the scamsters employed common ploys like price manipulation, price rigging, insider trading,\ncartels, collusion, and nexus among the bankers, brokers, politicians, and promoters. These ploys were\nsuccessfully engineered and implemented particularly around public issues or mergers. The regulators\nwere so ineffective that actions were undertaken only after the investors were looted of their hard-earned\nmoney. The ignorance of investors and greed for quick money made the scamsters\u2019 job all the more easy.\nPost-scam inquiries are still being carried on.\n\nIn this chapter, the first scam in the post-liberalization era, the 1991-92 securities scam, also known as\nthe Harshad Mehta scam and the 2001 scam, i.e., the Ketan Parekh scam are discussed in detail.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "The 1991-92 Securities Scam (The Harshad Mehta Scam)\n\nIn 1991, major changes in the government policy led to the emergence of a market-oriented private enter-\nprise economy through the removal of controls.\n\nThe economic liberalization package compelled banks to improve their profitability. With liberaliza-\ntion, entered the free interest rate regime, which meant that banks had to face interest rate uncertainty.\nCoupled with this was strict enforcement of the SLR requirements for banks to keep the money supply\nunder control. Hence, public sector banks were forced to undertake more trading in government securi-\nties. The increase in interest rates on government securities with a longer period of maturity meant capital\nloss (depreciation) on the holding of old securities. To partly offset this loss, banks began trading of anew\ninstrument\u2014repos or ready forward. Repo is a means of funding by selling a security held on spot (ready)\nbasis and repurchasing it on a forward basis.\n\nSeveral banks, including foreign banks, were unwilling to purchase securities for maintaining the SLR\nbecause of the risk of depreciation. They preferred ready forward contracts with other banks, which were\nsurplus in securities. These ready forward contracts were turned around every fortnight depending on\nthe banks\u2019 deposit figures. Moreover, many banks had purchased public sector bonds which they could\nnot sell due to the coupon rate hike. Many banks then violated the Reserve Bank advice and entered into\nready forward deals in PSU bonds.\n\nRepos are legal and versatile instruments but the inter-bank repos in 1991-92 were based on some\ninside information obtained illegally. This was confirmed by the interim report of the RBI panel on securi-\nties, which stated, \u201cTowards the end of March 1992, the State Bank of India (SBI) had purchased a large\nquantity of government securities on a ready forward basis one day prior to the date on which the coupon\nrate of government securities was raised.\u2019\n\nBesides obtaining information illegally, most of the ready forward deals were dubious and facilities\nlike bank receipts (BRs) and SGL forms were misused. Bank receipts which were working smoothly\nas a mechanism (acknowledgement) for transfer of government securities amongst banks were highly\nmisused. There were fake bank receipts in circulation and there was double counting of BRs, which led\nto an accelerated growth in money supply. For example, the Bank of Karad, which had an equity base of\nless than @1 crore, issued BRs worth more than %1,000 crore. Standard Chartered Bank, a foreign bank,\naccepted BRs worth %200 crore from this bank. These transactions, which were far out of proportion of\nthe banks\u2019 own resources, were handled by a handful of brokers. All this was pointed out in the interim\nreport, together with statistics. Of the 57,980 transactions of over %9,00,000 crore in securities entered\ninto by banks in 14 months from April 1, 1991, a mere 5.26 per cent was made up of outright pur-\nchases. More than two-thirds of these transactions were done by four foreign banks. Over 60 per cent\nof the transactions were carried out through brokers. Nearly 95 per cent of these transactions\u2014worth\n%8,58,511 crore, constituted commitments to repurchase or resell securities. In more than 40 per cent\nof these transactions, the commitments were not documented, but were a mere matter of understanding.\n\nMost banks, with a view to increasing their profits, employed their clients\u2019 funds in stocks through\ntheir brokers. This they did by offering higher returns through portfolio management.\n\nThe stock market index the BSE Sensex\u2014rose by leaps and bounds. Harshad Mehta, by injecting the\nbanks\u2019 money into share trading, pushed up prices of selected scrips. Besides the banks\u2019 funds, he tapped\nanother source of money\u2014mutual funds. The government was encouraging the creation of mutual funds.\nThese mutual funds, in order to increase their popularity, assured higher returns which led to sizable flow\nof money to the stock market. Moreover, certain industrialists engaged themselves in \u2018insider trading\u2019 to\nraise the prices of their shares to prevent hostile takeovers. Brokers, with so much money in their hands,\nwere successful in raising the Sensex by 1,500 points in 15 days.\n\nThe boom, which began in July 1991, peaked in April 1992, before the bubble burst. Prices of many\nscrips such as Apollo Tyres, ACC, Castrol India, East India Hotels, GE Shipping, GNFC, Deepak Fer-\ntilisers, and Tata Chemicals shot up three times their usual value in just a year\u2019s time. National Housing\nBank, Bank of Karad, Metropolitan Cooperative Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, Citibank, Bank of\nAmerica, ANZ Grindlays Bank, Canbank Financial Services, and many other institutions were involved\nin the boom.\n\nBetween March 1991 and March 1992, the BSE sensitive index rose by more than three-and-a-half\ntimes\u2014from 1,168 to 4,285. At the peak level, the market capitalization of %3 lakh crore was about half of\nthe GDP as compared to hardly one-fifth of the GDP in the previous year. The market price-earning (P/E)\nratio at 55 was not only higher than what it was in many other developing and developed countries but was\n\nfar in excess of the fundamentals. The monetary size of the securities fraud was estimated to be %3,542 crore.\nThe Sensex dropped to 3,000 and the BSE was closed for a month when the scam came to light.\n\nThe scam highlighted the loopholes in the financial system, unfair trade practices in various instru-\nments, widespread corruption, and wrong policies. The Reserve Bank banned inter-bank repos after the\nscam and the pace of reforms in the financial sector also increased.\n\nIn June 1992, the government had constituted a special court through an ordinance for trial of offences\nin the case and provided for disbursement of dues to banks and the IT department. The assets were identi-\nfied, attached and auctioned by a court appointed custodian and disbursements were made.\n\nBanks had an exposure of %2000 crore in the Harshad Mehta Security Scam. Standard Chartered\nBank and State Bank of India had the maximum exposure among all banks in this scam. The banks have\nclaimed dues of more than %4000 crore along with interest. The custodian has so far disbursed 2000\ncrore to various banks (including 71000 crore to the SBI group) towards their exposure and losses and\n%6310 crore to the IT department.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "The 2001 Scam (Ketan Parekh Scam)\n\nAll over the world, investment in ICE (Information Technology, Communication and Entertainment)\nshares was the trend. Ketan Parekh colluded with promoters of the new economy (ICE) shares and\nchanged the complexion of the market by buying stock known as K-10 scrips. He succeeded in lifting\nscrips such as HFCL, Satyam, and Global to international P/E levels.\n\nParekh\u2019s modus operandi was to route orders through his three broking outfits and 40 satellite brokers.\nHe had contacts with brokers in Kolkata and Ahmedabad, who were rewarded with badla payments. His\nsource of funds was non-resident Indians and the new private sector banks who accepted shares as collat-\neral. He would pledge shares with banks as collaterals when the share prices were high. Mutual funds and\nforeign institutional investors, by investing heavily in technology stocks, helped KP scrips to rise high.\nHe placed shares of Satyam at a premium of %1,000 with UTI and the shares of HFCL for 71,400 with\nmutual funds and foreign institutional investors. Parekh would increase the liquidity of stock when there\nwas a strong demand or buy aggressively if one of the portfolio stocks fell.\n\nThe bull run started in May-November 1999 when Parekh started his first major round of trading\naggressively in HFCL, Global, Satyam, and Zee scrips. The Sensex rose from 3,378.4 to 4,491 points.\nThe Sensex peaked at 6,100 points before it started falling due to a global meltdown in ICE shares. There\nwas a sharp decline in prices due to factors such as the global economic slowdown, significant market\ncapitalization erosion at NASDAQ and other leading stock exchanges, and bear hammering on the Indian\nstock exchanges in sectors such as telecommunication, media, and information technology. The sudden,\nsharp fall in prices of these scrips resulted in a huge depletion in the margins on shares that were placed\nas securities with the banks. Consequently, the banks were, on the one hand, obliged to ask Parekh and\nhis associates to either pledge more shares as collateral or return some of the borrowed money, and on the\nother, they were driven to prop the prices by pumping more money into the capital market. This resulted\nin a financial crunch for some major bull operators, which led to disputes in the Kolkata Stock Exchange\n(CSE). The crisis snowballed as the Kolkata brokers took more long positions than Parekh. Trading at\nKolkata is 90 per cent unofficial. It is a cash bad/a market where %1,500-2,000 crore is rolled over every\nmonth at 21-30 per cent. As the circumstances developed, badla rates shot up to 80 per cent at the Kolkata\nstock exchange. So, Parekh defaulted on payment to Kolkata brokers which resulted in a payment crisis\nbetween March 12-17, 2001.\n\nSeventy CSE brokers defaulted as the exchange plunged into crisis. The bear cartel on the BSE, which\nwas bear hammering the market with inside information, was caught red-handed by the SEBI which sus-\npended all seven broker members from the BSE governing board.\n\nKetan Parekh desperately borrowed huge sums from the Ahmedabad-based Madhavpura Mercantile\nCooperative Bank (MMCB). The bank issued pay orders running into crores of rupees without receiving\ncash payment or collateral from Parekh. Pay orders are instruments issued between branches of a bank in\none place. They are issued after the issuing bank collects the cash or has significant collateral. Hence, the\ndiscounting bank is sure of collection. As Parekh colluded with Ramesh Parekh, the chairman of MMCB,\nthe latter issued pay orders without having a sufficient balance in the bank\u2019s accounts. The Bank of India\n(BOI) discounted %137 crore worth of pay orders which bounced. Ketan Parekh paid only &7 crore and\nthe BOI went to a criminal court against him. The Reserve Bank specifically prohibits cooperative banks\nto invest in the stock market or to lend to stockbrokers. However, the latter are free to lend to individuals\nagainst a pledge of shares upto %10 lakh per borrower if the shares are in a physical form and upto %20\nlakh if they are in a dematerialized form. MMCB flouted the norms of the Reserve Bank to earn higher\nrates of return.\n\nThe Crime Branch of India arrested Ketan Parekh on the charge of defrauding the BOI. The BSE\nSensex plummeted from a peak of 6,100 points to 3,788.2 on March 30, 2001. The SEBI banned all defer-\nral products, including badla, from all stock exchanges.\n",

Harshad Mehta exploited\npublic sector banks while Ketan Parekh misused the new private sector and cooperative bank funds. The\nHarshad Mehta scam indicated that capital market was free from checks and controls while the Ketan\nParekh scam indicated that scams could and would occur inspite of checks and controls. The major cause\nof the crisis in the Ketan Parekh scam was the financial crunch resulting from bear hammering which\ncaused a sharp fall in prices, while in 1992 crisis, the fall was an effect, not the cause of the crisis.\n\nThe Harshad Mehta scam was thought to be a bank scam rather than a securities scam as banks and\ninstitutions lost several thousand crores of rupees. It was the Harshad Mehta scam that prompted reform\nof the equity markets whereas the Ketan Parekh scam occurred when equity markets had radically trans-\nformed.

                        "extracted-text": "The Primary Capital Market\n\n* The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) was set up in early 1988 as a non-statutory body\nunder an administrative arrangement. It was given statutory powers in January 1992 through the\nenactment of the SEBI Act, 1992 for regulating the securities market. The two objectives mandated\nin the SEBI Act are investor protection and orderly development of the capital market.\n\nThe Capital Issues (Control) Act, 1947 was repealed in May 1992, allowing issuers of securities to\nraise capital from the market without requiring the consent of any authority either for floating an\nissue or pricing it. Restrictions on right and bonus issues were also removed. The interest rate on\ndebentures was freed. However, the new issue of capital has now been brought under the SEBI\u2019s\npurview and issuers are required to meet the SEBI guidelines for disclosure and investor protection,\nwhich are being strengthened from time to time to protect investor interest.\n\nThe infrastructure of the primary capital market has been fairly diversified over the years with the\nsetting up of a large number of merchant bankers, investment and consulting agencies, and registrars\nto the issue.\n\nThe primary capital market has widened and deepened with public sector banks, financial insti-\ntutions, and public sector enterprises in the infrastructure and power sectors increasingly raising\nresources from the market both by way of debt and equity.\n\nAlthough the process of institutionalization of the market on the supply side started in 1987-88 when\nmany mutual funds sponsored by banks and financial institutions were set up, it gained considerable\n\nmomentum in the early 1990s when many mutual funds were set up in the private sector. There are\nnow 37 mutual funds operating in the country with a total asset base of over @1 lakh crore.\n\nThe requirement to issue shares at a par value of 210 and 7100 was withdrawn. This gave companies\nthe freedom to determine a fixed value per share. This facility is available to companies which have\ndematerialized their shares. Moreover, the shares cannot be issued in the decimal of a rupee. The\ncompanies which have already issued shares at 710 or 2100 per value are also eligible for splitting\nand consolidating the share values.\n\nImproved disclosure standards, prudential norms, and simplified issue procedures have been pre-\nscribed. Companies are required to disclose all material facts, specific risk factors associated with\ntheir projects while launching public issues and give justification for pricing on their prospectus.\nThe offer document is not vetted by the SEBI but a code of advertisement for public issues, for\nensuring fair and truthful disclosures has been introduced.\n\nTo reduce the cost of the issue, underwriting by the issuer was made optional, subject to the condi-\ntion that if an issue was not underwritten and in case it failed to secure 90 per cent of the amount\noffered to the public, the entire amount so collected would be refunded.\n\nOne of the significant steps towards integrating the Indian capital market with the international capi-\ntal markets was the permission given to foreign institutional investors such as mutual funds, pen-\nsion funds, and country funds, to operate in the Indian market. Foreign institutional investors were\ninitially allowed to invest only in equity shares; later, they were allowed to invest in the debt market,\nincluding dated government securities and treasury bills. The ceiling for investment by foreign insti-\ntutional investors was increased from 40 per cent to 49 per cent in 2000-01. This increase can be\nmade with the approval of shareholders through a special resolution in the general body meeting.\nIndian companies have also been allowed to raise capital from the international capital markets\nthrough issues of Global Depository Receipts, American Depository Receipts, Foreign Currency\nConvertible Bonds (FCCBs) and External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs). Companies were per-\nmitted to invest all ADR/GDR proceeds abroad. Two-way fungibility was announced for ADRs/\nGDRs in 2000-01 for persons residing outside India. Converted local shares could be reconverted\ninto ADRs/GDRs while being subject to sectoral caps wherever applicable.\n\n* Various bottlenecks on the floatation of new capital issues, particularly for infrastructure projects,\nwere removed. Requirements such as making a minimum public offer of 25 per cent of the issue,\nfive shareholders per %1 lakh of offer, and a minimum subscription of 90 per cent are no longer\nmandatory for infrastructure companies.\n\nWith a view to helping infrastructure companies raise funds for their projects, their debt instru-\nments are allowed to be listed on the stock exchanges without prior listing of equity. Corporates\nwith infrastructure projects and municipal corporations are exempted from the requirements of\nRule 19(2)(b) of the Securities (Contracts) (Regulation) Act, 1956 to facilitate the public offer\nand listing of its pure debt instruments as well as debt instruments fully or partly convertible\ninto equity without requirement of prior listing of equity but are subject to conditions such as\ninvestment grade rating. The freedom to issue debt security without listing security granted to\ninfrastructure companies and municipal corporations has been extended to all companies. This is\nsubject to certain conditions. Issues below 7100 crore shall carry an investment grade credit rat-\ning, issues above %100 crore shall carry an investment grade credit rating from two credit rating\nagencies; the issues shall comply with the provisions of Rule 19(2)(b) of the Securities Contracts\n(Regulation) Act, 1956 regarding the size of the public offer and the promoters shall bring in the\nequity contribution of 20 per cent and lock in the same for three years.\n\nIn respect of unlisted companies, the existing requirement of a track record of dividend payment in\nat least three of the preceding five years for asking an initial public offer (IPO) has been relaxed.\nUnder the new norms, the companies will have to demonstrate an ability to pay dividend instead\nof showing an actual dividend paying record.\n\nMerchant bankers are prohibited from carrying on fund-based activities other than those related\nexclusively to the capital market. Multiple categories of merchant bankers have been abolished and\nthere is only one entity, the merchant banker.\n\nBesides merchant bankers, various other intermediaries such as mutual funds, portfolio managers,\nregistrars to an issue, share transfer agents, underwriters, debenture trustees, bankers to an issue,\ncustodian of securities, venture capital funds and issues have also been brought under the purview\nof the SEBI.\n\nSince 1998-99, banks are permitted within the ceiling of 5 per cent of incremental deposits of the\nprevious year prescribed for banks\u2019 investment in shares to (a) sanction bridge loans to companies\nagainst expected equity flows/issues for periods not exceeding one year and (b) extend loans to\n\n\ncorporates against shares held by them to enable them to meet promoters\u2019 contribution to the equity\nof new companies in anticipation of raising resources. The approval of the bank\u2019s board is neces-\nsary. The prescription of the minimum margin of 50 per cent of loans to individuals against prefer-\nence shares and debentures/bonds of corporate bodies is withdrawn. However, the margin of 50 per\ncent prescribed in respect of equity shares has been retained. Subsequently, the ceiling amount on\nadvances against shares to individuals was increased from 210 lakh to 20 lakh against dematerial-\nized securities while the minimum margin prescription was reduced from 50 per cent to 25 per cent\nfor dematerialized shares.\n\n+ A code of conduct on advertisement has been issued for mutual funds, banning them from making\nany assurance or claims that might mislead the public.\n\n* The entry norms for IPOs have been tightened by modifying the Disclosure and Investor Protection\n(DIP) guidelines. According to the new guidelines, IPOs five times the size of the pre-issue net worth\nare allowed only if the company has had a record of profitability and a net worth of @1 crore in three\nof the past 15 years. Companies without such a track record or a issue size beyond five times the pre-\nissue net worth are allowed to make IPOs only through the book-building route, with 60 per cent of the\nissue to be allotted to qualified institutional borrowers (QIBs). For shares issued on a preferential basis\nto any person by listing companies, a lock-in period of one year has been stipulated. Infrastructure\ncompanies are exempt from the requirement of eligibility norms if the project has been appraised by a\npublic financial institution and not less than 5 per cent of the project cost is being financed by any of\nthe institutions jointly or severally, by way of loans and/or subscription to equity.\nThe SEBI DIP (Disclosure and Investor Protection) Guidelines, 2000 have been amended. Permission\nhas been granted to foreign venture capital investors (FVCIs) registered with the SEBI and State\nIndustrial Development Corporations (SIDCs) to participate in public issues through the book-\nbuilding route as qualified institutional buyers (QIBs). There is no lock-in requirements for the pre-\nissue capital of an unlisted company held by venture capital funds (VCFs) and FVCIs. Exemption\nfrom the public offer requirement in view of a reduction in quantum from 25 per cent to 10 per cent\nand restriction of a minimum public issue size of 225 crore in respect of an IPO through the book-\nbuilding issue have been removed.\n\n+ Companies in the IT, telecom, media, and entertainment sectors are allowed to tap the market with a\nminimum offering of 10 per cent of their equity. All public issues through this route have to satisfy\nthe criterion of a minimum 2100 crore issue size, follow the book-building route with an allocation\nof 60 per cent to QIBs, and maintain a minimum floating post-listing stock on a continuous basis.\n\n+ The issuer can make a public or rights offer of shares in demat form only. Investors have the option\n\nof subscribing to securities in either the physical or the dematerialized form.\n\nEvery public-listed company making an IPO of any security for {10 crore or more is required to\n\nmake an offer only in a dematerialized form.\n\nThe SEBI prescribed new guidelines for regulating private placement of debt securities issued by\n\nthe corporates. These guidelines aim to enhance transparency and protect the interest of investors\n\nin the debt securities.\n\n+ The SEBI introduced the green-shoe option facility in IPOs as a stabilization tool for the post listing\nprice of newly issued shares.\n\n+ The Central Listing Authority was set-up to ensure uniform and standard practices for listing the\n\nsecurities on stock exchanges.\n\nIn 2001, the SEBI guidelines mandated a minimum level of public holding at 25 per cent for compa-\n\nnies carrying out with fresh IPOs. Companies in infotech, media, and telecom sector were allowed\n\nto go public with a 10 per cent public stake. In order to ensure availability of floating stocks on a\n\ncontinuous basis and maintain uniformity for the purpose of continuous listing, a minimum public\n\nshare-holding of 25 per cent was prescribed. This minimum 25 per cent public float would not only\nlead to an increase in the floating stock, but also to a higher public holding or control of shares\nwith investors other than promoters which would make manipulation of stock prices difficult and\nboost liquidity in the market. According to a capital market study, there are over 136 companies\nin \u2018A\u2019 group alone with less than 25 per cent public float. According to the data provided by the\n\nNational Stock Exchange, the average public holding in listed companies in India is only 13 per\n\ncent. Holding of Indian promoters in contrast is on an average as high as 48 per cent. Companies like\n\nWipro whose public holding is just 6.74 per cent, Bharti Airtel (1.17 per cent), TCS (5.19 per cent),\n\nand several state-owned companies such as MMTC (0.02 per cent), ONGC (1.82 per cent), SAIL\n\n(2.08 per cent), BHEL (2.23 per cent), and NTPC (2.57 per cent) will be impacted by this move. This\n\nfall in public float was on account of a substantial rise in open offers arising from hostile takeover\n\nbids and mergers and acquisitions in the last few years; SEBI gave a time frame of two years to\n\n\nmaintain this minimum level. Hence, to increase public stakes, promoters can either offload their\nexisting equity shares in the open market through an offer for sale or issue fresh shares. This move\nfailed to yield results as promoters resisted. In 2008, the government has made it mandatory for all\nlisted firms, which do not have a public shareholding of 25 per cent, to increase their shareholding\nannually by 3\u2014S per cent.\n\nIn March 2003, the SEBI introduced sweeping changes in IPO norms to boost investor confidence.\nIt changed the eligibility criteria for IPOs\u2014a track record of distributable profits was replaced by\nnet tangible assets as it felt that profit figures could be fudged. According to the new norms, compa-\nnies floating IPOs should have net tangible assets of \u00ae3 crore in each of the two preceding two years.\nOf this, not more than 50 per cent should be held in monetary assets\u2014cash or its equivalent such\nas securities, It is now mandatory for companies changing their names to ensure that a minimum\n50 per cent of the total revenues are derived from the business activity suggested by the new name.\nOn March 29, 2005, the SEBI redefined the retail individual investor as one who applies or bids\nfor securities of or for a value not exceeding %1 lakh. It hiked allocation for retail investors in a\nbook-built issue from 25 per cent to 35 per cent and reduced allocation to high networth individuals\n(non-institutional) category. The allocation to high net-worth individuals was reduced to 15 per cent\nfrom 25 per cent. The market regulator also reduced the bidding period for a book-built issue. The\nSEBI reduced the bidding period from the current 510 days (including holidays) to 3-7 working\ndays. It has given an option to listed issuers to either disclose price band in a red-herring prospectus!\nan application form/an abridged prospectus or to disclose the price band/floor price atleast one day\nbefore opening of the bid. In order to improve contents and ensure uniformity in data display on the\nwebsites of the stock exchanges, the data will be made available for a further period of 3 days after\nthe closure of the bid/issue. The new norms are applicable to all public issues whose offer docu-\nments are filed with the SEBI on or after April 4, 2005.\n\nFor issues priced below 500 per share, the face value of the share should mandatorily be 710 per share.\nBut if the issue price is %500 or more, the minimum face value should not go below @1.\n\nShares will now be allotted on a proportionate basis within the specified categories, with the pre-\ndetermined minimum allotment being equal to the minimum application size.\n\nDuring 2005-06 SEBI Disclosure and Investor Protection (DIP) Guidelines, 2000 relating to book-\nbuilding issues were amended to introduce a specific allocation of 5 per cent for mutual funds,\nproportionate allotment to Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs) and margin requirement for QIBs.\nIn order to ensure availability of floating stocks on a continuous basis and maintain uniformity for\nthe purpose of continuous listing, a minimum public shareholding of 25 per cent was prescribed by\nSEBI in case of all listed companies barring a few exceptions.\n\nTo assist the retail investors, SEBI gave in-principle approval for grading of IPOs by the rating agen-\ncies at the option of the issuers. SEBI will not certify the assessment made by the rating agencies.\nThe disclosure requirements were rationalized during the year. Listed companies which have a satis-\nfactory track record of filing periodic returns with the stock exchanges are exempted from repititive\ndisclosures in case of rights and public issues by them. An issuer company is permitted to make a\nrights issue by dispatching an abridged letter of offer which shall contain disclosures as required\nto be given in the case of an abridged prospectus. A listed company can fix and disclose the issue\nprice in case of a rights issue, any time prior to fixing of the record date in consultation with the\ndesignated stock exchange and in case of public issue through fixed price rate, at anytime prior to\nfiling of the prospectus with the Registrar of Companies. In order to facilitate additional resource\nmobilization, a company is permitted to issue further shares after filing a draft offer document with\nSEBI, provided full disclosures as regards the total capital to be raised from such further issues are\nmade in the draft offer document.\n\nThe facility of electronic clearing services (ECS) was extended to refunds arising out of public issue\nso as to ensure faster and hassle free refunds.\n\nCompanies are permitted to take multiple routes to raise capital at the same time, even after a pro-\nspectus for an IPO or public offer is filed with the regulator. Companies are now only required to\nupdate their prospectus with details about the additional capital being raised through other routes.\nThis new relaxation will help corporates to efficiently plan their capital-raising programmes.\nVenture Capital and private equity forms are barred to sell their stake in a company after its IPO.\nNow, only those firms that have invested more than a year before the company goes public can sell\ntheir shares on listing.\n\nFor public/rights issues of debt instruments, credit rating from one credit rating agency would be\nsufficient now which had to be done from at least two agencies before. This was done to reduce the\ncost of issuance of debt instruments.\n\n\nIssuance of bonds which are below investment grade will be allowed to the public to suit the risk/\nreturn appetite of investors. This was previously required to be of, at least, investment grade.\n\nIn order to enable listed companies to raise equity through rights and follow-on issues in a short span\nof time, SEBI amended the DIP guidelines. The issues by listed companies are known as fast track\nissues and there are guidelines for the same which are covered in the next chapter.\n\nSEBI has allowed companies to give discount of upto 10 per cent to retail investors in public offers.\nThis move would enable companies to obtain a more diversified shareholding and a good response\nfrom retail shareholders in a period of dull primary market scenario.\n\nAll investors, including retail investors are allowed to invest in Indian Depository Receipts (IDRs).\nThe minimum investment limit has been reduced from %2,00,000 to 220,000.\n\nSEBI launched an alternate payment system called Applications Supported by Blocked Amount\n(ASBA) for public and rights issues in August 2008.\n\nPAN has been mandatory in all public and rights issues irrespective of the application amount. SEBI\nexempted investors residing in the state of Sikkim from the mandatory requirement of PAN for the\npurpose of opening/operating Beneficial Owner (BO) accounts with depository participants and\ntrading in cash market, respectively.\n\nIn order to make regulatory requirements consistent across companies irrespective of post-issue\ncapitalization and to facilitate mid-size issuers who may not be in need of large funds, norms on\nminimum offer to public were revised.\n\nMinimum public shareholding requirement in case of public companies was enhanced to at least 25\npercent within a period of three years, i.e., by August 22, 2017.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Secondary Capital Market\n\n* The open outcry trading system, prevalent till 1995, was replaced by the on-line screen-based elec-\ntronic trading. In all, 23 stock exchanges have approximately 8,000 trading terminals spread all over\nthe country.\n\n+ Three new stock exchanges at the national level were set up in the 1990s. These were: the Over the\n\nCounter Exchange of India (1992), the National Stock Exchange of India (1994), and the Inter-\n\nconnected Stock Exchange of India (1999).\n\nTrading and settlement cycles were uniformly trimmed from 14 days to 7 days in all stock exchanges in\n\nAugust 1996. Rolling settlement (T+5) was introduced in January 1998 for the dematerialized segment\n\nof all companies. With effect from December 31, 2001, all scrips have come under rolling settlement.\n\nThe settlement cycle for all securities was shortened from T +5 to T +3, with effect from April 1, 2002.\n\nWith a view to maintaining integrity and ensuring safety of the market, various risk containment mea-\n\nsures have been initiated or strengthened, such as the mark to market margin system, intra-day trading\n\nlimit, exposure limit, and setting up of trade/settlement guarantee fund. Stock exchanges are allowed,\nsubject to conditions, to use the settlement guarantee funds (SGFs) for meting shortfalls caused by\nnon-fulfillment/partial fulfillment of the obligations by members, before declaring them defaulters.\n\nThe NSE set up a separate clearing corporation\u2014The National Securities Clearing Corporation\u2014to\n\nact as a counter-party to all trades executed in the capital market segment of the exchange.\n\nTo enhance the level of investor protection, the process of dematerialization of securities through the\n\ndepository system and their transfer through electronic book entry is pursued vigorously. To enable\n\nthis, the National Securities Depository Limited was set up in November 1996 and the Central\n\nDepository Service Limited in February 1999. All actively traded securities are held, traded, and\n\nsettled in demat form.\n\nBadla-the carry forward trading mechanism was reinstated in January 1996, with safeguards in line\n\nwith the recommendations of the Patel Committee (1995) and the Varma Committee (1996). The\n\ncash segment was strengthened with measures such as mandatory delivery under negotiated deals,\nsecurities lending, and continuous net settlement. All deferral products including badla have been\n\ndiscontinued from July 2001 following the scam of March 2001.\n\nIssuing companies are required to make continuing disclosures under the listing agreement. All\n\nlisted companies are required to furnish to stock exchanges and also publish unaudited financial\n\nresults on a quarterly basis. Disclosure of material information, which may have a bearing on the\nperformance/operations of a company, is also required to be made available to the public.\n\nOne of the most significant reforms in the secondary market is the measure to improve corporate\n\ngovernance. Corporate governance is a set of systems and processes designed to protect the interests\n\nof stakeholders. It is about commitment to values, ethical business conduct, and a high degree of\ntransparency. It is about creating and enhancing shareholder wealth while protecting the interests\n\nof all other stakeholders. The SEBI had appointed a committee under the chairmanship of Kumar\nMangalam Birla on corporate governance in India. The committee framed the codes for corporate\ngovernance and suggested the implementation of the code through stock exchanges.\n\nStock exchanges have also undergone some major structural reforms. The boards of various stock\nexchanges have been made broad-based so that they represent different interests and not just the\ninterests of their members. Stock exchanges, brokers, and sub-brokers have been brought under the\nregulatory purview of the SEBI.\n\nCompanies are allowed to buy back their own shares for capital restructuring, subject to the condi-\ntion that the buy back does not exceed 25 per cent of the paid-up capital and free reserves of the\nconcerned company. This buy back has been allowed to improve liquidity and enhance wealth of\nthe shareholder.\n\nThe insider trading regulations have been formulated prohibiting insider trading and making it a\ncriminal offence, punishable in accordance with the provisions under the SEBI Act, 1992.\nRegulations are also in place for take over and substantial acquisition of shares to make the take over\nprocess more transparent and mindful of the interests of small shareholders. In September 2002,\nthe SEBI amended the Takeover Code by accepting the Bhagwati Committee recommendations on\ntakeovers. As per the new code, if an acquirer gains control of over 15 per cent in a company which\nalready owns 15 per cent in another company, the acquirer has to declare open offers for sharehold-\ners of both the companies. Also, any change in management control will result in an open offer, even\nthough the equity stake is below 15 per cent. Shareholders can withdraw shares already tendered in\nan open offer and sell them in the open market or to another acquirer at a higher price. Acquirers\nnow have to disclose their holdings in companies at various levels of acquisitions such as 5 per cent,\n10 per cent, and 14 per cent. Once the holding touches the 15 per cent mark, the acquirer then has to\nmake disclosures at every 2 per cent acquisition, thereby ensuring full transparency in acquisition.\nAn index-based market wide \u2018circuit breaker\u2019 system has also been introduced to check a sudden\nrise in security price, in speculation and over-trading. This system becomes active at three stages of\nthe index movements either way, at 10 per cent,15 per cent and 20 per cent. As an additional measure\nof safety, individual scrips-wise bands of 20 per cent either way can be imposed for all securities\nexcept those available for stock options.\n\nIn February 1999, trading terminals were allowed to be set up abroad for facilitating market partici-\npation by non-residents. Internet trading was permitted in February 2000.\n\nFor ensuring greater market transparency, SEBI, in 1999, banned negotiated and cross deals (where\nboth the seller and buyer operate through the same broker). Moreover, all private off-market deals\nin both shares as well as listed corporate debts were banned. So these deals are routed only through\ntrading screens.\n\nSince June 2000, trading of futures has begun. Both the NSE and the BSE have created proper facili-\nties for derivatives trading, including conducting of regular training programmes for the same. The\nSecurities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 has been amended for introduction of options trading.\nTrading of index-based and stock-based options started in June and July 2001 respectively while\ntrading of stock-based futures began in November 2001.\n\nIt is mandatory for listed companies to announce quarterly results. This enables investors to keep\na close track of the scrips in their portfolios. The declaration of quarterly results is in line with the\npractice prevailing in the stock markets in developed countries.\n\nTo check price manipulation, mandatory client code and minimum floating stock for continuous\nlisting were stipulated in November 2001.\n\nThe government amended the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957 to standardise listing\nrequirements at stock exchanges.\n\nA 99 per cent value at risk (VaR) based margin system for all scrips in rolling settlement was intro-\nduced from July 2, 2001.\n\nThe central government has notified the establishment of the Investor Education and Protection\nFund (IEPF) with effect from October 1, 2001. The IEPF will be utilised for the promotion of aware-\nness amongst investors and protection of their interests.\n\nThe restriction on short sales announced in March 7, 2001, was withdrawn with effect from July 2,\n2001, as all deferral products stand banned after that date.\n\nIt is mandatory for all brokers to disclose all details of block deals. Block deals include trading\nwhich accounts for more than 0.5 per cent of the equity shares of that listed company.\n\nWith a view to providing greater liquidity in the secondary securities market, the SEBI allowed cor-\nporate brokers with a net worth of atleast &3 crore to extend margin trading facility to their clients\nin the cash segment of stock exchanges.\n\nA clearing corporation/clearing house, after registration with the SEBI, under the SEBI scheme for\n\nSecurities Lending and Borrowing, as an approved intermediary may borrow securities for meeting\n\nshortfalls in settlement on behalf of the member.\n\nThe SEBI has made it mandatory for every intermediary, to make an application for allotment of\n\nunique identification numbers for itself and for its related persons, under the SEBI (Central Data Base\n\nof Market Participants) Regulations, 2003. This move aims to promote up-to-date information about\n\nall market participants. This will be made mandatory for investors and companies at a later date.\n\nStock exchanges were advised to amend Clause 41 of the Listing Agreement to make it mandatory\n\nfor listed companies to publish the number of investor complaints received, disposed of, unresolved\n\nalong with quarterly results.\n\nClearing and settlement cycle time was further contracted to T+2 with effect from April 1, 2003.\n\nWith a view to strengthening the position, specifying accountability and protecting the interest of\n\ninvestors, the SEBI defined the roles of the chief executive officer and fund manager of mutual\n\nfunds.

                        "extracted-text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe primary market is a market for new issues. It is also called the new issues market. It is\na market for fresh capital. Funds are mobilized in the primary market through prospectus,\nrights issues, and private placement.\n\nBonus issue is also one of the ways to raise capital but it does not bring in any fresh\ncapital. Some companies distribute profit to existing shareholders by the way of fully paid\nbonus shares instead of paying them a dividend. Bonus shares are issued in the ratio of the\nexisting shares held. The shareholders do not have to pay for bonus shares but the retained\nearnings are converted into capital. Thus, bonus shares enable the company to restructure\nits capital.\n\nBonus is the capitalization of free reserves. Higher the free reserves, higher are the\nchances of a bonus issue forthcoming from a corporate. Bonus issues create excitement in\nthe market as the shareholders do not have to pay for them and in addition, they add to their\nwealth. A bonus issue results in an increase in the company\u2019s equity capital. A 1:1 bonus\ndoubles the company\u2019s equity base. A bonus issued by a company indicates management's\nconfidence in strong earnings, growth and maintenance of its present level of dividend rate\nin the future. Companies issue bonus shares for varied reasons.\n\n* To boost liquidity of their stock: A bonus issue results in expansion of equity base,\nincreasing the number of absolute shares available for trading.\n\n* To bring down the stock price: A high price often acts as a deterrent for a retail investor\nto buy a stock. The price of a stock falls on becoming ex-bonus because an investor\nbuying shares, ex-bonus is not entitled to bonus shares. For instance, a scrip trading at\n%600 cum-bonus with a 1:1 bonus begins trading at around %300 ex-bonus.\n\n+ To restructure their capital, companies with high reserves prefer to issue bonus shares\nas the issue not only restructures their capital but since they are perceived to be likely\ncandidates for bonus issue by investors, they fulfil the expectation of investors.\n\nIn India, new capital issues are floated through prospectus, rights, and private placement\nby government companies, non-government public limited companies (private sector), public\nsector undertakings, banks, and financial institutions.\n\nIssues are offered to the public through prospectus and the public subscribes directly. The\nCompanies Act 2013 provides that where the offer or invitation to subscribe for shares or\ndebentures is made to 200 or more persons, then such an offer or invitation shall be deemed\nto be a public offering and shall have to comply with all the provisions of the act as well as\nthe SEBI guidelines applicable to such public offerings. Public issuesare open to the general\npublic. Wide publicity about the offer is given through the media. In the past, the job of\norganizing public issues was generally entrusted to prominent brokers but that practice has\nnow given way to the appointment of a merchant banker for the purpose.\n\nThe direct sale of securities by a company to some select people or to institutional investors\nis called private placement. No prospectus is issued in private placement. Private placement\ncovers equity shares, preference shares, and debentures. It offers access to capital more\nquickly than the public issue and is quite inexpensive on account of the absence of various\nissue related expenses.\n\n\nThere are three categories of participants in the primary market. They are the issuers of securities,\ninvestors in securities, and intermediaries. The last named render services to both the issuers and investors\nto enable the sale and purchase of securities.\n",

Companies had to obtain approval from the CCI for raising funds in\nthe primary market. The timing, quantum, and pricing of the issue were decided by the controller. New\ncompanies could issue shares only at par, while the existing companies with substantial reserves could\nissue shares at a premium. This premium was based on a prescribed formula set by the CCI. The formula\nwas based on balancing the two criteria, viz., the net assets value and price earnings value. The issue\nprice was set far below the market price of the company\u2019s share. This fixed price mechanism resulted in\nunderpricing of many issues.\n\nIn 1992, the Capital Issues (Control) Act, 1947 was repealed and all controls relating to raising of\nresources from the market were removed. Hence, now the promoters (issuers of securities) do not require\nthe consent of any authority either for making the issue or for pricing it. The promoter and his merchant\nbanker together decide the price of the issue. Both new and established companies are free to decide the\nprice of their issue.\n\nThere emerged under free pricing, an alliance of dishonest promoters and greedy merchant bankers.\nThey brought out issues with rosy but unreal projections and sold shares at very high premiums. These\nprojections never materialized, leading to a crash in prices. Moreover, companies with a negative bottom\nline came back with repeated rights issues at a premium. Issues of all kinds and premiums unheard of\nin corporate history were made in the early days of free pricing. These issues killed the primary market.\nMost of these issues were quoted below their offer price on the day they were listed at the stock exchange.\nOf the 4,000 issues that hit the market in 1992-96, more than 3,000 quoted below their offer price on the\nvery day they were listed. For example, Saurashtra Cements hit the market in September 1993 at 250 per\nshare. It stood at $85 when it was listed on the stock exchange; today it fetches only 8. The free market\nbecame a free falling market in numerous cases.\n\nThe regulator brought in strict regulations for merchant bankers, brokers, and others, and laid down\nguidelines for full disclosures for investors\u2019 protection. Unfortunately, this was done only when the small\ninvestors had fled the market. Today promoters are required to justify the issue price in the prospectus and\nmake material disclosures about the risk factors in the offer document.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "BOOK BUILDING\u2014A NEW ISSUE MECHANISM IN INDIA\n\nThe mechanics of determining the offer price during the CCI regime was to offer the share at a fixed price.\nHere, the firm and the merchant banker decided an offer price without taking into account the investor's\nfeedback. Fixed price offerings were made to uninformed investors. Moreover, there was a long time lag\nfrom the date of pricing to the date the issue opened, and to the date trading commenced. This raised the pos-\nsibility of price fluctuations in the intervening period. Empirical evidence supports the view that fixed price\noffering results in high cost of capital for firms due to under-pricing of shares for attracting subscription.\n\nThe pricing pattern changed in the free pricing era. This era was characterized by unrealistic and\nabrupt pricing structure, which stripped the radiance of the capital market. Investors shied away from the\nmarket after burning their fingers in those premium issues that are now being quoted not only below their\nissue price but even below their par value.\n\nFollowing the inefficient functioning of the capital market system, an alternative method, called the\nbook building method, is slowly becoming popular in India. Book building is a mechanism through which\nan offer price for IPOs based on the investors\u2019 demand is determined. In the fixed price method, the inves-\ntors\u2019 demand is not taken into account; the book building method explicitly uses investors\u2019 demand for\nshares at various prices as an important input to arrive at an offer price.\n\nGlobally, book building is a recognized mechanism for capital raising. It was book building which\nbuilt the US market almost entirely in the 1940s and 1950s.\n\nThe SEBI guidelines define book building as a process undertaken by which a demand for the securi-\nties proposed to be issued by a corporate body is elicited and built-up and the price for such securities\nis assessed for the determination of the quantum of such securities to be issued by means of a notice,\ncircular, advertisement, document or information, memoranda or offer document.\n\nThe book building is basically an auction of shares. Book building essentially means that the \u2018book is\nbeing built.\u2019 During the process on both the NSE and the BSE, investors can watch the book being built\u2014\na chart shown indicates the bid price and the number of shares being bid for. This helps the investor to\nknow the market price. It offers investors the opportunity to bid collectively. It then uses the bids to arrive\nat a consensus price.\n\nThe issue of securities through book building prior to August 2009 could be done in either of the fol-\nlowing two ways: 75 per cent book building known as partial book building and 100 per cent known as\none-stage book building. The SEBI allowed partial book building with only 75 per cent of the total issue\nallotted for the book built portion; the remaining 25 per cent has to be compulsorily offloaded in the gen-\neral market at a fixed price discovered during the book building process. The IPOs of Hughes Software\nand HCL Technologies are examples of partial book building which were successful. A 100 per cent\nbook building issue implies that the entire issue is completed in a single stage, without having to make\na mandatory fixed price offering. The option of 100 per cent book building was available only to those\nissuer companies which are to make an issue of capital of and above 7100 crore. Due to these restrictive\nguidelines, no issue was floated using this mechanism. These guidelines were modified in 1998-99. The\nceiling of issue size for book building was reduced from 100 crore to %25 crore.

It raised 834 crore through 100 per cent book building in\n2001-02. The 100 per cent book building route speeds up the public offering and allotment processes as\nthey take place entirely through the stock exchange network. The National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the\nBombay Stock Exchange(BSE) provide a real time graphic display of price and volumes of applications\nmade towards a book building issue through the stock exchange network. This system aids in better price\ndiscovery and transparency as institutional investors have the necessary expertise to analyse the informa-\ntion. The 100 per cent book building route provides the option to defer or scrap the issue if the discovered\nprice is inappropriate. Because most issuers preferred 100 per cent book building, the SEBI withdrew the\n75 per cent book building option.\n",

A \u2018syndicate member\u2019\nmeans an intermediary registered with the SEBI and who is permitted to carry on the activity as an\nunderwriter;\n\nThe details of final underwriting arrangement indicating actual numbers of shares underwritten shall\nbe disclosed and printed in the prospectus before it is registered with the Registrar of Companies.\n\n* The issuer shall enter into an agreement with one or more of the stock exchange(s) which have\nthe system of on-line offer of securities. The agreement shall specify inter-alia, the rights, duties,\nresponsibilities, and obligations of the issuer and recognized stock exchange(s) inter se.\n\n* The book runner(s)/syndicate members shall appoint stock brokers who are members of the\nrecognized stock exchange and registered with the SEBI, for the purpose of accepting bids,\napplications and placing orders with the issuer and ensure that the stock brokers so appointed\nare financially capable of honouring their commitments arising out of defaults of their clients/\ninvestors, if any. In case of Application Supported by Blocked Amount, Self-certified Syndicate\nBanks shall also accept and upload the details of such applications in electronic bidding system\nof the stock exchange(s). A \u2018Self-certified Syndicate Bank\u2019 means a banker to an issue registered\nwith the SEBI, which offers the facility of Application Supported by Blocked Amount. The stock\nbrokers and Self-certified Syndicate Bank accepting applications and application monies shall be\ndeemed as \u2018bidding/collection centres.\u2019\n\nThe underwriters also collect information from potential buyers and attempts to build interest. Part\nof the process of collecting this information is a road show, so named because the underwriter goes from\ncity to city making presentations about the company and the offering. The road show is conducted in the\nform of a press release, a broker-analyst meet and investor meet.\n\n+ The lead merchant banker shall file with the SEBI a draft red herring prospectus containing all the\ndisclosures including total issue size, if applicable, except the price and the number of specified\nsecurities to be offered.\n\n+ Book building was first introduced in 1999 with the concept of a price band. Price band includes the\nfloor price and the cap price. For instance, the PNB issue\u2019s price band was 7350-390. %350 is the\nfloor price-the minimum bid\u2014and 390 is the cap price. Investors can bid at any price between %350\nand %390. However, in April 2000, the SEBI moved to the concept of a fixed floor price, which led to\nunderpricing as maximum bids were received at or just above the floor price. The SEBI reintroduced\nthe moving price band concept in book built IPOs. In a moving price band, the range can be moved,\nupwards or downwards, depending on the demand and the direction in which the book is being built.\nThe band can be moved by 20 per cent (earlier 50 per cent) either way.\n\n+ The issuer may mention the floor price or price band in the red herring prospectus.\n\na. If the issuer opts not to make the disclosure of the price band or floor price in the red herring\nprospectus, the following shall also be disclosed in the red herring prospectus:\n\ni. a statement that the floor price or price band, as the case may be, shall be disclosed at\n\nleast two working days (in case of an initial public offer) and at least one working day\n\n(in case of a further public offer) before the opening of the bi\n\n\nii. a statement that the investors may be guided in the meantime by the secondary market\nprices (in case of a further public offer); and\niii. the names and editions of the newspapers where the announcement of the floor price or\nprice band would be made; names of websites (with address), journals, or other media in\nwhich the said announcement will be made.\n\nb. Where the issuer decides to opts for price band instead of floor price, the issuer shall also\n\nensure compliance with the following conditions:\n\ni. The spread between the floor and the cap of the price band should not be more than 20\nper cent. In other words, the cap should not be more than 120 per cent of the floor price.\nThis price band denotes the range of bidding.\n\n|. The price band can be revised during the bidding period in which case the maximum\nrevision on either side shall not exceed 20 per cent, i.e., floor of price band can move up\nor down to the extent of 20 per cent of floor of the price band disclosed in the red herring\nprospectus and the cap of the revised price band will be fixed in accordance with clause\n(i) above.\n\niii. Any revision in the price band shall be widely disseminated by informing the stock\nexchanges, by issuing press release, and also by indicating the change on the relevant\nwebsite and the terminals of the syndicate members.\n\niv. In case the price band is revised, the bidding period shall be extended to a maximum of\nten working days.\n\nv. The manner in which the shortfall, if any, in the project financing, arising on account of\nlowering of price band to the extent of 20 per cent will be met shall be disclosed in the red\nherring prospectus. It shall also be disclosed that the allotment shall not be made unless\nthe financing is tied up.\n\n* The basis for issue price, floor price, or price band, as the case may be, shall be disclosed and\njustified by the issuer in consultation with the lead merchant banker on the basis of the following\ninformation, which shall be also disclosed separately:\n\na. Earnings per share and diluted earnings per share, pre-issue, for the last three years (as adjusted\nfor changes in capital).\n\nPrice earning ratio pre-issue.\n\nAverage return on net worth in the last three years.\n\nMinimum return on increased net worth required to maintain pre-issue earnings per share.\n\nNet asset value per share based on last balance sheet.\n\nNet asset value per share after issue and comparison thereof with the issue price.\n\nmeee\n\nComparison of all the accounting ratios of the issuer as mentioned in items (a) to (f) above with the\nindustry average and with the accounting ratios of the peer group (i.e., companies of comparable size in\nthe same industry and the source from which industry average and accounting ratios of the peer group\nhas been taken shall be indicated).\n\nThe face value of equity shares and the statement that the issue price, floor price, or price band, as the\ncase may be, is \u2018X\u2019 times of the face value. Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956, the Act\nand these regulations, an issuer making an initial public offer may determine the face value of the equity\nshares in the following manner:\n\n1. If the issue price per equity share is 8500 or more, the issuer shall have the option to determine\nthe face value at less than %10 per equity share provided that the face value shall not be less than\none rupee per equity share.\n\n2. If the issue price per equity share is less than %500, the face value of the equity shares shall be\n710 equity share.\n\nProvided that nothing contained in this sub-regulation shall apply to initial public offer made by any gov-\nernment company, statutory authority or corporation or any special purpose vehicle set up by any of them,\nwhich is engaged in infrastructure sector.\n\nIn case the option of differential pricing under Regulation 29 has been availed, justification for the\nprice difference shall be given in the offer document. An issuer may offer specified securities at different\nprices, subject to the following:\n\n1. Retail individual investors or retail individual shareholders may be offered specified securities at\na price lower than the price at which net offer is made to other categories of applicants provided\nthat such difference shall not be more than 10 per cent of the price at which specified securities\nare offered to other categories of applicants.\n\n2. Incase ofa book built issue, the price of the specified securities offered to an anchor investor shall\nnot be lower than the price offered to other applicants.\n\n3. In case of a composite issue, the price of the specified securities offered in the public issue may\nbe different from the price offered in rights issue and justification for such price difference shall\nbe given in the offer document.\n\nWhenever fully convertible debt instruments (FCDs) are issued bearing interest at a rate less than the\nbank rate, the offer document shall contain disclosures about the price that would work out to the investor,\ntaking into account the notional interest loss on the investment from the date of allotment of FCDs to the\ndate(s) of conversions.\n\n+ A public issue shall be kept open for at least three working days but not more than ten working days,\nincluding the days for which the issue is kept open in case of revision in price band. In case the price\nband in a public issue made through the book building process is revised, the bidding (issue) period\ndisclosed in the red herring prospectus shall be extended for a minimum period of three working\ndays provided that the total bidding period shall not exceed ten working days. In other words, a bid is\nusually open for three and not more than seven working days, which may be extended to a maximum.\nof ten working days, in case the price band is revised.\n\n+ The issuer shall, after registering the red herring prospectus (in case of a book built issue) or prospec-\ntus (in case of fixed price issue) with the Registrar of Companies, make a pre-issue advertisement\nin one English national daily newspaper with wide circulation, Hindi national daily newspaper with\nwide circulation, and one regional language newspaper with wide circulation at the place where the\nregistered office of the issuer is situated. The pre-issue advertisement shall include the following\ndetails: name and address of the registered office of the issuer and the lead book runner/merchant\nbankers, and details of the issue such as nature of the specified security, size of the issue, face value\nof the security, price band, the proportion of shares to be allotted to different categories of investors\nincluding anchor investor, proposed listing, disclaimer clause, time period of the opening and clos-\ning of the issue, IPO grading, and names of the bankers to the issue. The issue advertisements shall\nalso disclose the financial ratios calculated for both upper and lower end of the price band.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Applications Supported by Blocked Amount (ASBA) Process\n\nThe SEBI launched an alternate payment system for book built public issues in August 2008. The alter-\nnate payment system, called additional mode of payment through ASBA, exempts retail investors from\nmaking full advance payment and instead let the amount to be retained in bank accounts till the comple-\ntion of allotment. This system co-exists with the current process, wherein cheque is used as a mode of\npayment by retail investors. ASBA can be used only for retail investors and on an optional basis.\n\nASBA is an application for subscribing to an issue, containing an authorization to block the applica-\ntion money in a bank account. This system does away with the refund process and thereby reduces the\ntime between an issue and its listing. ASBA Process is as follows:\n\n+ An ASBA investor shall submit an ASBA physically or electronically through the internet banking\nfacility to the Self-certified Syndicate Bank (SCSB) with whom the bank account to be blocked is\nmaintained. SCSB is a bank which offers the facility of applying through the ASBA process. ASBAs\ncan be accepted only by SCSBs, whose names appear in the list of SCSBs displayed in SEBI\u2019s website.\n\n* The SCSB shall then block the application money in the bank account specified in the ASBA, on the\n\nbasis of an authorization to this effect given by the account holder in the ASBA. The application money\n\nshall remain blocked in the bank account till finalization of the basis of allotment in the issue or till\nwithdrawal/failure of the issue or till withdrawal/rejection of the application, as the case may be.\n\nThe SCSB shall upload the details in the electronic bidding system of the BSE or NSE.\n\n\u2018Once the basis of allotment is finalized, the Registrar to the Issue shall send an appropriate request\n\nto the SCSB for unblocking the relevant bank accounts and for transferring the requisite amount to\n\nthe issuer's account. In case of withdrawal/failure of the issue, the amount shall be unblocked by the\n\nSCSB on receipt of information from the pre-issue merchant bankers.\n\nThe public issue of 20 microns was the first IPO to hit the market in September 2008 with ASBA facil-\nity for retail investors.\n\nThe SCSBs work as a single window intermediary \u2014 they collect applications, block application money\nin the investors\u2019 bank accounts, debit the investors\u2019 accounts, and transfer money to the escrow account on\nallotment of shares. The SCSB also sends aggregate information of total number of applications, shares\nbid for and amount to the registrar who will then reconcile the data and verify it for correctness with\ndepository\u2019s data base. Thus, ASBA has simplified the share application and refund process.\n\nThe SEBI extended the ASBA facility to rights issues, The rights issues of TATA Motors and Sadhana\nNitro Chem were the first to make use of this facility when the issues opened on September 29, 2008. In\ncase of rights issues, all shareholders would be able to make use of this facility while in book-built public\nissues, it is the retail shareholders only who can make use of this facility. ASBA process in rights issue\nwill enable a shareholder of the company as on record date to apply through ASBA mode by selecting\nthe option of ASBA in the application form of rights issue to the SCSB with whom the bank account to\nbe blocked is maintained. The rest of the process is similar to that of IPOs.\n\nThe SEBI extended this payment mode to all investors in public issues opening on or after May 1,\n2010. The SEBI extended ASBA facility to the investors subscribing to new fund offers (NFOs) of mutual\nfund schemes launched on or offer July 1, 2010. In order to increase the spread and enhance the reach\nof ASBA the non-retail investors i.e, qualified institutional buyers and non-institutional investors (HNIs)\nmaking application in public/rights issues have mandatorily to make use ASBA facility.\n\nPresently more than 99.5 per cent of the applications are received from centres where the application\nsupported by blocked amount (ASBA) facility is available.\n\nIn order to substantially enhance the points for submission of applications, registrar and share transfer\nagents (RTAs) and depository participants (DPs) will also be allowed to accept application forms (both\nphysical as well as on line) and make bids on the stock exchange platform. This will be over and above\nthe stock brokers and banks where such facilities are already available.\n\nThe system was made effective for public issues which opened on or after January 01, 2016.\n",

Allocation to qualified institutional buyers was determined by the book running lead manager\n(BRLM) based on issues like prior commitment, investor quality, price aggression, and earliness of bids.\nSEBI banned discretionary allotments and introduced proportionate allotments in the QIB portion.\n\nIn case of book built issues, the basis of allotment is finalized by the BRLM within two weeks from the\ndate of closure of the issue. The allotment of shares is done on a proportionate basis within the specified\ncategories, rounded off to the nearest integer, with predetermined minimum allotment being equal to the\nminimum application size. Under the earlier guidelines, if an issue was oversubscribed, applicants were\nchosen by drawing lots and allotted a minimum of 100 shares per minimum tradeable lot.\n\nThe registrar then ensures that the demat credit or refund as applicable is completed within 15 days of\nthe closure of the issue. The listing on the stock exchanges is done within seven days from the finalization\nof the issue.\n\n",

The anchor investor subscribes to the issue prior to its public opening, pay an upfront margin of\n25 per cent and follows it up with the remaining 75 per cent within two days of the closure of the public\nissue, and holds the shares for atleast one month which instills confidence in retail investors and boosts\nthe primary market. The anchor investor would be a qualified institutional buyer (QIB) and an issuer can\nallot up to 30 per cent of its institutional quota to such investors.The anchor investor/s cannot be related\nto the promoter or promoter group or the lead managers.\n\nThe Adani Power IPO in July 2009 was the first issue in the country to attract investors under the anchor\ninvestor scheme. The six anchor investors were T Rowe Price, AIC, Ecofin, TPG (through CLSA), Legg\nMason, and Sundaram MF. SKS Micro Finance attracted 36 anchor investor in its IPO issue in August 2010.\n\nThe guidelines provide various conditions for bringing in anchor investors in public issues:\n\n1. An anchor investor shall make an application of a value of at least 710 crore in the public issue.\n2. Allocation to anchor investors shall be on a discretionary basis and subject to the following:\ni, Maximum of 2 such investors shall be permitted for allocation upto 710 crore;\nii. Minimum of 2 and maximum of 15 such investors shall be permitted for allocation above 710\ncrore and upto 7250 crore, subject to minimum allotment of 25 crore per such investor;\n\n. In case of allocation beyond %250 crore, there can be ten additional anchor investors for every\nadditional allocation of %250 crore subject to a minimum allotment of %5 crore per anchor\ninvestor. This step will help issuers who intend to raise large amounts of funds.\n\n3. Upto 60 per cent of the portion available for allocation to qualified institutional buyers shall be\n\navailable to anchor investor(s) for allocation/allotment (anchor investor portion).\n\n}. One-third of the anchor investor portion shall be reserved for domestic mutual funds.\n\n. The bidding for anchor investors shall open one day before the issue opening date.\n\n. Anchor investors shall pay a margin of at least 25 per cent on application with the balance to be\n\npaid within two days of the date of closure of the issue.\n\n7. Allocation to anchor investors shall be completed on the day of bidding by anchor investors\n\naus\n\n10.\n\n1.\n\n. If the price fixed as a result of book building is higher than the price at which the allocation is\n\nmade to anchor investor, the anchor investor shall bring in the additional amount. However, if the\nprice fixed as a result of book building is lower than the price at which the allocation is made to\nanchor investor, the excess amount shall not be refunded to the anchor investor and the anchor\ninvestor shall take allotment at the price at which allocation was made to it.\n\n). The number of shares allocated to anchor investors and the price at which the allocation is made,\n\nshall be made available in public domain by the merchant banker before opening of the issue.\nThere shall be a lock-in of 30 days on the shares allotted to the anchor investor from the date of\nallotment in the public issue.\n\nNeither the merchant bankers nor any person related to the promoter/promoter group/merchant\nbankers in the concerned public issue can apply under anchor investor category. The parameters\nfor selection of anchor investor shall be clearly identified by the merchant banker and shall be\navailable as part of records of the merchant banker for inspection by the SEBI.\n\n.

The lead manager\nmakes a market in the paper by offering two-way quotes on the secondary market, till trading picks up.\nThere are no such provisions in the Indian book building process.\n\nIn India, unlike in the developed markets, the book building process is still dependent on good faith.\nThe numbers of investors invited to apply are limited and it is the peer pressure and reputation that\nensures that there are no defaults. Book building relies on much interaction among firms, merchant\nbankers, and investors, which is absent in India.\n\nThere is a lack of transparency at critical steps of the book building process and the absence of\nstrong regulation.\n\nSince the price fixed for the public portion as well as for the placement portion is the same, issues\nmay not succeed in inviting the desired public response.\n\nIt has not proved to be a good price discovery mechanism. Many issues have been listed below their\nissue price.\n\nIssuers may have to sell cheap due to the collective bargaining power of institutions.\n\nHigh institutionalized holding may affect the stock\u2019s liquidity and make it volatile as well in case of\nbulk offloading.\n\nThe role of retail investors in determining the pricing decreases. Moreover, retail investors may not\nhave the information to judge the issue and thus, may not be able to arrive at the correct pricing.\nThe limits fixed are fungible and can be altered depending upon market conditions. If there is a low\nretail demand, more than 75 per cent of the issue size is allocated to institutional investors.\n\nMost book built IPOs, since 1999, have fared badly on the stock market\u201418 out of 19 are currently\ntraded below their issue price. Only Balaji Telefilms is traded at a premium. The SEBI needs to re-\nexamine the entire book building process at the operational level and, if need be, modify its guidelines.\nThe book building system of ascertaining the cut-off price and the allocation to each applicant discrimi-\nnate between return and institutional investors. It is heavily loaded against the retail or the high net worth\ninvestors to the advantage of qualified institutional buyers (QIBs). Institutional investors can revise their\nbids, both quantity-wise as well as on the price, and back their bids with margin money up front and not\nthe entire amount. This preferential treatment is not available to retail investors who have to back their\nbids with funds. Moreover, the merchant bankers to the issue have the discretion to allot to the institu-\ntional investors which results in a small proportional allotment to retail investors.\n\n+ The share of public offer in total capital has been reduced from 75 per cent to 25 per cent and in\nsome cases, to 10 per cent. Effectively, retail now is allotted only 8.75 per cent (35 per cent of\n25 per cent) and 3.5 per cent (35 per cent of 10 per cent) of a company\u2019s total capital.\n\n* Book building is thrust upon the retail investors even though they cannot discover price. Institutional\ninvestors have the support of information and research that aids in price discovery.\n\n+ Many scrips prices rise/fall after listing and this reflects the extent of underpricing/overpricing.\nHence, a more effective price discovery is needed to avoid underpricing/overpricing.\n",

In the regular book built issue, investors have to bid within\nthe price band quoted by the merchant banker. This price band may not always represent the fair value.\nHence, many issues have quoted at a discount in the post-listing trading sessions. Pure auction makes book\nbuilding more market oriented and improves the price discovery process by allowing investors, rather than\ncompanies, to decide on the pricing of the issue. In pure auction, institutional bidders are free to bid at any\nprice above the floor price mentioned by the company and allotment of shares will be done on a top down\nbasis, starting from the highest bidder. Hence, each institutional investor could have a different allotment\nprice. However, retail individual investors and non-institutional investors in such cases would be allotted\nshares at the floor price. The SEBI has permitted the issuer to place a cap in terms of the number of shares\nallotted to a single bidder and percentage to issued capital of the company in order that a single bidder\ndoes not garner all shares on offer and there is wider distribution. The biggest advantage of this is that it\nwill bring down the institutional investors\u2019 oversubscription, as the institutional investors will bid for the\nquantity they intend to purchase and at a price which they are willing to purchase which will be above\nthe floor price. They may quote a higher price to get a big block of shares at a single price. SEBI has not\nmade it mandatory for companies coming out with follow-on public issues and it has given a choice to the\ncompanies\u2014they can either opt for the book building or go for the pure auction or a combination of both.\n",

It is just similar to reverse auctions. This process helps in discovering the exit\nprice and is used by companies who want to buy-back shares from the shareholders.\n\nThe process for reverse book building is as follows:\n\n* The acquiring company secures board and shareholders approval to delist the shares.\n\n+ The acquirer shall appoint a designated BRLM to execute the process.\n\n+ The BRLM decides the floor price and the dates for inviting bids from the shareholders. The floor\n\nprice shall not be less than the following: (a) where the equity shares are frequently traded in\n\nall the recognized stock exchanges where they are listed, the average of the weekly high and low of\nthe closing prices of the equity shares of the company during the 26 weeks or 2 weeks preceding\nthe date on which the recognized stock exchanges were notified of the board meeting in which the\ndelisting proposal was considered, whichever is higher, as quoted on the recognized stock exchange\nwhere the equity shares of the company are most frequently traded; (b) where the equity shares of\nthe company are infrequently traded in all or some of the recognized stock exchanges, the floor\nprice shall be determined by the BRLM taking into account the following factors: (i) the highest\nprice paid by the promoter for acquisitions, if any, of equity shares of the class sought to be delisted,\n\nincluding by way of allotment in a public or rights issue or preferential allotment, during the 26\n\nweeks period prior to the date on which the recognized stock exchanges were notified of the board\n\nmeeting in which the delisting proposal was considered and after that date upto the date of the public\nannouncement; and, (ii) other parameters including return on net worth, book value of the shares of\nthe company, earning per share, price earning multiple vis-A-vis the industry average.\n\nThe acquiring company shall, upon receipt of in principle approval for delisting from the recognized\n\nstock exchange, make a public announcement in at least one English national daily with wide circu-\n\nlation, one Hindi national daily with wide circulation, and one regional language newspaper of the\nregion where the concerned recognized stock exchange is located.\n\n+ Before making the public announcement, the acquiring company shall open an escrow account and deposit\ntherein the total estimated amount of consideration calculated on the basis of floor price and number of equity\nshares outstanding with public shareholders. The escrow account shall consist of either cash deposited with a\nscheduled commercial bank, or a bank guarantee in favour of the merchant banker, or a combination of both.\n\n+ The acquiring company shall despatch the letter of offer to the public shareholders of equity shares,\nnot later than 45 working days from the date of the public announcement, so as to reach them at\nleast 5 working days before the opening of the bidding period. The letter of offer shall be sent to all\npublic shareholders holding equity shares of the class sought to be delisted whose names appear\non the register of the company or depository as on the date specified in the public announcement.\n\n* The date of opening of the offer shall not be later than 55 working days from the date of the public\nannouncement. The offer shall remain open for a minimum period of three working days and a maxi-\nmum period of five working days, during which the public shareholders may tender their bids.\nBidding will be done only in the electronic form and through the stock exchanges trading mechanism.\nThe holders of physical equity shares may send their bidding form together with the share certificate\nand transfer deed to the trading member appointed for the purpose, who shall immediately after\nentering their bids on the system send them to the company or the share transfer agent for confirm-\ning their genuineness. The company or the share transfer agent shall deliver the certificates which\nare found to be genuine to the merchant banker, who shall not make it over to promoter unless the\nbids in respect thereof are accepted and payment made. The bids in respect of the certificates which\nare found to be not genuine shall be deleted from the system.\n\n+ The BRLM will give the list of trading members who are eligible to participate in the reverse book\n\nbuilding process to the stock exchange.\n\nBids will be placed through trading members at the bidding centres, whom the public shareholders\n\nmay approach for placing bids on the on-line electronic system and will have to be made at or above\n\nthe floor price.\n\nThere is no cap on the bid price and revision of bids is possible. The shareholders may withdraw or\n\nrevise their bids upwards not later than one day before the closure of the bidding period. Downward\n\nrevision of bids is not permitted.\n\n* The acquiring company shall not be bound to accept the equity shares at the offer price determined\n\nby the book building process. Where the acquiring company decides not to accept the offer price\n\nso determined:\n\na. The company shall not acquire any equity shares tendered pursuant to the offer and the equity\nshares deposited or pledged by a shareholder shall be returned or released to him within ten\nworking days of closure of the bidding period.\n\nb. The company shall not make the final application to the exchange for delisting of the equity\nshares.\n\nc. The promoter may close the escrow account.\n\nd. Ina case where the public shareholding at the opening of the bidding period was less than\nthe minimum level of public shareholding required under the listing agreement, the acquiring\ncompany shall ensure that the public shareholding shall be brought up to such minimum level\nwithin a period of six months from the date of closure of the bidding.\n\nWithin eight working days of closure of the offer, the BRLM shall make a public announcement in\n\nthe same newspapers in which the public announcement was made regarding:\n\na. the success of the offer alongwith the final price accepted by the acquirer; or\n\nb. the failure of the offer;\n\nc. rejection of the final price discovered by the promoters.\n\n+ Where, pursuant to acceptance of equity shares tendered in terms of these regulations, the equity shares are\ndelisted, any remaining public shareholder holding such equity shares may tender his shares to the promoter\nupto a period of at least one year from the date of delisting and, in such a case, the promoter shall accept\nthe shares tendered at the same final price at which the earlier acceptance of shares was made. The payment\nof consideration for shares accepted shall be made out of the balance amount lying in the escrow account.\n\nThe reverse book building route is a difficult and costly process. Price discovery is a problem in case of\nsmall companies as their shares are thinly traded, making it difficult to delist through the reverse book\nbuilding route. Unless the shares are delisted, the small companies have to pay all listing charges.\n\nSEBI (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations, 2009 (Voluntary and Compulsory Delisting of\nEquity Shares)\n\nCHAPTER |\n\nDefinitions:\n1.

Green-shoe option is an option\nof over-allotting shares by an issuer to the underwriter in a public offering to provide post-listing price\nstability to an initial public offering. This option is to the extent of 15 per cent of the issue size. It is also\nreferred to as an over-allotment option. Over allotment is an allotment or allocation of shares in excess\nof the size of a public issue, made by the SA out of shares borrowed from the promoters or the pre-issue\nsharcholders or both, in pursuance of a green-shoe option exercised by the company in accordance with\nthe provisions of this Chapter VIIIA of the DIP guidelines.\n\nThe guidelines relating to green-shoe option are as follows:\n\n+ A company desirous of availing the option should seek authorization in the general meeting for\nallotment of the additional shares to the stabilizing agent (SA) at the end of the stabilization period.\n+ The company should appoint one of the merchant bankers or book runners as the SA who will be\nresponsible for the price stabilization process, if required. The SA should enter into an agreement\nwith the issuer company, prior to filing the offer document with the SEBI, clearly stating all the\nterms and conditions relating to this option including fees charged/expenses to be incurred by the\nSA for this purpose.\nThe SA should also enter into an agreement with the promoter(s) who will lend their shares. The\nagreement should specify the maximum number of shares that may be borrowed from the promoters\nor the shareholders which should not be in excess of 15 per cent of the total issue size. The details\nof the agreements shall be disclosed in the draft prospectus, the draft red herring prospectus, the red\nherring prospectus, and the final prospectus.\n\n+ The promoters and pre-issue shareholders, of both unlisted and listed company, holding more than\n5 per cent shares should lend the shares for the purpose of green-shoe option.\n\n* The allocation of these shares should be on pro-rata basis to all the applicants. The stabilization\n\nmechanism should be made available for not more than 30 days from the date when trading is\n\npermitted on the exchange(s).\n\nThe SA shall open a special account with a bank to be referred to as the GSO Bank account and a spe-\n\ncial account for securities with a depository participant to be referred to as the GSO Demat Account.\n\n+ The money received from the applicants against the over-allotment in the green-shoe option shall be\n\nkept in the GSO Bank Account, distinct from the issue account and shall be used for the purpose of\n\nbuying shares from the market, during the stabilization period.\n\nThe shares bought from the market by the SA, if any, during the stabilization period, shall be cred-\n\nited to the GSO Demat Account. The shares bought from the market and lying in the GSO Demat\n\nAccount shall be returned to the promoters immediately, in any case not later than two working days\n\nafter the close of the stabilization period.\n\n+ The prime responsibility of the SA shall be to stabilize post-listing price of the shares. To this end,\nthe SA shall determine the timing of buying the shares, the quantity to be bought, the price at which\nthe shares are to be bought, etc.\n\n+ On expiry of the stabilization period, in case the SA does not buy shares to the extent of shares over-\nallotted by the company from the market, the issuer company shall allot shares to the extent of the\nshortfall in dematerialized form to the GSO Demat Account, within five () days of the closure of the\nstabilization period. These shares shall be returned to the promoters by the SA in lieu of the shares\nborrowed from them and the GSO Demat Account shall be closed thereafter. The company shall make\na final listing application in respect of these shares to all the Exchanges where the shares allotted in\nthe public issue are listed. The provisions of Chapter XIII shall not be applicable to such allotment.\n\n* The shares returned to the promoters shall be subject to the remaining lock-in period.\n\n* The SA shall remit an amount equal to (further shares allotted by the issuer company to the GSO\n\nDemat Account) * (issue price) to the issuer company from the GSO Bank Account. The amount left\n\nin this account, if any, after this remittance and deduction of expenses incurred by the SA for the\n\nstabilization mechanism, shall be transferred to the investor protection fund(s) of the stock\nexchange(s) where the shares of issuer company are listed, in equal parts if the shares are listed in\nmore than one exchanges. The GSO Bank Account shall be closed soon thereafter.\n\nThe SA shall submit a report to the stock exchange(s) on a daily basis during the stabilization period\n\nand a final report to SEBI in the format specified in Schedule XXIX. The SA shall maintain a reg-\n\nister in respect of each issue having the green-shoe option in which he acts as a SA.\n\nA stabilizing agent (SA) steps in and buys the shares from the market when the share price falls below\nthe offer price. He has the discretion to decide the timing, the quantity and the price at which to buy shares\nfor stabilizing the post-listing price. To ensure the post-listing price, the SA may either buy the issuer's\n\u2018equity shares from institutional shareholders or purchase them from the market but not in excess of 15 per\ncent of the issue size. The issuer may set up a separate stabilizing fund account to keep the funds as well\nas the shares for purpose of stabilization. The stabilizing measure serves as a cushion against temporary\nvolatility in stock. The SA is also responsible for meeting the excess demand after the commencement of\nthe trading activity. On expiry of the stabilization period, in case the SA does not buy shares to the extent\nof shares over-allotted by the company from the market, the issuer company shall allot shares to the extent\nof the shortfall in dematerialized form.\n\nThe first-ever exercise of a green-shoe option in the course of a public issue was carried out by the\nICICI Bank. The Life Insurance Corporation became the first institution to lend shares in the primary\nmarket. It provided 16 million shares to the DSP Merill Lynch to ensure the post-listing price.\n\nIf the issuer company opts for green-shoe option, the mechanism is as follows:\n\n1. If a company is issuing 1,000 shares, the company will enter into an agreement regarding over-\nallotment option (lending excess shares) with one of the merchant bankers or book runners or lead\nmanagers known as the stabilizing agent (SA) to the extent of 150 shares.\n\n2. In pursuance with the agreement, the promoters would lend 150 shares to the SA for a limited\nperiod of 30 days from the date of listing.\n\n3. Allotment would be made to the extent of 1,150 shares (1,000 shares issued by the company and\n150 borrowed from the promoters).\n\n4. In case, on listing, the market price falls below the issue price, the SA may buy shares from the\nmarket to the extent of 150 shares. This may counter the selling pressure and raise the market\n\nprice. The shares bought by the SA are then returned to the promoters. Thus, only 1,000 shares\nremain listed on the exchange after 30 days.\n\n5. In case, on listing, the share price rises rapidly, and the SA does not buy the shares from the\nmarket, then at the end of the 30 days period (or before) the over-allotment option gets invoked.\nThe company allots 150 more shares which are then returned to the promoters. Thus, 1,150 shares\nremain listed on the exchange.\n\nThe green-shoe option is an investor protection measure-especially for protection of small investors\nduring the post-listing period. This option benefits the underwriters in both bullish and bearish conditions.\nIna bull market, underwriters will opt for additional allotment of 15 per cent due to the index riding high.\nIn such a scenario, the post-listing price will be automatically maintained and sometimes even higher than\nthe offer price, enabling underwriters to make larger profits. However, in a bearish market, the underwrit-\ning option may not be exercised or the underwriters may buy up to 15 per cent at prices lower than the\nissue price from the market.\n\nEarlier, the green-shoe option could be exercised only in book built IPOs. Now it can be exercised in\nall IPOs. This measure is expected to mitigate volatility and enhance investors\u2019 confidence.\n\nPrimary issuances by companies are governed by the SEBI in terms of SEBI (Issue of Capital and\nDisclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009. They are called as ICDR Regulations. These regulations\nreplace the SEBI (Disclosure and Investor Protection) Guidelines from August 26, 2009.\n\nThe broad process flow by using the secondary market infrastructure for primary issuance is as under:\n\nInvestor will be able to submit his application to/ place order with any SEBI registered Stock Broker,\nDepository Participant (DP) or Registrar and Transfer Agent (RTA and Self Certified Syndicate Bank (SCSB).\n\nDepositories can take access to the Stock Exchange platform and in turn provide the same to their\nDPs/ RTAs (other than the RTA, who acts as the RTA to the particular issue, to address the concerns of\nconflict of interest).\n\nInvestor will continue to have the option of submitting Application Supported by Blocked Amount\n(\u201cASBA\u201d) application to SCSB or stock broker. To start with, DP and RTA shall accept only ASBA appli-\ncations. However, they may be enabled to accept non-ASBA applications in future subject to appropriate\nchanges in the regulatory framework, as may be necessary.\n\nInvestors can also fill the application form online and submit it on the web portal of trading member,\nDP/RTA or SCSB (in case of ASBA), if provided by the intermediary.\n\nUnder this case, the investor will not be required to physically sign any paper as even the Companies\nAct, 2013 recognizes the electronic form of a document. This will help eliminate printing application\nform and thereby reduce the overall cost of public issuance.\n\nOn receipt of application, the Stock Broker/DP/RTA/SCSB will have to lodge the application on the\nbidding platform. Once the bid has been entered in the bidding platform by a stock broker, clearing cor-\nporation will block 100 per cent funds from the cash collateral of the stock broker. National Payments\nCorporation of India (\u201cNPCT\u201d) has implemented National Automated Clearing House (\u201cNACH\u201d) a web\nbased solution to facilitate interbank, high volume, electronic transactions which are repetitive and periodic in\nnature. NACH is a centralised system, launched with an aim to consolidate multiple ECS systems running\n\nBox 6.1 The Green-Shoe Option\n\nIn the case of an initial public offering (IPO) by India\u2019s largest technology company\u2014Tata Consultancy Services (ICS)\u2014there was a\ngreen-shoe option available to the lead book runner JM Morgan Stanley, its stabilizing agent (SA).\n\nIt was the volatility on the stock market before its IPO that prompted TCS to set up a stabilizing fund to ensure that the market\nprice upon listing did not go below the offer price of $850 per share. Incidentally, following its listing on August 25, 2004 at\n1,076 per share, the stock price did not go below %850 during the 30 days after the trading commenced.\n\nHowever, this kind of an appointment of an SA to support stock prices had earlier met with failure. In April 2004, ICICI Bank, which came\nout with a public issue of 12.50 crore shares to mop up %3,500 crore, had appointed DSP Merill Lynch as the stabilizing agent as a cushion\nagainst temporary volatility in the stock. DSP was supposed to check that the share price never once went below the cut-off price of 280\nper share. However, shareholders got a rude shock when the share price closed at 265-815 lower than the issue price-on May 14, 2004.\nThe stabilization period was to end on May 22, 2004. No sooner did the stock open at %284 in morning trades, the sale of 130 crore shares\nled the price to dive to \u00a3277. On receiving support at this level from DSP, the share price rose to \u20ac280. But, shortly thereafter, with trading\nvolumes reaching 33 crore on BSE and %100 crore on NSE, the scrip tanked below the issue price. It was DSP\u2019s purchase of 24.79 lakh shares\n(almost 50 per cent of the traded volume) on a single day that helped the stock to fall only 6.95 per cent, as against the average decline of\n15 per cent in other bank stocks on that day.\n\nSource: Capital Market, Sept. 13-26, 2004.\n\nacross the country and provides a framework for the harmonization of standard and practices and removes\nlocal barriers/inhibitors. Stock brokers will be advised to use the said NACH mechanism and thereby\nreceive upfront payment from the investor. Through NACH system, an investor can give instructions to its\nbanker for multiple debits at different points of time for making IPO applications. This will help eliminate\nthe delay on account of cheques in the process.\n\nFor ASBA applications lodged with stock broker, existing process will continue. For bids made\nthrough depository participant and RTA, subsequent to bidding, the application will be forwarded to Self\nCertified Syndicate Bank (\u201cSCSB\u201d) for blocking of funds. For direct ASBA applications, existing process\nof bidding and blocking of funds by the SCSB shall continue.\n\nInvestors will not be able to withdraw bids upon closure of the issue. Upon closure of the issue, the\nbid book shall be made available to the registrar by stock exchanges and depositories. Details of payment\nconfirmation for the bids will be made available by banks, and clearing corporation to the registrars.\n\nBased on the bid file and payment confirmations, registrars will finalise the basis of allotment.\n\nOn approval of basis of allotment by stock exchanges, registrars will give instructions to clearing\ncorporations and banks to credit funds in the public issue account maintained by the clearing corporation.\nExcess money received will be refunded to the investors by the stock broker/bank, as the case may be.\nUpon confirmation of receipt of public issue amount by the clearing corporation to the registrar, instruc-\ntion will be issued to depositories to credit securities directly to the investor's account.\n\nOn confirmation of the same, Stock Exchanges will issue the listing and trading notice. Based on trading\nnotice, funds will be transferred from public issue account of the clearing corporation to issuer's account.\nInvestors would get SMS/e-mail alert for allotment under the IPO, similar to alerts being sent to investors\nfor secondary market transactions.\n\nOn account of the above, the post issue timelines have been reduced from T + 12 days to T + 6 days. Once\nthe process gets stabilised, SEBI plans to further curtail timelines to T + 3/2 days. Further, on account of\nreduction in printing of application forms, the overall cost of public issues will also come down.\n\nPrimary Issues are classified into Public issue, Rights issue and Private placement (Figure 6.1).\n",

In such a case, the company shall have to refund the entire subscrip-\ntion amount received; a delay beyond eight days attracts a penal charge of 15 per cent per annum.\n\nAn unlisted company shall not make a public issue of equity share or any security convertible at later date\ninto equity share, if there are any outstanding financial instruments or any other right that would entitle the\nexisting promoters or shareholders any option to receive equity share capital after the initial public offering.\n\nA company shall not make a public or rights issue of equity share or any security convertible at later\ndate into equity share, unless all the existing partly paid-up shares have been fully paid or forfeited in a\nmanner specified in the guidelines. A company shall not make a public or rights issue of securities unless\nfirm arrangements of finance through verifiable means towards 75 per cent of the stated means of finance,\nexcluding the amount to be raised through proposed public/rights issue, have been made.\n\nIn order to enable investors assess new equity issues offered through an IPO, the issuer has to get IPO\ngrading done by atleast one credit rating agency, before filing the offer documents with SEBI or thereafter.\nHowever, the prospectus/Red Herring Prospectus must contain the grade/s given to the IPO by all credit\nrating agencies.\n\nIn case of a public issue by an unlisted company, the promoters shall contribute not less than 20 per cent\nof the post issue capital which should be locked in for a period of three years. The remaining pre-issue capital\nshould also be locked in for a period of one year from the date of listing. Lock-in indicates a freeze on the\nshares and it is stipulated to ensure that promoters continue to hold some minimum percentage of shares in\nthe company. Promoters\u2019 Participation in Excess of the required minimum contribution will be to treated as\npreferential allotment. Securities which were pledged with banks or financial institutions as collateral security\nfor loans granted by such banks or financial institutions, would not be eligible for computation of minimum\npromoters\u2019 contribution in case of company going for public issue. In order to capital raising by companies\nfounded by professionals, first generation entrepreneurs and in case the post-issue shareholding of the pro-\nmoters is less than 20 per cent, the Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) may contribute for the purpose of\nmeeting the shortfall in minimum contribution, subject to a maximum of 10 per cent of the post-issue capital.\n\nEvery issuer making an issue of more than %500 crore is required to appoint a monitoring agency,\nwhich needs to file a monitoring report with the issuer company. The issuer company will in turn place\nthe report before its Audit Committee so as to enable the Audit Committee to make appropriate recom-\nmendations to the Board of the issuer company. Further, every issuer company is required to inform\nmaterial deviations in the utilization of issue proceeds to the stock exchange and to simultaneously make\npublic the material deviations/adverse comments of the Audit Committee/monitoring agency, through\nan advertisement in newspapers. This provision will not apply to (i) issues by banks and public financial\ninstitutions and (ii) offers for sale.\n\nAn issuer company has to file draft prospectus with the SEBI through a merchant banker, at least 30\ndays prior to the filing of the prospectus with the Registrar of Companies (ROC). The SEBI may specify\nchanges, if any, in the draft offer document which shall have to be complied with the issuer or the lead\nmerchant banker before filing the offer document (prospectus) with the ROC/SEs. The draft offer docu-\nment is available on the SEBI website for public comments for a period of 21 days from the filing of the\ndraft offer. The merchant banker has to ensure that all the requirements of the DIP (disclosure and investor\nprotection) guidelines are complied with while submitting the draft offer document to the SEBI.\n\nSome of the pertinent information that has to be disclosed in the offer document relate to earnings per\nshare (EPS), pre-issue EPS for the last three years, pre-issue price-carnings ratio (P/E), average return on\nnet worth in the last three years, minimum return on increased net worth required to maintain pre-issue\nEPS, net-asset value (NAV) per share based on last balance sheet, NAV per share after issue and compari-\nson, thereof, with the issue price and comparison of all the accounting ratios of the issuer company. Other\ninformation include credit rating, risks in relation to the first issue, risk factors-internal and external,\ndetails of underwriting agreements, objects of the offering, funding plan, schedule of implementation,\ndividend policy, material developments since last balance sheet date and legal and statuary disclosures.\n\nA company has to file a draft offer document with the SEBI atleast 21 days prior to the filing of the offer\ndocument with the registrar of companies (ROC) and stock exchanges (SEs). The SEBI may specify changes\n\nifany, in the draft offer document which shall have to be complied with the issuer or the lead merchant banker\nbefore filing the offer document (prospectus) with the ROC/SEs. The draft offer document is available on the\nSEBI website for public comments for a period of 21 days from the filing of the draft offer. The SEBI has\nextended the validity period of IPO\u2019s and rights issues to one year from three months. The SEBI issues observa-\ntions in 21 days and the companies can raise the funds (launch IPO) within one year from the day when these\nobservations were issued. The merchant banker has to ensure that all the requirements of the DIP (disclosure\nand investor protection) guidelines are complied with while submitting the draft offer document to the SEBI.\nIn order to enable investors assess equity issues offered through an IPO the issuer has to get IPO grading done\neither before filling the offer documents with SEBI or thereafter. However, the prospectus/red herring prospec-\ntus must contain the grade(s) given to the IPO by all credit rating agencies.\n\nThe issuer is allowed to freely price the issue. The issuer and the merchant banker have to justify the\nissue price in the prospectus. There are two methods for determining the issue price\u2014fixed price and the book\nbuilding route. In the fixed price method, the issuer, in consultation with the merchant banker, decides the\nprice of the issue while in book building, the issuer and the merchant bankers (book running lead manager)\nstipulate a floor price or a price band but the final price is discovered by market forces. On completion of\nthe bidding process, the cut-off price is arrived at on the lines of \u2018Dutch\u2019 auction and the basis of allotment\nis finalized. The final price discovered can be any price in the price band or any price above the floor price.\nUsually it is the price at which the entire issue is exhausted. This issue price is called cut-off price. An issuer\ncan go for differential pricing, ie., pricing of an issue where one category is offered shares at a price dif-\nferent from the other category. In the DIP guidelines, differential pricing is allowed only if the securities to\napplicants in the firm allotment category is at a price higher than the price at which the net offer to the public\nis made. An issuer company can allot the shares to retail individual investors at a discount of maximum 10\nper cent to the price at which the shares are offered to other categories of public. The final prospectus with\nall the details including the final issue price and the issue size is filed with the registrar of companies (ROC).\n\nAfter the closure of the issue, the bids received are segregated under different categories viz., firm\nallotment, qualified institutional buyers (QIBs), non-institutional buyers, and retail investors. A firm allot-\nment is the allotment to the investor on firm basis. An issuer making an issue to the public can allot shares\non firm basis to Indian and multilateral development financial Institutions, Indian mutual funds, foreign\ninstitutional investors including non-resident Indians, permanent/regular employees of the issuer com-\npany, and scheduled banks. The ICDR Regulations guidelines provide for maximum percentage of shares\nwhich can be reserved on a firm basis. Reservation on a competitive basis can be made in a public issue\nto the employees of the company, shareholders of the promoting company in case of a new company, and\nshareholders of the group companies in case of an existing company. Indian mutual funds, foreign insti-\ntutional investors, Indian and multilateral development institutions and scheduled banks are categorized\nas qualified institutional buyers. Retail individual investor(RII) means an investor who applies or bids for\nsecurities for a value of not more than %1,00,000. Investors who do not fall within the definition of retail\ninvestor and QIB are categorized as \u2018Non-institutional Investors\u2019 (NII). Any investor who wants to invest\nin an issue should have a PAN which is required to be mentioned in the application form.\n\nAllotment to various investor categories is as follows:\n\nIn Case of Book Built Issue\n\n1. In case an issuer company makes an issue of 100 per cent of the net offer to the public through\n100 per cent book building process\na. Not less than 35 per cent of the net offer to the public shall be available for allocation to retail\nindividual investors;\nb. Not less than 15 per cent of the net offer to the public shall be available for allocation to non-institu-\ntional investors, i.e., investors other than retail individual investors and qualified institutional buyers;\nc. Not more than 50 per cent of the net offer to the public shall be available for allocation to the\nqualified institutional buyers.\n2. In case of compulsory book built issues at least 50 per cent of net offer to the public being allotted to\nthe qualified institutional buyers (QIBs), failing which the full subscription monies shall be refunded.\n3. In case the book built issues are made pursuant to the requirement of mandatory allocation of\n60 per cent to QIBs in terms of Rule 19(2)(b) of Securities Contract (Regulation) Rules, 1957, the\nrespective figures are 30 per cent for RIIs and 10 per cent for NIls.\n\nIn Case of Fixed Price Issue The proportionate allotment of securities to the different investor\ncategories in an fixed price issue is as follows:\n\n1. A minimum 50 per cent of the net offer of securities to the public shall initially be made available\nfor allotment to retail individual investors, as the case may be.\n\n2. The balance net offer of securities to the public shall be made available for allotment to:\na. Individual applicants other than retail individual investors, and\nb. Other investors including corporate bodies/institutions irrespective of the number of securities\napplied for.\n\nAfter the closure of the issue, allotment to each investor is done based on proportionate basis within\ntheir respective categories in both book built and fixed price public issue. The oversubscription ratios are\ncalculated for each of the categories as against the shares reserved for each of the categories in the offer\ndocument. Within each of these categories, the bids are then segregated into different buckets based on the\nnumber of shares applied for. The oversubscription ratio is then applied to the number of shares applied\nfor and the number of shares to be allotted for applicants in each of the buckets is determined. Then, the\nnumber of successful allottees is determined. All the public issues of size in excess of \u20ac10 crore are to be\nmade compulsorily in dematerialized form.\n\nAn investor can get allotment/refund of shares in case of fixed price public issues within 30 days of\nthe closure of the issue and in case of book built public issues within 15 days of the closure of the issue.\nIn case of a listed company, the aggregate issue size of the proposed issue along with all the previous\nissues made during the financial year should not exceed five times its pre-issue net worth as per the\naudited balance sheet of the last financial year. If the name of the company has been changed in the last\none year, then the revenue accounted for by the activity suggested by the new name should not be less than\n50 per cent of its total revenue in the preceding one full-year period.\n\nThe Companies Act, 2013 provides that a company which has raised money from the public through a\nprospectus and still has any unutilised money so raised, will not change its objects for which it raised the\nmoney through a prospectus or vary the terms of a contract referred to in the prospectus unless a special\nresolution is passed by the company. The Companies Act, 2013 also provides that the dissenting sharehold-\ners will be given an exit opportunity by the promoters and the shareholders having control over the company\nin such manner and with such conditions as may be specified by SEBI by making regulations in this behalf.\n\nAccordingly, SEBI has introduced an elaborate framework specifying conditions for the exit offer, the\nparameters for pricing, procedures, etc. The framework has been made applicable for issues which opened\nafter April 01, 2014 and where the amount to be utilised for the objects for which the prospectus was\nissued is less than 75 per cent of the amount raised (including the amount earmarked for general corporate\npurposes as disclosed in the offer document), subject to the proposal for the change in the objects being\ndissented against by at least 10 per cent of the shareholders.\n\n\u2018No company can make a public or rights issue of debt instruments (whether convertible or not), unless\nit fulfils the following two conditions: credit rating of not less than investment grade is obtained from not\nless than two SEBI registered credit rating agencies, and it should not be in the list of wilful defaulters of\nthe Reserve Bank. Moreover, it should not have defaulted payment of interest or repayment of principal,\nif any, for a period of more than six months.\n\nAn issuer company should not allot non-convertible debt instrument pursuant to a public issue, if the\nproposed allottees are less than fifty. In such a case, the company shall have to refund the entire subscrip-\ntion amount received, a delay beyond eight days attracts a penal charge of 15 per cent per annum.\n\nA record number of mega issues were floated after the reforms. An issue of a minimum size of 7100\ncrore is a mega issue.\n\nMost of the IPOs are quoted at a premium to their offer price on getting listed.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Follow-on Public Offering (FPO)\n\nIt is an offer of sale of securities by a listed company. FPO is also known as subsequent or seasoned public\noffering. SEBI (DIP) Guidelines define a listed company as a company which has any of its securities\noffered through an offer document listed on a recognized stock exchange and also includes public sector\nundertakings whose securities are listed on a recognized stock exchange. Listed companies issue FPOs\nto finance their growth plans. In case of a listed company, the aggregate issue size of the proposed issue\nalong with all the previous issues made during the same financial year in terms of size (i.e., offer through\noffer document + firm allotment+ promoters\u2019 contribution) through the offer document should not exceed\nfive times its pre-issue net worth as per the audited balance sheet of the last financial year. If the name\nof the company has been changed in the last one year, then the revenue accounted for by the activity\nsuggested by the new name should not be less than 50 per cent of its total revenue in the preceding one\nfull-year period. Any listed company not fulfilling these conditions shall be eligible to make a public issue\nby complying with QIB route or appraisal route as specified for IPOs. In addition, the promoters shall\ncontribute not less than 20 per cent of the post-issue capital or 20 per cent of the issue size. Moreover,\nparticipation by promoters in the proposed public issue in excess of the required minimum percentage\n\nshall attract the pricing provisions of guidelines on preferential allotment, if the issue price is lower than\nthe price as determined on the basis of said preferential allotment guidelines.\n\nSEBI has introduced fast track issues (FTI) in order to enable well-established and compliant listed\ncompanies satisfying certain specific entry norms/conditions to raise equity through follow-on and rights\nissues. These norms reduce the process of issue and thereby the time period thus enabling issuers a quick\naccess to primary capital market. Such companies can proceed with follow-on public offers (FPOs)/right\nissues by filing a copy of Red Herring Prospectus (RHP)/prospectus with the registrar of companies (RoC)\nor the letter of offer with designated stock exchange (SE), SEBI and stock exchanges. Moreover, such\ncompanies are not required to file draft offer document for SEBI comments and to stock exchanges as the\nrelevant information is already in the public domain.\n\nThe entry norms for companies seeking to access primary market through FTI\u2019s in case aggregate\nvalue of securities including premium exceeds 50 lakhs:\n\n1. The shares of the company have been listed on any stock exchange having nationwide terminals for a\nperiod of at least three years immediately preceding the date of filing of offer document with RoC/SE.\n\n2. The \u2018average market capitalization of public shareholding\u2019 of the company is at least 21,000\ncrores for a period of one year up to the end of the quarter preceding the month in which the pro-\nposed issue is approved by the board of directors/shareholders of the issuer;\n\n3. The annualized trading turnover of the shares of the company during six calendar months imme-\ndiately preceding the month of the reference date has been at least 2 per cent of the weighted\naverage number of shares listed during the said six months period;\n\n4. The company has redressed at least 95 per cent of the total sharcholder/investor grievances or\ncomplaints received till the end of the quarter immediately preceding the month of the date of\nfiling of offer document with RoC/SE.\n\n5. The company has complied with the listing agreement for a period of at least three years imme-\ndiately preceding the reference date;\n\n6. The impact of auditors\u2019 qualifications, if any, on the audited accounts of the company in respect\nof the financial years for which such accounts are disclosed in the offer document does not exceed\n5 per cent of the net profit/loss after tax of the company for the respective years;\n\n7. No prosecution proceedings or show cause notices issued by the Board are pending against the\ncompany or its promoters or whole time directors as on the reference date; and\n\n8. The entire shareholding of the promoter group is held in dematerialized form as on the reference\ndate.

                        "extracted-text": "Rights Issue\n\nRights issue means an issue of capital under Sub-section (1) of Section 81 of the Companies Act,1956, to\nbe offered to the existing shareholders of the company through a letter of offer. The SEBI (ICDR) Regula-\ntions define rights issue as an offer of specified securities by a listed issuer to the shareholders of the issuer\nas on the record date fixed for the said purpose; Section 81(1) of the Companies Act, specifies the mode\nof making a rights issue. As per Clause (a) of this section, the rights shares \u2018shall be offered to the persons\nwho, at the date of the offer, are holders of equity shares of the company, in proportion, as nearly as circum-\nstances admit, to the capital paid-up on those shares at that date.\u2019 Thus, for deciding the rights entitlement,\nonly the capital paid up on each share is relevant.\n\nRights issue is the issue of new shares in which existing shareholders are given pre-emptive rights to\nsubscribe to the new issue on a pro-rata basis. The right is given in the form of an offer to existing sharehold-\ners to subscribe to a proportionate number of fresh, extra shares at a pre-determined price. Companies offer\nshares on a rights basis either to expand, diversify, restructure their balance sheet or raise the promoter stake.\n\nPromoters offer rights issues at attractive price often at a discount to the market price due to a variety\nof reasons. Firstly, they want to get their issues fully subscribed to. Secondly, to reward their sharehold-\ners. Thirdly, it is possible that the market price does not reflect a stock\u2019s true worth or that it is overpriced,\nprompting promoters to keep the offer price low. Fourthly, to hike their stake in their companies, thus, avoid-\ning the preferential allotment route which is subject to lot of restrictions. Moreover, funds can be raised by\na company through this route without diluting the stakes of both its existing shareholders and promoters.\n\nRights Issue is different from public issue:\n\n+ Ina rights issue, new shares are offered to existing shareholders while in a public issue shares are\noffered to public at large.\n\n+ In case of rights, shareholders can renounce their \u2018rights entitlement\u2019 (REs) while there is no rights\nentitlement in case of public issue.\n\n+ Rights shares are allotted based on sharcholding as on record date as against \u2018proportionate allot-\nment\u2019 based on application size in public issues. All details of sharcholders on a record date is\navailable with the company, other than those who have purchased RE from the market and become\neligible for rights issue subsequently.\n\nAccording to the SEBI guidelines, no listed issuer company shall make any rights issue of securities,\nwhere the aggregate value of such securities, including premium, if any, exceeds 50 lakh, unless a draft\nletter of offer has been filed with the SEBI, through a merchant banker, at least 30 days prior to the filing\nof the letter of offer with the designated stock exchange.\n\nThe ICDR regulations put restrictions on the issue of rights shares: (a) No issuer shall make a rights\nissue of equity shares if it has outstanding fully or partly convertible debt instruments at the time of mak-\ning rights issue, unless it has made reservation of equity shares of the same class in favour of the holders\nof such outstanding convertible debt instruments in proportion to the convertible part thereof and (b) the\nequity shares reserved for the holders of fully or partially convertible debt instruments shall be issued at\nthe time of conversion of such convertible debt instruments on the same terms on which the equity shares\noffered in the rights issue were issued.\n\nA listed issuer who wants to raise funds through a rights issue shall announce a record date for the\npurpose of determining the shareholders eligible to apply for specified securities in the proposed rights\nissue. The issuer shall not withdraw rights issue after announcement of the record date. If the issuer with-\ndraws the rights issue after announcing the record date, it shall not make an application for listing of any\nof its specified securities on any recognized stock exchange for a period of 12 months from the day on\nwhich the record date was announced. The issuer may seek listing of its equity shares allotted pursuant to\nconversion or exchange of convertible securities issued prior to the announcement of the record date, on\nthe recognized stock exchange where its securities are listed.\n\nCompanies issue right shares by sending a letter of offer to the shareholders whose names are recorded\nin the books on a particular date. A shareholder has four options in case of rights. The first is to exercise\nhis rights, ie., buy new shares at the offered price, second is to renounce his rights and sell them in the\n\u2018open market, third is to renounce part of his rights and exercise the remainder, and lastly, choose to do\nnothing. Thus, rights issue application form has three parts. Part A deals with application by the share\nholders (including request for additional shares), Part B deals with form of renunciation to be filled in\nby the shareholders who desire to renounce their RE, and Part C deals with application by renouncee(s).\n\nAlso, shareholders can request for split application forms wherein they want to renounce only a part of\ntheir entitlement and want to apply for the rest of their entitlement or the shareholders want to renounce\ntheir entitlement in favour of more than one person.\n\nRights market has been a favoured capital mobilizing route for the corporate sector. However, this\nmarket shrunk from 715,000 crore a year to just about 71,500 crore. This was due to an absence of a\ntrading platform for the post-issue trading of rights. Rights were traded through brokers by way of an\nover-the-counter market which does not lead to efficient price discovery. Hence, those shareholders who\ndo not subscribe to their entire entitlement let the unsubscribed rights expire. In addition, the rights issue\nprocess was cumbersome wherein the issue has to be kept open for 30 days and the disclosure norms\nare stringent. In order to activate the rights market and to make the process cheaper and faster, the SEBI\neased the disclosure norms relating to the rights issue. For rights issues, the issuer is required to give\nonly the audited accounts of the last financial year and audited or unaudited financials with limited\nreview results for the remaining period instead of five years\u2019 restated financials required earlier. Since\nrights are issued to shareholders who have already been receiving information about the company on a\nregular basis, the issuer need not give a summary of the industry and its business or information on its\npast performance or management. Disclosures that have been done away with include summary of the\nindustry and business of the issuer company, promise vs. performance with respect to earlier/previous\nissues, management discussion, and analysis. The disclosures relating to financial statements, litiga-\ntions, risk factors, etc. have been simplified.\n\nIn order to enable corporates to raise money faster, SEBI reduced the time line for approving a\nrights issue from 109 to 43 days. The reduction in timeline approved for rights issues include: the\nnumber of days for the notice period for a board meeting to be reduced from seven days to two working\ndays; the notice period for record date to be reduced from 15/21/30 days to seven working days for all\nscrips; issue period to be reduced from minimum 30 days to a minimum of 15 days with a maximum\nof 30 days; and the time for completion of post-issue activity to be reduced from 42 days to 15 days.\nThis will help the corporates to lower the risk due to an adverse change in market conditions and keep\nproject costs under control.\n\nIn September 2008, the SEBI proposed trading in rights entitlements (RE) both electronically and\nphysically through the stock exchange platform. Rights would be given a separate ISIN (code number for\nthe security in a depository system) for it to trade on the exchange.\n\nThe proposed trading will work as follows:\n\n(A) Electroni\n\n1. The issuer fixes a Record date to identify eligible shareholders. These shareholders would be\nentitled to subscribe to the proposed rights issue.\n\n2. The issuer dispatches a letter to each shareholder informing that the rights entitlements have been\ncredited into their respective demat accounts and duration of trading in RE and attaching the Let-\nter of Offer and a Blank Application Form (unlike the present form which has shareholders\u2019 name\nand entitlement printed on it) to all the shareholders on the record date.\n\n3. The blank application forms shall also be available with the stock exchanges, merchant bankers, and\nbrokers. Further, soft copy of the same shall be available on the websites of the aforesaid intermediaries.\n\n4. The Registrar, on the instruction of the issuer, shall through credit corporate action, credit the RE\nin the given ratio into the demat accounts of the eligible shareholders (as on record date).\n\n5. The Rights issue shall thereafter open for (a) subscription; and (b) renunciation/trading of RE\nelectronically through the stock exchange platform.\n\n6. Trading will happen in REs on the secondary market platform of the stock exchanges as it hap-\npens in case of ordinary shares. To separate the trading of REs from the trading of ordinary\nshares, a separate ISIN shall be given for the REs.\n\n7. Shareholders, who do not want to exercise their RE, can renounce their RE by selling their REs\non the electronic trading platform of stock exchanges.\n\n8. The shareholders who have not renounced their RE and the renouncees who don\u2019t want to\nrenounce their RE further shall apply for shares against their RE during the issue period (which\nincludes the trading period of RE) by submitting the application form received with the Letter of\nOffer/downloaded blank application form or by submitting the required information on a blank\npaper and submit the requisite payment instrument to Bankers to the issue.\n\n. Trading of RE may close at least three working days before closure of the rights issue so as to avoid last\nminute rush in submitting applications and to ensure that beneficial owner of REs have sufficient time\nto submit an application form. Once trading of REs closes, ISIN assigned to REs shall be suspended.\n\nights Issue Process\n\n\u00b0\n\n10. After the closure of trading and settlement of the trades done, the depositories shall make avail-\n\n11.\n\nable the list of RE holders on the date the ISIN was suspended and the list of shareholders on the\nrecord date to the Registrar with their respective number of REs.\n\nThereafter, the Registrar shall reconcile the application by matching the number of shares applied\nfor with number of RE available in the respective demat accounts based on the aforesaid list.\n\n12. The registrar shall finalise the allotment and thereafter on the instruction of the issuer, credit the\n\n13.\n\nrights shares through a credit corporate action, to the respective demat accounts.\nThereafter, the Registrar shall through a corporate action debit the REs from the respective demat\naccounts for (a) shares allotted and (b) lapsed REs.\n\n(B) Physical Rights Issue Process\n\n1\n\n2.\n\n. The issuer fixes a Record date to identify eligible shareholders. These shareholders would be\n\nentitled to subscribe to the proposed Rights Issue.\n\nThe issuer dispatches the Letter of Offer and Composite Application Form (CAF) with a pre-\n\nprinted unique no., name of the shareholder and his/her entitlement, to all the eligible sharehold-\n\ners on the record date.\n\n. The Rights issue shall thereafter open for (a) subscription and (b) renunciation/trading of RE\nphysically.\n\n. The shareholders who have not renounced their RE and the renouncees shall apply for shares\nagainst their RE during the issue period (which includes the trading period of RE) by submitting\nthe CAF or by submitting the required information on a blank paper and submit the requisite pay-\nment instrument to Bankers to the issue.\n\n. Trading of RE may close at least three working days before closure of the rights issue so as to\navoid last minute rush in submitting applications and to ensure that beneficial owner of REs have\nsufficient time to submit an application form.\n\n. The Bankers to the Issue shall send the CAF/blank paper application to the Registrar.\n\n. Thereafter, the Registrar shall reconcile the application form as per the current practice.\n\n. The Registrar shall finalize the basis of allotment and send the physical share certificates to the\nshareholders.\n\nThe rights issues market made a come back after remaining dormant for over a decade. Companies\n\nfind it\nrights\n\ncasier to raise funds through rights issues when the primary market is in doldrums. Most of the\nissues were offered at a discount to the ruling market price. Hence, shareholders enthusiastically\n\nresponded to the rights issues.\nBesides the rights issue, several companies prefer private placement route to raise funds.\n",

To enable Indian investors to diversify risk and as a step\ntowards integration of the Indian capital market with the international capital markets, foreign companies\nare allowed to access the Indian capital market by issuing Indian depository receipts (IDRs).\n\nAn IDR is an instrument denominated in Indian rupees in the form of a depository receipt against the under-\nlying equity of issuing company to enable foreign companies to raise funds from the Indian capital market.\n\nThe Companies Act was amended in 2002 to permit foreign companies to offer shares in the form of\ndepository receipts in India. However, the Department of Company Affairs (DCA) laid down the guide-\nlines in February 2004. The salient features of the Companies (Issue of Indian Depository Receipts)\nRules, 2004 are as follows:\n\n* Only those companies registered overseas and having a pre-issue paid up capital and free reserves\nof at least USD 50 million and minimum average market capitalization of at least USD 100 mil-\nlion during the three financial years preceding the issue would be eligible to tap the Indian capital\nmarket.\n\n+ The issuing company should have made profits for atleast five years prior to the issue and a dividend\nrecord of not less than 10 per cent in those years. Also, the issuing company has to ensure that pre-\nissue debt equity ratio is not more than 2:1.\n\n+ The issuing company should be listed in its home country and not been prohibited to issue securi-\nties by any regulatory Body and has a good track record with respect to compliance with securities\nmarket regulations.\n\n+ Foreigners, resident or employed in India, subsidiaries of global corporations and foreign funds\nregistered in India would also be eligible to invest in IDRs.\n\nThe application would be required to be made atleast 90 days ahead of the opening of the issue in\nthe format laid down along with a refundable fee of USD 10,000. On receiving the approval, an\nissue fee of 0.5 per cent subject to a minimum of 710 lakh would have to be paid for issues of upto\n2100 crore. Where the issue size exceeds 7100 crore, a fee of 0.25 per cent, would be payable on an\namount exceeding 7100 crore.\n\nThe repatriation of proceeds of the issue would be subject to the laws in force relating to export of\nforeign exchange.\n\nThe IDRs shall not be redeemable into underlying equity shares for a period of one year from the\ndate of issue. IDRs can be converted into the underlying equity shares only after the expiry of one\nyear from the date of the issue of the IDR, subject to the compliance of the related provisions of\nForeign Exchange Management Act and Regulations issued there under by the RBI in this regard.\nThe IDRs issued in a financial year can not exceed 15 per cent of the issuing company\u2019s paid-up\ncapital and free reserves.\n\nThe IDRs will have to be denominated in Indian rupees and will have to be listed on one or more\nstock exchanges.\n\nThe issuer shall appoint an overseas custodian bank, with whom the underlying equity shares shall\nbe deposited and a domestic depository which shall be authorized to issue the IDRs. For the issue\nof IDRs, a merchant banker should also be appointed. Overseas Custodian Bank is a banking com-\npany which is established in a country outside India and has a place of business in India and acts as\ncustodian for the equity shares of issuing company against which IDRs are proposed to be issued.\nDomestic Depository is a custodian of securities registered with the SEBI and authorized by the\nissuing company to issue Indian Depository Receipts. It is also responsible to distribute dividend\nor other corporate action on the IDRs to the IDR holders in proportion to their holdings of IDRs.\nMerchant Banker registered with SEBI is responsible for due diligence and filing the draft prospec-\ntus with the SEBI.\n\n\u2018The draft prospectus shall be filed by the issuer with the ROC and the SEBI. Copies of certain docu-\nments as specified have to be filed. The SEBI may specify changes to be made in the offer document\nwithin a period of 21 days.\n\nStatement of variation of utilization of funds from the projected figures and the quarterly audited\nfinancial results shall be published in English language newspapers in India.\n\nOn the receipt of dividends or other corporate action, the domestic depository shall distribute them\nproportionately among the IDR holders.\n\nIDRs will be listed on one or more recognized stock exchanges having nation-wide trading terminals\nin India and may be purchased, possessed, and freely transferred by persons resident in India as\ndefined under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (FEMA). IDRs can be transferred and\nredeemed, subject to the provisions of the FEMA.\n\nThe guidelines also clearly state that the IDR issuer would have to fulfil the eligibility criteria laid\ndown by the SEBI and that it should obtain prior approval of the SEBI to make any issue.\nThe SEBI has prescribed its own set of norms which would also have to be adhered to by the IDR issuer.\n\nity for Issue of IDRs No issuer shall make an issue IDRs unless\n\n. it fulfills the eligibility criteria as specified in Rule 4 of the IDR Rules;\n. it is listed in its home country;\n\n. it has not been prohibited to issue securities by any Regulatory Body; and\n\n. it has good track record with respect to compliance with securities market regulations.\n\n1\n2.\n3\n4\n\nInvestors\n\n1. IDRs can be purchased by any person who is resident in India as defined under FEMA. NRIs and\nFils cannot purchase or possess IDRs unless special permission of the Reserve Bank of India is\ntaken.\n\n2. Investments by Indian Companies in IDRs shall not exceed the investment limits, if any, pre-\nscribed for them under applicable laws.\n\n3. Automatic fungibility of IDRs is not permitted.\n\n4. In every issue of IDR:\n\na. At least 50 per cent of the IDRs issued shall be subscribed to by QIBs;\n\nb. The balance 50 per cent shall be available for subscription by non-institutional investors\n(i.e., investors other than QIBs and retail individual investors) and retail individual investors,\nincluding employees. IDRs shall be allocated among non-institutional investors, retail indi-\nvidual investors and employees at the discretion of the issuer. The manner of allocation shall\nbe disclosed in the prospectus for IDRs.\n\n5. The minimum application amount in an IDR issue shall be %20,000/-\n6. Procedure to be followed by each class of applicant for applying shall be mentioned in the pro-\nspectus.\n\nMinimum Issue Size The size of an IDR issue shall not be less than %50 crore.\n\nMinimum Subscription Ifthe company issuing the IDRs does not receive the minimum subscription of\n90 per cent of the issued amount on the date of closure of the issue, or if the subscription level falls below\n90 per cent after the closure of issue on account of cheques having being returned unpaid or withdrawal of\napplications, the company shall forthwith refund the entire subscription amount received. If there is a\ndelay beyond eight days after the company becomes liable to pay the amount, the company shall pay\ninterest at the rate of 15 per cent per annum for the period of delay.\n\nThe SEBI has extended the facility of anchor investors to issue of IDRs on similar terms as applicable\nto public issues made by domestic companies. Moreover, at least 30 per cent of issue size of the IDRs\nshall be reserved for allocation to retail individual investors, who may otherwise be crowded out. IDRs\nhave not taken off so far.\n",

IDRs shall not be redeemable into underlying equity shares before the expiry of one year\nperiod from the date of listing of IDRs.\nii. After completion of one year period from the date of listing of IDRs, the issuer shall, provide\ntwo-way fungibility of IDRs.\ni. IDR fungibility shall be provided on a continuous basis.\n.. The issuer shall provide said fungibility to IDR holders in any of the following ways:\na. converting IDRs into underlying shares; or\nb. converting IDRs into underlying shares and selling the underlying shares in the foreign\nmarket where the shares of the issuer are listed and providing the sale proceeds to the IDR\nholders; or\nc. both the above options may be provided to IDR holders.\nProvided that the option once exercised and disclosed by the issuer at the time of offer-\ning the IDRs to public cannot be changed without the specific approval of SEBI.\nAll the IDRs that have been applied for fungibility by the holder shall be transferred to IDR\nredemption account at the time of application. The issuer shall take necessary steps to provide\nunderlying shares or sale proceeds as per the choice made under sub-clause (iv) of this clause.\nvi. The issuer may receive requests from the holders of underlying shares and convert these into\nIDRs subject to the Headroom available with respect to the number of IDRs originally issued\nsubject to the guidelines prescribed by SEBI & Reserve Bank of India (\u201cRBI\u201d) from time\nto time.\n\n<\n\nvii. In case of option of converting the IDRs into underlying equity shares and providing the sale\nproceeds to the IDR holders is exercised, the issuer shall disclose the range of fixed/variable\ncosts in percentage terms upfront and ensure that all the costs together shall not exceed Sper\ncent of the sale proceeds.\n\nviii. Available Headroom and significant conversion/reconversion transactions shall be disclosed\nby the issuer on a continuous basis.\n\nix. The issuer shall lay down the detailed procedures while taking into consideration the above\nbroad guidelines in addition to other norms specified by SEBI and RBI, from time to time.\n\nIl. Guidelines for Fungibility of Existing Listed IDRs\n\ni. After completion of one year period from the date of issue of IDRs, the issuer shall, every\nyear provide redemption/conversion of IDRs into underlying equity shares of the issuer of\nup to 25per cent of the IDRs originally issued. The Issuer shall invite expression of inter-\nest from IDR holders by giving advertisements in leading English and Hindi national daily\nnewspapers with wide circulation as well as notification to the stock exchanges giving\nthe operating guidelines for redemption/conversion of IDRs at least one month before the\nimplementation.\n\nii, The issuer shall exercise the option specified in sub-clause (iii), below, provided that the same\nis disclosed in accordance with subclause (xii) of this clause.\n\nThe mode of fungibility: The issuer shall provide the said fungibility to IDR holders in any\nof the following ways:\n\na. converting IDRs into underlying shares; or\n\nb. converting IDRs into underlying shares and selling the underlying shares in the foreign\nmarket where the shares of the Issuer are listed and providing the sale proceeds to the\nIDR holders; or\n\nc. both the above options may be provided to IDR holders.\n\niv. The periodicity for IDR fungibility shall be at least once every quarter. The fungibility window\nshall remain open for the period of at least seven days. Provided that the option once exer-\ncised and disclosed by the issuer to public cannot be changed without the specific approval\nof SEBI. However, the issuer may decide to exercise the option provided in sub-clause\n(xiii), below, without specific approval from SEBI.\n\nv. Total number of IDRs available for fungibility during one fungibility window shall be fixed\nbefore the opening of the window. Re-issuances of IDRs during the fungibility window, if\nany, shall be considered for computation of Headroom only at the time of next cycle of\nfungibility. Fungibility window for this purpose shall mean the time period during which\nIDR holders can apply for conversion of IDRs into underlying equity shares.\n\nvi. In case of requests for conversion in excess of the limit available, the manner of accepting\nIDRs for conversion/redemption or shares for re-issuance shall be on proportionate basis.\n\nvii.

Further, the excess unsatisfied demand from the retail investors shall be included\nin the unreserved portion.\n\n+ in case of lower demand for fungibility from retail investors, the unallocated portion\nshall be added to the unreserved portion.\n\nviii. All the IDRs applied for fungibility shall be transferred to IDR redemption account at the\ntime of application and in case of unsuccessful bids the balance IDRs shall be transferred\nback to the account of applicant.

For this\npurpose, the issuer shall disclose the exercising of the said option by giving advertisements\nin leading English and Hindi national daily newspapers with wide circulation as well as\nnotification to the stock exchanges giving the operating guidelines for redemption/conversion\nof IDRs at least one month before exercising the option.

The said platform is accessible to:\n\na. companies which are intensive in their use of technology, information technology, intel-\nlectual property, data analytics, biotechnology and nanotechnology to provide products,\nservices or business platforms with substantial value addition and with at least 25 per cent\nof the pre-issue capital being held by QIBs or\n\nb. any other company in which at least 50 per cent of the pre-issue capital is held by QIBs.\n\n|. No person (individually or collectively with persons acting in concert) in such a company\n\nshall hold 25 per cent or more of the post-issue share capital.\n\nisclosure requirements have been rationalized for companies raising funds on this plat-\n\nform. Considering the nature of the business of a company which may list on the said plat-\nform, disclosures may contain only the broad objects of the issue and there will be no cap\non the amount raised for general corporate purposes as applicable for the companies listed\non the main board. Further, lock-in requirements of the entire pre-issue capital will be for\na much shorter period of only six months from the date of allotment uniformly for all the\nshareholders, subject to certain exemptions to ensure liquidity.\n\niv. As standard valuation parameters such as P/E, EPS may not be relevant in the case of many\nsuch companies, the basis of issue price may include other disclosures (except projections)\nas deemed fit by the issuers.\n\nv. Only two categories of investors can access the proposed ITP \u2014 (i) Institutional investors\n\n(QIBs, along with family trusts, systemically important NBFCs registered with RBI and\n\nintermediaries registered with SEBI, each with a networth of more than %500 crore) and (ii)\n\nNon-institutional Investors (NIIs) other than retail individual investors.\n\nIn case of a public offer, allotment to institutional investors may be on a discretionary basis\n\nwhereas to NIls, it will be on a proportionate basis. Allocation between the two categories\n\nwill be in the ratio of 75 and 25 per cent, respectively.\n\nvi.\n\nvii. In case of discretionary allotment to institutional investors, no institutional investor will be\nallotted more than 10 per cent of the issue size. All shares allotted on a discretionary basis\nwill be locked-in, in line with the requirement for lock-in in the case of the anchor investors,\nthat is, for 30 days.\n\nviii. The minimum application size in case of such issues will be @lakh and the minimum trading\nlot will also be of the same amount.\n\nix. The number of allottees in case of a public offer will be more than 200.\n\nThe company will have the option to migrate to the main board after three years subject to\n\ncompliance with the eligibility requirements of the stock exchanges.\n\nxi. For Category I and II AIFs, which are required under the SEBI (Alternative Investment\nFunds) Regulations, 2012 to invest a certain minimum amount in unlisted securities, invest-\nments in shares of companies listed on this platform may be treated as investments in\n\u2018unlisted securities\u2019 for the purpose of calculating investment limits.\n\nxii, The same platform will also facilitate capital raising by SMEs.\n\n\u201d\n\nPrivate Placement Market\n\nIn the primary capital market, corporates can raise resources through public issues, rights issues, and\nprivate placement. In the case of public issues, securities are allotted to the general public. In the case of\nrights issues, securities are allotted to the existing shareholders on a pro-rata basis. In contrast, private\nplacement refers to the direct sale of newly issued securities by the issuer to a small number of investors\nthrough merchant bankers. These investors are selected clients such as financial institutions, corporates,\nbanks, and high net worth individuals.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Private Placements of Securities by Companies\n\nSome companies misused the private placement route by issuing huge number of debt securities to public\nunder the garb of private placements, Companies Act, 2013 and rules made thereunder, have put some\nrestrictions on private placements, which was previously lightly regulated.\n\nAs per Chapter III, The Companies (Prospectus and Allotment of Securities) Rules, 2014 , in case of\na private placement of securities, private placement offer or invitation cannot be made to more than 200\npersons in the aggregate in a financial year (excluding qualified institutional buyers and employees of the\ncompany being offered securities under a scheme of employees stock option).\n\nSuch offer can be made only to such persons whose names are recorded by the company prior to the\ninvitation to subscribe, and that such persons shall receive the offer by name, and that a complete record\nof such offers shall be kept by the company and complete information about such offer shall be filed with\nthe registrar within a period of thirty days of circulation of relevant private placement offer letter.\n\nAll monies payable towards subscription of securities through private placement shall be paid through\ncheque or demand draft or other banking channels but not by cash. Further, rules require that the payment\nto be made for subscription to securities shall be made from the bank account of the person subscribing to\nsuch securities and the company shall keep a record of all such bank accounts. The company shall allot its\nsecurities within sixty days from the date of receipt of the application money for private placement, else\nmoney has to be repaid to the investors.\n\n\u2018Company offering securities through private placement shall not release any public advertisements or uti-\nlize any media, marketing or distribution channels or agents to inform the public at large about such an offer.\n\nMinistry of Corporate Affairs has also notified Companies (Prospectus and Allotment of Securities)\nRules, 2014. As per the said rules, a private placement offer letter shall be accompanied by an application\nform serially numbered and addressed specifically to the person to whom the offer is made and no person\nother than the person so addressed in the application form shall be allowed to apply through such applica-\ntion form. The value of such offer or invitation per person shall be with an investment size of not less than\n%20,000 of face value of the securities.\n\nA return of allotment of securities shall be filed with Registrar of Companies within 30 days of allot-\nment along with a complete list of all security holders containing the full name, address, permanent\naccount number and e-mail Id of such security holder.\n\nCompanies Act, 2013 mentions that any offer or invitation that is not in compliance with the provisions\nof Section 42 shall be treated as a public offer and all provisions of Companies Act, 2013, and the Securi-\nties Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 and the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 shall be\nrequired to be complied with, including the above mentioned requirements.\n\n\nHowever, as mentioned above, Companies Act, 2013 provides a window for making private placement\noffers to Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs) and the\u2019 limit of 200\u2019 is not applicable to such QIBs. QIBs\nare the entities such as a MF, Foreign Portfolio Investor (FPI), AIF, Scheduled Commercial Bank, IRDA\nregistered Insurance company, etc., as defined in SEBI (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements)\nRegulations, 2009.\n\nThe private placement route offers several advantages to the issuer for raising resources. The time\ntaken by as well as the cost of issue for the private placement route is much less for the issuer as compared.\nto the public and rights issues. Privately placed issues can be tailor-made to suit the requirements of both\nthe issuer and the investor to give them greater flexibility than public or rights issues. Moreover, private\nplacement does not require detailed compliance of formalities, rating, and disclosure norms as required\nin public or rights issues. These advantages make the market quite popular in the USA where generally,\ndebt instruments are privately placed.\n\nAvailable data indicates that private placement has become the preferred route for raising resources by\nboth private and public sector companies. In India, this route has gained immense importance during the\nlast few years, in view of the prolonged subdued conditions in the new issues market.\n\nIn terms of instruments, debt instruments, mainly bonds and debentures of different maturities, were\npreferred the most. The equity portion was raised in the form of preference shares.\n\nThe factors that led to private placement becoming a favoured route for Indian corporates and financial\ninstitutions are as follows:\n\n* The prolonged subdued conditions in the primary market since 1995-96.\n\nPrivate placements in India were not bound by any regulatory system till September 2003.\n\nPrivate placements have no lock-in period except when it is in favour of promoters.\n\nThere is no compliance system for merchant bankers in private placement as in the case of public issues.\nThe limit on a bank\u2019s investment on debt has been removed which has made this market more buoyant.\nThrough private placements, issuing banks can raise their Tier II capital in order to prop up the\ncapital adequacy ratio.\n\nMany corporate issuers of debt are defaulters with the subscribing banks and financial institutions.\nThese banks and financial institutions subscribe to a fresh issue and the proceeds from this issue are\nused to repay the interest and principal of term loans so that the issuing company is not classified as\na non-performing asset in the books.\n\nBenefits of operational flexibility and attractive pricing.\n\nThe private sector taps this market to raise funds for the retirement of old expensive debt or acquisi-\ntions.\n\nShort-term debentures and non-convertible debentures are more popular with issuers and investors\nin this market.\n\nThe major issuers of privately placed securities are financial institutions, banks, and central- and\nstate-level undertakings. The subscribers are banks, provident funds, mutual funds, and high net worth\nindividuals.\n\nIn India, privately placed securities are admitted for trading, but are not listed. Banks do not trade these\nsecurities and hold them till maturity. Hence, there is no secondary market for such securities. There is not\nmuch depth in the market as the number of investors is quite low.\n\nIn the US, the private placement market is an important source of long-term funds for corporates.\nOnly qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) are allowed to trade in private debt and this has increased the\nliquidity of private placements.\n\nBanks and institutions have over %1,00,000 crore worth of exposure in the private placement market.\nThe Reserve Bank has issued guidelines to banks and financial institutions for investment in such\ncases. These guidelines are, however, not applicable to privately placed issues with less than 50 mem-\nbers. Issuers avoid these guidelines by tying up with less than 50 members. Hence, the capital market\nregulator, the SEBI, prescribed stringent disclosure norms on September 30, 2003 for this segment, which\nhad remained almost unregulated until then. On account of this, resource mobilization from this market\ndeclined in 2003-04.\n\nPrivate placements are now regulated. Companies wanting to list their privately placed bonds have\nto make disclosures as per the Companies Act and the SEBI guidelines. Further, they will have to comply\nwith the listing agreement of stock exchanges. For privately placed debt in standard denominations of 710\nlakh, such disclosures have to be made through the company and stock exchange websites. Credit rating is\ncompulsory for privately placed debt issues. At least an investment-grade rating is needed for listing. All\nsuch issuances must have a debenture redemption trustee and a reserve that may be governed by the SEBI\u2019s\ndebenture trust rule. The company shall appoint a SEBI-registered debenture trustee. Securities should be\n\n\nissued and traded in demat form. All trades, with the exception of spot transactions in a listed debt security\nshall be executed only on the trading platforms of a stock exchange. Secondary market is restricted to\nqualified institutional buyers (QIBs) and high net worth individuals. If an issuer is unwilling to list the\npaper, no SEBI-registered merchant banker can be involved in the issue. The Reserve Bank of India also\nhas barred financial institutions (Fls) from investing in unrated papers and papers rated below investment\ngrade. The RBI has placed a 20 per cent ceiling on investment in unlisted securities and securitized paper.\nWithin this 20 per cent limit, it has placed a ceiling of 10 per cent on FI investment in unlisted papers. Fis\nhave to follow the guidelines issued by the SEBI on raising resources through the private placement mar-\nket. Further, FIs have to disclose the details on the issuer composition of investment made through private\nplacement and non-performing investments in the balance sheet from the fiscal year 2003-04. The RBI\nnorms have also put a cap on banks\u2019 investment in unrated debt at 10 per cent of their investments.\n\n",

Provided that a financial institution, scheduled bank, foreign\ninstitutional investor, and mutual fund shall not be deemed to be promoter group merely by virtue of the\nfact that 10 per cent or more of the equity share capital of the issuer is held by such person: Provided further\nthat such financial institution, scheduled bank, and foreign institutional investor shall be treated as promoter\ngroup for the subsidiaries or companies promoted by them or for the mutual fund sponsored by them;\n\nA company can make preferential issue of equity shares, warrants, partly convertible debentures (PCDs),\nfully convertible debentures (FCDs), or any other financial instruments convertible into or exchanged with\nequity shares at a later date. A listed company is permitted to make a preferential issue only if its entire share-\nholding is held in dematerialized form. In case of preferential issues, the entire prepreferential allotment share-\nholding should be under lock-in. The lock-in period shall commence from the relevant date upto a period of\nsix months from the date of preferential allotment. The shareholders who have sold their shares during the six\nmonths period prior to the relevant period would not be eligible for allotment of shares on a preferential basis.\n\nThe SEBI has issued norms for preferential allotment which are as follows:\n\n* The total preferential investments issued to promoters is to be locked in for three years. The lock-in period\nof shares allotted on conversion of warrants shall start when shares are allotted and not when warrants\nare allotted.\n\n* The upfront margin to be paid by allottees of warrants has been raised to 25 per cent from 10 per\ncent. This is expected to discourage promoters from issuing warrants to themselves at a discount\nin a bull run and then do not honour their commitments if the stock prices fall.\n\n* The details of the amount utilized out of preferential issue proceeds are to be disclosed under an\n\nappropriate head in the balance sheet of the company, indicating the purpose for which such money\n\nhas been utilized. Even the details of the unutilized money are also to be disclosed in the balance\nsheet under a separate head indicating the form in which such unutilized money has been invested.\n\nPreferential allotment should be at a price not less than the higher of the following: The average of\n\nthe weekly high and low of the closing prices of the scrip quoted on a stock exchange during the\n\nsix months preceding the date of general meeting or the average of the weekly high and low of the\nclosing prices of the scrip quoted on a stock exchange during the two weeks preceding the date of\ngeneral meeting.\n\n+ Where the equity shares of a company have been listed on a stock exchange for a period of less than\nsix months as on the relevant date; the issue of shares on preferential basis can be made at a price not\nless than higher of the following: The price at which shares were issued by the company in its IPO\nor the average of the weekly high and low of the closing prices of the related shares quoted on the\nstock exchange during the period shares have been listed preceding the relevant date or during the\ntwo weeks preceding the relevant date provided that on completing a period of six months of being\nlisted on a stock exchange, the company shall recompute the price of the share in accordance with\nthe provisions mentioned above and if the price at which shares were allotted on a preferential basis\nunder this clause was lower than the price so computed, the difference shall be paid by the allot-\ntees to the company. The preferential allotment guidelines were amended to enable companies with\nlisting history of less than six months also to raise money through preferential allotment, subject to\ncomplying with the modified pricing and disclosure norms.\n\n+ Relevant date in the case of preferential issue of equity shares is provided as \u2018thirty days prior to the\ndate on which meeting of shareholders is held to consider the proposed preferential issue\u2019. The avoid\ninterpretational issues, the amendment has provided that in case the relevant date falls on a weekend/\nholiday, the day preceding the weekend/holiday would be reckoned to be the relevant date, Also for\npurpose of uniformity, the reference to time period in terms of \u2018months\u2019 has been modified to \u2018weeks\u2019.\n\nFurther, the listed companies intending to make preferential allotment would be required to obtain\nPAN from each applicant before making the allotment. Debt restructuring framework should commence\nfrom the date of allotment and continue for a period of one year. In case of partly paid-up shares, the\nlock-in period should commence from the date of allotment and continue for a period of one year from\nthe date when shares become fully paid-up.\n\nPreferential allotment is carried out for various reasons: to enhance the promoters\u2019 holding by issuing share\nwarrants to themselves; as part of debt restructuring/conversion of loans; for the purpose of strategic invest-\nments by institutional/foreign investors; to issue shares by way of Employees Stock Option Plans (ESOPs); for\nfresh issue to shareholders other than promoters and for take-over of company by management group.\n\nCompanies use the preferential allotment route to raise working capital. Besides, the company can choose\namong the varied types of investors for its preferential issue. Institutional investors like private equity funds\n\nprefer preferential issue route as it enables management control in the issuing company and the lock-in period\nis only one year. One of the reasons why companies prefer to allot preferential shares to their promoters is\nthat they can be pledged with banks either to release their earlier holdings which are not under lock-in or to\nrelease fresh funds to cash in on the bull run. The preferential allotment route is preferred in bullish market.\n\nPreferential issues enable quick fund raising at low cost and allow a company to take on board its busi-\nness partners like technology collaborators, to raise their commitment to the company. Moreover, increase\nin investments by promoters and institutional investors boosts the confidence of retail investors However,\nit increases the equity base of a company which leads to a decline in the earnings per share. Since the\nbeneficiaries are promoters or outsiders, the relative holding of existing shareholders declines. Hence, it is\nan inequitable way of raising funds. In most cases, promoters are allotted additional shares at times when.\nthe company may not be in need of funds. This adversely affects the valuation ratios and brings down the\nstock prices thereby affecting the interests of existing shareholders.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Qualified Institutions Placement (QIP)\n\nIt has emerged as a new fund raising investment for listed companies in India. QIP is an issue of equity\nshares or securities convertible into equity shares by a listed company to qualified institutional buyers\nonly, in terms of provisions of Chapter XIIIA of SEBI(DIP) guidelines. Through a QIP issue, funds can be\nraised from foreign as well as domestic institutional investors without getting listed on a foreign exchange,\nwhich is a lengthy and cumbersome affair. Also, unlike a private placement, there is no lock-in clause. The\nissue process is not only simple but can be completed speedily since the company issues equity shares and\ndoes not create a derivative investment as is the case with GDR/ADR. Investors also gain since they invest\ndirectly in equity shares and do not have to bear the cost of holding and converting depository receipts.\nUnlike GDRs, a QIP issue can be offered to a wider set of investors including Indian mutual funds, banks\nand insurance companies, as well as, foreign institutional investors. As there is no new stock exchange list-\ning, the issue is free from the hassles of continuing disclosures and administrative costs.\n\nSEBI issued guidelines for Qualified Institutions Placement on May 8, 2006. Key features of the same are:\n\nIssuer A company whose equity shares are listed on a stock exchange having nation-wide trading\nterminals for a period of atleast one year and which is complying with the prescribed requirements of\nminimum public shareholding of the listing agreements will be eligible to raise funds in domestic market\nby placing securities with Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIB).\n\nSecurities Securities which can be issued through QIP are equity shares, or any securities other than\nwarrants, which are convertible into or exchangeable with equity shares. A security, which is convertible or\nexchanged into equity shares at any time, after allotment of security but not later than sixty months from the\ndate of allotment can be issued. The specified securities shall be made fully paid up at the time of allotment.\n\nInvestors/Allottees The specified securities can be issued only to QIBs, as defined under subclause (v)\nof Clause 2.2.2 B of the SEBI (DIP) Guidelines. Such QIBs shall not be promoters or related to promoters\nof the issuer, either directly or indirectly. Each placement of the specified securities issued through QIB\nshall be on private placement basis, in compliance with the requirements of the first provision to clause\n(a) of Sub-section (3) of Section 67 of the Companies Act, 1956. A minimum of 10 per cent of the\nsecurities in each placement shall be allotted to Mutual Funds. For each placement, there shall be atleast\ntwo allottees for an issue of size upto 7250 crores and at least five allottees for an issue size in excess of\n250 crore. Further, no single allottee shall be allotted in excess of 50 per cent of the issue size. Investors\nshall not be allowed to withdraw their bids/applications after closure of the issue.\n\nIssue Size The aggregate funds that can be raised through QIPs in one financial year shall not exceed\nfive times of the networth of the issuer at the end of its previous financial year.\n\nPlacement Document _ Issuer shall prepare a placement document containing all the relevant and material\ndisclosures. There will be no pre-issue filing of the placement document with SEBI. The placement\ndocuments will be placed on the websites of the stock exchanges and the issuer.\n\nPricing The floor price of the specified securities shall be determined on a basis similar to that for GDR/\nFCCB issues and shall be subject to adjustment in case of corporate actions such as stock splits, rights\nissues, bonus issue, etc. The floor price for QIPs is based on two weeks average with the relevant date\nbeing the day on which the board meets to take the decision to open the QIP. A maximum discount of\n5 per cent has been permitted to the price calculated subject to approval by shareholders.\n\nOther Procedural Requirements The resolution approving QIP, passed under Sub-section (1 A) of\nSection 81 of the Companies Act, 1956 or any other applicable provision, will remain valid for a period\nof 12 months from the date of passing of the resolution. There shall be a gap of at least six months\nbetween each placement in case of multiple placements of specified securities pursuant to authority of the\nsame shareholders\u2019 resolution. Issuer and Merchant Banker shall submit documents/undertakings, if any,\nspecified in this regard in the listing agreement, for the purpose of seeking in-principle approval and final\npermission from Stock Exchanges for listing of the specified securities.\n",

Ear-\nlier, only debt was allowed to be raised from international markets. In the early 1990s, foreign exchange\nreserves had depleted and the country\u2019s rating had been downgraded. This resulted in a foreign exchange\ncrunch and the government was unable to meet the import requirements of Indian companies. Hence,\nallowing companies to tap the equity and bond market in Europe seemed a more sensible option. This\npermission encouraged Indian companies to become global.\n\nIndian companies have raised resources from international capital markets through Global Deposi-\ntory Receipts (GDRs)/American Depository Receipts (ADRs), Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds\n(FCCBs), and External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs). The last are used as a residual source, after\nexhausting external equity as a main source of finance for large value projects.\n\nFactors Leading to an Increase in the Popularity of International Markets\n\nSince 1993, many of the firms have chosen to use the offshore primary market instead of the domestic\nprimary market for raising resources. The factors that can be attributed to this behaviour are as follows:\n\nThe time involved in the entire public issue on the offshore primary market is shorter and the issue\n\ncosts are also low as the book building procedure is adopted.\n\nOffshore issues allow foreign ownership to cross the ceiling.\n\nForeign institutional investors (FIIs) prefer Euro issues as they do not have to register with the SEBI\n\nnor do they have to pay any capital gains tax on GDRs traded in the foreign exchanges. Moreover,\n\narbitrage opportunities exist as GDRs are priced at a discount compared with their domestic price.\n\nIndian companies can collect a larger volume of funds in foreign exchange from international mar-\n\nkets than through domestic markets.\n\nThe increasing popularity of Euro bonds market among international borrowers. Euro bonds are\n\nunderwritten by an international syndicate of banks and placed in countries other than the one in\n\nwhose currency the bond is denominated. There are no regulatory restrictions as they fall outside the\n\npurview of any single country\u2019s regulatory framework. Moreover, they are not subject to stringent\n\ndisclosure norms as compared to dollar denominated bonds in the US.\n\nThe projections of the GDP growth are very strong and consistent which have created a strong appe-\n\ntite for Indian paper in the overseas market.\n\n+ An overseas issuance allows the company to get exposure to international investors, thereby, increas\ning the visibility of Indian companies in the overseas market.\n\n\u2018The investors in international markets are hedge funds, long equity funds, and self-managed pension funds.\nIndian firms can raise long-term funds from the international markets through equity instruments such\nas GDRs/ADRs or through FCCBs\u2014a debt instrument convertible into equity on a future date. Long-\nterm loans raised from the international markets are known as External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs).\n",

Thus, the issue of GDR creates equity shares of the issuing company which\nare kept with a designated bank. GDRs are freely transferable outside India and dividend in respect\nof the share represented by the GDR is paid in Indian rupees only. They are listed and traded on a\nforeign stock exchange. Trading takes place between professional market makers on an OTC (over\nthe counter) basis. A GDR may represent one or more shares of the issuing company. The shares\ncorrespond to the GDR in a fixed ratio.

A holder of a GDR can, at any time, convert it into the number of shares that it represents. Till\nconversion, the GDRs do not carry any voting rights and once conversion takes place, the underly-\ning shares are listed and traded on the domestic exchange.

These ADSs serve as stock\ncertificates and are used interchangeably with ADRs which represent ownership of deposited shares.\nThere is no legal or technical difference between an ADR and a GDR. As they are listed on the New\nYork Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the NASDAQ (National Association of Securities Dealers Automated\nAssociation), ADR issues offer access to the US institutional and retail markets while GDR issues offer\naccess only to the US institutional market. ADR listing requires comprehensive disclosures and greater\ntransparency as compared to a GDR listing.\n\nGDRs can be converted into ADRs by surrendering the existing GDRs and depositing the underlying\nequity shares with the ADR depository in exchange for ADRs. The company has to comply with the SEC\n\n\nrequirements to materialize this exchange offer process. However, the company does not get any funds by\nthis conversion. The trend is towards the conversion of GDRs into ADRs as ADRs are more liquid and\ncover a wider market.\n\nADRs are accessible to only good companies with high transparency and good governance practices\nwhich also benefit the local investor; this gets reflected in a higher P/E ratio. Companies are attracted\ntowards raising ADRs as they are free to decide the deployment of funds either in the US or in India.\nCompanies can also make their presence felt in the global arena which would result in increased liquid-\nity of the company\u2019s stock. This would also further broaden the mergers and amalgamations financing\ncapabilities of the company. Moreover, an ADR issue creates a currency for issue of dollar-denom-\ninated stock option to employees, thereby enabling the company to hire and retain the best human\nresources. A considerable amount of resources has been raised from the international capital market\nthrough GDRs/ADRs.\n\nGood companies through good corporate practices and governance have been successful in get-\nting themselves listed on the LSE, the NASDAQ, and the NYSE. There are 12 Indian companies\nlisted on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and two on NYSE Euronext. The US government\nhas made listing norms more stringent in the wake of a recent spate of accounting scandals. With the\nintroduction of stringent Sarbanes Oxley Act in the US, many Indian companies have found it dif-\nficult to raise funds through ADRs. Many small and mid-size Indian companies opted to raise funds\nat the Alternate Investment Market (AIM) at London. Firms listed at AIM can trade on other global\nexchanges. Satyam Computers went for a cross-listing in early 2008 by joining NYSE Euronext\nbesides NYSE.\n\n\nBox 6.4 Sponsored ADS Issues\n\nIna sponsored ADS issue, a company\u2019s shareholders submit their domestic shares to the company which are then issued to foreign investors\n\u2018in the form of ADSs. The shares submitted for the sponsored ADS issue are extinguished and replaced with ADRs. A sponsored ADS issue is\ndifferent from the regular ADS issue. When companies issue sponsored ADS, there is no new issue of equity shares. Indian investors, promot-\ners, or Fils can tender their shares when a company announces an ADR issue and the allotment is done proportionately. Companies which\nhave large amounts of cash and a high percentage of floating stock (shares owned by non-promoters), issue sponsored ADS to increase their\nvisibility in territories where their products are sold.\n\nICICI Bank converted 38.4 million equity shares (5.2 per cent of its equity) into American Depository Shares (ADSs) at USD 12.11 each\nat a premium of 18 per cent to the closing domestic price on March 11, 2005. ICICI Bank was the first bank to go in for a sponsored ADS\nissue.\n\nInfosys Technologies, India\u2019s second largest software services firm, offered in May 2005, ADS conversion (conversion of existing shares\ninto US-listed stock) at USD-67 per ADS (American Depository Shares). This sponsored secondary offering consisted of 14 million ADSs\nrepresenting 14 million equity shares with a green-shoe option of 2 million shares. Infosys offered this conversion to boost the size of US\nfloat to about 14 per cent of its capitaland also to give domestic investors an opportunity to reap the big premium on the NASDAQ. Of the 16\nmillion shares on offer, 20 per cent (3.2 million) shares were allotted to the Japanese market through a public offer without listing (POWL).\nThis was the first POWL issue by any Indian company. POWL means offering the Infosys stock without an official listing procedure to Japanese\ninstitutions and retail investors.\n\n",

Therefore, such\nissues would need to conform to the existing FDI policy and only in areas where FDI is permis-\nsible. Indian companies raising money from ADRs/GDRs through registered exchanges are now\nfree to access the ADR/GDR markets automatically, without the prior approval of the Ministry\nof Finance, Department of Economic Affairs. Prior permission from the Government of India is\nessential for the issue of FCCBs. A company seeking to raise funds abroad through these instru-\nments should have a consistently good track record of at least three years. The foreign equity\nparticipation directly or indirectly is restricted to 51 per cent of the issued and subscribed capital\nof a company.\n\nBanks, financial institutions, and registered non-bank financial institutions were made eligible for\nEuro issues in June 1996 subject to the condition that the proceeds from such issues would not be invested\nin stock market and real estate. There is no restriction now on the number of Euro issues floated in a year\nby a company or a group of companies.\n\nThe end use of the GDR proceeds and external commercial borrowings have been prescribed\nand modified from time to time. As GDRs/ADRs are full risk equity, end-use restrictions on GDR/\nADR issue proceeds have been removed. The proceeds so raised have to be kept abroad till actually\nrequired in India. Pending repatriation or utilization of the proceeds, the Indian company can invest\nthe funds in:\n\n1. Deposits with or Certificate of Deposit or other instruments offered by banks who have been rated\nby Standard and Poor, Fitch, IBCA or Moody\u2019s, etc. and such rating not being less than the rating\nstipulated by Reserve Bank from time to time for the purpose (current rating applicable is AA(-)\nby Standard and Poor/Fitch IBCA or Aa3 by Moody's);\n\n2. Deposits with branch/es of Indian Authorized Dealers (ADs) outside India; and\n\n3. Treasury bills and other monetary instruments with a maturity or unexpired maturity of one year\nor less.\n\nIndian companies are free to utilize, without any prior approval, 100 per cent of the proceeds for\noverseas investment.\n\nThe ADR/GDR proceeds can be utilized for first stage acquisition of shares in the disinvestment\nprocess of Public Sector Undertakings/Enterprises and also in the mandatory second stage offer to the\npublic in view of their strategic importance. Voting rights on shares issued under the scheme shall be\nas per the provisions of Companies Act, 1956 and in a manner in which restrictions on voting rights\nimposed on ADR/GDR issues shall be consistent with the Company Law provisions. RBI regulations\nregarding voting rights in the case of banking companies will be applicable to all shareholders exercis-\ning voting rights.\n\nIn his budget speech 1998-99, the finance minister announced a special stock option scheme for\nIndian software companies linked with ADR/GDR offerings to enable them to provide incentive to retain\ntheir highly skilled professionals.\n\nIn March 2001, the government allowed two-way fungibility for Indian GDRs/ADRs by which con-\nverted local shares could be reconverted into GDRs/ADRs subject to sectoral caps. Under this scheme, a\nstock broker in India, registered with SEBI, can purchase shares of an Indian company from the market\nfor conversion into ADRs/GDRs based on instructions received from overseas investors. Re-issuance of\nADRs/GDRs would be permitted to the extent of ADRs/GDRs which have been redeemed into underly-\ning shares and sold in the Indian market.\n\nWith this, the reverse fungibility of ADRs and GDRs has gathered momentum. With the reconver-\nsions, there was no headroom in case of the ICICI bank\u2019s counter in September 2002. Headroom denotes\nthe number of domestic shares which are available for reconversion into ADRs or GDRs.\n\nFunds raised through FCCBs can be used for restructuring of external debt and not more than 25 per\ncent of the FCCB issue proceeds may be used for general corporate restructuring, including working capi-\ntal requirements. Unlisted companies are barred from issuing shares or debt overseas through FCCBs,\nwithout a prior or simultaneous listing in the domestic stock markets.\n\nListed companies not eligible to raise funds from the domestic capital markets, including those\nrestrained by the SEBI, will not be eligible to issue FCCBs or GDRs. Similarly, overseas corporate\nbodies (OCBs), which are debarred from investing through the portfolio route and those entities\nprohibited from dealing in securities by the SEBI are barred from investing in FCCBs and GDRs.\nCompanies which have already issued GDRs, ADRs, or FCCBs will now have to get themselves\n\nlisted in the domestic market within three years of issue. These measures were aimed at bringing\nthe ADR/GDR guidelines \u2018in alignment\u2019 with the SEBI\u2019s guidelines on domestic capital issues and\nto put a quality check on the burgeoning number of FCCB issues. Accordingly, GDR and FCCB\nissues would now have to correspond to share prices of similar companies quoted in the Indian Stock\nMarkets. This would block companies from tapping markets abroad, at discounted prices to the local\nprice level. The pricing of GDR/ADR/FCCB issues which was an average of the weekly high and\nlow of the closing prices of related shares in the markets, during six months, or two weeks preceding\nthe relevant date was revised in December 2005. The norms stipulated that the floor price must be\nan average of the weekly highs and lows during the 26 weeks ending a month before the \u2018relevant\ndate\u2019 or the average of the daily highs and lows in the last fortnight of these 26 weeks, whichever is\nhigher. The relevant date is the day the company\u2019s AGM approves the issue. This norm made it more\ndifficult for companies to raise money from overseas markets, especially in declining markets since\nthe floor price determined by this formula was high. Since prices fell sharply during 2008, the norms\nwere again revised in 2008. As per the revised norms, the companies have to price their issues at\nthe higher of the two months\u2019 average price or 15 days average price preceding the decision to issue\nshares overseas. Moreover, the closing prices upto the date on which the shareholders decide on the\nissuance could be considered.\n\nThe Indian company issuing ADRs/GDRs has to furnish to the RBI, full details of such issue within\n30 days from the date of closing of the issue.\n\nTakeover regulations relating to ADRs/GDRs were amended in August 2009. ADRs/GDRs holder\nwith voting rights will have to make an open offer to minority shareholders if the holding touches the\n15 per cent limit.\n",

However, in the subsequent four years, there was a lack of\ninterest in Indian equity overseas.

Infosys Technologies and Satyam\nInfoway are listed on the NASDAQ while ICICI is listed on the NYSE. Satyam Infoway was the\nfirst Indian company which tapped this overseas market even though it was not listed on any of the\nIndian stock exchanges.\n\nIn 1999-2000, Indian firms raised USD 1 billion and, in 2000-01, around USD 4 billion through\nADRs, making them Asia\u2019s biggest issuers of ADRs. This capital raised from the overseas market was\ngreater than the total equity mobilization from the domestic market through public issues.

With USD 8.6 million in accumulative losses, it could not meet the SEBI's strict criterion of\na three-year profitability track record.

The issue carried a very low coupon rate of 7.84\nper cent.\n\nIn October 1996, the first floating rate ECB issue was introduced by Global Telesystems. The\ncompany raised 60 million Swiss francs (around USD 48 million) in the form of fully convertible\nbonds. The company offered an interest rate of 175 basis points over the LIBOR (London Inter-\nBank Offer Rate).\n\nSIDBI raised USD 20 million for 38 years\u2014one of the largest tenored ECBs raised in the\ncountry\u2014in 2005. Reliance Petroleum, Adani Power, and Essar Oil each raised USD 500 million\nduring 2007-08.\n\nECBs are a key component of India\u2019s overall external debt which includes, external assistance, buyers\u2019\ncredit, suppliers\u2019 credit, NRI deposits, short-term credit, and rupee debt. ECB refer to commercial loans\n(in the form of bank loans, buyers\u2019 credit, suppliers\u2019 credit, securitized instruments (such as floating rate\nnotes, and fixed-rate bonds) availed from non-resident lenders with minimum average maturity of three\nyears. It also includes credit from official export credit agencies and commercial borrowings from the\nprivate sector window of multilateral financing institutions.\n\nECBs can be accessed under two routes, the automatic route and the approval route.\n\n",

Framework for Raising Loans Through External Commercial Borrowings\n\n1.1 External Commercial Borrowings (ECB): ECBs are commercial loans raised by eligible resident\nentities from recognized non-resident entities and should conform to parameters such as minimum\nmaturity, permitted and non-permitted end-uses, maximum all-in-cost ceiling, etc. The parameters apply\nin totality and not on a standalone basis. The framework for raising loans through ECB (herein after\nreferred to as the ECB Framework) comprises the following three tracks:\n\nTrack I: Medium-term foreign currency denominated ECB with minimum average maturity of 3/5 years.\nTrack II: Long-term foreign currency denominated ECB with minimum average maturity of 10 years.\nTrack III: Indian rupee (INR) denominated ECB with minimum average maturity of 3/5 years.\n\n1.2 Forms of ECB: +The ECB framework enables permitted resident entities to borrow from recognized\nnon-resident entities in the following forms:\n\ni, Loans including bank loans;\nii, Securitized instruments (\u00a2.g., floating rate notes and fixed rate bonds, non-convertible, option-\nally convertible or partially convertible preference shares/debentures);\niii, Buyers\u2019 credit;\niv. Suppliers\u2019 credit;\nv. Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds (FCCBs);\nvi. Financial Lease; and\nvii. Foreign Currency Exchangeable Bonds (FCEBs)\n\nHowever, ECB framework is not applicable in respect of the investment in Non-convertible Debentures\n(NCDs) in India made by Registered Foreign Portfolio Investors (RFPIs).\n\n1.3 Available routes for raising ECB: Under the ECB framework, ECBs can be raised either under\nthe automatic route or under the approval route. For the automatic route, the cases are examined by\nthe Authorised Dealer Category-I (AD Category-I) banks. Under the approval route, the prospective\nborrowers are required to send their requests to the RBI through their ADs for examination. While the\nregulatory provisions are mostly similar, there are some differences in the form of amount of borrowing,\neligibility of borrowers, permissible end-uses, etc. under the two routes. While the first six forms of\n\nborrowing, mentioned at 2.2 above, can be raised both under the automatic and approval routes, FCEBs\ncan be issued only under the approval route.\n\n1.4 Parameters for ECBs:\nthe following sub-paragraphs.\n\n1.4.1 Mit\nset out as under:\n\nVarious parameters of raising loan under ECB framework are mentioned in\n\nimum Average Maturity Period: The minimum average maturities for the three tracks are\n\nTrack |\n\nTrack Il\n\nTrack Ill\n\n3 years for ECB upto USD 50 million or its equivalent.\n\n10 years irrespec-\n\nSame as under\n\n5 years for ECB beyond USD 50 million or its equivalent. ve of the amount.

                        "extracted-text": "Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds (FCCBs)\n\nFCCBs are bonds issued by Indian companies and subscribed to by a non-resident in foreign cur-\nrency. They carry a fixed interest or coupon rate and are convertible into a certain number of ordi-\nnary shares at a preferred price. They are convertible into ordinary shares of the issuing company\ncither in whole, or in part, on the basis of any equity-related warrants attached to the debt instru-\nments. These bonds are listed and traded abroad. Till conversion, the company has to pay interest\nin dollars and if the conversion option is not exercised, the redemption is also made in dollars.\nThus, foreign investors prefer convertible bonds whereas Indian companies prefer to issue GDRs.\nThe interest rate is low but the exchange risk is more in FCCBs as interest is payable in foreign\ncurrency. Hence, only companies with low debt equity ratios and large forex earnings potential\nopt for FCCBs.\n\nCorporates can raise FCCBs at a coupon rate of 1.5 per cent which is lower than the domestic rate.\nThe yield-to-maturity in case of these bonds is around 6-7 per cent and it is to be paid only at the end of\nthe tenure.\n\nThe scheme for issue of FCCBs and ordinary shares was notified by the government in 1993 to allow\ncompanies easier access to foreign capital markets. Under the scheme, bonds upto USD 50 million are\ncleared automatically, those up to USD 100 million by the Reserve Bank, and those above that by the\nfinance ministry. The minimum maturity period for FCCBs is five years but there is no restriction on the\ntime period for converting the FCCBs into shares.\n\nThe interest rate in FCCBs is much lower than bond issuances or loan syndications. The equity\ncomponent in a FCCB is an attractive feature for investors. Higher the premium for conversion of\nequity, higher will be the yield on the FCCB. FCCBs straddle both the worlds of equity and debt.\nFCCBs are less dilutive than equity and are cheaper than debt. In case of FCCBs, equity dilution\nis not immediate and happens gradually as the bonds get converted into underlying local shares in\na phased manner. Initial outflow on interest payments is extremely low since the coupon rate lies\nbetween 0 and 1.5 per cent.\n\nWhen the stock markets become buoyant, FCCBs are a more preferred route to raise foreign currency\nfunds than pure ECBs. Indian companies have issued around USD 20 billion to 50 billion of FCCBs over\nthe past few years to meet their growth plans.\n\nThe issuance of FCCBs was brought under the ECB guidelines in August 2005. Issuance of FCCBs\nshall conform to the Foreign Direct Investment guidelines including sectoral cap. In addition to the\nrequirements of (i) minimum maturity of 5 years, (ii) the call & put option, if any, shall not be exercisable\nprior to 5 years, (iii) issuance without any warrants attached, (iv) the issue related expenses not exceeding\n4 per cent of issue size and in case of private placement, not exceeding 2 per cent of the issue size, etc. as\nrequired in terms of provisions contained in Regulation 21 of the Foreign Exchange Management\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Conclusion\n\nThe primary market was in a depressed state for a long time. Some unsustained spells of buoyancy were\nwitnessed in 1994-95 (financial sector IPOs), 1999-2000 (IT boom), and the latest in 2002. During the\nfinancial years 1994 and 1995, more than 1,000 IPOs were floated in the Indian primary market. In the\nyear 2001-02, only six equity issues aggregating 860 crore were floated by the private sector.\n\nThe primary market was subdued due to lack of investors\u2019 confidence. Many fraudulent promoters\ntook advantage of the free pricing regime and duped investors. The SEBI failed to take timely action\nagainst these promoters leading to a lack of confidence among investors. They shied away from the\nprimary market. The level of investors\u2019 confidence, in turn, is dependent on the performance of the sec-\nondary markets. The secondary markets were also coloured with stories of scams which again eroded\n\ninvestors\u2019 confidence. Certain other factors which led to subdued conditions in the primary market were\nstrict disclosure standards and entry point norms, prescribed by the SEBI, which led to a decline in the\nnumber of issues by the new companies.\n\nThe blue-chip companies tapped the international markets via the GDR/ADR route to raise financial\nresources. Corporates, financial institutions, and banks preferred the private placement route. The private\nplacement route became more popular than the public issue route. In private placements, it was the debt\ninstruments which gained more popularity as investors preferred safety over higher returns. This led to a\nrise in the debt-equity ratio of many private sector companies.\n\nThe primary market revived during 2004-05 as many good quality scrips from private sector com-\npanies were subscribed to, enthusiastically, by the investors. Moreover, the government's disinvestment\nprogramme created a favourable climate whereby small investors once again entered the market. In\nNovember 2005, along with private provident funds (PFs), superannuation and gratuity funds were also\nallowed by the finance ministry to invest 5 per cent of their new inflow in stocks The total size of superan-\nnuation and gratuity funds is around 10-15 per cent of the %2,50,000 crore provident fund sector. Since\nNovember 2005, a dozen superannuation and gratuity funds have, for the first time, invested in equity\nmarkets. Besides purchasing shares in the secondary market, these retirement funds are also investing\nin IPOs, follow on equity offerings of companies and some of the equity-linked mutual funds. They can\ndirectly invest in only those shares where debt instruments floated by the company have an investment\ngrade, from atleast two rating agencies. The government liberalized the guidelines relating to private\nprovident funds in August 2008, to facilitate more retirement savings to flow into the stock market and\nhelp evolve the corporate debt market. Private provident funds can now invest upto 15 per cent of the cor-\npus in the stocks and 40 per cent of the funds in private sector debt instruments. These debt instruments\nwill have to be rated investment grade by just one credit rating agency as opposed to the earlier require-\nment of two. The revised guidelines will be effective from April 1, 2009. The pension sector should also\nbe opened up so that long-term domestic money can enter the primary and secondary market.\n\nThe bearish phase in the stock markets has had an impact on companies, going for raising funds,\nthrough public issues. Indian companies need to have a relook at their business and growth plans in the\ncontext of global fund crisis.\n\nDuring the years 2015\u201416 and 2016-17 larger number of companies came up with IPO issues. These\nissues got a favourable response from the investors which reflected their growing investment confidence\nin the capital market.\n\nIndia has a household saving rate of about 35 per cent of the GDP, which approximately amounts to\n%6 lakh crore a year. Moreover, the Indian investor is looking for profitable and safe investment avenues.\nIndian retail investors are usually more interested in buying from the primary market. Small investors are\nmore concerned with gains on the listing date which has converted the primary market into a speculative\none. If the merchant bankers appropriately price the issue, this will go a long way in sustaining the revival\nof the primary market. It is the good faith of the small investors, regulator, and promoter which can help\nthese issues become a success.\n",

The central government's direct involvement and involvement through holding\ncompanies was to the extent of 95 per cent of the total share capital of all the central public\nsector undertakings. Fifty-eight industries were reserved exclusively for the public sector in\nthe 1950s. In 1991, the number of industries reserved was brought down to 18 and now it is 3.\n\nPSUs do not have an autonomy as most of their decisions relating to capital expenditure,\nacquisitions and investments have to be approved by the Public Investment Board (PIB),\nCabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) and the central government. The control\n\u2018on PSUs is also exercised through the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), Central Vig-\nilance Commission (CVC), and the CBI. These controls exist because PSUs are ultimately\nresponsible to parliament.\n\nPublic Sector Undertakings (PSUs) can be classified as Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs),\nCentral Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) and Public Sector Banks (PSBs).\n\nThe Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) are also classified into \u2018strategic\u2019 and\n\u2018non-strategic\u2019. Areas of strategic CPSEs reserved exclusively for the public sector are:\n\n1. Arms & Ammunition and the allied items of defence equipments, defence air-crafts\nand warships.\n\n2. Atomic Energy (except in the areas related to the operation of nuclear power and\napplications of radiation and radio-isotopes to agriculture, medicine and non-strate-\ngic industries).\n\n3. Railways transport.\n\nPublic sector enterprises were set up to serve the broad macro-economic objectives of\nhigher economic growth, self-sufficiency in production of goods and services, long term\nequilibrium in balance of payments and low and stable prices besides meeting certain socio-\neconomic obligations. While there were only five Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs)\nwith a total investment of 29 crore at the time of the First Five Year Plan, there were 320\nCPSEs (excluding 7 Insurance Companies) with a total investment of %11,71,844 crore as\non 31st March, 2016.\n\nAs on March 31, 2017 there were 47 Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) listed\non the stock exchanges accounting for almost 12 per cent of the total market capitalization,\nwith an aggeregate market capitalization of 715,45,270.99 crore.

                        "extracted-text": "D\n\nThe disinvestment of public sector undertakings means the sale of public sector equity leading to a\ndilution of the government's stake. In India, the term \u2018disinvestment\u2019 is used rather than \u2018privatization.\u2019\nPrivatization implies a change in ownership resulting in a change of management while disinvestment\nmay or may not lead to a change of management. A well-designed disinvestment programme helps in the\nlong-term growth process through increased foreign investment, technology transfer and the subsequent\nenhancements in productivity. The process of disinvestment was initiated by the government of India\nduring 1991-92 as part of a package of PSU reform. The disinvestment of government stake from PSUs\nfollows from the Industrial Policy Statement of 1991-92. Around %2,00,000 crore are locked in PSUs.\n\nAlmost half of the PSUs in the country are loss-making enterprises and a big drain on the national\nexchequer. The public sector was consuming far too much capital and current revenues and the govern-\nment itself was facing a resource crunch owing to mounting fiscal deficit. The then finance minister, Man-\nmohan Singh, realised that competition would intensify due to reforms and the cash-starved PSUs would\nbe badly affected. So the idea of equity sale privatization was first mooted in 1991 by him as a means of\nraising resources and improving the performance of PSUs. Moreover, the process of liberalization began\nin the 1990s. The private sectors had enough resources to get into the sectors dominated by PSUs. The\ngovernment also identified certain sectors such as hotel and food which could be best left to the private\nsector.\n\ninvestment\n\nObjectives The privatization programme was flagged-off in October 1991 without clear-cut objectives.\nThe stated objective was to raise resources to finance fiscal deficit. It was proclaimed that the step\nmeant widespread holding which again meant increased efficiency. Moreover, there was no well-defined\nstrategy laid down to achieve these unclear objectives. This was evident by the way the government\noffloaded, in the very first year, small lots of 2 per cent and 3 per cent of a company\u2019s equity capital which\nleft major control still in the government's hands. This revealed the unstated objective of the government\nwhich was to retain control over the management. The government later on stated that the objectives\nof disinvestment were to broad base equity, improve management, enhance availability of resources\nfor these public sector enterprises and finance fiscal deficit. In the Disinvestment Policy 2000-01, the\ngovernment, for the first time, seemed prepared to reduce its stake in the non-strategic PSUs even below\n26 per cent if necessary.\n\nIn 2001, the government introduced a special provision for setting aside a quota of shares for small\ninvestors and workers. The government set out the following policies in respect of PSUs: Bring down gov-\nernment equity in all non-strategic PSUs to 26 per cent or lower if necessary; restructure and revive poten-\ntially viable PSUs; close down PSUs which cannot be revived; and fully protect the interest of workers.\n\nThe government has stressed that the proceeds from disinvestment would be used for meeting expendi-\nture in the social and infrastructure sectors, restructuring of PSUs, and restructuring public debt.\n\nTo maximize returns to the government, the approach has been shifted from the disinvestment of small\nlots of shares to strategic sale of blocks of shares to strategic investors.\n\nThe disinvestment minister reviewed the disinvestment policy on December 9, 2002 and stated the\nobjective of disinvestment as to put national resources and assets to optimal use and in particular to unleash\nthe productive potential inherent in our public sector enterprises. The disinvestment policy aimed at mod-\nernization and upgradation of public sector enterprises, creation of new assets, generation of employment,\nand retiring of public debt.\n\n\nObjectives of Current Disinvestment Policy:\n\n(a) Promote people\u2019s ownership of Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) to share in their pros-\nperity through disinvestment.\n\n(b) Enable efficient management of public investment in CPSEs for accelerating economic develop-\nment and augmenting Government's resources for higher expenditure.\n\n(c) Listing of CPSEs on stock exchanges to facilitate development and deepening of capital market\nand spread of equity culture.\n\n(d) Raising budgetary resources for the Government.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "DISINVESTMENT MACHINERY\n\nInitially, in 1991-92, the government resorted to bundling options wherein shares were offered only in\nbundles of \u2018very good,\u2019 \u2018good,\u2019 and \u2018average\u2019 companies. This resulted in disinvestment at very low prices.\nThe government then realized that framing proper strategies for disinvestment was essential.\n\nThe Government of India appointed a committee under the chairmanship of the former RBI Governor,\nC. Rangarajan, in 1993. It recommended that a disinvestment committee be established on a statutory basis in\nview of the multiple ministries involved, its impact on economic reform, and the need to monitor use of the\nproceeds of such disinvestment. In 1996 when the Congress was voted out of power, the United Front govern-\nment set up a disinvestment commission. It was constituted under the chairmanship of G. V. Ramakrishna.\nIt was set up for advising the government on disinvestment in general and for drawing up a long-term disin-\nvestment programme for the PSUs referred to the commission. The commission identified four objectives as\npart of its long-term strategy: to strengthen PSUs, where appropriate, in order to facilitate disinvestment; to\nprotect employees\u2019 interest; to broad base ownership; and to augment receipts for the government.\n\nThe Disinvestment Commission broadly classified the PSUs into two categories for disinvestment\u2014the core\ngroup and the non-core group. Those in the core group were defined as having considerable market presence and\nhence PSU disinvestment would be limited to a maximum of 49 per cent. The non-core group industries were\ndefined as units where private sector players have already made huge investments with the aim of enhancing the\nintrinsic value of PSU shares. The commission recommended that the core and non-core PSUs should be restruc-\ntured prior to disinvestment. It identified about 100 PSUs and classified them as navratnas and mini-ratnas. Nine\nwell-performing PSUs under the core category were identified by the government for granting autonomy, which\nmeant giving them freedom to incur capital expenditure, raise resources, and enter technology contracts. These\nPSUs, popularly known as \u2018navratnas\u2019, are BHEL, BPCL, HPCL, IPCL, IOC, NTPC, ONGC, SAIL, and VSNL.\n\nThe Disinvestment Commission advocated \u2018strategic sales\u2019 of particular PSUs or sale of equity blocks\ntoa single buyer accompanied by transfer of management to the private investor. The government showed\nits willingness to hand over control through strategic sales to any private party acquiring 25 per cent in the\ncompany. The commission has the mandate to offload upto 74 per cent government equity in the non-core\nand non-strategic areas. There is no change in the government's present shareholding in strategic areas.\nThe government has identified arms, ammunition, and the allied items of defence, equipment, defence\naircraft and warships, atomic energy, and railway transport as strategic areas.\n\nThe Disinvestment Commission submitted 12 reports recommending disinvestment of 58 PSUs out of\nthe 71 referred to it. These reports contained specific recommendations including disinvestment through\nstrategic sale in 29 PSUs, trade sale in 8 PSUs, offer of share through GDR and domestic route for 5\nPSUs, no disinvestment for 1 PSU, disinvestment deferred in 11 PSUs, and closure of 4. The government\ndecided to disinvest in 45 PSUs out of the recommended 58. The tenure of the Disinvestment Commission\nended on November 30, 1999.\n\nThe Disinvestment Commission was reconstituted in July 2001 with R. H. Patil as chairman. The task\nof this Disinvestment Commission was to advise the government on non-strategic PSUs and their subsidi-\naries excluding IOC, ONGC, and GAIL. The Disinvestment Commission submitted its thirteenth report\nin January 2002 and made recommendations in respect of the following four PSUs: Neyveli Lignite Cor-\nporation Limited (NLC); Manganese Ore (India) Limited (MOIL); Real India Technical and Economic\nServices Limited (RITES); and Projects and Equipment Corporation Limited (PEC).\n\nThe government constituted the Department of Disinvestment (DOD) on December 10, 1999. It is a\nnodal body set up to streamline and speed up disinvestment and establish a systemic policy approach to\nit. Ithas been made responsible for all matters relating to the disinvestment of central government equity\nfrom central PSUs. The Ministry of Disinvestment is to take decisions on its recommendations on the\nmodalities of disinvestment including restructuring.\n\nThe Department of Disinvestment was set up as a separate Department on 10th December, 1999 and\nwas later renamed as Ministry of Disinvestment form 6th September, 2001. From 27th May, 2004, the\nDepartment of Disinvestment is one of the Departments under the Ministry of Finance.\n\nIn line with the announcement of the Hon'ble Finance Minister in his Budget Speech of 2016-17, the\nDepartment has been re-named as Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM)\nfrom 14th April, 2016, with focus of the Government on management of its investment in Central Public\nSector Enterprises (CPSEs) for accelerating economic development as well as augmenting Government\nresources for higher expenditure.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "THE PSU SELL-OFF METHODS\n\nThe government has adopted various methods to sell-off shares in PSUs. These are follows:\n\n+ Bidding: In 1991-92, the bidding method was adopted. When the government invites bids for a portion\nof its stake in a public sector undertaking, it is essentially conducting an auction. The Department of\nPublic Enterprises (DPE) invites closed bids from government financial institutions and mutual funds.\nThe tendering process is driven by a reserve price based on valuation models such as net asset value,\nearnings potential, and previous realizations if available. These were determined after consultations\nwith merchant bankers such as IDBI and SBI Caps. The government sets a price below which it is\nunwilling to sell its stake. This price is referred to as the reserve price. In 1991-92, the government\nresorted to bundling option wherein shares were offered only in bundles of \u2018very good,\u2019 \u2018good,\u2019 and\n\u2018average\u2019 . The realized amount exceeded the targeted amount in the very first year of the disinvestment\nprogramme due to acceptance of low bids for share bundles. However, this strategy instead of helping\nthe government to divest shares in loss-making enterprises at reasonable prices, resulted in disinvest-\nment at very low prices. The share bundles included certain PSU shares such as MTNL, ITI, VSNL,\nCMC, and Cochin Refineries which would have otherwise commanded a high premium if sold indi-\nvidually. The practice of bundling shares was abandoned thereafter. The government, in subsequent\nyears, sold shares for each company separately. The emphasis of the government in the initial years\nwas on disinvestment of equity, retaining the controlling block.\n\nSale of Shares in the Market: During 1991-99, shares of companies like IOC, BPCL, HPCL, GAIL,\nand VSNL were sold in the market. The shares of these blue chip companies were sold at price-earn-\nings ratios of ranging between 4.5 and 6.0. The sale of shares through public issue not only brings\ndown the government's equity holding in the company but there is also the advantage that the money\nso realized can be used for expansions. The offer of sale of shares in the primary market increases\npublic ownership in these PSUs through retail participation resulting in better price discovery,\nincreasing the floating stock of the company and deepening the capital market. The IPO route is\nsuitable during strong secondary market conditions. Moreover, retail investors get an opportunity to\nsubscribe to the offer and help develop capital markets. The wealth created by PSUs through public\nresources can be shared equitably with the public at large. However, a public issue does not result\nin a change in management style and functioning of the companies. The control of the companies\ncontinues to be vested with the government resulting in a lower P/E ratio.\n\nGlobal Depository Receipts (GDR) Route: The government decided to tap the overseas market for\ndisinvestment due to sluggish capital market conditions. In March 1997, the VSNL disinvestment took\nplace through the GDR issue which was priced at USD 13.93 and was over-subscribed 10 times. The\nsecond GDR issue of VSNL in February 1999 was priced at a lower price of USD 9.25. MTNL and\nGAIL were the other GDR issues. The government sold 18 per cent equity in GAIL in 1999-2000 and\nraised 1,095 crore through the disinvestment of 155 million shares represented by 22.5 million GDR.\nThe disinvestment through offloading of minority shares through domestic, ADR, or GDR markets\nwas not productive.\n\nCross-holdings: After widely missing the targets on the PSU disinvestment front, the government\nadopted an innovative route to meet the disinvestment target in 1998-99. Cash-rich oil companies were\nasked to subscribe to each other's shares. This swapping of shares within oil sector PSUs took place\njust before the close of 1998-99. This cross-holding of Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) buying 10 per\ncent government stake in ONGC and 5 per cent stake in GAIL, ONGC buying 10 per cent in IOC and 5\nper cent in GAIL, and GAIL buying 2.5 per cent stake in ONGC helped the government gather %4,867\ncrore at the end of the year. The lock-in period of these shares came to an end in September 2004.\nStrategic Sale: The Disinvestment Commission in 1996 advocated \u2018strategic sales\u2019 of particular PSUs\nor sales of equity blocks to a single buyer accompanied by the transfer of management to the private\ninvestor. The government also felt the need for privatization as opposed to just disinvestment. It preferred\nto privatize the PSUs through the strategic sale route. A strategic sale is indicative of the government's\nsincerity about disinvestment. It also enables a higher valuation since it takes into account intrinsic valu-\nation, not just the prevailing market price. Moreover, private investors introduce new technologies, induct\nfresh investments, and improve efficiency. Under strategic sale, the government transfers part of its hold-\ning to a strategic partner who would control the operation and financial policy of the enterprise. The\nstrategic partner is chosen through an elaborate bidding process. The transfer of ownership is subject to\ncertain restrictions imposed through covenants. However, strategic sale may inhibit competition and limit\nthe ability of the government to realise the full value of the assets. The first strategic sale was of Modern\nFood where the government offloaded 74 per cent of its equity to Hindustan Lever for %105.45 Crore.\nThe strategic sale of Baleo, CMC, HTL, MFIL, PPL, JESSOP, IBP, LIMC, VSNL, HZL, Maruti, and\n\nIPCL was done at a higher price-earnings ratio ranging between 11 and 89. VSNL price-earnings ratio\nof around 11 was higher by around 6 than in case of public issue. In strategic sale, the money goes to\nthe government exchequer instead of the company. The government has adopted the competitive bidding\nroute to ensure the success of the disinvestment programme. The group or the corporate securing the bid\nthen has to make an open offer for acquiring shares from the public at six months\u2019 average price as per\nSEBI's takeover code. The recourse to strategic sale has made the process of disinvestment more ben-\neficial from the revenue point of view. Between 1991 and 1997, the sale of minority shares in blue chip\nPSUs such as ONGC, IOC, GAIL, and VSNL fetched a price\u2014earnings ratio of 4.4 to 6. With strategic\nsales, the price-earnings ratio spurted to between 11 and 89. The amount so realized was %1 1,335 crore,\nfrom the disinvestment of a mere 1.02 per cent of the government equity of 8885 crore.\n\nThe Ministry of Disinvestment has set certain guidelines for evaluating PSUs. It has suggested four\nmethods to arrive at the reserve price of a PSU. These are: the discounted cash flow (DCF) method, the\nbalance sheet method, the market multiple method, and the asset valuation method.\n\nThe DCF method discounts the expected future cash flows of the PSU to arrive at its present value. The\nbalance sheet method values a company on the basis of the value of its underlying assets. This method does\nnot project the future cash flow. The market multiple method uses information on how the market is evaluating\ncomparable firms. The asset valuation method estimates the cost of replacing the tangible assets of the business\nand the costs so arrived at as the value of the firm. The asset valuation method overlooks the value of intangibles\nsuch as goodwill, brands, distribution network, and customer relationships which are important to determine the\nintrinsic value of the enterprise. The asset valuation method is more suitable in case of liquidation than in the\ncase of companies sold as running concerns. The DCF method is superior to the other three as it projects future\ncash flows and the earning potential of the firm, takes into account intangibles such as brand equity, marketing\nand distribution networks, the level of competition likely to be faced in the future, risk factors to which the enter-\nprise is exposed as well as the value of its core assets. Sometimes, it is better to use a combination of methods\nin case of PSUs having sizeable tangible assets such as surplus land, which are unrelated to its core business.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Strategic Sales Techniques\n\nIn the years 2000-01 and 2001-02, 14 PSUs were disinvested. The disinvestment ministry had evolved\ninnovative methods to make them attractive for sale. In case of Balco and VSNL, the government retained\ncash and the real estate of the company and sold the remaining assets while in the case of India Tourism\nDevelopment Corporation (ITDC) and the Shipping Corporation of India (SCI), it spun off various assets\nas separate and individual entities. The government financially restructured the ailing Paradeep Phos-\nphates before the sale, to make it more attractive to prospective buyers.\n\n\u2018Two sell-offs in 2002, that of Maruti Udyog Limited (MUL) and Indian Petrochemical Corporation Limited\n(IPCL), were unique in the 11-year history of disinvestment. In the case of Maruti, the government decided to\nsell 50 per cent holding in three phases. The first phase entailed 2400 crore rights issue in which the government\nwould renounce its entitlement in favour of its equal foreign partner, Suzuki Motor Corporation, for a consid-\neration of 71,000 crore. Suzuki's stake was to go upto 54.5 per cent after the issue and the %400 crore were to\nflow into the company\u2019s coffers. Suzuki also paid 71000 crore as control premium. In the second phase, the\nGovernment of India would sell 36 lakh shares in an initial public offer (IPO) and earn a minimum of %828 crore\nas Suzuki had underwritten these shares at a price of 22,300 (face value 7100). The government's remaining\nstake was to be sold in the last phase. Suzuki was only picking up 4.5 per cent additional stake under the rights\nissue to become a majority owner and it would be obliged to buy the remaining stake only if the government\nwas unable to get a predetermined minimum price for its share in the two subsequent public issues. In 2003, the\ngovernment divested 27.5 per cent by way of initial public offering (IPO) which was a huge success. The issue\nwas oversubscribed ten times and opened with a premium of 25.2 per cent.\n\nIn the IPCL case, the government of India sold-off one of its units prior to the sale to prevent the\ncreation of a monopoly in the petrochemical sector. The sale of one unit (the Baroda unit to IOC) prior\nto disinvestment made IPCL more attractive for the buyer\u2014Reliance\u2014as the unit was the oldest and\nthe least profitable. The government held a 59.95 per cent stake in the petrochemicals giant and to dilute\nits holdings it decided to sell its 51 per cent holding in two phases. In the first phase, the government\ninvited financial bids in April 2002 from prospective bidders\u2014Reliance Industries, 1OC\u2014the Chatterjee\nGroup Combine and Nirma for a 26 per cent stake in the oil giant. On May 18, 2002, Reliance Industries\nLimited (RIL) became the strategic buyer as it had submitted the highest bid of 2231 per share for a\ntotal consideration of 21491 crore. RIL further bought 20 per cent from the market to take its holding to\n46 per cent. The second phase involved selling 25 per cent of its stake in tranches of 10 per cent or less\nevery year, either in the market or to a strategic buyer.\n\n",

                        "extracted-text": "PROCEEDS REALIZED FROM DISINVESTMENT\n\nThe government has collected disinvestment proceeds of around %49,214 crore from the sale of 50 PSUs\nin the last 15 years. There have been only four years (1991-92, 1994-95, 1998-99, and 2003-04) during\nwhich the actual receipts have exceeded the targeted receipts. The success has been due to acceptance of\nextremely low bids in 1991-92 for share bundles which included premium shares offloading in 1994-95\nof a large chunk of shares in attractive PSU giants such as BHEL, GAIL, and Bharat Petroleum and\nthrough cross-holdings wherein cash-rich PSUs were forced to buy back equity of other PSUs.\n\nDuring 1993-94, disinvestment was held in March 1994 and the bids were opened in April 1994. Thus,\nthe proceeds so realized were accounted as capital receipts of 1994-95. The actual mobilization under the\ndisinvestment programme fell short of the targeted amount in the budget for three successive years\u2014from\n1995-96 to 1997-98\u2014due to sluggish capital market conditions. Hence, the government adopted the\nGDR route to mobilize resources under this programme.\n\nThe Supreme Court judgement in December 2001 validating the previous fiscal\u2019s (FY 2001) sale of alu-\nminium major Balco to Sterlite Industries, gave impetus to the limping disinvestment process. Moreover,\nthe disinvestment ministry headed by Arun Shourie was able to sell-off PSUs at a hefty premium by adopt-\ning the competitive bidding route. The successful bidders were supposed to make an open offer to investors\nother than the government. These helped in creating a bullish environment in the PSU segment. The PSU\nstocks which were trading at a discount started trading at price-earnings multiples comparable to private\nsector blue chips. The BSE PSU index rose 531.27 points or 57.44 per cent between December 31, 2001\nand March 31, 2002. The BSE Sensex was up only by 207.02 points or 6.34 per cent in the same period.\n\nBuoyed by this spurt in market prices of PSU shares, the Department of Disinvestment mooted a pro-\nposal on July 8, 2002, for mopping up %25,000 crore by making public offers in five major PSUs. These\ninclude BSNL, IOC, GAIL, NTPC, and ONGC. The government owns 100 per cent stake in BSNL and\nNTPC, 82 per cent in IOC and ONGC, and 67 per cent in GAIL.\n\nIn the last four years, i.e., from 1999-2000 to 2002-03, the government failed to meet its disinvest-\nment targets. The NDA government set a target of 213,200 crore in 2003-04.\n\nThe disinvestment was set-off with the initial public offering (IPO) from India\u2019s largest car maker\nMaruti Udyog Limited (MUL) which hit the primary market on June 12, 2003. The government\ndivested 25 per cent of its 45.8 per cent stake in MUL by selling 7.22 crore shares of the face value\nof 85 per share at a floor price of 2115 per share through the book-building route. The total size of the\nissue was %830 crore with a green-shoe option to sell another 72 lakh shares. The issue was offered in\n75 cities and 150 centres through 100 per cent book building process wherein 60 per cent of the issue\nwas allocated to qualified institutional buyers (QIBs), 15 per cent to non-institutional investors, and\n25 per cent to retail investors to subscribe upto 1,000 shares. The issue was over-subscribed almost\n10 times and the cut-off price was fixed at {125 per share. The MUL IPO created a history of sorts by\nlisting at \u20ac157, a 26 per cent premium to its issue price of 8125 per share. After touching an intra-day\nhigh of 2170.3, the scrip ended at %164 at over 31 per cent premium to the offer price. This spectacular\nsuccess of the MUL IPO demonstrated the merits of a disinvestment strategy where the strategic sale\n\u2018of a government company is then followed by selling residual shares to the public. The government\ngarnered %993.35 crore through this sale. Post-offer, the government's stake came down to 18.3 per cent\nfrom 45.8 per cent.\n\nOn March 27, 2002, the government had offloaded its 26 per cent equity in Hindustan Zinc to Sterlite\nIndustries for 7445 crore. In November 2003, Sterlite Industries acquired the government's residual stake\nof 18.92 per cent for 2323.88 crore.\n\nThe disinvestment programme of the government received a set-back with the Supreme Court ruling\non September 16, 2003 that disinvestment in HPCL and BPCL required parliamentary sanction as\nthese former MNCs were nationalized through an act of parliament. The planned disinvestment of\nNalco, HPCL, and BPCL were deferred. The growing Indian economy, good corporate results and a\nslow down in the US market attracted the foreign institutional investors towards Indian Stock Markets\nwhich led to a rally in the stock market. Moreover, the IPOs of UCO Bank and Vijaya Bank got good\nresponse from the market which motivated the government to offload its stakes by selling shares to the\npublic. The government decided to divest its holdings in six PSUs namely IPCL, CMC, IBP, Dredg-\ning Corporation of India Limited (DCIL), ONGC, and GAIL, in March 2004. In IPCL, CMC and IBP,\nthe government completely divested its holdings, while in others it sold only a part. The government\nreserved 25 per cent of all the offerings for retail investors and offered them shares at a 5 per cent dis-\ncount to the cut-off price. The process of disinvestment in these six PSUs began by February end and\nwas completed by mid-March, 2004.\n\nThe IPCL issue opened on February 20, 2004 at a floor price of 7170 per share which was also the\ncut-off price. The government offloaded 29 per cent stake by offering 5.94 crore shares. The IPCL issue\nwas over-subscribed 4.9 times with over two lakh applications. The government raised %1,219.24 crore\nthrough the IPCL issue.\n\nIBP and CMC issues opened on February 23, 2004. In IBP, IOC had brought majority stake of 53.58\nper cent at 1400 per share in 2001. The government offloaded 57.58 lakhs IBP shares of 710 each at a\nfloor price of %620. Initially, the IBP offer received a lukewarm response due to the sustained offloading\nof stock, but with the disinvestment minister Arun Shourie announcing a probe, IBP got over-subscribed\nby 2.80 times, receiving around 85,000 applications. The government raised 352.53 crore by divesting\nits 26 per cent stake at a cut-off price of %620.\n\nIn CMC, the government had sold 51 per cent of the paid-up capital to Tata Sons for 2152 crore, i-e., at\n2197 per share in October 2001. This price was higher than the reserve price of 8108.8 crore. The govern-\nment decided to offload the remaining 26 per cent stake in CMC at a floor price of 2475 per share. The\nissue was over-subscribed 11 times with the retail portion being over-subscribed six times. The govern-\nment collected 7188.69 crore through its offer of 39.76 lakh shares at a cut-off price of 8485 per share.\n\nThe government's offer for sale of 56 lakh shares of Dredging Corporation of India (DCI) hit the mar-\nket on February 26, 2004. The government offloaded 20 per cent of its stake in the company at a cut-off\nprice of 2400. The floor price was in the range of 385 to 2400 and the offer was over-subscribed by more\nthan nine times. Maximum bidding was seen at the ceiling of the price band set by the government and\nhence the cut-off price was set at 7400. The DCI IPO received bids for 86.62 lakh shares as against the\noffer size of 56 lakh shares. The government raised 2223.44 crore through this sale and post offer its stake\ncame down to 78.6 per cent.\n\nThe IPO of GAIL India issue opened on February 27, 2004. The government offered 8.45 crore shares\nat a floor price of 185 by disinvesting 10 per cent of its ownership to the public. In less than two days,\nthe IPO of Gail India got over-subscribed 2.41 times. The government raised %1643.63 crore through this\nissue at a cut-off price of 2195.\n\nThe government's offer for sale of 10 per cent of its stake in Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC)\nopened on March 5, 2004. This was the largest IPO in the history of the Indian primary market. Moreover,\nit was the biggest success among the six PSU IPOs. One of the factors attributing to its success was the\nissue price which was fixed in a range of 680 to 2750. The price-earning multiple worked out to around\n9.7 which was quite low when compared to its global peers and this attracted retail investors. Moreover,\nthe SEBI allowed merchant bankers and lead managers to issue participatory notes to large investors\ndomiciled overseas for ONGC shares which led to a high demand for the scrip. The offer for sale of 14.26\ncrore shares was over-subscribed 5.9 times attracting bids worth over %60,000 crore. ONGC made history\nby mopping up the targeted 710,000 crore in less than 20 minutes of its opening.\n\nThe government met its target of disinvestment after a gap of four years. These six offers for\nsale helped the government to surpass the disinvestment target of 713,200 crore by %2,347 crore.\nThrough these six offers, the government was successful in broadening the retail investor base. The strong\nresponse to ONGC issue demonstrates that the Indian stock markets can successfully execute global size\nofferings and Indian investors do respond enthusiastically to good paper.\n\nThe Manmohan Singh government (UPA) after assuming power came up with an offer for sale of\n5.25 per cent stake in state power producer, National Thermal Power Corporation which were sold in\n2004-05.\n\n\nThe government sold 8 per cent of MUL\u2019 shares in early 2006 at 678.40 per share for \u20ac1567.60 crore\nto eight public sector banks and financial institutions. The sale fetched a price higher than the prevailing\nmarket price due to the French auction model\u2014bidders pay the price that they bid. The government sold-\noff its remaining stake of 10.27 per cent stake in MUL to banks, financial institutions and private mutual\nfunds through the differential pricing method during 2008-09.\n\nThe government did not divest its stake in PSUs during the years 2006-07 and 2008-09. The govern-\nment raised &15,199 crore by selling 10 per cent stake in Coal India Limited (CIL) in 2010 through an\ninitial public offering, which was the largest ever IPO till now.

In the initial years of\nimplementation, the government talked of disinvestment without losing control and when the programme\nflopped, it talked more in terms of privatization than disinvestment.\n\nThe disinvestment programme was used as a tool to finance fiscal deficit. It was more a tool for raising\nresources to finance revenue expenditure than one to redefine the role of the government in the economy.\nThe government did not have a proper privatization policy. The government was never clear about what\nbusiness it meant to remain in and from where it needed to move out. There was a lack of political will\nand a sense of urgency, which led to sales being repeatedly stopped and restarted. Every sale undertaken\nby the government was a subject of controversy. There were differences of opinion on the methods or\npricing which slowed down the pace of disinvestment. Moreover, the lack of a politically acceptable\nagenda hampered the progress of the disinvestment programme.\n\nImprovement in efficiency should be the primary objective of privatization. This objective can be\nachieved when inefficient public sector units are privatized. Instead, in the last decade, some of the best\n\nTABLE 7.1 Summary of Receipts from disinvestmer\n\nTargets and Achievements\n\nSL.No. Financial Year Target (in Crore) Achievement (in % Crore)\n\n1 2011-12 40000 13894\n\n2 2012-13 30000 23957\n\n3 2013-14 40000 15819\n\n4 2014-15 43425 24349\n\n5 2015-16 41000 23997\n\n6 2016-17 56500 46246.58\n\n7 2017-18 72500 1195.46 (As on 09.05.2017)\n\n\nperforming units have been sold-off. Most of the blue chip companies were sold at very low prices. The\ndistress sale was a result of an inappropriate pricing strategy and delays in pricing. The delay in pricing\nthe VSNL issue resulted in a massive loss to the nation. The same mistake was committed when the shares\nof GAIL were sold at half the proposed price. To make disinvestment a success, the government should\ncome to terms with the fact that it is the market that determines the price of a PSU stock.\n\nThe Unit Trust of India was one of the financial institutions which had picked up a sizeable number of\nshares in the disinvestment programme of the early 1900s. The market price of these shares fell so sharply\nthat UTI lost %5,056 crore over an investment of %6,403 crore. The government had to bailout UTI with\ntax payers\u2019 money and at a great cost to investors.\n\nIn the case of strategic sale of a unit, the government did not put in substantial efforts to restructure or\nmarket the PSUs. Hence, most of the time it ended up selling a company cheap. For instance, the restructur-\ning of Paradeep Phosphates was incomplete and it was sold-off at a low price to Zuari Macro Phosphate.\nThe restructuring of a unit should be of both financial and operational nature. For instance, writing-off loans\nand interest for a certain period and deciding specific and achievable operational objectives for each stage.\nThus, the restructuring exercise requires long-term planning and a step-by-step approach for successful\nimplementation and timely completion. For instance, SAIL\u2019s restructuring is expected to be completed by\n2005 but it is stuck at various levels due to conflicts either with the state governments where the units are\nlocated or due to old issues not being sorted out at the initial stage. The entire restructuring exercise reflects\na half-hearted approach of the government and if restructuring is not completed as soon as it should be, the\nsale might not fetch the government a high price.\n\nDisinvestment was not a privatization programme in the real sense; it was one which led to transfer of\nmoney from one public undertaking pocket to another to bridge immediate resource gaps. Cash-rich oil\ncorporations were forced by the government to cross-hold shares in other oil PSUs. The surplus resources\nof cash-rich oil corporations could instead have been used for their restructuring to face a competitive\nenvironment. Moreover, there has been no real change in the ownership and quality of management. Most\nof the companies have had a disinvestment of less than 10 per cent of government holding.\n\nThe proceeds realized from the sale of assets should be deployed in a productive manner such as liq-\nuidation of debts or the creation of sound infrastructure. In its budgets, the government earmarked the\namount expected to be realized from disinvestment for use in social and infrastructure sectors, restruc-\nturing of PSUs and so on. However, the target amount could not be realized and whatever was realized,\nbecame a part of revenue receipts.\n\nIn 2000-01, it seemed that the disinvestment minister had managed to evolve a consistent and fairly\nsophisticated approach to disinvestment. He insisted on a proper implementation of the programme and\nbelieved in transparency. Privatization gathered momentum with 14 PSUs divested in the last 24 months.\nMost of the PSUs were sold-off during this time at a hefty premium.\n\nSince 2001, the government\u2019s emphasis was on strategic sale as it thinks that it boosts share price\nof the concerned PSU. This, in turn, increases the value of the government's residual equity. To boost\nthe disinvestment process, the finance ministry decided on June 30, 2002, to permit companies to\nraise ADRs/GDRs/ECB to fund disinvestment buyouts. Thus, bidders have access to an additional\nsource of funds and this route can bring foreign funds to the disinvestment process.\n\nThe UPA government has proposed setting up of a Board for Reconstruction of Public Sector Enter-\nprises which will replace the Disinvestment Commission. The function of this proposed board will be to\nstrengthen PSUs and make them more autonomous and professional.\n\nThe public sector still has a role to play\u2014especially in the strategic areas. The PSUs in the defence\nand aerospace sectors are top performers and have succeeded in building global brands. There are certain\nareas such as broadcasting, law and order, and regulatory bodies where PSUs are still needed.\n\nThe government has recognised that investment in CPSEs is important as they are important assets\nfor accelerating economic growth. The government is adopting a multi-pronged strategy for managing its\ninvestment in CPSEs:\ninvestment of CPSEs through minority stake sale (upto 49 percent), listing of profitable CPSEs and\nStrategic disinvestment.\n\nManaging Government of India\u2019s investment in CPSEs through capital restructuring for optimising\nreturns on investment; and financial restructuring for revival/strengthening.\n\nThis will be a real challenge for the government as it has to balance the national priorities and invest-\nment and disinvestment in CPSEs.\n\n",

These countries had laid down clear-cut objectives and strategies (methodology) for disin-\nvestment. Most of them were successful in attaining their objectives which included decrease in govern-\nment control in the country\u2019s economy.\n\nThe UK\u2019s disinvestment programme is cited as one of the most successful of all.

The\nstated objective was to reduce the role of the government in the economy and apply the resources thus\nfreed to better governance. In the UK, privatization was encouraged through the multiple methods of\ndirect sale, management buyouts, and floatation of public issues. Large corporations such as British\nTelecom (BT) and British Airways were restructured by installing good management with full autonomy\nbefore they were offered to the public. These entities were aggressively marketed and their shares were\nunderpriced which led to an over-subscription of 35 to 45 times. In most of the large companies, the\ngovernment sold a 100 per cent stake through public issues. The impact of privatization was that most of\nthe companies including British Airways and Enterprise Oil could improve their performance and profit-\nability. In fact, privatization led to an improvement in service standards and consumers were paying less\nand getting more.\n\nCountries such as Japan, France, Italy, and Germany have raised almost USD 285 billion through\n120 public offerings.

Moreover, this model has helped develop capital markets and promote an equity\nculture among domestic investors. The disinvestment proceeds were utilized to trim budget deficits,\nenhance institutional and structural competence, and to improvise on the social costs emerging as a\nresult of disinvestment.\n",

For instance, there are some PSUs which are loss-making but\nare of immense value due to their production capacities and/or distribution network. In such cases,\na better price can be obtained from strategic sale rather than sale in open market to retail investors\nwhile in some PSUs, retail interest may be necessary to drive the trading volumes. Moreover, offering\ngood PSU stock to the retail segment can improve market sentiments and broad base the sharehold-\ning. Finally, the speed of the disinvestment process is a critical variable for its success. The increase\nin competition and drying up of the resources of the government can weaken even strong PSUs. A\ndelay in disinvestment can not only weaken these PSUs, but also reduce the value that can be realized\nthrough their sale.\n\nA smooth and successful disinvestment programme of central PSUs can raise the probabilities of\nsuccessful disinvestment of state PSUs.\n",

The real beginning, however, occurred in the middle\nof the nineteenth century, after the enactment of the Companies Act in 1850 which introduced the\nfeature of limited liability, and generated investor interest in corporate securities.\n\nThe Native Share and Stock Brokers\u2019 Association, now known as the Bombay Stock\nExchange (BSE) was formed in Bombay (now Mumbai) in 1875. This was followed by the\nformation of association/exchanges in Ahmedabad in 1894, Calcutta (now Kolkata) in 1908,\nand Madras (now Chennai) in 1937. In order to promote the orderly development of the stock\nmarket, the central government introduced a comprehensive legislation called the Securities\nContracts (Regulation) Act, 1956.\n\nThe Calcutta Stock Exchange (CSE) was the largest stock exchange in India till the 1960s.\nIn 1961, there were 1,203 listed companies across the various stock exchanges of the country.\nOf these, 576 were listed on the CSE and 297 on the BSE. However, during the later half of the\n1960s, the relative importance of the CSE declined while that of the BSE increased sharply.\n\nTable 8.1 shows the phenomenal growth in the operations of the stock markets in India till\nthe nineties.\n\nTill the early 1990s, the Indian secondary market comprised regional stock exchanges with\nthe BSE heading the list.

The trading members, who provide broking services, owned, controlled and managed\nthe exchanges. The governing body was vested with wide-ranging powers to elect office-bearers, set up\ncommittees, admit and expel members, manage properties and finances of the exchange, resolve disputes\nand conduct day-to-day affairs of the exchange.\n\nThe OTCEI and the NSE are demutualized exchanges wherein the ownership and management of the\nexchange are separated from the right to trade on exchange. The National Stock Exchange was the only\ntax-paying company incorporated under the Companies Act and promoted by leading financial institu-\ntions and banks.\n\nBrokers are members of the stock exchange. They enter trades either on their own account or on behalf\nof their clients. They are given a certificate of registration by the SEBI and they have to comply with the\nprescribed code of conduct. Over a period of time, many brokers with proprietary and partnership firms\nhave converted themselves into corporate entities. Both NSE as well as OTCEI have laid down strict\nstandards for the admission of members, which relate to capital adequacy, track record, education, experi-\nence and so on, to ensure quality broking services.\n\nBrokers are important intermediaries in the stock markets as they bring buyers and sellers together, and\naid in price discovery. There are three classes of brokers, namely, proprietary, partnership and corporate. In\nthe old exchanges, most of the brokers are proprietary in nature, whereas in the new exchanges, they are\ncorporate members. Several structural changes have taken place in the Indian broking industry over the\npast few years. Consolidation and reconstructuring have assumed considerable importance in this segment.\nAs on March 31, 2010, there were 9,772 brokers and 4,424 brokers in the cash segment registered with the\nSEBI. The CSE has the highest number of brokers followed by the NSE, the OTCEI and the BSE.\n\nA stock broker is required to pay an annual registration fee of 85,000, if his turnover per year does\nnot exceed @1 crore. If it does, he has to pay %5,000 plus one-hundredth of 1 per cent of the turnover in\nexcess of @1 crore. About 5 years from the date of initial registration, he has to pay %5,000 for a block of\n5 financial years. The exchange also levies transaction charges.\n\nThe brokerage on transactions varies from broker to broker. The maximum brokerage that can be\nlevied is 2.5 per cent of the contract price, exclusive of statutory levies such as SEBI-turnover fee, ser-\nvice tax and stamp duty. He is also required to pay the exchange, the transaction charges at the rate of\n0.0035 per cent (83.5 per @1 lakh) of the turnover. Trading members are also required to pay securities-\ntransaction tax (STT) on all delivery-based transaction, at the rate of 0.125 per cent (payable by both\nbuyer as well as seller), and, in case of non-delivery transactions, at the rate of 0.025 per cent, for\nequities payable by the seller alone). Stamp duties are also payable by him as per the rates prescribed\nby the relevant states.\n\nBrokers can now offer direct market-access (DMA) facility to institutional clients that allow clients\na direct access to the exchange-trading system, through the broker's infrastructure, without any manual\nintervention by the broker. This enables brokers to have a direct control of clients over orders, faster\nexecution of client orders, reduced risk of errors associated with manual-order entry, greater transpar-\nency, increased liquidity, lower-impact costs for large orders, better audit trails and better use of hedging\nand arbitrage opportunities through the use of decision-support tools/algorithms for trading.\n\nConsolidation is taking place in the broking industry. Small brokerages are shutting shop as the big\nbroking entities have cornered a big chunk of the broking business.\n",

Inother words, it was the brokers who traded, collectively owned and managed these exchanges.\nThe ownership and managerial rights of the brokers often led to a conflict of interests, wherein the\ninterest of brokers was preserved over those of the investors. Instances of price rigging, recurring pay-\nment crisis on stock exchanges and misuse of official position by office bearers, have been unearthed\nin the last few years. As a result, both rolling settlement as well as demutualization of stock exchanges\nwere announced to preserve their integrity.\n\nDemutualization is the process by which any member-owned organization can become a shareholder-\nowned company. Such a company could either be listed on a stock exchange or be closely held by its\nshareholders.\n\nStock exchanges in India were either Section-25 companies under the Companies Act or an association\nof persons. Hence, stock exchanges were exempt from all taxes. The NSE, the OTCEI and the ICSE were\nset up as demutualized stock exchanges. The NSE was set up as a demutualized entity and is owned by\nfinancial institutions. Although the ISE was set up as demutualized, it was not a profit-making organization,\nwhich means that even if the profit gets generated, it cannot be distributed among owners, like in the\nNSE. Like the ISE, the OTCEI has been set up with a not-for-profit motive. It was the first demutualized\nexchange in the country, set up with a share capital of 10 crores and promoted by prominent Indian finan-\ncial institutions. Table 8.3 provides a comparison of the NSE model and international models of demutual-\nized exchanges.\n\nThrough demutualization, a stock exchange becomes a corporate entity, changing from a non-profit-\nmaking company to a profit- and tax-paying company. Demutualization separates the ownership and control\nof stock exchanges from the trading rights of its members. This reduces the conflict of interest between the\nexchange and the brokers and the chances of brokers using the stock exchanges for personal gains. With\ndemutualization, stock exchanges have access to more funds for investment in technology, mergers with\nand acquisition of other exchanges, and for strategic alliances with other exchanges. Members of the stock\nexchange also benefit by demutualization as their assets become liquid and they get a share of the profits\nmade by the exchange through dividends. Demutualization makes operations of the stock exchange trans-\nparent, which facilitates better governance.\n\nDemutualization process is similar to a company-going public\u2014owners will be given equity shares.\nThe exchange offers equity capital, either through dilution of existing promoters stake or by the fresh\nissue of capital. The process seeks to give majority control (5 per cent) of the exchange to investors who\ndo not have trading rights. This is to allow a better regulation of the exchange. Once listed as a public\ncompany, the exchange will be governed by the corporate-governance codes to ensure transparency.\n\nThere has been a global trend towards demutualization, wherein 17 stock exchanges including NAS-\nDAQ, and those of Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, London and Tokyo have already been demutualized,\nand another 15 are in the process of demutualization. The Amsterdam and Australian Stock Exchanges\nhave become publicly listed companies. In Asia, the Singapore Stock Exchange (SGX) and the Singapore\nMonetary Exchange have merged.\n\nIn November 2002, SEBI approved the uniform model of corporatization and demutualization of stock\nexchanges, recommended by the Kania Committee. The committee recommended that stock exchanges\nin India, which were set up as associations of persons, should be converted into companies, limited by\nshares. The three stakeholders of the exchange\u2014the shareholders, brokers and the investing public\u2014\nshould equally represent the board. The trading and ownership rights, currently coded in the broker's\nmembership card, should be separated. A broker will get trading rights after paying a certain fee, fixed\nby the exchange. The ownership right, however, will reside with the shareholders of the corporatized\nexchange. The shares of an exchange can also be listed on other exchanges.\n\nThe Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act was amended on October 12, 2004, through an ordinance, mak-\ning it compulsory for the exchanges to convert into corporate entities and delink their broker members from the\n\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Policy on review of Ownership and Governance\nof Market Infrastructure Institutions\n\nA Committee was constituted to examine the issues arising from the ownership and governance of Market\nInfrastructure Institutions (Mlls). The committee has submitted its report. The Board considered the\nReport of the committee and other related matter and took the following major decisions:\n\nNetworth and Ownership Norms for Mils\n\n1. The Stock Exchanges will have minimum networth of %100 crore and the existing Stock Exchanges\nwill be given 3 years to achieve this networth of 7100 crore. The minimum networth for the Clear-\ning Corporation (CC) and the Depository will be & 300 crore and %100 crore respectively. All\nexisting clearing corporations shall be mandated to build up to the prescribed networth of 7300\ncrore over a period of three years from the date of notification/circular.\n\n2. i, The Stock Exchanges will have diversified ownership and no single investor will be allowed\n\nto hold more than 5 per cent except the Stock Exchange, Depository, Insurance Company,\n\nBanking Company or public financial institution which may hold upto 15 per cent.\n\nAt least 51 per cent of the holding of the Stock Exchanges shall be held by public.\n\n|. _In case of CCs at least 51 per cent holding will be held by Stock Exchanges. No Stock\n\nExchange can hold more than 15 per cent in more than one CC. To ensure diversified owner-\nship for shareholders other than Stock Exchanges, the limit of 5 per cent and 15 per cent shall\napply as in the case of Stock Exchanges.\n\niv. In case of depositories minimum 51 per cent holding will be held by sponsors and the exist-\n\ning list of sponsors will continue. No other entity will be allowed to hold more than 5 per cent\nof equity share capital. Stock Exchange can hold upto 24 per cent.\n\n\nv. The sharcholding limits prescribed for each category of investors shall be inclusive of all instru-\nments that provide for equity or rights over equity at any future date. The voting rights of no share-\nholder shall, however, exceed the prescribed maximum sharcholding limit at any point in time.\n\nGovernance Structure\n\n1. Autonomy of Regulatory Departments in MII will be maintained in order to avoid conflicts of\n\ninterest between regulatory and business functions of the MII\u2014\n\na. Member\n\ni) The heads of departments of Member Regulation will directly report to an independent\ncommittee of the board of the Stock Exchange as well as to MD/CEO (dual reporting).\n\nii) The long term goal would however be to set up an independent SRO at an appropriate time\nin future and provide the seed fund for the same.\n\nb. Listing Regulation\n\ni) In Order to prevent a regulatory race to the bottom SEBI will prescribe the minimum listing\nstandards to be followed by Exchanges.\n\nii) The head of departments of Listing Regulation will cSrecr. report to an independent com-\nmittee of the board of the Stock Exchange as well as to MO/CEO (dual reporting).\n\n\u00a2. Trading Regulation\nThe surveillance function will report to an independent committee of the Board of the Exchange\nas well as to the MD/CEO.\n\nAll the independent committees will have a majority of Independent directors and will be\nheaded by one of them.\n\n4. Besides the above a Conflict Resolution Committee (CRC) will be formed by SEBI with majority\nexternal and Independent members to deal with all issues concerning conflicts of interest. Issues of\nconflicts will be referred by Exchanges or may be taken up suo motu by CRC. The independent com-\nmittee of Exchanges responsible for regulatory functions shall have regular interaction with CRC.\n\ne. Separation of Risk Management to Independent Clearing Corporation\nAmong the functions of the Exchange it is the Clearing Corporation (CC) or Clearing House that\nfully bears the risk of payment and delivery by providing a guaranteed settlement of all transac-\ntions on the Exchange. It has therefore been decided, inter alia, that the central role of the clearing\nfunction will be separated into an independent corporation with its own prescribed networth:\ni. Clearing and settlement must compulsorily be carried out through a recognized clearing\ncorporation under Regulation framed by SEBI.\nii. To ensure effective supervision of CCs through regulations of SEBI.\nCC will constitute a risk committee comprising independent members which shall report to the\nBoard of the CC as well as directly to SEBI on issues and matters so identified and prescribed.\niv. An expert committee will be set up by SEBI to examine the viability of introducing a single\nclearing corporation or interoperability between different CCs.\n\n2. The Board of Stock Exchanges/CC. will not have any Trading Member/Clearing Member repre-\nsentative. However, an Advisory Committee shall be constituted by the Board of Stock Exchange/\nCC, comprising of Trading Members/Clearing Members, to take benefit of experience of such\nMembers. All recommendations of the Advisory Committee shall be placed in the ensuing Board\nmeeting for consideration and appropriate decision. The Public Interest Directors representation on\nBoard of Stock Exchange shall not be lesser than the number of shareholder directors and in case\nof recognized clearing corporation will be 2/3 of the Board strength.\n\n3. Appointment of all Directors to the Board of Stock Exchanges/CC will be subject to approval by\nSEBI. Appointment of MD/CEO of Depository will also be subject to approval by SEBI.\n\n4. The compensation structure for key management personnel are to be based on the principles of sound\ncompensation practices issued by international fora like Financial Stability Board. The decisions in this\nregard are directed towards curbing incentives that result in excessive risk taking in the short term:\n\nPart One: Policies and Programmes\ni. A compensation committee consisting of majority Public Interest Directors (PID) and chaired by\na PID will determine the compensation of Key Management Personnel.\nii, The variable pay component will not exceed one-third of total pay.\niii, Of the variable pay 50 per cent of it will be paid on a deferred basis after three years\niv. ESOPs and other equity linked options in the Ml will not form part of the compensation for the\nidentified key management personnel.\n\n\nv. The compensation policy to key management personnel will be approved by SEBI. Also, the\nterms and conditions of the remuneration shall not be changed without the approval of SEBI.\nvi. The compensation policy may have \u2018claw back\u2019 arrangements.\n\nProfits of Mils\n1. To bolster the risk management capacity of C.C. the stock exchange will be mandated to transfer 25\nper cent of their profits to the Settlement Guarantee Fund of the CCs where their trades are settled.\n2. In case of depository 25 per cent of the profits will be transferred to Investor Protection Fund of\nthe depositories.\n3. The non-core activities of Mlls will have to be segregated to a separate legal entity and when a related\nbusiness of an MIl delivers a service to another Ml it will provide equal and fair access to all.\n\nListing\n1. The stock exchanges may be permitted to list when they put in place the appropriate mechanisms\nfor tackling conflicts of interest.\n2. The stock exchanges will not be allowed to list on itself.\n3. A recognized stock exchange shall be eligible for listing after three years of continuous trading\noperations immediately preceding the date of application of listing.\n4, Depository may also be allowed to list but not the clearing corporation considering its risk bearing role.\n\nPolicy on Exit of Non-operational Stock Exchanges\n\nThe following was decided by the board with regard to exit of stock exchanges which are non-operational\nor have been de-recognized:\n\n1. The Board decided the process of de-recognition and exit of stock exchanges. A stock exchange\nwithout any trading at its own platform or where the annual trading is less than 7 1,000 crore may\napply for voluntary de-recognition and exit. If the stock exchange ible for voluntary de-recog-\nnition is not able to achieve a turnover of % 1,000 crore on continuous basis or does not apply for\nvoluntary de-recognition and exit within a period of two years from the date of notification, SEBI\nshall proceed with the compulsory de-recognition and exit of such stock exchange.\n\n2. With regard to exit option to shareholders of exclusively listed companies, a mechanism of dissemi-\nnation board at stock exchange is decided on the lines of bulletin board.\n\n3. With regard to treatment of assets of the de-recognized stock exchanges, the Board decided that the\nstock exchanges may be permitted to exit subject to certain conditions such as payment of statutory\ndues to Government/SEBI contribution of certain percentage of assets of the exchange towards\nInvestor Protection and Education Fund etc.\n\n4. The trading members of the de-recognized stock exchange will continue to avail trading opportu-\nnity through its existing subsidiary company, which will function as a normal broking entity, at the\nExchanges having nationwide trading terminals.\n\nAs on March 31, 2016, 17 regional stock exchanges had been granted exit by SEBI. Exclusively listed\ncompanies at Regional Stock Exchanges (RSEs), which failed to obtain a listing on any other stock\nexchange, had to be listed companies and moved to the dissemination board by the exiting stock exchange.\nThe exiting stock exchanges were required to enter into an agreement with at least one of the stock\nexchanges with nationwide trading terminals providing a dissemination board. In 2015-16, shares of 372\nexclusively listed companies at RSEs were made available for buying/selling on the dissemination board\nof NSE. Similarly at BSE, in 2015-16, the shares of 1,422 exclusively listed companies at RSEs were\nmade available for buying/selling on the dissemination board.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "LISTING OF SECURITIES\n\n\u2018A company has to list its securities on the exchange so that they are available for trading. A company\ncan seek listing on more than one stock exchange. Earlier, it was compulsory to list on the regional stock\nexchange that is nearest to its registered office, but now it is not mandatory. A security listed on one\nexchange is permitted for trading on the other.\n\nA company seeking listing of its securities on the stock exchange is required to file an application,\nin the prescribed form, with the Exchange before issue of Prospectus by the company, where the securi-\nties are issued by way of a prospectus or before issue of Offer for Sale, where the securities are issued\nby way of an offer for sale. The prospectus should state the names of the stock exchanges, where the\n\nsecurities are proposed to be listed. It has to enter into a listing agreement with the stock exchange.\nAs per Section 73 of the Companies Act, 1956, a company seeking listing of its securities on a stock\nexchange is required to submit a letter of application to all the stock exchanges where it proposes to\nhave its securities listed, before filing the prospectus with the registrar of companies. Section 21 of the\nSecurities Contract (Regulation) Act, 1956, deals with the listing of the public companies. Section 19\nof the Securities Contract (Regulation) Rules, 1957, deals with the requirements and documents to be\nsubmitted with respect to the listing of securities on a recognized stock exchange. The documents that\nneed to be submitted are: Memorandum and articles of association and, in case of a debenture issue,\na copy of the trust deed, prospectus or statements in lieu of prospectus, offers for sale and circulars or\nadvertisements offering any securities for subscription or sale during the last 5 years, balance sheets\nand audited accounts for the last 5 years, or in the case of new companies, for such shorter period for\nwhich accounts have been made up; a statement showing dividends and cash bonuses, if any, paid\nduring the last 10 years (or such shorter period as the company has been in existence, whether as a\nprivate or public company) and dividends or interest in arrears, if any; certified copies of agreements\nor other documents relating to arrangements with or between vendors and/or promoters, underwriters\nand sub-underwriters, and brokers and sub-brokers; a statement containing particulars of the dates of,\nand parties to all material contracts, agreements (including agreements for technical advice and col-\nlaboration), concessions and similar other documents (except those entered into in the ordinary course\nof business carried on or intended to be carried on by the company), together with a brief description of\nthe terms, subject matter and general nature of the documents; a brief history of the company since its\nincorporation giving details of its activities including any reorganization, reconstruction or amalgama-\ntion, changes in its capital structure (authorized, issued and subscribed) and debenture borrowings, if\nany; particulars of shares and debentures issued (i) for consideration other than cash, whether in whole\nor part, (ii) at a premium or discount or (iii) in pursuance of an option; and a statement containing par-\nticulars of any commission, brokerage, discount or other special terms including an option for the issue\nof any kind of the securities granted to any person. The SEBI issues guidelines/circulars prescribing\ncertain norms to be included in the listing agreement and to be complied by the companies.\n\nIn case the exchange does not admit the company\u2019s securities for listing, the company cannot pro-\nceed with the allotment of shares. However, the company may file an appeal before SEBI under Section\n22 of Securities Contract (Regulation) Act, 1956 (SCRA, 1956), and also to the Securities Appellate\nTribunal (SAT).\n\nA company delisted by a stock exchange and seeking relisting at the same exchange is required to\nmake a fresh public offer and comply with the extant guidelines of the exchange. Provisions in the list-\ning agreement attempt to ensure liquidity and investor protection in the stock market. There were 5,900\nsecurities listed on exchanges and around 6,94,000 unlisted companies in India at the end of March 2009.\nUnlisted companies follow provisions under the Companies Act which are less stringent. Because the\ncompliance cost of listing are high, companies do not prefer to get listed on the stock exchanges. The\ncompliance costs for listed companies include expenses for carrying out legal formalities, costs for com-\nmunicating quarterly and annual financial reports to shareholders, printing and posting costs of reports,\nlisting fee to the exchanges and reporting board decisions to exchanges.\n\n\u2018A company can seek listing if at least 10 per cent of the securities, subject to a minimum of 20-lakh\nsecurities, have been offered to the public for subscription. In addition, the size of the net offer to the public\n(ce., the offer price multiplied by the number of securities offered to the public, excluding reservations, firm\nallotment and promoters\u2019 contribution) is not less than 7100 crores and the issue is made only through book-\nbuilding method with 60 per cent of the issue size allocated to the qualified institutional buyers (QIBs).\nAlternatively, a company has to offer at least 25 per cent of the securities to the general public.\n\nA company needs to obtain \u2018in-principle\u2019 approval for listing from the exchanges having nationwide\ntrading terminals where it is listed, before issuing further shares or securities. Where the company is\nnot listed on any exchange having nationwide trading terminals, it needs to obtain such \u2018in-principle\u2019\napproval from all the exchanges in which it is listed before issuing further shares or securities. Moreover,\nthe equity-listing agreement has been amended to prohibit listed companies from issuing shares with\nsuperior rights as to voting or dividend vis-A-vis the rights on the equity shares that are already listed.\n\nThe basic norms for listing of securities are uniform for all exchanges. They are specified in the list-\ning agreement entered into between the company and the concerned exchange and their compliance is\nmonitored by the exchanges. The stock exchanges levy annual listing fees from the listed companies; this\nconstitutes their major source of income.\n\nThe following eligibility criteria have been prescribed effective August 1, 2006 for listing of compa-\nnies on BSE, through Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) and Follow-on Public Offerings (FPOs):\n\n\nCompanies have been classified as large-cap companies and small-cap companies. A large-cap com-\npany is a company with a minimum issue size of 210 crores and market capitalization of not less than 725\ncrores. A small-cap company is a company other than a large-cap company.\n\n1. In respect of Large-Cap Companies: The minimum post-issue paid-up capital of the applicant\ncompany shall be %3 crores; issue size shall be 210 crores; and the market capitalization of the\ncompany shall be 225 crores (market capitalization shall be calculated by multiplying the post-\nissue paid-up number of equity shares with the issue price).\n\n2. In respect of Small-Cap Companies: The minimum post-issue paid-up capital of the Company\nshall be 3 crores; the issue size shall be %3 crores; the market capitalization of the Company shall\nbe &5 crores; the income/turnover of the Company shall be %3 crores in each of the preceding\nthree 12-month period; and number of public shareholders after the issue shall be 1,000. A due\ndiligence study may be conducted by an independent team of Chartered Accountants or Merchant\nBankers appointed by BSE, the cost of which will be borne by the company. The requirement of\na due diligence study may be waived if a financial institution or a scheduled commercial bank has\nappraized the project in the preceding 12 months.\n\nThe BSE issued new listing norms in August 2002 for companies listed on other exchanges and seek-\ning listing on the BSE. These companies should have a minimum issued and paid-up equity capital of\n%3 crores, minimum net worth of %20 crores, profit-making track record of 3 years, minimum market cap at\n\u2018two times its paid-up capital, and a dividend track record for three consecutive years with a minimum\ndividend of at least 10 per cent. Besides, there should be a two-year track record of being listed on a\nregional exchange. At least 25 per cent of the issued capital should be with a non-promoter and no single\nshareholder should hold more than 0.5 per cent of the capital.\n\nAfter a security is issued to the public and listed on a stock exchange, the issuing company has to make\ncontinuous disclosures relating to financial results, material information which would have a bearing on\nthe performance of the company, and information in the form of a statement on the actual utilization of\nfunds and actual profitability as against the projected utilization of funds and projected profitability, on a\nquarterly basis to the stock exchanges. To improve transparency, the SEBI made it mandatory for listed\ncompanies to provide their half-yearly results and disclose their balance sheets\u2014audited or un-audited\u2014\nevery 6 months to the stock exchanges. Listed companies will also be permitted to submit accounts under\nthe international financial reporting standards (IFRS), which calls for greater disclosures.\n\nThe SEBI issued new norms for listing and raising of funds by small and medium enterprises (SMEs)\non November 9, 2009. According to the norms, Companies listed on the SME exchanges would be\nexempted from the eligibility norms applicable for IPOs and FPOs prescribed in the SEBI (Issue of\nCapital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009 (ICDR). SEBI has prescribed a minimum IPO\napplication size of 21 lakh in order to have informed, financially sound and well-researched investors\nwith a certain risk-taking ability. The minimum trading lot under the SME platform would be Rs! lakh.\nFor listing on the main boards of NSE and BSE, an upper limit of 225 crores paid-up capital has been\nprescribed for a company wanting to be listed on the SME platform/exchange and having a minimum\npaid-up capital of 210 crores. In other words, 225 crores would be the maximum capital permissible to be\nraised under the SME platform. If the paid-up capital is more than 225 crores, trading will be on the main\nplatform. The entire public offer of small and medium companies will have to be underwritten. The offer\ndocument will have to be filed with SEBI and the exchange. No observations would be issued by SEBI on\nthe offer documents filed by the merchant bankers.\n\nAn exchange can take some disciplinary actions, including suspension/delisting of securities if a com-\npany fails to comply with the requirements. Delisting of securities means removal of securities of a listed\ncompany from the stock exchange where it was registered. As a result of this, the company ceases to be\ntraded at that stock exchange. There are two methods for delisting: compulsory and voluntary.\n\nA stock exchange may compulsorily delist the shares of a listed company under certain circumstances\nsuch as non-compliance with the listing agreement for a minimum period of 6 months, failure to maintain the\nminimum trading level of shares on the exchange, insider trading, manipulation of share prices, unfair market\npractices by promoters/directors, inability to meet current debt obligations or to adequately finance operations\ndue to sickness, or has not paid interest on debentures for the last 2-3 years, or has become defunct, or there\nare no employees, or liquidator appointed. Under compulsory delisting, the promoter of the company shall be\nliable to compensate the sharcholders of the company by paying them the fair value of the securities held by\nthem and acquiring their securities, subject to their option to remain security holders with the company. In such\ncase, there is no provision for an exit route for the shareholders except that the stock exchanges would allow\ntrading in the securities under the permitted category for a period of 1 year after delisting.\n\nThe SEBI has issued the delisting guidelines for voluntary delisting from any stock exchange other than\nthe regional stock exchange. The companies need to obtain prior approval of the holders of the securities\nsought to be delisted, by a special resolution at a General Meeting of the company. The shareholders will\nbe provided with an exit opportunity by the promoters or those who are in the control of the management.\n\nCompanies can get delisted from all stock exchanges following the substantial acquisition of shares.\nThe regulations state that if the public shareholding goes down to 10 per cent or less of the voting capi-\ntal of the company, the acquirer making the offer, has the option to buy the outstanding shares from the\nremaining shareholders at the same offer price. However, under the existing SEBI takeover code, the exit\nprice is based on the average of the preceding 26-week high and low prices.\n\nAn exit-price mechanism called \u2018reverse book-building method\u2019 is used to arrive at the price at which\nthe shares will be bought from the shareholders. However, an exit opportunity need not be given in cases\nwhere securities continue to be listed in a stock exchange having nationwide trading terminals.\n\nDual Listing of shares of companies is not allowed in India. Dual Listing allows a company to be\nlisted on stock exchanges of two countries. This enables an investor to buy/sell shares in one country and\nsell/buy them in another country where they are listed. For example, Royal Dutch Shell and Unilever are\nlisted on the stock exchanges of the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, and Rio Tinto Group is listed on\nthe stock exchanges of Australia and the United Kingdom. Dual Listing is required when two companies in\ntwo countries enter into an agreement to operate their businesses as if they were a single enterprise (without\nan outright merger), while retaining their separate legal entity and the existing stock exchange listings. Bharti\nAirtel and the South Africa-based Telco, MTN sought dual listing of their shares where Bharti shares could\nbe listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and MTN on NSE or BSE. But the Indian government policy\ndoes not allow dual listing. There are many issues which need to be resolved to enable dual listing. Domestic\ntrading in shares denominated in foreign currency is not permitted; and to enable this, the Foreign Exchange\nManagement Act and the Companies Act need to be amended. Moreover, the Indian rupee needs to be fully\nconvertible. In addition, the domestic company\u2019s and the foreign company\u2019s composition of Boards should be\nidentical and the stock exchanges of both the countries should have similar rules and regulations.\n\nConsolidation and Streamlining of Listing Requirements for Companies SEBI (Listing Obligations\nand Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (Listing Regulations) consolidate and streamline the\nprovisions of existing listing agreements for different segments of the capital market equity (including\nconvertibles) issued by the entities listed on the main board of stock exchanges; small and medium enter-\nprises listed on the SME exchange and institutional trading platforms; non-convertible debt securities;\nnon-convertible redeemable preference shares; Indian Depository Receipts (IDRs); and securitized debt\ninstruments and units of various schemes issued by mutual funds. The listing regulations have, thus, been\nstructured to provide ease of reference while consolidating all the listing requirements for the various\ntypes of securities listed on the stock exchanges into one single document.\n\nThe listing regulations are sub-divided into two parts: (a) substantive provisions incorporated in the\nmain body of the listing regulations; and (b) procedural requirements provided in the schedules to the\nlisting regulations.\n\nThe salient features of the Listing Regulations are:\n\na. Guiding Principles The Listing Regulations provide the broad principles (in line with the IOSCO\nObjectives and Principles of Securities Regulation) for periodic disclosures by listed entities and also\nincorporate the principles for corporate governance (in line with the G20/OECD Principles of Corporate\nGovernance). These principles underlie the specific requirements prescribed in the different chapters of\nthe Listing Regulations. In the event of the absence of any specific requirement or if there is ambiguity,\nthese principles will serve to guide the listed entities.\n\nb. Common Obligations Applicable to All Listed Entities: Obligations which are common to all\nthe listed entities have been enumerated. These include general obligation of compliance of the listed\nentity, appointment of a common compliance officer, filings on an electronic platform and mandatory\nregistration on SCORES.\n\nc. Specific Obligations: Obligations which are applicable to specific types of securities have been\nincorporated under separate chapters.\n\nd. Obligations of Stock Exchanges and Actions in Case of Default: Stock exchanges have been\ngiven the responsibility of monitoring compliance or the adequacy/accuracy of compliance with the\nprovisions of the Listing Regulations and to take action for non-compliance.\n\ne. Ease of Reference: Related provisions have been aligned and provided in one place for ease of\nreference. For example, all clauses dealing with disclosure of events or information which may be material\nor price sensitive which were spread across the listing agreement have been provided as a schedule to the\nListing Regulations. All disclosures to be made on the website of the listed entity have been enumerated\nin a single place for ease of reference and all requirements pertaining to disclosures in the annual report\nhave been combined.\n\nf. Streamlining and Segregation of Initial Issuance/Listing Obligations: In order to ensure\nthat there is no overlapping or confusion on the applicability of the Listing Regulations, pre-listing\nrequirements have been incorporated in respective regulations-ICDR Regulations, ILDS Regulations,\netc. These provisions pertain to allotment of securities, refund and payment of interest, a 1 per cent\nsecurity deposit (in case of public issuance), etc. Post-listing requirements have been incorporated in the\nListing Regulations.\n\ng- Alignment with the Provisions of the Companies Act, 2013: Wherever necessary, the provisions\nof the Listing Regulations have been aligned with those of the Companies Act, 2013.\n\nh. Listing Agreement: A shortened version of the listing agreement (about two pages) has been\nprescribed which is required to be signed by a company getting its securities listed on the stock exchanges.\nExisting listed entities are required to sign the new listing agreement within six months of the notification\nof the Listing Regulations.\n\nListing Compliance:\n\nSEBI envisaged and implemented four levels of monitoring for listed entities by way of regulations and\nguidelines. At the first level, company secretaries and the respective boards of directors of the listed enti-\nties will monitor the compliance of various regulatory requirements. Compliance reports on corporate\ngovernance and the report of an independent company secretary on compliance related issues are now\nrequired to be placed before the boards of listed entities. The boards are required to review the compliance\nreports as well as corrective steps taken in case of any non-compliance.\n\nAt the second level, an independent practising company secretary will review compliance and will\ncertify the same as required under the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013. The certification in this\nregard is published in the annual report of the company which, inter-alia, includes the observations of the\npracticing company secretary. As mentioned earlier, SEBI has made it mandatory that such reports (along\nwith the corrective steps taken) should be placed before their boards.\n\nAt the third level, the stock exchanges will monitor compliance or regulatory requirements of listed\ncompanies. Based on their monitoring they may levy fines, penalties, freeze the promoters\u2019 holdings in the\ncompany or suspend trading in the securities of the company depending on the level of non-compliance.\nAt the fourth level, SEBI will have overall regulatory oversight on the compliance standards of the corpo-\nrate sector through various reports received from the stock exchanges.\n",

Stock exchanges have laid down trading rules and\nregulations for broker-members, set up market surveillance systems to curb excess volatility, created\ntrade/settlement guarantee fund to ensure timely settlements even if a member defaults to deliver secu-\nrities or pay cash, and set up a clearing corporation to guarantee financial settlement of all trades and\nthereby reduce credit risk in the settlement system. The Clearing Corporation matches the transactions,\nreconciles sales and purchases and daily settlements. It is also responsible for the risk management of its\nmembers and conducts inspection and surveillance. It also collects margins and capital from members\nand monitors their net worth requirement. Its major role is to ensure the fulfilment of every contract either\nby becoming a counter-party itself to every trade or by guaranteeing the performance of all trades. This\nrisk management system was absent in the pre-reforms period and the setting up of the system is one of\nthe landmark achievements of financial market reforms.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Trading Rules and Regulations\n\nStrict rules and regulations have been framed to prevent unfair trading practices and insider trading. The\ntrading rules relate to the margin system, intra-day trading limit and exposure limit. Brokers are levied\nvarious types of margins such as daily margins, mark-to-market margins, ad hoc margins and volatility\nmargins to check price volatility.\n\nStock exchanges impose different types of margins on brokers for individual stocks, depending\non the exposures taken by these brokers in these stocks, both on a proprietary basis and on behalf of\nclients, vis-d-vis the overall market exposure in the scrips. Several of these margins are paid upfront\nby brokers.\n\nThese margins are collected to prevent operators from taking market positions in excess of their buy-\ning capacities and are used to settle dues to the exchange/clearing corporation/traders in the event of any\nfund shortage faced by the broker. The margins vary from operator to operator depending on the size of\nthe positions taken in the market. There is a real-time monitoring of the intra-day trading limits and gross\nexposure limits by the stock exchanges. There is an automatic deactivation of trading terminals in case of\nbreach of exposure limits. The collection of margins from institutional clients is on T +1 basis.\n\nAs a large section of the market makes margin payments by routing trades through brokers who pay\nlower margins, the SEBI stipulated that the stock brokers/sub-brokers of one exchange cannot deal with\nthe brokers/sub-brokers of the same exchange either for proprietary trading or for trading on behalf of\nthe clients without prior permission. It has also stipulated that a stock broker/sub-broker of an exchange\ncan deal with only one broker/sub-broker of another exchange for proprietary trading offer, intimating the\nnames of such stock broker/sub-broker to his parent stock exchange.\n\nIf the markets become volatile, the exchanges impose different types of margins such as value-at-risk\n(VaR) to minimize the risk of default by either counter-party. The system of collecting margins is devised\nin such a manner that higher exposures attract higher margins. Besides the normal margin, scrips with\nunusually high trading volumes attract special margins or a special ad hoc margin to keep defaults at bay.\n\nThe SEBI has shifted the margining system from net basis to gross basis (sale and purchase) with\neffect from September 3, 2001, and introduced a 99 per cent VaR-based margin for all scrips in the com-\npulsory rolling system with effect from July 2, 2001. VaR measures the worst-expected potential loss from\nan unlikely adverse event in a normal, everyday market environment. Prior to VaR, trade positions were\nreported at book value only and no considerations were made for market changes. This margin is kept in a\nmanner that covers price movements for more than 99 per cent of the time. Usually, three sigma (standard\ndeviation) is used for the measurement.\n\nThe intra-day trading limits, that is, limit to volume is specified and no broker's trading volume can\nexceed this limit. If a broker wishes to exceed the limit he has to deposit the additional capital with the\nexchange. The upper limit for the gross exposure of a broker is fixed at 20 times his capital to ensure\nmarket safety. Besides these, there are capital adequacy norms for members, indemnity insurance and\nonline-position monitoring by exchanges.\n\nTo ensure fair trading practices, the SEBI has formulated Insider Trading Regulations prohibiting\ninsider trading by making it a criminal offence. To enhance transparency of the takeover process and to\nprotect the interests of the minority shareholders, there are now separate regulations relating to acquisi-\ntions and takeovers.\n\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Circuit Breakers\n\nTo contain the excessive volatility in prices, the SEBI introduced, in 1995, scripwise daily circuit breakers/\nprice bands. The circuit breakers bring about a halt/suspension in trading, automatically for a specified\nperiod, if the market prices vary unusually on either side, that is, move out of a pre-specified band. Circuit\nbreakers do not halt trading but no order is permitted if it falls out of the specified price range.\n\nCircuit breakers allow participants to gather new information and assess the situation. This helps in\ncontrolling the panic. It helps exchange-clearing houses to monitor their members. However, the intro-\nduction of circuit breakers precipitates matters during volatile moves and leads to chaos as participants\nrush to execute their orders before an anticipated trading halt.\n\nIn the United States, the system of circuit breakers was introduced in 1987 to halt a sharp fall in share\nprices. In India, circuit breakers are used to halt both sharply rising as well as declining prices. Price bands,\nwhich were originally fixed at 8 per cent, were relaxed in case of 100 scrips in January 2000, when a further\nvariation of 4 per cent in the scrip beyond 8 per cent was allowed after a cooling-off period of 30 minutes.\nIn June 2000, the price band was relaxed by 8 per cent from 4 per cent in case of scrips under rolling settle\nment. These price bands were removed for all stocks in the rolling mode from July 2, 2001, and for the entire\n\nmarket from January 2, 2002. An index-based, market-wide circuit-breaker system at three stages of the index\nmovement, either way at 10 per cent, 15 per cent and 20 per cent is now applied. To enhance safety, individual\nscripwise price bands of 20 per cent either way have been prescribed for all securities except those available\nfor trading in the derivatives segment, and new listings.\n\nFor the first time since their introduction in July 2001, the Sensex and Nifty attracted the index-wide\ncircuit filters and trading on BSE and NSE was halted two times (for a total of 3 hours) on May 17, 2004.\nMonday, May 17, witnessed the biggest intra-day fall (842.37 points or 17.59 per cent) and the second-\nbiggest, single-day fall (564.71 points or 11.14 per cent) of the Sensex. The market reacted adversely to\nthe statements of some leaders of the new Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government\nregarding policy matters including disinvestment in the PSUs, liberalization of foreign-direct investment\n(FDI) norms and the sale of non-performing assets by banks and financial institutions. On November\n26, 2008, markets hit lower circuits on the news of global financial crisis. For the first time on Monday,\nMay 18, 2009, markets hit two upper circuits (first circuit at over 10 per cent and the next at 20 per cent)\nwhen a clear mandate for the Congress-led UPA was announced. May 18, 2009 was the reverse of May\n17, 2004. Trading was halted within seconds of opening of the markets when the 30-share Sensex surged\n14.70 per cent or 1,789.88 points to 13,963.30 and the 50-unit S&P CNX Nifty gained 531.65 points or\n14.48 per cent to 4203.30.\n\nBox 8.2 Index-wide Circuit Breakers\n\nThe BSE and the NSE implement the index-based market-wide circuit breaker system on a daily basis based on the previous day's closing\nlevel of the index. The market-wide circuit breakers would be triggered by movement of either the Sensex or the NSE S&P CNX Nifty which-\never is breached earlier.\n\nIncase of a 10 per cent movement of either of these indices, there would bea one-hour market halt if the movement takes place before\n1 p.m. In case, the movement takes place at or after 1 p.m. but before 2:30 p.m., there will be a trading halt for one-half hour. In\ncase the movement takes place at or after 2.30 p.m., there will be no trading halt at the 10 per cent level and the market will continue\ntrading.\n\nIn case of a 15 per cent movement of either index, there will be a two-hour market halt if the movement takes place before\n1 p.m, Ifthe 15 per cent trigger is reached on or after 1 p.m. but before 2 p.m., there will be a one-hour halt. If the 15 per cent trigger\nis reached on or after 2 p.m. the trading will halt for the remainder of the day.\n\nIn case of a 20 per cent movement of the index, the trading will be halted for the remainder of the day.\n\nAs an additional measure of safety, individual scrip-wise price bands have been fixed by as\n\ni. In addition to the market wide index based circuit filters, there are individual scrip wise price bands of 20% either way, for all scrips\nin the compulsory rolling settlement except for the scrips on which derivatives products are available or scrips included in indices on\nwhich derivative products are available.\n\nii. Appropriate individual scrip wise price bands upto 20% shall be applicable on those scrips on which no derivatives products are avail-\nable but which are part of index derivatives.\n\nDaily price bands of 2 per cent (either way) on a set of specified securities\n\nDaily price bands of 5 per cent (either way) on a set of specified securities\n\nDaily price banks of 10 per cent (either way) on specified securities\n\nPrice bands of 20 per cent (either way) on all remaining securities (including debentures, warrants, preference shares etc. which are\ntraded on CM segment of NSE),\n\nNo price bands are applicable on: scrips on which derivative products are available or scrips included in indices on which derivatives\nproducts are available.\n\nTo further strengthen the mechanism of index based market-wide circuit breaker as under:\n\n(a) NSE and BSE shall compute their market-wide index (NIFTY and SENSEX respectively) after every trade in the index constituent\n\nstocks and shall check for breach of market-wide circuit breaker limits after every such computation of the market-wide index.\n\n(b) Inthe event of breach of market-wide circuit breaker limit, stock exchange shall stop matching of orders in order to bring about a\n\ntrading halt. All unmatched orders present in the system shall thereupon be purged by the stock exchange.\n\n(c) BSE and NSE shall implement suitable mechanism to ensure that all messages related to market-wide index circuit breakers are\ngiven higher priority over other messages. Further, the systems (including the network) for computation of market-wide index,\nchecking for breach of circuit breaker limits and initiating message to stop matching of executable order and acceptance of fresh\norders, shall not be used for any other purposes.\n\nBSE and NSE shall include in the scope of their annual system audit a review of its index based market-wide circuit breaker mecha-\nnism with the view to identify improvements.\n\n(d\n\nSource: SEBI, Master Circular 2016.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "TRADING ARRANGEMENTS\n\nThe open outcry system, prevalent a few years ago on regional stock exchanges, has been replaced by\nan online, screen-based electronic trading system. The NSE and the OTCEI had adopted screen-based\ntrading right from inception. With almost all the exchanges going electronic, trading has shifted from the\nfloor to the brokers\u2019 office where trades are executed through a computer terminal. All stock exchanges\ntogether have 8,000 terminals spread across the country. In a screen-based trading system, a member\ncan feed into the computer the number of securities and the prices at which he would like to transact\nand the transaction is executed as soon as it finds a matching order from a counter party. The electronic\ntrading system is superior to the open outcry system of the past. It ensures transparency, as it enables\nparticipants to see the full market during real time. It increases information efficiency by allowing a\nfaster incorporation of price-sensitive information into prevailing prices and thereby helps in an efficient\nprice discovery. This also results in the operational efficiency as there is a reduction in time, cost, risk\nof error, and fraud and elimination of a chain of brokers and jobbers, which result in low transaction\ncosts. This system has enabled a large number of participants, in every part of the country, to trade in\nfull anonymity with one another simultaneously, thereby improving the depth and liquidity of the market.\nThis has led to the integration of different trading centres spread all over the country into a single trading\nplatform.\n\nThe SEBI has permitted the setting up of trading terminals abroad as well as Internet trading. Now,\ninvestors in any part of the world can route the order through the Internet for trading in Indian scrips.\nInternet trading is more cost effective than using trading terminals.\n\nThere are two types of trading systems\u2014order-driven trading system and quote-driven trading system.\nIn the order-driven system, orders from all over the country are entered into an electronic system and\nmatched directly and continuously without the involvement of a jobber or a market maker. In the quote-\ndriven system, there are market makers who continuously offer two-way quotes\u2014buy-and-sell quotes\u2014\nand are willing to buy and sell any quantity. The BSE provides both these systems while the NSE provides\nonly the order-driven system.\n\nThere are two types of orders: limit orders and market orders. Limit orders are those trades which will be\nonly executed at the price specified by the investor. Usually, retail investors and fund houses place limit orders.\nMarket orders are those trades which are executed at the latest quoted bid or offer price on the trading screen.\n\nThere are certain orders (buy or sell) which already exist in the trade book at the time of trade match-\ning which are known as passive orders. While active orders are incoming orders that are matched against\nthe passive orders, stock exchanges charge different transaction fees for both passive and active orders.\n\nSteps Involved in Online Trading\n\n1. An investor/trader needs to sign the \u2018member-client agreement\u2019 if dealing directly with a bro-\nker or a \u2018broker-sub-broker-client tripartite agreement\u2019 if dealing with a sub-broker in order\nto execute trades on his behalf from time to time. An investor/trader has also to furnish details\nsuch as permanent account number (PAN), which has been made mandatory for all the inves-\ntors participating in the securities market;,his name, date of birth, photograph, address, edu-\ncational qualifications, occupation, residential status (Resident Indian/NRI/others); bank and\ndepository account details; and if registered with any other broker, then the name of that broker\nand the concerned stock exchange and the Client Code Number in the client registration form.\nAll brokers have been mandated to use the unique client code that is linked to the PAN details\nof the respective client, which will act as an exclusive identification for the client. The broker\n\n\u2018opens a trading account in the name of the investor for maintenance of transactions executed,\nwhile buying and selling the securities.\n\n2. An investor has to open a Beneficial Owner Account (BO Account)/Demat Account with a depos-\nitory participant in his name for the purpose of holding and transferring securities. He also has\nto open a bank account which is used for debiting or crediting money for trading in the securities\nmarket.\n\n3. Investor/trader who wants to trade places order with a broker to buy/sell the required quantity of\n\nspecified securities.\n\nThe order is matched at the best price based on the price-time priority.\n\n. The order which is executed electronically is communicated to the broker's terminal.\n\nThe broker issues the trade confirmation slip to the investor/trader.\n\nThe broker issues contract note to the investor/trader within 24 hours of trade execution. A contract\n\nnote is a confirmation of trades done on a particular day on behalf of the client by the broker. It imposes\n\na legally enforceable relationship between the client and the broker with respect to purchase/sale and\n\nsettlement of trades. It also helps to settle disputes/claims between the investor and the broker.\n\nThe stock exchanges assign a Unique Order Code Number to each transaction, and once the order\nis executed, this order code number is printed on the contract note. The time when the investor/trader\nhas placed the order and the time of execution of the order have to be mentioned in the contract note.\n\n8. The payment for the shares purchased or delivery of shares in case of sale of shares is required to\nbe done prior to the pay-in date for the relevant settlement.\n\n9. Pay-in of funds and securities take place before T+2 day as the settlement cycle is on T+2\nrolling-settlement basis, w.e.f. April 1, 2003. Pay-in day is the day when the broker shall make\npayment or delivery of securities to the exchange.\n\n10. Pay-out of funds and securities take place on T+2 day. Pay-out day is the day when the exchange\nmakes payment or delivery of securities to the broker. The broker makes payment to the investor/\ntrader within 24 hours of the payout.\n\n11. The investor/trader can get direct delivery of shares in his beneficial owner account. To avail\nthis facility, he has to give details of his beneficial owner account and the DP-ID of his Deposi-\ntory Participant (DP) to his broker along with the standing instructions for \u2018Delivery-In\u2019 to his\nDP for accepting shares in his beneficial owner account. After the receipt of these instructions,\nthe clearing corporation/clearing house sends pay-out instructions to the depositories and the\ninvestor/trader receives pay-out of securities directly into his beneficial owner account.\n\n12. Incase of short or bad (non) delivery of funds/securities, an auction of securities on the pay-in day\nis held to settle the delivery. The Exchange purchases the required quantity in the Auction Market\nand delivers them to the buying trading member. The shortages are met through auction process\nand the difference in price indicated in the contrac t note and the price received through auction\nis paid by the member in the Exchange, which is then liable to be recovered from the client. Auc-\ntion ensures that the buying trading member receives the securities. The Exchange purchases the\nrequisite quantity in auction market and gives them to the buying trading member. Auction price\napplicable is previous day\u2019s close price.\n\nIDS\n\nIn case the shares could not be bought in the auction, the transaction is closed out as per SEBI guide-\nlines. The guidelines stipulate that the close-out price will be the highest price recorded in that scrip on\nthe exchange in the settlement in which the concerned contract was entered into and up to the date of auc-\ntion/close out or 20 per cent above the official closing price on the exchange on the day on which auction\noffers are called for (and in the event of there being no such closing price on that day, then the previous\nday\u2019s closing price), whichever is higher.\n",

The benefits of DMA are:\n\n1. It prevents the practice of front-running by brokers who are trading ahead of the client based on\nthe knowledge of the client order. Brokers profit from the price changes which take place when\nlarge institutional orders are placed. With DMA, the secrecy of the orders can be maintained as\nthe orders are routed directly through the computer system.\n\n2. It enables a faster execution of orders with a minimal risk of errors from the manual order entry.\n\n3. It reduces malpractices and price manipulation, enhances transparency and increases liquidity as\nthe orders are visible to the entire market rather than to a particular person/group.\n\n4. It results in lower impact costs for large orders. Moreover, institutional client can break large\norders into smaller ones, thereby reducing the bid-ask spread. In addition, it results in saving, in\nthe form of low brokerage charges.\n\n5. Itenables algorithmic trading wherein the traders instal computers running complex mathemati-\ncal algorithms and place buy-and-sell orders automatically in the trading system through DMA.\nAlgorithmic trading or program trading is a software program built on certain mathematical mod-\nels, which enables traders to detect an arbitrage opportunity between the cash and the futures\nmarket and place orders on exchanges in real time. It enhances efficiency in trading, reduces\ntransaction costs and prevents information leakage. Foreign broking firms such as Merrill Lynch,\nGoldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Citigroup and Credit Suisse offer these trading services.\n\nAlgorithmic trading is popular in developed countries but it has not taken off in a big way in India\nbecause of lack of liquidity beyond the top 15-20 actively traded scrips and both the exchanges\u2019 systems\nnot being equipped to handle very heavy orders of trades, when the market is unusually active.\n",

Later on, securities\nwere traded and settled under a uniform weekly-settlement cycle. In a trading cycle, trades accumulated till\nthe end of a specified period and the positions were settled in the form of payment of cash and delivery of\nsecurities. The carry-forward system prevailed for a long period at stock exchanges, as it increased the vol-\nume of trading and thereby added to the liquidity of the system. However, it also increased the speculation\nwhich, in turn, increased the volatility in prices and defaults by brokers, thereby impeding the price-discov-\nery process. Hence, an alternative system called \u2018rolling settlement\u2019 was introduced in a phased manner.\n\nUnder the T +5 basis rolling-settlement system, the trading cycle comprises 1 day and transactions in\nthese securities are settled 5 days after the trade date. The rolling settlement on a T+5 basis was intro-\nduced in 10 scrips in January 2000, extended to another 153 scrips in May 2000 and then to 414 securi-\nties in July 2001; and thereafter, all scrips were covered under this system. From April 2002, the rolling\nsettlement was on a T+3 basis but since April 2003 it is on a T+2 basis (transactions in securities are\nsettled 2 days after the trade date).

Through this means of trading, investors can buy\nand sell shares online through the Internet.\n\nTo start Internet trading, an investor has to register himself with a broker offering online services.\nHe has to open a bank account as well as a demat account with the broker. The broker is responsible\nfor the risk management of his clients, The orders get logged directly on the trading platforms within\nthe assigned limits designated by the broker to the clients. Even if the client order exceeds the assigned\n\nlimits, the order gets re-routed to the broker's server for authorization or rejection. The broker can\nchange the parameters on-line. His software allows real time market information display, client infor-\nmation display, bank account management, and a transaction history display.\n\nIn April 2000, the market was bullish and a large number of players ventured into online (Internet)\ntrading. As many as 79 members took permission for Internet trading. However, after the Ketan Parekh\nscam, barely 10 members remained online. The market is dominated by /CICI Direct.com with a market\nshare of about 50 per cent and Jndia Bulls.com with a market share of 26 per cent.\n\nICICI has emerged as a market leader because it can provide strong connectivity between the trading\naccount, demat account, and bank accounts. Moreover, ICICI\u2019s huge off-line presence in various financial\nservices segments and penetration aids in drawing as well as servicing customers. ICICI Direct leads the\npack with 1,70,000 trading customers. It executes an average of 1,600 trades a day; this puts it in the same\nleague as the tenth largest online brokerage in the US. Sharekhan.com and 5 paise.com have faded away\nwhile Kotak Street.com and HDFC Securities are hanging on.\n\nAround 44 lakh investors had registered to trade online as on March 31, 2008. There has been a sharp\nincrease in volumes after the rolling settlement was introduced. The online trading volumes rose from\n27,288 crore in 2000-01 on the National Stock Exchange to %6,68,399 crore in 2007-08. Around 11.68\nper cent of the total trading volume was routed and executed through internet during 2007-08.\n\nOnline trading has driven down the transaction costs substantially and increased the liq.\navailable to an investor to enter or exit from the stock at his own wish. The Internet has provided a wide\nrange of information to the investor which has enabled him to take calculated risks.\n\nThe US has the largest number of cyber investors\u2014approximately 15 million. Online trading has\ngrown tremendously in the US where roughly 40 per cent of retail stock brokerage business is conducted\nthrough the Internet.

Online trading represents about 18 per cent of the\ntotal traded volumes on the NSE and the BSE.\n\nThe stumbling blocks for such low online trading volumes are as follows:\n\nErratic bandwidth and erratic net connectivity coupled with low personal computer (PC) penetration.\nLow security and inadequate cyber laws.\n\nLack of automation in the banking sector especially among public sector banks. Not many banks\noffer online transaction of money.\n\nIncremental and ongoing investment in technology and brand building are required. This is owing to\nlack of funding for Internet-based business.\n\nStipulation from the SEBI\u2014Know Your Customer (KYC)\u2014which requires that companies actually\nmeet their customers before allowing them to trade on their site. This requires a large off-line struc-\n\nA big time lag of S\u201410 minutes between the placing of an order and its execution. The high volatility\nprevailing in the market leads to fluctuations in prices.\n\nHigh cost of transactions as online brokers charge brokerage as steep as 0.20-0.25 per cent for non-\ndelivery based transaction and between 0.50-0.75 per cent for delivery based transaction.\n\nAbsence of streaming data on the investor\u2019s computer. The broker gets streaming data on his com-\nputer while the client does not. Clients get a browser-based web application which works on a\nrequest reply model, most suited for document presentation,\n\nAn online investor pays more margin for trading than the off-line investor and his funds are also tied\nup for more trading days.\n\nBox 8.3 To Trade Online Using e-broking Facility\n\nRegister yourself with the online trading portals listed on the site.\n\nYou must be a registered iconnect user.\n\nOn placing an order for buy/sell of securities through the listed, online trading portal, click on \u2018Pay Through\u2019\u2014Bank listed on the\nonline portal which will direct you to a login screen of your account.\n\nOnce the details of your Login ID and password are entered, you are required to verify the transaction details and confi rm the\ntransaction by entering your transaction ID and password.

The stock market index is a barometer of market behaviour.\nIt reflects market direction and indicates day-to-day fluctuations in stock prices. The market index reflects\nexpectations about the behaviour of the economy as a whole. It is a precursor of economic cycles. The function\nofa stock index is to provide investors with information regarding the average share price in the market. A well-\nconstructed index captures the overall behaviour of the market and represents the return obtained by a typical\nportfolio investing in the market. An ideal index must represent changes in the prices of scrips and reflect\nprice movements of typical shares for better market representation. Stock index is a barometer of a nation\u2019s\neconomic health as market prices reflect expectations about the economy's performance. Stock markets tend to\nbe buoyant when the economy is expected to do well. The bell wether Sensex, if it touches the psychologically\ngolden 35,000 mark, indicates that the country\u2019s fnancial and economic growth is surging ahead.\n\nStock indices are termed as leading economic indicators as they indicate what is going to happen in the econ-\nomy in the future. The returns generated in the stock market are based on future expectations. The future streams\nof expected returns from the companies are discounted to arrive at their present value known as market price.\n\nA good market index incorporates a set of scrips which have high market capitalization and high\nliquidity. Market capitalization is the sum of the market value of all the stocks included in the index. The\nmarket value is derived by multiplying the price of the share by the number of equity shares out-standing.\nLiquidity is reflected in the ability to buy or sell a scrip at a price close to the current market price. In other\nwords, the bid-ask spread is minimum.\n\nThe index on a day is calculated as the percentage of the aggregate market value of the set of scrips incorpo-\nrated in the index on that day to the average market value of the same scrips during the base period. For example,\nthe BSE Sensex is a weighted average of prices of 30 select stocks and S&P CNX Nifty of 50 select stocks.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Methodologies for Calculating the Index\nMarket Capitalization Weighted\n\n1. Full market capitalization method: In this method, the number of shares outstanding multi-\nplied by the market price of a company\u2019s share determines the scrip\u2019s weightage in the index. The\nshares with the highest market capitalization would have a higher weightage and would be most\ninfluential in this type of index. Examples: S&P 500 Index in USA and S&P CNX Nifty in India.\n\n2. Free-float market capitalization method: Free-float is the percentage of shares that are freely\navailable for purchase in the markets. It excludes strategic investments in a company such as\nthe stake held by government, controlling shareholders and their families, the company\u2019s man-\nagement, restricted shares due to IPO regulations, and shares locked under the employee stock\nownership plan. In this methodology, the weight of a scrip is based on the free-float market cap-\nitalization. Free-float market capitalization reflects the investible market capitalization which\nmay be much less than the total. Closely held companies would have a much lower weightage\nand companies with high free-float, i.e., higher investible shares, would be rewarded. Compa-\nnies which provide high shareholder value but have less free-float would be marginalized.\n\nFree-float market capitalization method is superior to full market capitalization method in\nseveral ways.\n\nFree-float is rational in the sense that it factors in the constituent shares to the extent they are\navailable for trading in the market. For instance, ONGC has a free-float of less than 15 per cent\nand hence it has a weight of under 5 per cent in the free-float weighted sensex.\n\nThe free-float methodology helps in designing a broad-base index wherein the concentration of\ntop few companies and their influence on index movement is reduced. It avoids the undue inf\nuence of closely held large capitalization stocks on the index movement and prices.\n\nAn index-based on free-float methodology, is useful to active fund managers as it enables them.\nto benchmark their fund returns vis-a-vis an investible index.\n\nIt avoids multiple counting of company shares through cross holding.\n\nPassive investing (index investing) in the developed market is around 10 per cent. The free-float index\nhelps fund managers in better tracking and replication as the weight of scrips in the index is based on their\nfloat available in the market, which helps them in investing in those scrips. The free-float methodology\nhas become popular the world over. Since June 2001, the entire range of FTSE (Financial Time Stock\nExchange) indices are fully free-float adjusted. S&P\u2019s indices around the world are free-float. All Dow\nJones indices except Dow Jones Industrial Average are free-float adjusted.\n\nThe BSE has taken a lead on free-floating the indices. It made a beginning by launching on July 11,\n2001, the country\u2019s first free-float index, \u2018BSE-TECK Index,\u2019 an index for technology, entertainment,\ncommunication, and other knowledge-based sectors. The BSE has introduced this methodology in the\ncase of the BSE sensex since September 1, 2003. Now the BSE sensex is a free-float sensex.\n\nFree-float Factors The BSE has adopted the international practice of assigning a free-float factor to\ncach company. Free-float factors are assigned according to a banding structure consisting of ten bands\ninto which each company falls, based on its percentage of shares in free-float. The banding structure\nmeans that the actual free-float of a company is not taken as it is but rounded off to the higher multiple\nof 5 or 10 depending upon the banding structure adopted. The exact free-float of a company is rounded-\noff to the higher multiple of 10. For example, if the free-float factor of a company is, say, 16 per cent,\na free-float factor of 0.2, i.e., 20 per cent is applied. If the free-float factor changes, adjustment to the\nindex is made only if the new free-float crosses either the lower band or the higher band by 2 percentage\npoints. The free-float factor is then multiplied with the full market capitalization of the company to\narrive at the free-float capitalization. Based on the percentage of a company\u2019s free-float capitalization\nto the total free-float capitalization of the sensex, weights are assigned to each company.\n\nIn order to reduce the frequency of index adjustments arising out of a change in free-float of a com-\npany, the BSE refined the banding structure and increased the number of bands from 10 to 20. In the\n20 band system, a company having a free-float of 60.1 per cent would be assigned a free-float factor of\n0.65 and another company having a free-float of 67 per cent would be assigned a free-float factor of 0.7.\nA Free-float factor of say 0.55 means that only 55 per cent of the market capitalization of the company\nwill be considered for index calculation.\n\n3. Modified capitalization weighted: This method secks to limit the influence of the largest\nstocks in the index which otherwise would dominate the entire index. This method sets a limit\non the percentage weight of the largest stock or a group of stocks. The NASDAQ-100 Index is\ncalculated by using this method.\n\nPrice Weighted Index _ In this method, the price of each stock in the index is summed up which is then\nequated to an index starting value. An arbitrary date is set as the base and the Laspeyre\u2019s Price Index\nwhich measures price changes against a fixed base period quantity weight is used. In case of a stock-split,\nthe market price of the stock falls and this results in less weightage in the index. The Dow Jones Industrial\nAverage and Nikkic 225 are price-weighted indices.\n\nEqual Weighting In this method, each stock's percentage weight in the index is equal and hence, all\nstocks have an equal influence on the index movement. The value line index at Kansas City Board of\nTrade (KCBT) is an equal weighted index.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Major Indices in India\n\nThere are two major indices in India: BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty. The BSE Sensitive Index of equity\nshare prices was launched in 1986. It comprises 30 shares and its base year is 1978-79. The major\ncriterion for selection of a scrip in the Sensex is large market capitalization. Besides this criterion,\nother criteria like listed history, track record, industry/sector representation, number of trades, average\nvalue of shares traded per day as a percentage of total number of outstanding shares, are considered for\ninclusion in the Sensex. The scrip selection is also based on a balanced representation of the industry,\nleadership position in the industry, continuous dividend-paying record, and track record of promoters.\ng in 1986, it was revised for the first time on the 50th Independence Day, August 15,\n1997, by replacing 15 scrips. During this revamp, the scrips of banks and financial institutions with a\nweightage of 14.6 per cent were included on the index for the first time. It was revised again in October\n1998 to replace some old economy stocks such as Arvind Mills, Great Eastern Shipping, Steel Author-\nity of India, and IPCL with some new economy stocks such as Infosys, NIIT, Castrol, and Novatris.\nThe sensex was revamped again on March 11, 2000, which came into effect on April 10. Certain scrips,\nsuch as Indian Hotels, IDBI, Tata Chemicals, and Tata Power were replaced by Satyam Computers, Zee\n\n\nTelefilms, Dr Reddy's Laboratories, and Reliance Petroleum. The new economy stocks had a 50 per\ncent weightage in the index. Today, only eight of the original club of 30 remain, the others have been\nsupplanted by companies whose scrips are far more indicative of the happenings in the market.\n\nThe TCS has the highest weightage of 9.94 per cent in index market capitalization, followed by Reli-\nance Industries with 8.15 per cent, and HDFC Bank with 7.92 per cent. The BSE Sensex represents 44 per\ncent of the BSE market capitalization and 14 most-important listed and traded sectors. The BSE Sensex\nscrips, on average, account for 52 per cent of the trading volumes on a daily basis and 35 per cent of total\ntrades executed on the exchange.\n\nAnother index which has become very popular in a short span of time is the S&P CNX NIFTY.\nThe NSE began equity trading in November 1994, and its volumes surpassed that of the BSE in a\nvery short span of time. The NSE and CRISIL undertook a joint venture, wherein they jointly pro-\nmoted India Index Services and Products, a specialized organization to provide stock index services.\nThis organization developed scientifically devised indices of stock prices in the NSE in technical\npartnership with Standard and Poor (S&P). The NSE introduced this index to reflect the market\nmovements more accurately, provide fund managers with a benchmark for measuring portfolio per-\nformance and develop a reference rate for introducing index-based derivative products. The S&P\nCNX Nifty launched on July 8, 1996, comprises 50 scrips which are selected on the basis of low\nimpact cost, high liquidity and market capitalization. The impact cost is the percentage marking\nfrom the (bid +ask)/2 suffered in executing a transaction. The \u2018Bid\u2019 is the buyer\u2019s price\u2014the price at\nwhich there is a ready buyer for the stock which he intends to sell. The \u2018Ask\u2019 (or offer) is the price\nat which there is a seller ready to sell his stock and this is the price the buyer needs to know when\nhe is buying a stock.\n\nLower the impact cost, higher the liquidity of a stock and vice versa. Suppose a scrip trades at a bid\nprice of 99 and an asking price of 2101, the ideal price is 2100. If a buy order for 1,000 shares goes\nthrough at 7102, then the market impact cost is 2 per cent. Ifa buy order for 2,000 shares goes through at\n2104, then the market impact cost at 2,000 shares is 4 per cent. For a stock to be included in the S&P CNX\nNifty, it must trade in the total portfolio of 22 crores at an impact cost of less than 1.5 per cent on 85 per\ncent of the trading days. Nifty represents about 44 per cent of the total market capitalization on the NSE.\nThe S&P CNX Nifty is a widely used indicator. Index funds and index futures and options, launched at\nthe NSE, are based on the S&P CNX Nifty.\n\nBoth BSE as well as the NSE use the weighted average method of averaging whereby each stock\nis given a weight in proportion to its market capitalization. Suppose an index contains two stocks, A\nand B. If A has a market capitalization of %3,000 crores and B has a market capitalization of %1,000\ncrores, then a 75 per cent weightage is attached to the movements in A and a 25 per cent weightage to\nthe movements in B.\n\nBesides these two indices, the other popular indices are the Economic Times Ordinary Share Price\nIndex, Financial Express Ordinary Price Index and the RBI Index of Security Prices. These indices com-\nprise 72, 100, and 338 scrips, respectively. The major regional stock exchanges such as Kolkata, Chennai,\nDelhi and Ahmedabad have their own indices. The other major indices are the OTCEI index, the CMIE\n(Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy) index, the CRISIL CNX indices (mid-cap 200, PSE index, IT\nindex and MNC index) and the Business Line (all India) Index.\n\n",

                        "extracted-text": "STOCK EXCHANGES\nThe Bombay Stock Exchange\n\nTrading in securities has been in vogue in India for a little over 200 years. Trading in securities dates\nback to 1793, most of them being transactions in loan securities of the East India Company. Ram-\npant speculation was a common feature even during those times. The broking community prospered\nas there was a rise in prices which led to a share mania during 1861-65. This bubble burst in 1865\nwhen the American Civil War ended. The brokers realized that investor confidence in the securities\nmarket could be sustained only by organizing themselves into a regulated body with defined rules\nand regulations. This realization resulted in formation of \u2018The Native Share and Stock Brokers\u2019\nAssociation,\u2019 which later came to be known as the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). In 1875, these\nbrokers assembled at a place now called Dalal Street. The BSE was set up as a voluntary, non-profit-\nmaking association of broker members. It emerged as a premier stock exchange after the 1960s. The\nincreased pace of industrialization caused by the two world wars, protection to the domestic industry\nand the government's fiscal policies aided the growth of new issues, which, in turn, helped the BSE\n\nto prosper. The BSE dominated the Indian capital market by accounting for more than 60 per cent of\nthe all-India turnover.\n\nUntil 1992, the BSE operated like a closed club of select members. With the securities scam outburst\nin 1992 and the SEBI taking over the reins of the stock market, the BSE had to bring about changes in its\noperational policies. Until March 1995, the BSE had an open outcry system of trading. However, when\nfaced with a stiff competition from the NSE, the country\u2019s first modern, computerized and professionally\nmanaged stock exchange set up in 1994, the BSE had to change its system of trading and operations. On\nMarch 14, 1995, the BSE turned to electronic trading whereby the brokers trade using computers. This\nsystem is known as the BSE On-line Trading System (BOLT). Screen-based trading was initially confined\nto 818 major scrips. Trading in all the 5,000 scrips of the BSE was transferred to BOLT on July 3, 1995.\nThe introduction of BOLT helped in improving trading volumes, significantly reducing the spread between\nbuy-and-sell orders, better trading in odd-lot shares, fixed-income instruments and dealings in the renuncia-\ntion of rights shares.\n\nIn 1995, BOLT was limited to Mumbai, whereas the NSE was operating at the national level. As a\nresult, the BSE was losing countrywide business. The BSE, therefore, submitted a proposal for allowing\nthe installation of terminals connected to BOLT in centres outside Mumbai. After rejecting the proposal\nfour times, on October 29, 1996, the SEBI finally allowed the BSE to use its BOLT system nationwide.\n\nToday, BOLT is spread over 330 cities with 15,471 TWSs (trader work stations). Later, the BSE set up\na central depository system to dematerialize shares and promote demat trading.\n\nBSE Milestones\n\n1840-50 About half-a-dozen brokers converge under a banyan tree near what is now called\nHorniman Circle.\n\n1860-65 In the prevailing share mania, the number of brokers rises to about 250, but in the\naftermath of the price crash they are hard-pressed to find a place for their regular\nmeeting.\n\n1874 The broking community find a place in what is now called Dalal Street to conduct\n\ntheir dealings in securities without hindrance and an informal association of sorts\ncomes into being.\n\nJuly 9, 1875 The Native Share and Stock Broker Association with the aim of \u2018protecting the char-\nacter, status and interests of native share and stock brokers,\u2019 with 3,128 members\nwho pay an entrance fee of 1 rupee is set up. The genesis of the present-day BSE is\nclearly traceable to these humble beginnings. Premises are hired in 1874 so that the\nindignity of trading in public comes to an end.\n\n1895-1930 The exchange moves into what is now known as the Stock Exchange Old Building in\n1895.\n\nWith more members and more trading spaces, after repeated expansion in 1920,\n\n1928 and 1930, the BSE is vastly different from the one that existed in the last quar-\nter of the 19th century.\n\n1921 The establishment of a clearing house for settlement of transactions.\n\n1923 K. P. Shroff, later to be known as the doyen of the Indian stock market, assumes the\npost of honorary president of the BSE, a position he retained till 1966. Together with\nPhiroze Jeejeebhoy, who later succeeded him, Shroff steers the exchange through\nstormy times and plays a major role in raising the BSE's status.\n\n1957 The government accords a permanent recognition under the Securities Contracts\n(Regulation) Act.\n\n1973 The construction work for a new multi-storey office to house the BSE commences. It\nis named after its former president, Phiroze Jeejeebhoy.\n\n1986 On January 2, BSE launches the first stock index with 30 scrips and the base year of\n\n1978-79 with quotations from specified and non-specified group of companies listed\n\u2018on the five major bourses\u2014Bombay, Calcutta, Delhi, Anmedabad and Madras.\n\n1994 Serial bomb biasts in BSE, but it begins to operate as usual despite damages to the\npremises.\n1995 In March, BSE introduces the modified carry-forward system (the traditional badla\n\nhad been banned since March 1993). In July, all scrips are transferred to BOLT. Now,\nmore than 250 cities/towns are on BOLT trading.\n\n1997 Screen-based trading commences.\n1999 In March, Central Depository Services, promoted by the BSE, begins operations.\n2000 In June, the BSE becomes the first exchange in the country to introduce trading in\n\nderivatives in the form of index futures on the Bell Wether Sensex.\n\n2005\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n2012\n\n2013\nJuly 2015\n\nJuly 9, 2015\nJan, 2017\n\nFeb. 3, 2017\n\nLaunched enterprise market for SMEs\u2014INDOnext on January 7, 2005 to provide\n\u2018small and medium enterprises easy and an efficient access to capital markets.\nINDOnext is a joint initiative of the BSE with 18 regional stock exchanges.\nLaunch of Currency Derivatives, Interest Rate Futures and Mutual Fund Service\nSystem.\n\nFirst to introduce mobile-based trading, launch of Fastrade on web (FOW) exchange\nhosted platform, Launch of SIP and SLB, Commencement of S&P BSE Shariah\nIndex.\n\nLaunch of BSE Training Institute Ltd. with |GNOU-MBA program specializing in finan-\ncial market.\n\nLaunch of S&P BSE-GREENEX to promote investment in Green India, BSE-SME\nexchange Platform and trading in BRICSMART indices derivative.\n\nBSE enters into strategic partnership with S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\nBSE SME platform successfully completes listing of 100 SMEs under its SME\numbrella\n\nBSE celebrated its 140th Foundation Day\n\nHon'ble Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi inaugurated India International\nExchange (IFSC) Ltd, India\u2019s 1st international exchange\n\nBSE becomes India's 1st listed stock exchange.

Badla was a unique selling proposition of the BSE. Badla provided the facility for carrying\nforward the transaction from one settlement to another. In simple terms, it was the postponement of the\ndelivery of or payment for the purchase of securities from one settlement period to another. This facil-\nity of carry forward provided liquidity and breadth to the market. It was invented in the BSE and other\nexchanges copied the mechanism as it facilitated share financing, share lending, and carry forward\nsimultaneously. It was a stock lending facility (since shares were needed to postpone a sell position) as\nwell as a money market operation (since finance was needed to postpone a buy decision). By bringing\nin outside money to fund the carry forward of the long positions, badla acted as a bridge between the\nmoney market and the stock market. This system also helped in moderating extreme movement of stock\nprices, as it facilitated short selling in a rising market and long purchases in a declining market. It acted\nas a risk-hedging instrument wherein an investor could hedge against a likely fall or rise in prices by\nselling or buying in a carry forward market.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Badla Mechanism\n\nBadla was allowed in the specified group of shares of the BSE. This specified group was also known as\nthe forward group as one could buy or sell shares in it without physical delivery. The carry forward ses-\nsion (badla session) was held on every Saturday at the BSE.\n\nA contract for current settlement could be executed in any of the following three ways:\n\n* Delivery against a sale contract given and delivery against a purchase contract received, and pay-\nment received/made at the contract rate.\n\n+ Squaring off of transactions wherein a reverse transaction of either buying or selling of shares\nsquared up with the earlier outstanding position and the difference in prices settled.\n\n+ A contract in respect of which delivery was given or taken and which was not offset by an opposite\ntransaction during the settlement period, could be carried forward to the next settlement period at\nthe making up price, i.e., the closing quotation on the last trading day and the difference between\nthe contract rate and the making up price settled. This postponement of the delivery of or pay-\nment for the purchase of securities from one settlement period to another was referred to as carry\nforward.\n\nBadla involved four parties: the long buyer\u2014a buy position in a stock without the capacity to take\ndelivery of the same, the short seller\u2014a sell position without having the delivery in hand, the financier\nand the stock lender.\n\nIf the quantum of delivery sales exceeded the quantum of delivery purchases, financiers\nknown as vyaj badlawala came forward to assist in completing the deal, took delivery in the cur-\nrent settlement, made the delivery in the next settlement to the buyers and, by doing so, helped in\ncarrying forward the transaction. The difference between the current settlement rate and the sale\nrate for the next settlement which they received was the interest charges known as seedha badla\nand the transaction was known as vyaj or mandi badla. If the quantum of delivery purchases\nexceeded the quantum of delivery sales, share financiers known as teji badlawala would give\ndelivery in the current settlement to the buyers at the settlement rate and take the delivery back\nin the next settlement from the seller at lower sale rates. The difference between the two rates\nearned by them was known as \u2018backwardation\u2019 or ulta badla and the transaction was known as\nmal badla or teji badla.\n\nBadla charges were market-determined and varied from scrip to scrip and from settlement to\nsettlement. Badia rates ranged from 15 per cent to 36 per cent on a yearly basis. The SEBI banned\nbadla charges for carry forward sales (short position) if the net carry forward buy (long) positions\nexceeded short positions. If the market was overbought (net long), there would be more demand for\nfunds and the carry forward rates would be high; the reverse would be true when the market was\noversold (net short). An oversold market would result in high demand for securities and the stock\nlender would get returns.\n\nThese transactions were completely hedged and stock exchanges guaranteed settlements and con-\nducted auctions of shares in case of defaults. However, these guarantees were not available in unofficial or\nparallel bad/a markets which existed in Kolkata and Mumbai. Kolkata had a 90 per cent unofficial badla\nmarket and as a result, it had to undergo a payment crisis in 2001.\n\nBadla, or the carry forward facility, was quite popular, accounting for nearly 90 per cent of the trade\nat all stock exchanges.\n\nAdvantages\n\nThe badla system contributed to the increase in the volume of the trading activity at the BSE as\nit facilitated brokers to carry forward their positions and leverage. Moreover, as badla financiers\nwere earning higher returns through this mechanism, they were lending a larger amount of funds,\nleading to an increase in trading activity. Bad/a along with other factors such as increased network,\nboom periods, and increased participation by retail investors was instrumental in the increase of\nvolume of trading activity from %500 crore in 1991-92 to %9,000 crore in 2000. Badla was also a\nvehicle of speculation.\n\nThe 135-year-old badla system was banned in 1993 by the SEBI as it led to excessive speculation\nand increased market risk. It was also uncontrolled and unregulated which enhanced market risk and the\nprices of scrips could be manipulated under badla as brokers could easily corner liquid stocks. Moreo-\nver, brokers evaded margins and manipulated badla rates. Following the ban, however there was a steep\ndecline in the volumes in the specified group following the ban. Therefore, it was revived and resumed\nagain on the BSE in January 1996 on the recommendations of the G. S. Patel Committee. Later, in March\n1997, the SEBI constituted the J. R. Varma Committee to review the revised carry forward system. The\ncommittee recommended a modified carry forward system (MCFS) which was accepted by the SEBI.\n\nThe MCFS was replaced by another carry forward mechanism\u2014Borrowing and Lending of Securities\nScheme (BLESS)\u2014on January 27, 2001. This scheme was similar to Automatic Lending and Borrowing\nMechanism (ALBM) of the NSE. The difference between ALBM/BLESS and badla was that while under\nALBM/ BLESS one could withdraw the securities financed by paying a small margin of 15 per cent to 20\nper cent, under badla, securities were kept with the clearing house and could not be withdrawn. Due to\nthe facility of withdrawal of securities under BLESS/ALBM, a broker could create an exposure seven to\neight times the amount invested in these deferral products.\n\nIn March 2001, after the Ketan Parekh scam came to light and the payment crisis in the Kolkata Stock\nExchange, the SEBI completely banned bad/a and all deferral products\u2014ALBM and BLESS\u2014from\nJuly 2001. With this ban again, the volume of trading on BSE slumped from an average daily turnover\nof %5,220 crore in May 2001 to around %700 crore in July 2001\u2014a decline of more than 70 per cent in a\nperiod of two months. This old system has been replaced by a new system\u2014rolling settlement.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Listing Categories\nBefore badla was resumed in 1996, there were only two categories of securities listed on the BSE\u2014the\n\nspecified group of shares comprising the securities in which carry forward deals were allowed and the\ncash group shares in which no carry forward deals were permitted. Later, it was observed that the facility\n\nof carry forward was not being used in all the 94 scrips in the specified group. Hence, after badla was\nresumed, the size of the specified group was reduced to 32 scrips on April 3, 1996.\nThe BSE later decided to regroup the existing A and B group shares into three categories.\n\nAGroup This group consists of large turnover and high floating stock, with large market capitalization.\nIn other words, scrips included in this group are blue-chip companies. Carry-forward deals and weekly\nsettlement were allowed in this group. At present, there are 150 scrips in this group.\n\nB1 Group This group includes scrips of quality companies with an equity above 23 crores, with high\ngrowth potential and trading frequency. No carry-forward facility was allowed in this group.\n\nB2 Group This group of scrips were just like those of B1 but with a fortnightly settlement. However,\nin September 1996, the BSE introduced a weekly settlement for all scrips listed on the exchange, thus\ndoing away with the distinction between the B1 and B2 groups. This group consists of low trading volume\nscrips, with an equity below %3 crores, and surveillance measures initiated against most of them for\nsuspected price manipulations.\n\nBoth B1 and B2 groups have been merged into one group known as B Group since April 1, 2008. All\ncompanies not included in group \u2018A\u2019, \u2018S\u2019 or \u2018Z\u2019 are clubbed under this category.\n\nSubsequently, a Z group was introduced in 1999 with scrips of companies that do not meet the rules,\nregulations and stipulations laid down by the exchange. It is a buyer-beware company. There are some\n300 scrips in the group. The companies that failed on a frequent basis to disclose quarterly results, to\naddress investor grievances and make an arrangement with depositories to demat shares or even pay the\nexchange-listing fees are transferred by the exchange to this category. All Z-category stocks result in\ndeliveries. The trading is on a trade-to-trade basis and no squaring up is permitted in intra-day trading as\nin other groups. The exchange authorities review their performance on a regular basis; and if a company\nsatisfies the requirement, it is reverted back to its original group.\n\nA new F group pertaining to the debt-market segment and G group pertaining to the government-\nsecurities market was started with effect from September 9, 1996.\n\nThe BSE set up the BSE INDONext market as a separate trading market on January 7, 2005 on its\nBOLT system as S group.\n\nThe scrips are transferred on a trade-to-trade basis from the regular segment to T group. Settlement\nof trades is done on the basis of gross obligations for the day. No netting is allowed and every trade is\nsettled separately.\n\nScrips in the BSE-Indonext segment S, which are settled on a trade-to-trade basis as a surveillance\nmeasure, are transferred to the TS group.\n\nThere were 5,834 companies were listed on BSE till March 31, 2017.\n",

Since then, in the last\n15 years, it has launche d 13 more indices. The BSE Sensex of equity-share prices was launched with\nthe base year of 1978\u201479. It comprises 30 scrips. The BSE Sensex was followed by the BSE National\nin 1989.\n\nThis is a broader index comprising 100 scrips. The BSE introduced two new indices during 1993-94\u2014\nthe BSE 200 and the Dollex. The BSE 200 reflects the movements in the shares of 200 selected compa-\nnies from its specified and non-specified lists. The Dollex is a dollar version of the BSE 200, which has\n1989-90 as its base year. The BSE Dollex indices are Dollex 30, 100 and 200. The BSE introduced five\nsectoral indices from August 1999\u2014the BSE IT Index, the BSE Capital Goods Index, the BSE FMCG\nIndex, the BSE Health Care Index and the BSE Consumer Durables Index. In 2001, the BSE launched the\nBSE-PSU Index Dollex-30 and the BSE-Tech Index. Market capitalization of all the indices is a free-float\nmarket capitalization except for BSE-PSU Index. Subsequently, it introduced seven new sectoral indices\nwhich include auto, bank, metal, oil and gas, power, realty and tech. The other major indices introduced\nare small cap, midcap, BSE100, BSE 500 and BSE IPO. From June 2017, Differential Voting Rights\n(DVRs) are eligible for index inclusion provided that the ordinary share class is part of the index and the\nDVR shares outstanding are greater than 10% of the ordinary shares outstanding. In addition, the DVRs\nmust individually satisfy all other index eligibility criteria. DVRs satisfying the index eligibility criteria\nare aggregated with the company\u2019s common stock and index construction is done based on the aggregated\ncompany data.\n\nBull Rally The first bull rally was witnessed in 1992 when the reforms were announced in the\nManmohan Singh Budgets. The sensex climbed from 1017.72 on January 17, 1991 to a peak of 4467.32\non April 23, 1992. On October 17, 2003, the BSE Sensex closed at 4,930.53. This was the fastest rally\nof 2,006 points in the last decade. This 2,006-point rally came in 123 trading days, since April 25, 2003,\nwhen the Sensex was 2,924.12 points. However, the fastest rally, outside the current decade, was during\nthe Harshad Mehta Scam when the Sensex gained 2,193 points in 31 trading days between February 7,\nand April 2, 1992. The biggest bull run was inspired by \u201cBig Bull\u2019 Harshad Mehta and expectations of foreign\nmoney coming into the local equity market. The Sensex moved up by 127 per cent from 1,885 to 4,285 levels.\n\nThe second 1,150-plus point rally during March\u2014August 2003 in the equity market was the largest half-\nyear rally in more than a decade. The BSE Sensex then registered the biggest post-reform gain\u2014a record\nrise of 83.37 per cent during the year 2003-04. Unlike some previous rallies, this rally was a broad-based\none, not driven by a few scrips of one or two sectors. Investors holding a diversified portfolio recorded an\nall-round gain. Moreover, there was also a considerable amount of FIl interest in the Indian markets.\n\nBetween the last week of October 2004 and end-March 2005, a strong rally pushed the BSE Sensex\nto a historic high of 6,915.06 on March 8, 2005. Strong macroeconomic fundamentals, renewed buying\ninterests by Fils, an acceleration in the industrial activity, an improved financial performance of Indian\ncompanies, a moderation of domestic inflation, an easing of international crude-oil prices, an unprec-\nedented pick-upon in bank credit and policy initiatives relating to the FDI in telecom and construction\nsections contributed to the upsurge in the Sensex.\n\nThe Sensex crossed the 8,000 level\u2014a historic high on September 8, 2005. The Sensex closed on that day\nat 8,053\u2014a rise of 106 points. The BSE Sensex crossed the 5-digit mark on February 6, 2006 when it touched\n10,122. It touched 12,000 on April 20, 2006 and 12,671 on May 11, 2006, but it went into a free fall after\nMay 12, 2006, lost 30 per cent over a month, touched bottom at 8,799 on June 14, 2006 and drove investors\ninto a panic.\n\nThe Sensex touched 11,015 on August 8, 2006 and 12,010 on September 15, 2006. It crossed the\n13,000 mark on October 30, 2006 when the index rallied 117 points to close at 13,024. Investors\u2019 wealth\nin the 30 Sensex companies, measured in terms of the cumulative market value of these firms, soared to\nover %16,50,000 crores, from about %15,00,000 crores on April 20, 2006. Total investor wealth soared to\nover 34,00,000 crores on October 30, 2006. Strong economic growth, robust corporate results, a stable\nrupee, inflation and interest rates, lower crude-oil prices and high FII investment gave a fillip to market\nsentiments which drove the Sensex to amazing heights.\n\nIn 2006, the Sensex joined a select club of global indices such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the\nNikkei and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng which had crossed the 10,000 mark. India became the first BRIC coun-\ntry to join an exclusive club of developed markets whose market capitalization of companies listed on the\nstock exchanges exceeds the GDP.

It was opined that the BSE would not be in a position to face stiff competition from this\nnew and modern stock exchange. However, the BSE revamped its operations quickly, adopted modern\ntechnology, and gave tough competition to the NSE. This competition among the exchanges has made the\nIndian capital market more mature.\n\nThe BSE is still in the process of reforming itself. The involvement of BSE brokers and its elected\nmembers in a series of scams has affected its image and small and institutional investors have more or\nless lost faith in it. It completed the process of demutualization and corporatization in May 2007. The\nSingapore stock exchange (SGX) and the Deutsche Borse (DB) are BSE\u2019s strategic partners holding 5\nper cent stake each in the exchange. They have a combined investment of \u20ac380 crore at %5200 per share.\n\nThe BSE\u2019s network outside Mumbai has not expanded significantly. The BSE lacks in liquidity and\nneeds to draw in more players like market makers to create liquidity. The BSE and NSE had commenced\nderivatives trading in 2000 but NSE dominates the derivatives market. The oldest stock exchange in order\nto regain a competitive edge over NSE, it reformulated its strategies and effectively implemented them to\n\nrecover its lost market share. BSE is slowly surging ahead by gaining substantial market share both in the\ncash segment and especially in the derivatives segment.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "THE NATIONAL STOCK EXCHANGE OF INDIA\n\nThe stock markets witnessed many institutional changes in the 1990s. One of them was the establishment\nof the NSE, a modern stock exchange which brought with it the best global practices.\n\u2018The NSE was incorporated in November 1992 with the following objectives:\n\n* To establish a nationwide trading facility for equities, debt instruments, and hybrids.\n\n* To ensure all investors all over the country equal access through an appropriate communication network.\n\n* To provide a fair, efficient, and transparent securities market to investors through an electronic trad-\ning system.\n\n* To enable shorter settlement cycles and book-entry settlement system.\n\n+ To meet the current international standards of securities markets.\n\nThe Pherwani Committee, which mooted the setting up of the NSE, wanted different trading floors\nlinked through a technologically backed, automated network thereby creating an exchange with a national\nnetwork. However, instead of providing a common platform for all regional stock exchanges, the NSE is\ncompeting with the BSE, thus creating a problem of survival for other exchanges.\n\nThe NSE, unlike other Indian stock exchanges, is a tax-paying company incorporated under the Com-\npanies Act, 1956. It has been promoted by leading financial institutions and banks to provide automated\nand modern facilities for trading, clearing and settlement of securities in a transparent, fair and open\nmanner and with countrywide access.\n\nThe exchange is professionally managed in that the ownership and the management of the NSE are\ncompletely separated from the right to trade on the exchange. In order to upgrade the professional stand-\nards of the market intermediaries, the exchange lays stress on factors such as capital adequacy, corporate\nstructure, track record and educational experience.\n\nNSE\u2019s membership is always on tap and anyone who meets the eligibility criteria such as cash deposits and\nhigh net worth can become a member. A member, who wants to quit business, can do so freely and refund\ndeposits after meeting all liabilities.\n\nNSE members are connected to the Exchange from their work stations to the central computer located at\nthe exchange through a satellite using VSATs (very small aperture terminals). The NSE has installed over\n2,648 VSATs in over 201 cities across the country. Members can place orders from their office and extend\nconnectivity to clients through their computer-to-computer-link (CTCL) facility outside their premises. Reg-\nistered dealers of the members have remote trading terminals at their offices and they trade electronically\non the \u2018NSE-NEAT\"\u201d trading system through the CTCL server installed at the members\u2019 office. Through this\nfacility, members can have a total control over their network and can closely monitor the orders placed by\ntheir registered dealers/branches.\n\nThe NSE was granted recognition as a stock exchange in April 1993 and it started operations with the\nwholesale debt market (WDM) segment in June 1994, It started equity trading in November 1994 and, in a\nshort span of 1 year, surpassed the volume at the BSE, the largest stock exchange in the country. The NSE is\nthe only stock exchange in the world to get to the first place in the country in the very first year of its operations.\n\nThe NSE offers a trading platform for a wide range of products for multiple markets, including equity\nshares; warrants; exchange-traded funds (ETF); mutual funds; debt instruments including corporate\ndebt, central and state government securities, treasury bills, commercial paper and certificate of deposits;\nderivatives like index futures and options, stock futures and options and currency futures. The Exchange\nprovides trading in four different segments, namely, Wholesale Debt Market (WDM) segment, Capital\nMarket (CM) segment, Futures & Options (F&O) segment and the Currency Derivatives (CD) segment.\n\nThere are more than 1,800 companies listed on the NSE and more than 95 per cent of these are actively\ntraded.\n\nThe NSE introduced, for the first time in India, fully automated, screen-based trading, eliminating the\nneed for physicaltrading floors. This screen-based trading was the first to go live in the world through\nsatellite communication.\n\n\u2018The NSE developed a system of managing the primary issues through screen-based automated trading system.\n\nThe NSE offers its nationwide network for conducting online IPOs through the book-building\nprocess. It operates a fully automated, screen-based, bidding system called NEAT IPO that enables\nthe trading members to enter bids directly from their offices through a sophisticated telecommunica-\ntion network.\n\n\nThe NSE developed a new trading application, NOW, or \u2018NEAT on Web\u2019 in May 2008. This platform\nallows the trading members to connect to the Exchange through the Internet, and has resulted in a signifi-\ncant reduction in both access cost as well as turnaround time for providing access.\n\nThe NSE is the first stock exchange to help promote institutional infrastructure of the capital market.\n\nNSE offers more than 10 asset classes and has taken initiatives to strengthen the securities industry by\nproviding several new products like Mini Nifty, long dated options and mutual fund service system. It\nhas introduced services like DMA, FIX capabilities co-location facility and mobile trading to cater to the\nevolving needs of the market and participants. NSE has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)\nwith Singapore Exchange (SGX) to cooperate in the development of a market for market linked products\nand services to be listed on SGX.\n\nIn 1995, the NSE set up the National Securities Clearing Corporation Limited (NSCCL)\u2014the first\nclearing corporation in the country, to provide settlement guarantee. To promote dematerialization of\nsecurities, it jointly set up with the erstwhile UTI and the IDBI, the National Securities Depository Lim-\nited (NSDL)\u2014the first depository in India.\n\nThe NSE set up India Index Services and Products Limited (IISL), a joint venture of CRISIL and NSE,\nin May 1998, to provide indices and index services. IISL is India\u2019s first specialized company focusing\nupon the index as a core product and maintains over 96 equity indices comprising broad-based, bench-\nmark indices, sectoral indices and customized indices.\n\nThe NSE\u2019s IT set-up is larger than that of any company in the country. It has a state-of-the-art client-\nserver application. The NSE was the first exchange to grant permission to brokers for Internet trading. The\nNSE incorporated a separate entity\u2014NSE IT Ltd in October 1999, to service the securities industry in addi-\ntion to the management of IT requirements of the NSE. It also set up NSE Infotech Services Ltd to focus\non IT. It caters to the IT needs of NSE and all its group companies exclusively. The data and info-vending\nproducts of the NSE are provided through a separate company DotEx International Ltd, a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of the NSE. DotEX also offers \u2018NOW\u2019 a fully managed, secure and reliable trading gateway, pro-\nviding immediate, scalable and seamless access through internet to members and internet investors\n\nThe commodity exchange platform\u2014NCDEX\u2014was jointly set up by the NSE with financial institutions.\nIn order to provide clearing-and-settlement services to NCDEX, it promoted a company\u2014National Com-\nmodity Clearing Limited (NCCL) in 2006. The clearing and settlement covers contracts in 44 products rang-\ning from agricultural commodities to base metals, energy, polymers and precious metals. In 2008, it set up a\nnational-level electricity exchange\u2014Power Exchange India (PXI) Ltd, again the first of its kind in the country.\n\nThe NSE is ranked third in terms of number of equity shares traded and is the eighth largest derivatives\nexchange in the world.\n\nNSE Milestones\n\nMonth!

                        "extracted-text": "National Securities Clearing Corporation Limited\n\nIn April 1995, the NSE set up the National Securities Clearing Corporation Limited (NSCCL), a wholly\nowned subsidiary, to undertake clearing and settlement at the exchange. It commenced operations from\nApril 1996. It operates with a well-defined settlement cycle, aggregates trades over a trading period, nets the\npositions to determine the liabilities of the members, and ensures movement of funds and securities to meet\nrespective liabilities. Its central functions are clearing and settlement of trades and risk management.\n\nIt was set up with the following objectives:\n\n* to bring and sustain confidence in clearing and settlement of securities;\n+ to promote and maintain, short and consistent settlement cycles;\n\n* to provide counter-party risk guarantee, and\n\n* to operate a tight risk containment system.\n\nThe NSCCL assumes the counter-party risk of each member and guarantees settlement. Settlement\nguarantee is a guarantee provided by the clearing corporation for the settlement of all trades even if a\nparty defaults to deliver securities or pay cash. The NSCCL started the settlement guarantee fund for the\ncapital market in June 1996 with an initial corpus of 2300 crore. This fund stood at 82,700 crore at the end\nof March 2006. It cushions itself from any residual risk. Members contribute to this fund which is utilized\nfor the successful completion of settlement. A separate settlement guarantee fund (SGF) is maintained for\nthe futures and options (F&O) segment.\n\n\u2018There are four entities linked with the Clearing Corporation (NSCCL) in the clearing and settlement process.\n\nClearing Banks\nCustodians Nscct |} PCMs\nDepositories\n\nCustodian/Clearing members: Clearing members have to make available funds and/or secu-\nrities in the designated accounts with clearing bank/depositories to meet their obligations on\nthe settlement date. Custodian is a clearing member but not a trading member. They settle\ntrades assigned to them by trading members. The NSCCL notifies the relevant trade details to\ncustodians on the trade day who affirm back. If a custodian confirms to settle that trade, he is\nassigned that particular obligation by the NSCCL. There are 19 custodians empanelled with the\nNSCCL.\n\nClearing banks: They are a key link between the clearing members and clearing corporation. Every\nclearing member is required to open a dedicated clearing account with one of the designated clear-\ning banks. The NSCCL, in association with clearing banks, provides working capital funding to\nclearing members. A clearing bank has to enter into an agreement with the NSCCL and the clearing\nmember and open clearing accounts with depositories. The clearing member has to approach its\nbank, which would extend the funding requirements in consultation with the NSCCL.\nDepositories: They hold securities in dematerialized form for the investors in their beneficiary\naccounts. Every clearing member is required to maintain a clearing pool account with the deposi-\ntories. The depository runs on electronic file to transfer securities from accounts of the custodians/\nclearing member to that of the NSCCL and vice versa.\n\nProfessional Clearing Members (PCMs): They are a special category of members with clearing\nrights but with no trading rights and who perform functions similar to those of custodians. PCMs\nclear and settle trade for their clients who may be individuals or institutions.\n\nThe NSCCL carries out the clearing and settlement process with the help of clearing banks and deposi-\ntories which results in an actual movement of funds and securities on the prescribed pay-in and pay-out day.\n\nThe clearing members bring in the securities in designated accounts with the two depositories\u2014the\nCM pool account in the case of the NSDL and designated settlement accounts in the case of the CDSL\nand funds in the designated accounts with clearing banks. The clearing banks, on receiving electronic\ninstructions from the NSCCL, debit accounts of clearing banks and credit accounts of the clearing corpo-\nration. This is termed as pay-in of funds and securities.\n\nThe NSCCL, after providing for shortages of funds/securities, sends electronic instructions to the\ndepositors/clearing banks to credit accounts of clearing members and debit accounts of the clearing cor-\nporation. Thus, the settlement cycle is complete once the pay-out of funds and securities is done.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Margin Requirements\n\nThe NSCCL imposes stringent margin requirements as part of its risk containment measures. For impos-\ning margins, the stocks are categorized as follows:\n\n+ The stocks, which have traded atleast 80 per cent of the days during the previous 18 months, shall\nconstitute Group I and Group I.\n\n+ Out of the scrips identified above, those having a mean impact cost of less than or equal to one per\ncent shall be under Group I and the scrips where the impact cost is more than one, shall be under\nGroup II.\n\n* The remaining stocks shall be under Group III.\n\n+ The impact cost shall be calculated on the 15th of each month on a rolling basis considering the\norder book snapshots of the previous six months. On the basis of the calculated impact cost, the\nscrip shall move from one group to another group from the Ist of the next month. The impact cost\nis required to be calculated for an order value of @1 lakh.\n\nThe daily margin is the the sum of mark to market margin (MTM margin) and value at risk-based\nmargin (VaR-based margin). The VaR margin is applicable for all securities in rolling settlement.\n\nFor the securities listed in Group I, scripwise daily volatility is calculated using the exponentially\nweighted moving average which is 3.5 times the volatility. For the securities listed in Group II, the VaR\nmargin is higher of scrip VaR (3.5 8) or three times the index VaR and it is scaled up by root 3. For the\nsecurities listed in Group III, the VaR margin is equal to five times the index VaR and scaled up by square\nroot of 3. The VaR margin rate for a security constitute the following:\n\n+ The index VaR would be the higher of the daily Index VaR based on the S&P CNX Nifty or the BSE\nSensex. The index VaR would be subject to a minimum of 5 per cent.\n\n+ An additional VaR margin of 6 per cent as specified by the SEBI.\n\n* The NSCCL may stipulate security specific margins for the securities from time to time.\n\nThe mark to market margin is calculated on the basis of a notional loss which the member would incur\nin case the cumulative net outstanding position of the member in all securities, at the end of the relevant\nday were closed out at the closing price of the securities as announced at the end of the day by the NSE.\nMark to market margin is calculated by marking each transaction in a scrip to the closing price of the\nscrip at the end of trading. In case the security has not been traded on a particular day, the latest available\nclosing price at the NSE is considered as the closing price. In the event of the net outstanding position of\na member in any security being nil, the difference between the buy and sell values would be considered as\nnotional loss for the purpose of calculating the mark to market margin payable. MTM profit/loss across\ndifferent securities within the same settlement is set off to determine the MTM less for a settlement. Such\nMT losses for settlements are computed at client level.\n\nThe NSCCL has introduced the facility of direct payment to clients\u2019 account on both the deposito-\nries\u2014the NSDL and the CDSL. Based on the information received from members, the NSCCL sends\npay-out instructions to the depositories which enables the clients to receive the pay-out directly into their\naccounts on pay-out day.\n\nThe NSCCL also offers constituent subsidiary general ledger (CSGL) facilities to investors in govern-\nment securities. SGL is a facility provided by the RBI to large banks and financial institutions to hold their\ninvestments in government securities in the electronic book entry form. The securities held in SGL can be\nsettled through a delivery-versus payment (DVP) mechanism which ensures simultaneous movement of\nfunds and securities.\n\nMutual Fund Service System (MFSS) is a facility provided by the NSCCL to investors for transacting\nin dematerialized units of open-ended schemes of mutual funds. The objective is to provide to the investor\na one-stop shop for transacting in financial products. MFSS addresses the need for a common platform\nfor sale and repurchase of units of schemes managed by various funds. The exchange, with its extensive\nnetwork covering around 400 cities and towns across the country, offers a mechanism for electronic online\ncollection of orders from the market and the Clearing Corporation acts as a central agency for the clearing\nand settlement of all orders. The transactions are not covered by settlement guarantee.\n\nThe NSCCL was permitted to operate a stock lending/borrowing scheme from July 1998. The NSE\nand the NSCCL commenced the automated lending and borrowing mechanism (ALBM) for lending and\nborrowing of securities from February 10, 1999. The ALBM facilitated borrowing/lending of securities/\nfunds at market-determined rates to meet immediate settlement requirements or payment obligations at\na reasonable cost and low risk. The ALBM was NSE\u2019s answer to BSE\u2019s badla. The ALBM was restricted\nto only the S&P CNX Nifty and the CNX Nifty Junior Index securities. Badla was supposed to be a\npure financing mechanism while ALBM was a security lending and borrowing mechanism. The trades in\nthe ALBM segment were guaranteed by the settlement fund of the NSE. This deferral product has been\nbanned by the SEBI along with other deferral products from July 2001.\n\n",

The order-driven sys-\ntem helped reduce jobbing spreads to cut down transaction costs.\n\nAs on March 31, 2013, there were 1,666 listed companies on NSE. On an average, 85 per cent of their\nstocks are traded every day. The exchange covers 90 per cent of all-India market capitalization.\n\nTrading volumes increased tremendously during the years 1994-95 to 2000-01. A major reason for\nthis growth was the nationwide reach of the NSE. The superior technology of the NSE enabled an investor\nin a remote part of the country to trade safely. The liquidity in the NSE market was not limited to high-\nmarket capitalization stocks, but was found in other mid- and low-capitalization stocks as well. Trading\nvolumes declined in 2001-02, but again, picked up in the first quarter of 2002-03. There was a strong\nbuying interest in mid-cap technology stocks, in PSU scrips following acceleration of the disinvestment\nprogramme and in banking scrips due to their improved performance and relaxation in FDI limits. The\nmarket capitalization of listed companies depicts a rising trend except in the year 2000-01 due to a\ndecline in the market prices of IT stocks.\n\nOn June 4, 2007, the S&P CNX Nifty Index scaled to a peak of 4362.95 and the market capitalization\nof the scrips was a record high of %39,78,381 crores on June 29, 2007. The secondary market was buoyant\nduring 2005-06 and 2006-07 on account of earnings growth reported by Corporates, relaxation in fringe\nbenefit tax (FBT) treating open-ended and close-ended equity or oriented schemes on par for dividend\ndistribution tax, strong macro-economic fundamentals, raising FII limit in debt market and favourable\nglobal economic environment. The Nifty declined to 3,021 in 2008-09 on account of global economic\ncrisis but with an improvement in global economic scenario increased to 5,249 in 2009-10 and 5,834 in\n2010-11. 2010-11.

The exchange\nis credited with technology innovation, speeding up of the process for dematerialization, introduc-\ntion of effective risk containment measures and the introduction of derivatives trading. It has spread\nto 364 cities using close to 3900 VSATs. It is a dominant stock exchange accounting for 84 per cent\nof the traded volume in the cash segment and 74 per cent of the traded volume in the derivatives\nsegment.\n\nThe NSE has emerged as a technology-driven stock exchange. It has rightly positioned itself as \u2018the\nexchange with a difference\u2019. In order to maintain its leading position among exchanges, it increases the\nnumber of users by trying to meet their growing and ever changing types of needs through innovative\nefforts. Its aim is to continuously upgrade technology systems and trading practices. The setting up of\nthe NSE has changed the face of the Indian stock market. The NSE won the inaugural Wharton-Infosys\nBusiness Transformation Award in the \u2018organization-wide transformation\u2019 category for Europe and the\nAsia-Pacific region for harnessing technology to create a world class exchange and using it as an instru-\nment of change for the industry as a whole.

                        "extracted-text": "REGIONAL STOCK EXCHANGES,\n\nOne significant aspect of the Indian capital market is the existence of as many as 19 regional stock\nexchanges\u2014the highest in the world. RSEs existed in developed markets also but ultimately, they had to\nshut down or merge with the principal exchanges. Over 20 stock exchanges existed in the UK until 1973.\nBy 1965, the regional exchanges joined together to form the Federation of Stock Exchanges and amalga-\nmated to become a fully unified stock exchange in 1973.\n\nAustralia had six exchanges which got together and established the Australia Associated Stock\nExchanges (AASE), a company limited by its guarantee, to represent them at the national level. In\n1987, the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) commenced operation, with the six capital city exchanges\nas its wholly owned subsidiaries. In Italy, all securities listed on the Milan Stock Exchange and nine\nother RSEs were transferred to a national computerized order-driven trading system under the Italian\nStock Exchange in 1991. Today, the Italian stock market is a computerized system which has no spe-\ncific location.\n\nIn India, the area of operation and jurisdiction of the regional stock exchanges were specified. The\nemergence of a number of regional stock exchanges was the result of India\u2019s geographical and telecom-\nmunications limitations.\n\nThese regional stock exchanges provided investors an access to big brokers in Mumbai. They also\nserved as a link between the local companies and local investors. Reputed local companies could get\nthemselves listed on these exchanges and the regional stock exchanges promoted trading in these local\nscrips. This led to a competition among issuers and they listed their securities on as many exchanges as\npossible to attract investors from all over the country. Moreover, each regional stock exchange followed\nits own practice and procedures in respect of listing and trading of securities, clearing and settlement of\ntransactions, and risk containment measures. This resulted in a waste of the resources of the issuers for\ncomplying with the listing requirement of a number of exchanges simultaneously. Again, competition\namongst exchanges increased to attract as many issuers as possible. The listing fees constitutes a major\nsource of income and to maintain these fees, listing standards were diluted. The regional stock exchanges\ndid well till the beginning of the 1990s.\n\nIn the 1990s, new stock exchanges\u2014the Over the Counter Exchange of India, the National Stock\nExchange, and the Inter-Connected Stock Exchange of India\u2014were set up and permitted nationwide\ntrading. Subsequently, all stock exchanges were permitted to expand across the nation. Inspite of this\nexpansion, the turnover did not increase because with the spread of online trading, traders in remote\nparts of the country could deal directly with the NSE or the BSE. Hence, there was no need to go\nthrough regional exchanges. Besides this, members of these regional stock exchanges involved them-\nselves in speculation instead of reaching out to new investors and catering to local companies in an\nefficient manner. With turnovers plunging, most RSEs acquired membership of the BSE or the NSE\nand became their stockbrokers.\n\nMany large companies decided to delist on all stock exchanges except the BSE and the NSE. Since list-\ning fees constitutes the major source of income, the question of viability of these stock exchanges arose.\nApart from listing fees, another source of income for stock exchanges is interest and rent. These stock\nexchanges receive custodial deposits for risk management and earn interest on them. Despite increase in\nthe interest income, most of the stock exchanges incurred losses.\n\nThe daily turnover at the Delhi Stock Exchange plunged to 2100 crore in 2002. Stock exchanges such\nas Guwahati, Cochin, Jaipur, Bhubaneshwar, Mangalore, Madhya Pradesh, and Magadh had an almost\nnegligible turnover. There was insignificant or no trading at all in these stock exchanges. The percentage\nof turnover on regional stock exchanges was around 1.1 per cent in 2003-04.\n\nIn 2001-02, the NSE commanded around 80 per cent of the turnover, while the BSE accounted for 16 per\ncent only. The regional stock exchanges together accounted for the remaining 4 per cent of the total turnover.\n\nThe share of the RSEs came down to a meagre | per cent in 2004-05, 0.19 per cent in 2005-06 and\n0.01 per cent in 2008-09. The Mangalore Stock Exchange was not given recognition by the SEBI in\n2004-05. The Magadh, Hyderbad and Saurashta-Kutch ((SKSE) stock exchanges have been derecog-\nnized by the SEBI. After the derecognition, the stock exchange might continue as a corporate entity\nbut cannot use the expression \u2018stock exchange\u2019 or any variant of this in its name or its subsidiary\u2019s\nname.\n\nThere was hardly any transaction in the 13 out of the 15 regional stock exchanges during 2008-09.\nWith a significant decline in the trading at the RSEs, they set up subsidiaries; and these subsidiar-\nies acquired access to national exchanges at concessional rates. Some of the subsidiaries are profit-\nmaking entities providing securities trading, depository participant services and distribution of mutual\nfunds.\n\nThe RSEs were needed when there was no electronic trading. With the NSE and the BSE offering\nnationwide, screen-based trading, the question has arisen whether the RSEs are needed at all.\n\nLooking at this scenario, it seems that, in the long run, there will be only two stock exchanges in India:\nthe NSE and the BSE. The lead that the NSE has gained over the BSE will increase in the coming years\nas the NSE is perceived to be more investor-friendly than the BSE by most investors. The RSEs will be\nforced to down their shutters as low turnover volumes will result in huge revenue deficits. Moreover, most\nof the stock exchanges do not have the money to upgrade their IT infrastructure, a prerequisite to survive\nand compete in the future.\n\nWith a view to reviving the regional stock exchanges, the SEBI allowed the outside investors to invest in\nthem. It allowed single-entity holding up to 15 per cent in the stock exchanges. The government has allowed\nforeign direct and portfolio investors to buy into the equity of stock exchanges with a limit of 49 per cent.\nHowever, despite the outside investors\u2019 investment, these stock exchanges have not yet managed to restart\noperations.\n\nThere are seven stock exchanges in India, of which four\u2014BSE, NSE, Calcutta Stock Exchange\nand Ahmedabad Stock Exchange have been granted permanent recognition, the Metropolitan Stock\nExchange of India Ltd. has been granted renewal of recognition while the remaining two stock\n\nexchanges, Magadh Stock Exchange and the Delhi Stock Exchange, have been de-recognized and\nare in the process of exiting. Out of the four permanent exchanges, Ahmedabad Stock Exchange and\nCalcutta Stock Exchange are also in the process of exit. Pursuant to the exit policy for de-recognized/\nnon-operational stock exchange notified by SEBI in 2012, 17 stock exchanges have exited so far. Of\nthese, 12 exited during 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2014-15 and five more stock exchanges exited during\n2015-16. Now there are no regional stock exchanges as both Calcutta Stock Exchange and Ahmedabad\nStock Exchange who had been granted permanent recognition have exited in 2017.\n\nSEBI laid down a framework in November 2008, to promote several trading platforms or exchanges\nfor trading of shares of small and medium enterprises (SMEs).\n\nI Eligibility criteria for setting up of new stock exchange/platform of an existing stock exchange\nfor the SME sector\nDedicated stock exchanges for the Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) sector may be set up after\nrecognition under the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act\u20141956 (SCRA).\nlity criteria for the same are as under:\n\n1, The proposed stock exchange should be set up as a corporatized entity since inception.

The exchange shall have a balance sheet networth of atleast 7100 crores.\n\n3. The exchange shall have nation wide trading terminals and an online screen-based trading sys-\ntem, which also has a suitable business continuity plan including a disaster recovery site.\n\n4.

                        "extracted-text": "Routes for Investment in Indian Stock Markets\n\nThere are three routes through which FIls can invest in the Indian stock market. The first is the direct\nroute, the second is participatory notes and the third is through FII sub-accounts. In the direct route, the\nforeign entity applies to the SEBI for registration as FII. Sub-account means any person resident outside\nIndia, on whose behalf investments are proposed to be made in India by a foreign institutional investor\nand who is registered as a sub-account under SEBI (FIl) regulations. The names of the sub-accounts on\nwhose behalf the Foreign Institutional Investor is investing are to be disclosed to the SEBI by the Foreign\nInstitutional Investor. An institution or fund or portfolio established or incorporated outside India, a broad\nbased fund or proprietary fundor a foreign corporate or individual can register as sub-accounts. The gov-\nernment allowed listed foreign companies with an asset base of not less than $2 billion and a proven track\nrecord of profitability and foreign individuals with a minimum net worth of $50 million to register as sub\naccounts and trade in local stocks.\n\nFils have to clearly segregate their own funds and that of their sub-accounts. The SEBI simplified the\nprocess of approval of sub-accounts of registered FIIs. FIs can setup sub-accounts in Mauritius to enter\nIndia. While sub-accounts have certain administrative costs, it is less expensive than buying a participa-\ntory note. India has a double taxation avoidance agreement (DTAA) with Mauritius, which makes it an\nattractive platform for flow of investment to India. Because of the tax avoidance treaty, most FIIs are\nregistered in Mauritius and declare their income as capital gains and pay no tax. SEBI has also made\nit mandatory for FIIs to disclose all information relating to sub-accounts through joint undertakings.\nThe sub-account applicant and the FII through whom the application for registration is made, have to\nsubmit joint undertakings. These include a written submission that the sub-account is not a non-resident\nIndian (NRI) or an overseas corporate body and the source of income of the applicant is from known and\nlegitimate means. The total number of FIIs and sub-accounts registered with SEBI as on September 18,\n2008 was 1,506 and 4,576 respectively.\n\nParticipatory notes (P-notes) are overseas derivative instruments issued by SEBI-registered FII to\nforeign investors for trading in the Indian stock market. These derivative instruments derive value from\nunderlying securities such as equity and equity-linked instruments. These foreign investors do not get\nregistered with SEBI out of choice or regulatory issues. As they are not registered with the SEBI, the\nidentity of the actual investor and source of funds remain disguised. These notes are generally issued\nby associates of India-based foreign brokerage houses. Morgan Stanley, Credit Lyonnais, Citigroup and\nGoldman Sachs are the biggest issuers of participatory notes. The SEBI issued some directives to moni-\ntor investment through participatory notes. It is mandatory for Flls to fully disclose various details of\noffshore derivatives instruments such as participatory notes, equity linked notes and others With effect\nfrom February 2004, participatory notes against underlying Indian securities can be issued only to regu-\nlated entities and further transfers, if any, of these instruments can also be made to other regulated enti-\nties only subject to compliance with \u2018know your client requirements.\u2019 This means that FIls can not issue\nparticipatory notes to unregulated entities such as Overseas Corporate Bodies (OCBs) and non-resident\nIndians (NRIs). It is mandatory for FIIs to report the issuance/renewal/cancellation/redemption of such\ninstruments.\n\n",

Screen-based trading\nand depository are realities today largely because of FIIs. Equity research was something unheard of\nin the Indian market a decade ago. It was FIIs who eased the pressure on the rupee from the balance\nof payments\u2019 position and lowered the cost of capital to Indian business. It is due to FIls that a con-\ncept like corporate governance is being increasingly adopted by Indian companies; this is benefiting\ndomestic investors also. FIIs are the trendsetters in any market. They were the first ones to identify the\npotential of the Indian technology stocks. When the rest of the investors invested in these scrips, they\nexited the scrips and booked the profits. Before the arrival of FIIs, the activity in stocks used to be\nevenly distributed, with a little difference between the volumes in specified and cash groups. However,\nsince FIIs concentrate on the top 200 companies against the 6,000 listed companies on the BSE, stock-\ntrading activity has concentrated in these liquid scrips, making the less-liquid scrips totally illiquid.\nThus, FIs have become the driving force behind the movements of stock indices in the Indian stock\nmarkets.\n\nLooking to the active participation of FIs in the Indian stock markets, many broking firms converted\ninto corporate entities. This corporatization of brokerage houses resulted in an increased transparency\nof broking firms and reduction of broking charges, which, in turn, added more depth and width into the\nbourses.\n\nRolling settlement was introduced at the insistence of Flls, as they were uncomfortable with the badla\nsystem. The major beneficiaries of the rolling-settlement system are Flls, as short-settlement cycles offer\nthem a quick exit from the market.\n\nWith their massive financial muscle, FIIs have almost replaced the conventional market movers of the\nIndian bourses. Today, financial institutions and mutual funds including UTI can do little to help the stock\nmarkets at a time of crisis. Even UTI, which used to be a counter force for FIs, has ceased to play that\nrole in the Indian stock markets.\n\nFIl inflows create a bull run which encourages participation of small investors. FIIs caused the bull run\nof 2003 which enabled the government to carry out its disinvestment programme.\n",

A separate limit for investments by FPIs in State Development Loans (SDLs) has\nalso been introduced. Further, as per the framework, the debt limits will be increased every half year in\nMarch and September and released every quarter. The following tables provide a glimpse of FPI invest-\nment limits in government securities and corporate bonds as well as the re-investment of coupons in\ngovernment securities as on March 31, 2016.\n\nAs on March 31, 2017, there were 8781 FPIs registered with SEBI. These included 7807 FPIs regis-\ntered as per the new SEBI FPI Regulations, 2014 and 974 deemed FPIs. As on March 31, 2016, 18 DDPs\nhad been registered with SEBI.\n\nForeign Portfolio Investor (FPI) Category I & II are exempted from indirect transfer provision. Indirect\ntransfer provision shall not apply in case of redemption of shares or interests outside India as a result of\nor arising out of redemption or sale of investment in India which is chargeable to tax in India\n\nThe limit for investment by FPIs in government securities, for the April \u2014 June 2017 quarter was\nrevised as follows:\n\na. Limit for FPIs in central government securities enhanced to %1,84,901 cr.\n\nb. Limit for Long Term FPIs (Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs), Multilateral Agencies, Endow-\nment Funds, Insurance Funds, Pension Funds and Foreign Central Banks) in central govern-\nment securities revised to 46,099 cr.\n\nc.

The SEBI mandated compulsory trading and settlement of\nselect securities in dematerialized form. All securities are held, traded, and settled in demat form. Two\ndepositories have come into existence\u2014the NSDL and the CDSL. Demat settlements have eliminated bad\ndeliveries and other related problems associated with physical securities.\n\nDepositories are discussed in detail in Chapter 18.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Buy Back of Shares\n\nBuy back of shares means that a company purchases or buys back its own shares, which it had issued previ-\nously to the shareholders. The company has the option to either cancel them or hold them as treasury-frozen\nstock. The difference, though technical, is significant. For example, a company buys back one crore equity\nshares of the face value of 210 at 100 each. If the shares are cancelled, the equity base of the company will\nbe reduced by 210 crore, while the reserves will be depleted by %90 crore. If the repurchased shares are held\nas treasury stock, the shares will not be extinguished but will be held neither as an investment nor as equity.\nThey can be revived by reissuing them at a later date or for employee option.\nA company may be motivated to buy back its own shares for any of the following reasons:\n\n+ A company with surplus cash to invest and buy back may consider it to be a worthwhile investment\nproposition as it carries minimum risk compared with other avenues of investment such as invest-\nment in new projects, development of new products, acquisitions, and takeovers.\n\nFor a company facing a threat of hostile takeover, share buy back would help its promoters to\nincrease their proportional shareholding in the company.\n\nA company may think of altering its capital structure if its equity is disproportionately large. Buy\nback may help the company to achieve a target capital structure.\n\nA panic driven fall in share prices can be arrested through buy back of shares.\n\nA company intending to improve market quotes of its scrips may choose buy back rather than pay\nhigher dividends as buy back signals management confidence. Moreover, buy back provides an exit\nroute to investors in case of illiquid scrips.\n\nBuy back is a tool to increase the wealth of the shareholders. With share buy back, a reduction in the\nfloating stock of the company takes place, which improves the earnings per share (EPS) which, in turn,\nincreases the market price of the share. At high market prices, a company can come out with new issues\nat a premium and thereby lower its cost of capital.\n\nMethods of Share Buy Back Section 77A of the Companies Act, 1956 contains the basic framework for\ncompanies to buy back its own securities. Section 7A (5) provides the methods of buy back . The buy-back\nunder sub-section (1) may be:\n\na. from the existing security holders on a proportionate basis; or\n\nb. from the open market; or\n\nc. from odd lots, that is to say, where the lot of securities of a public company, whose shares are\nlisted on a recognized stock exchange, is smaller than such marketable lot, as may be specified by\nthe stock exchange; or\n\nd. by purchasing the securities issued to employees of the company pursuant to a scheme of stock\noption or sweat equity.\n\nThe SEBI (Buy back of Securities) Regulations, 1998 contains the procedure for buy back. Share buy\nback can be done in two ways: through a tender offer or through an open market repurchase. The tender\noffer to shareholders can be either at the market price or at a premium to the market. In going for a tender\noffer route, a company can adopt a fixed price tender or go for an auction. Auctions are generally held\nwhen a company is under a takeover threat and is interested in buying back a large number of shares at\nthe lowest possible price.\n\nThe open market repurchase route is used when the desired number of shares to be bought back is\nrelatively small. Buy back from the open market can be either through the book building process or by\ndirect purchase on the stock exchange. Most companies prefer the open market purchase route.\n\nCompanies (Amendment) Ordinance, 1998 The buy back of shares was prohibited in India until\nOctober 31, 1998. Indian companies were permitted to buy back their own shares by the Companies\n(Amendment) Ordinance, 1998. The ordinance inserted two new sections (77A and 77B) in the Companies\nAct, 1956 which laid down the provisions and restrictions relating to buy back of shares, Under the new\nprovision, a company may buy back its own shares or other specified securities from its free reserves,\nsecurities premium account, or the proceeds of an earlier issue other than a fresh issue of shares made\nspecifically for buy back purpose.\nBuy back is permitted only when the company satisfies the following conditions:\n\n* Itis authorized by its articles.\n+ Asspecial resolution has been passed in the general meeting of the company authorizing the buy back.\n\n+ The buy back does not exceed 25 per cent of the paid-up capital and free reserves of the company.\n+ The debt equity (including free reserves) ratio is not more than 2:1 after such buy back.\n\n+ All shares and other specified securities are fully paid-up.\n\n* The buy back is in accordance with the SEBI regulations framed for the purpose.\n\nIt is further stipulated that a company that has defaulted on repayment of deposit, term loan, redemp-\ntion of debenture/preference shares and so on, will not be permitted to buy back shares. Buy back of\nshares through subsidiary companies or investment companies is also prohibited.\n\nFollowing the promulgation of the Companies (Amendment) Ordinance, the SEBI issued regulations\non the buy back of shares by listed companies on November 10, 1998. The facility of buy back of secu-\nrities by listed companies was introduced to increase liquidity in securities and to enable companies to\nenhance the shareholders\u2019 wealth.\n\nThe SEBI has a stipulated time limit to ensure the completion of the buy back process, speedily. If\nshares are bought back through stock exchanges, an offer for buy back should not remain open for more\nthan 30 days. The verification of shares received in the buy back has to be completed within 15 days of the\nclosure of the offer. The payments for accepted securities has to be made within 7 days of the completion\nof verification and bought-back shares have to be extinguished within 7 days of the date of the payment.\n\nThe SEBI relaxed buy back norms in 2001. Companies can now buy back shares upto 10 per cent\nof the equity capital and free reserves just by a board resolution, without seeking shareholders\u2019 approval.\nThe moratorium on the fresh issue of shares after a buy back programme was reduced to 6 months from\nthe earlier 24 months. On October 25, 2001, the SEBI relaxed the yearly creeping acquisition limit by pro-\nmoters to 5 per cent from 10 per cent a year without the SEBI approval. On October 27, 2008, the SEBI\nallowed promoters to buy upto 75 per cent in listed companies through the creeping acquisition route-5\nper cent a year without the SEBI approval.\n\nThese relaxed norms led to a spurt in buy back activity. The biggest buy back earmarked in 2001\nwas that of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL)\u2014to the tune of 71,100 crore at %353 per share. The\nother large buy backs were Bajaj Auto (%720 crore) followed by Raymonds (\u00ae486 crore), GE Shipping\n(@ 150 crore), and Indian Rayon (\u00ae143 crore).\n\nMost blue chip companies such as Cadburys, Reckitt Benckiser, Philips, and others offered to buy\nback shares at more than a 25 per cent premium to market price. This move was on account of various\nreasons. One of the reasons cited is that these MNCs were forced to go public by the government in\nthe late 1970s. Now there were no restrictions or obligations for them to remain listed on the domestic\nexchanges. Another reason cited is that with stringent listing requirements\u2014MNCs found it both dif-\nficult and expensive to adhere to these requirements. These delistings were done as a part of a cost-\ncutting exercise and not for shutting down of the Indian operations. Moreover, the centre has been\nliberalizing foreign direct investment (FDI) norms since the early 1990s. MNCs can set up 100 per\ncent subsidiaries or increase the parent\u2019s stake in their existing subsidiaries, associates, or affiliates\nby way of creeping acquisition, or an open offer. These delistings are a loss to the domestic investors\nwho not only part with the shares at a depressed price but are also deprived from participating in the\nfuture growth of these companies. The exit of these companies took place when there was dearth of\ngood quality paper. Moreover, it had an adverse impact on market capitalization, liquidity, as well as\nvolumes at the exchanges.\n\nMost of the buy backs by cash-rich corporates were at cheap prices, leaving minority sharehold-\ners stranded. The price of the share buy backs were based on prices of the previous six months and\nduring that time, share prices were quite low. Many of the promoters took advantage of low prices to\nhike their stake.\n\nIn buy-back regulations the regulator found that there were instances where companies were\nannouncing a buy-back at a certain price and they were not even using 25 per cent of what was allot-\nted for buy-back. Moreover, some companies are trying to use the buy-back regulations not to reward\nshareholders but to manipulate the share price. Hence, SEBI is now coming out with a new buy-back\nregulation and has already come out with a discussion paper on share buy-back.\n\n1. Minimum buy back quantity\n1.1 Pursuant to the order of the Securities Appellate Tribunal dated 26.09.2008 in the matter of\nSasken Communications Limited and after observing instances of companies not buying a sin-\ngle share or buying negligible quantity after buy-back announcement, the Merchant Bankers\nare being advised to ensure that a minimum of 25 per cent of maximum buy-back proposed/\ndisclosed and bought back.\n\nw\n\n>\n\nLal\n\n6.\n\n7.\n\nCompanies on an average have bought back 49.96 per cent of the maximum quantity pro-\nposed for buyback in the financial years 2009-10 and 2010-11 after the aforesaid prescription.\nTaking the above into consideration, it is proposed to mandate 50 per cent as the minimum.\nquantity.\n\nMaximum period to complete the buy back\n\nIt is proposed that companies complete the buy back in 3 months. To ensure that only serious\n\ncompanies launch the buyback program, it is further proposed that these companies be mandated\n\nto put 25 per cent of the maximum amount proposed for buy back in an escrow account.\n\n. Post buy back obligations\n\nIt is proposed that listed companies coming out with buyback programs may not be allowed to\nraise further capital for a period of two years.\n\nDisincentive for not completing the buyback program successfully\n\nIn order to ensure that the companies do not launch buyback programs for stabilizing the share\nprice, it is proposed that companies who are not able to buy back 100 per cent of the proposed\namount (or the proposed maximum number of shares) may not be allowed to come with another\nbuyback for a period of atleast one year irrespective of the mode of approval for buy back.\n\nRationalization of ongoing disclosure requirements\nThe following are proposed:\n\ni. The company shall disclose the number of shares purchased and the amount utilized to the\nexchanges on daily basis.\n\nii, The company shall disclose the following details regarding the buyback offer to the exchanges\non monthly basis and also include the same while publishing quarterly and annual results:\n\na. Total number of shares proposed to be bought back in the offer.\n\nb. Cumulative number of shares bought back till the end of previous reporting period and\namount utilized for the same.\n\nc. Number of shares bought back during the current reporting period and amount utilized\nfor the same.\n\nd. Cumulative number of shares bought back till the end of the current reporting period and\n\namount utilized for the same (b+c).\n\n. Number of shares yet to be bought back and amount yet to be utilized.\n\nCumulative number of shares extinguished and destroyed till the end of previous\n\nreporting period.\n\ng. Number of shares extinguished and destroyed during the current reporting period\n\nh. Cumulative number of shares extinguished and destroyed till the end of the current\nreporting period (f+g).\n\nme\n\niii.\n\nIt is felt that the current requirement of publishing the disclosures in the news papers on fort-\nnightly basis and every time an additional 5 per cent of maximum shares on offer were bought\nback only adds to the cost of buyback program. In view of the above and in view of the same\nbeing included as part of quarterly financial results which are published, it is proposed to do\naway with the requirement of fortnightly publication. iv. In addition, the companies have to\ndisclose on a monthly basis why the proportionate quantity was not bought during the month,\nwherever applicable.\n\nLimit for open market method\nIt is proposed that buy-back of 15 per cent or more of (paid up capital + free reserves) must be\nonly by way of a tender offer method.\n\nProcedure for buy-back of physical shares (odd lot) in Open Market Purchase Method\nThe following changes are proposed:\n\ni. Creation of separate window in trading system for buying physical shares. This window will\nremain open only during the buy-back program.\n\nii, Sharcholders holding 500 shares or less in physical form will be eligible to tender their shares\nin this window (It may be noted that the trading in Odd Lot Segment on the exchange is also\nlimited to 500 shares).\n\nSuch shareholders may be permitted to tender shares to a broker designated for the pur-\npose by the company, without the need to open a trading account or strict compliance\nwith KYC norms.\n\niii.\n\nHowever, the requirement of PAN/Aadhar may be made mandatory for such shareholders\nholding shares in the physical form.\niv. The shareholder can tender the shares to the designated broker directly or to the company, who\ncan then put the transaction through the designated broker.\n\nv. Buy-back price for such shareholders may be Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) of the\nshares bought (in the normal segment) during the calendar week in which such shares were\nreceived by the broker. In case no shares were bought back in the normal market during the\naforesaid week, the last week when the company has bought may be considered.\n\nvi. The Public Announcement shall contain information mentioned above.\n\n8. Removal of restriction on issuance of shares pursuant to Employee Stock Option (ESOP)\nschemes during the buy-back offer\nIt is proposed that the issuance of shares pursuant to obligations arising out of Employee Stock\nOption schemes may be allowed during the buy-back period subject to the following:\n\ni. The shares are not allotted to directors and key managerial personnel of the company.\n\nii. There is no acceleration in the vesting period.\n\n9. Extinguishment of shares in buyback process\n\nThe following is proposed regarding extinguishment of shares in open market purchase method\n\nof buyback:\n\ni, The companies shall extinguish/destroy shares bought back during the month, on or before\nfifteenth day of the succeeding month subject to the companies destroying the bought back\nshares in the last month within seven days of the completion of the offer.\n\nii, As detailed disclosure regarding extinguishment and destruction of shares have been proposed\nabove, the existing requirement of furnishing a separate certificate by the company to SEBI in\nthis regard may be done away with.\n\n10. Dealing in shares or other specified securities in the stock exchange during the period of\nbuy back\n\nSection 19(1 )(e) of SEBI(Buy back of Securities) regulations, 1998 reads as under:\n\n\u201cThe company shall ensure that the promoter or the person shall not deal in the shares or other\nspecified securities of the company in the stock exchange during the period the buy-back offer\nis open.\u201d\n\nIt is proposed to extend this restriction to dealing in the securities of the company in off\nmarket as well.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "MARKET MAKING SYSTEM\n\nThe extensive reforms in the last decade have transformed the operations of the securities market. Trans-\naction costs have reduced and transparency has increased with the introduction of electronic trading and\norder-matching system at all stock exchanges. However, there are still a large number of shares that are\nnot actively traded despite the fact that many of them have some intrinsic value.\n\nTo provide liquidity to the illiquid scrips, market makers are required who will continuously provide two\nway quotes. A market maker puts up a buy quote and a sell quote simultaneously. Thus, he creates a market\nfor a scrip wherein it can be easily bought and sold. This process is called market making mechanism. For\nrendering these services, the market maker is allowed to buy and sell at a different rate, with the differential\nrate ranging from 3 per cent to 10 per cent. This difference is his income for providing these services.\n\nMarket making was much in use during the floor-based trading era when jobbers used to play the role\nof market makers. However, market making is almost absent in the screen-based trading era. The major\nhindrances to its development are the non-availability of back-finances to brokers, lack of incentives such\nas authority to route trades through market makers, and lack of market depth. The market making scheme\nhas been introduced in the derivatives segment also where it has not yielded the expected results.\n\nInternationally, the market making concept is highly advanced and a highly specialized job, with select\nfirms specializing in it. The market making responsibility is taken up by firms who have specialized in\nthis activity on the basis of the size of the companies and select industries. Some market makers cater\nto particular regions of the country or purely to institutional clients. The market making activity is very\nactive in the US markets, especially in NASDAQ. Among the top NASDAQ-listed companies, Oracle\nhas as many as 101 active market makers followed by Cisco systems with 99, Dell Computer with 90,\nApplied Materials with 88, Intel with 86, and Microsoft with 82. Moreover, Indian stocks such as Sify, with\n13 market makers, are clocking an average daily volume of around 50,000 to 60,000 trades, and Rediff,\nwith 9 market makers, manages 4,000 to 5,000 trades. NASDAQ has around 4,730 companies listed, of\nwhich over 90 per cent manage to trade on any given day. This volume of trading is due to active market\nmakers. However, in the BSE, out of 5,700 listed companies, hardly 1,500 manage to trade on a given\nday.\n\nIn India, a systematic and organized form of market making was initiated by the OTCEI. At the OTCEI,\nmarket making is a compulsory activity and the sponsor has to act as a market maker for at least three\nyears. At the regional stock exchanges, some brokers tried to give two-way quotes to revive some illiquid\nscrips, but they could not be successful.\n\nTo facilitate the market making system on Indian stock exchanges, the SEBI set up a committee on market\n\nmaking under the chairmanship of G. P. Gupta (Chairman, IDBI) to study various facets of market mak-\ning, including the merits and demerits of the two trading systems\u2014the order driven system and quote driven\nsystem. The committee was of the view that shares could be classified into two categories\u2014liquid and illiq-\nuid\u2014 and market making facility should be provided for illiquid shares. The committee stressed the obliga-\ntion of market makers to offer continuous two-way quotes which would force them to carry an inventory\nof stocks. However, this would require a large commitment of capital and lead to an increased exposure to\nmarket risks. It is expected that the stock lending scheme and margin trading would give an impetus to market\nmaking.\nIn April, 2010, SEBI put in a framework for setting up of new exchange or separate platform of exist-\ning stock exchange having nationwide terminals for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Market\nmaking has been made mandatory in respect of all scrips listed and traded on SME exchange. The fol-\nlowing guidelines shall be applicable to the Market Makers on the stock exchanges and SME exchange:\n",

The volumes have risen\na hundred fold in respect of many shares.

The introduction of market making facility for such shares could be a possible means to infuse\nliquidity in such shares. The guidelines for market maker as provided below.\n\nOver the past several years the securities market has witnessed a sea change. The market has become\nmore modern in terms of infrastructure, adoption of best international practices and introduction of com-\npetition. With the maturity of the regulatory framework and increased market surveillance, the market\nhas also become safer and investor is better protected. The extensive reforms introduced by SEBI over the\nlast few years have enhanced the integrity, transparency and efficiency of the operations of the securities\nmarket.

                        "extracted-text": "Stock Lending and Borrowing (SLB)\n\nSecurities Lending and Borrowing scheme is a facility for lending and borrowing of shares to enable\ninvestors to honour trades involving short-selling. The stock lending and borrowing scheme is essentially\na facility for short sellers. A short seller is a person who sells shares which he does not own/possess. With\nthe ban on badla, short sellers were often left with uncovered positions when the prices of scrips moved\nagainst expectations. This had to be met through auctions, which led to an increase in the loss of short\nsellers, as auction prices were higher than the last traded prices. Short selling enables the seller to hedge\nthe risk of a long position in the same security or a related security. It enhances market efficiency through\nprice discovery, improves liquidity in the secondary market and reduces volatility in market returns. How-\never, it may also lead to a downward trend in prices, thus, destabilizing the market.\n\nThe stock lending and borrowing scheme enables a short seller to minimize his losses by borrowing\nshares at the time of settlement. As scrips are delivered at the time of settlement, the number of scrips\nauctioned reduces considerably.\n\nThe stock-lending scheme enables a seller to borrow shares from a SEBI-registered intermediary\nand deliver them to a buyer against outstanding commitments. When the price declines, he replaces the\nborrowed shares by buying from the market. The borrower of the securities pays the lender interest on\nthe value of the securities borrowed. The borrowers of securities are usually brokers, speculators, market\nmakers, custodian banks, clearing corporations, and finance companies. The lenders are mutual funds,\ninsurance companies, custodian banks, finance companies, brokers, and high net worth individuals.\n\nBroad Framework for Short Selling and Securities Lending and Borrowing\n\nPursuant to the recommendations of the Secondary Market Advisory Committee (SMAC) of SEBI, it was\ndecided to permit all classes of investors to short sell. In order to provide a mechanism for borrowing\nof securities to enable settlement of securities sold short, it has also been decided to put in place a full-\nfledged Securities Lending and Borrowing (SLB) scheme for all market participants in the Indian securi-\nties market under the over-all framework of \u201cSecurities Lending Scheme, 1997\u201d of SEBI. The Securities\nLending Scheme was notified by SEBI on February 06, 1997. The guidelines for this facility of short\nselling and framework for securities lending and borrowing are specified in Annexure | and 2.\n\nTo enable the mechanism of short selling, the facility of SLB scheme, was put in place for all market\nparticipants, under the overall framework of \u201cSecurities Lending Scheme, 1997\u201d of SEBI.\n\nAnnexure 1 - Broad framework for short selling\n\n1. \u201cShort selling\u201d shall be defined as selling a stock which the seller does not own at the time of\ntrade.\n\n2. All classes of investors, viz., retail and institutional investors, shall be permitted to short sell.\n\n3. Naked short selling shall not be permitted in the Indian securities market and accordingly, all\ninvestors would be required to mandatorily honour their obligation of delivering the securities\nat the time of settlement.\n\nNo institutional investor shall be allowed to do day trading, i.c., square-off their transactions\nintra-day. In other words, all transactions would be grossed for institutional investors at the cus-\ntodians\u2019 level and the institutions would be required to fulfill their obligations on a gross basis.\nThe custodians, however, would continue to settle their deliveries on a net basis with the stock\nexchanges.\n\nThe stock exchanges shall frame necessary uniform deterrent provisions and take appropriate\naction against the brokers for failure to deliver securities at the time of settlement which shall\nact as a sufficient deterrent against failure to deliver.\n\nA scheme for SLB shall be put in place to provide the necessary impetus to short sell. The\nintroduction of a full-fledged securities lending and borrowing scheme shall be simultaneous\nwith the introduction of short selling by institutional investors.\n\nThe securities traded in F&O segment shall be eligible for short selling. SEBI may review the\nlist of stocks that are eligible for short selling transactions from time to time.\n\nThe institutional investors shall disclose upfront at the time of placement of order whether the\ntransaction is a short sale. However, retail investors would be permitted to make a similar dis-\nclosure by the end of the trading hours on the transaction day.\n\nThe brokers shall be mandated to collect the details on scrip-wise short sell positions, col-\nlate the data and upload it to the stock exchanges before the commencement of trading on\nthe following trading day. The stock exchanges shall then consolidate such information and\ndisseminate the same on their websites for the information of the public on a weekly basis.\nThe frequency of such disclosure may be reviewed from time to time with the approval of\nSEBI.\n\nAnnexure 2 - Broad framework for Securities Lending and Borrowing\n\nlL.\n\n. The Authorised Intermediary (Als) shall ent\n\nThe stock exchanges shall put in place, a full-fledged SLB scheme, within the overall frame-\nwork of \u201cSecurities Lending Scheme, 1997\u201d (the scheme), that is open for all market partici-\npants in the Indian securities market.\n\n.. To begin with, the SLB shall be operated through clearing corporation/clearing house of stock\n\nexchanges having nation-wide terminals who will be registered as Approved Intermediaries\n(Als) under the SLS, 1997,\n\n. The SLB shall take place on an automated, screen based, order-matching platform which will\n\nbe provided by the Als. This platform shall be independent of the other trading platforms.\n\n}. In addition to the scrips on which derivatives contracts are available, scrips that fulfill the fol-\n\nlowing criteria shall be considered eligible for SLB:\n\na. Scrip classified as \u2018Group I security\u201d\n\nb. Market Wide Position Limit (MWPL) of the scrip, shall not be less than 7100 crores; and\n\n. average monthly trading turnover in the scrip in the cash market shall not be less than 7100\ncrores in the previous six months.\n\n. Stock exchanges shall review the scrips eligible for SLB on a half-yearly basis. In the event a\n\nscrip fails to meet the eligibility criteria, no new SLB transaction shall be allowed in the scrip\nfrom the next trading day. However, the existing contracts in such scrips shall be allowed to\ncontinue till expiry.\n\n. All categories of investors including retail, institutional, etc., will be permitted to borrow and\n\nlend securities. The borrowers and lenders shall access the platform for lending/borrowing set\nup by the Als through the Clearing Members (CMs) (including banks and custodians) who are\nauthorized by the Als in this regard.\n\ninto an agreement with CMs for the purpose of\nfacilitating lending and borrowing of securities. The agreement shall specify the rights, respon-\nsibilities and obligations of the parties to the agreement. The agreement shall include the basic\nconditions for lending and borrowing of securities as prescribed under SLB framework. Fur-\nther, the exact role of Als/CMs vis-a-vis the clients shall be laid down in the agreement. Als\nshall ensure that there shall not be any direct agreement between the lender and the borrower.\nIn addition to that, Als may also include suitable conditions in the agreement to have proper\nexecution, risk management and settlement of lending and borrowing transactions with clear-\ning member and client. The Als shall frame a rights and obligations document laying down the\nrights and obligation of CMs and clients for the purpose of lending and borrowing of securities.\nThe rights and obligation document shall be mandatory and binding on the CMs and the clients\nfor executing trade in the SLB framework.\n\n20.\n21.\n\nBp\n\n.. The Als shall allot a unique ID to each client which shall be mapped to the Permanent Account\n\nNumber (PAN) of the respective clients. The Als shall put in place appropriate systemic safe-\nguards to ensure that a client is not able to obtain multiple client IDs.\n\n). The tenure of contracts in SLB may be upto a maximum period of 12 months. The approved\n\nintermediary (Clearing Corporation/Clearing House) shall have the flexibility to decide the\ntenure (maximum period of 12 months).\n\n). The settlement cycle for SLB transactions shall be on T+1 basis. The settlement of lending and\n\nborrowing transactions shall be independent of normal market settlement.\n\n. The settlement of the lending and borrowing transactions shall be done on a gross basis at the\n\nlevel of the clients, i.e., no netting of transactions at any level will be permitted.\n\n. Als would frame suitable risk management systems to guarantee delivery of securities to bor-\n\nrower and return of securities to the lender. In the case of lender failing to deliver securities\nto the AI or borrower failing to return securities to the Al, the AI shall conduct an auction for\nobtaining securities. In the event of exceptional circumstances resulting in non-availability of\nsecurities in auction, such transactions would be financially closed-out at appropriate rates,\nwhich may be more than the rates applicable for the normal close-out of transactions, so as to\nact as a sufficient deterrent against failure to deliver securities.\n\n. Position limits at the level of market, CM and client shall be decided from time to time by Als in\n\nconsultation with SEBI. To begin with (a) the market\u2014 wide position limits for SLB transactions\nshall be 10% of the free-float capital of the company in terms of number of shares (b) No clear-\ning member shall have open position of more than 10% of the market-wide position limits or\n250 crore (base value), whichever is lower (c) For all institutional investors , the position limits\nshall be the same as of a clearing member (d) The client level position limits shall be not more\nthan 1% of the market-wide position limits,\n\n.. There shall be no lending/borrowing activity during the periods of corporate action in the secu-\n\nrity and shall be disclosed by AI to the market.\n\n. Details of treatment of corporate actions during the tenure, such as dividend, stock split etc., are\n\nspecified as below:\n\na. Dividend: The dividend amount would be worked out and recovered from the borrower on\nthe book closure/ record date and passed on to the lender.\n\nb. Stock split: The positions of the borrower would be proportionately adjusted so that the\nlender receives the revised quantity of shares.\n\n\u00a2. Other corporate actions such as bonus/merger/amalgamation/open offer, etc.: The trans-\nactions would be foreclosed from the day prior to the ex-date. The lending fee would be\nrecovered on a prorata basis from the lender and returned to the borrower.\n\n. Any borrowing/lending and return of securities would not amount to purchase/disposal/transfer\n\nof the same for the purpose of compliance with the extant FDI/FII limits and the norms regarding\nacquisition of shares/disclosure requirements specified under the various regulations of SEBI.\n\n. Adequate systems shall be put in place by the stock exchanges/depositories to distinguish the\n\nSLB transactions from the normal market transactions in the demat system.\n\n. Als shall provide suitable arbitration mechanism for settling the disputes arising out of the SLB\n\ntransactions executed on the platform provided by them.\n\n). Als shall disseminate in public domain, the details of SLB transactions executed on the plat-\n\nform provided by them and the outstanding positions on a weekly basis. The frequency of such\n\ndisclosure may be reviewed from time to time with the approval of SEBI.\n\nThe time for SLB session may be extended to the normal trade timings of 9:15 am to 3:30 pm.\n\nRisk Management\n\na. With regard to risk management in SLB, it is advised that common risk management prac-\ntices shall be followed by stock exchanges for SLB. It is reiterated that the exchanges\nshould ensure that the risk management framework strikes a balance between ensuring\ncommercial viability of SLB transactions and ensuring adequate and proper risk manage-\nment. Exchanges should satisfy themselves regarding the adequacy of the risk manage-\nment system.\n\nb. The collateral to be accepted for meeting margin obligations related to SLB transactions\nshall be in the same form as applicable in the cash market.\n\n. The lender/borrower shall be provided with a facility for early recall/repayment of shares.\n. In case the borrower fails to mect the margin obligations, the AI shall obtain securities and\n\nsquare off the position of such defaulting borrower, failing which there shall be a financial\nclose-out.\n\n24. In case lender recalls the securities anytime before completion of the contract, the AI on a\nbest effort basis shall try to borrow the security for the balance period and pass it onward\nto the lender. The AI will collect the lending fee from the lender who has sought early\nrecall.\n\n25. In case of early recall by the lender, the original contract between the lender and the AI will\nexist till the contract with the new lender for the balance period is executed and the securities\nreturned to the original lender.\n\n26. In case of early repayment of securities by the borrower, the margins shall be released imme-\ndiately on the securities being returned by the borrower to the AI. The AI shall on a best effort\nbasis, try to onward lend the securities and the income arising out of the same shall be passed\non to the borrower making the early repayment of securities.\n\n27. In case Al is unable to find a new borrower for the balance period, the original borrower will\nhave to forego lending fee for the balance period.\n\n28. Incase of early recall by lender or early repayment of securities by borrower, the lending fee for\nthe balance period shall be at a market determined rate.\n\nOperationalisation of Short Selling and Securities Lending and Borrowing\n\nThe broad framework for short selling by institutional investors and a full-fledged securities lending and\nborrowing scheme for all market participants were operationalized with effect from April 21, 2008.\n\nIntroduction of Roll-over Facility\n\n1 Any lender or borrower who wishes to extend an existing lent or borrow position shall be per-\nmitted to roll-over such positions, i.e., a lender who is due to receive securities in the pay out of\nan SLB session, may extend the period of lending. Similarly, a borrower who has to return bor-\nrowed securities in the pay-in of an SLB session, may, through the same SLB session, extend\nthe period of borrowing. The roll-over shall be conducted as part of the SLB session.\n\n2 Roll-over shall not permit netting of counter positions, ic., netting between the \u2018borrowed\u2019 and\n\u2018lent\u2019 positions of a client.\n\n3 Roll-over shall be available for a period of 3 months, i.c., the original contract plus 2 roll-over\ncontracts.\n\nIntroduction of Liquid Index Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) under the SLB scheme\n1 Liquid Index ETFs shall be eligible for trading in the SLB segment.\n2 For the purposes of this circular, an Index ETF shall be deemed \u2018liquid\u2019 provided the Index ETF\nhas traded on at least 80% of the days over the past 6 months and its impact cost over the past\n6 months is less than or equal to 1%,\n3 Positions limits for SLB in respect of ETFs shall be based on the assets under management of\nthe respective ETE.\n\nAdvantages of SLB\n\nStock lending and borrowing (SLB) provides an avenue for institutional investors such as banks, mutual\nfunds, financial institutions and insurance companies to earn income by lending their idle stock in the\nmarket. The lender of the stock charges interest for lending the stock. The rate of interest charged by\nthe lender is determined by various factors such as liquidity of the scrip, quality of management, size of\nthe underlying company and the risk involved in lending the stock. The lender does not cease to be the\nowner of the stock and gets all beneficial rights such as dividend, rights or bonus shares in respect of the\nstock lent. The borrower, however, has the legal title of the borrowed securities and is entitled to deal with\nand dispose of securities in any manner he deems fit.\n\nStock lending provides an avenue for institutional investors such as banks, mutual funds, financial\ninstitutions, and insurance companies to earn income by lending their idle stock in the market.\n\nStock lending increases the liquidity of stocks as more and more players are able to sell or take posi-\ntions. It keeps a bull market in check. Stock lending through the clearing house can help carry forward\nshort sales and check volatility in the share prices at the time of settlement. It facilitates timely settlement\nand avoids delivery failures.\n\nStock lending aids in the development of the derivatives markets. It enables investors to undertake\narbitrage activities either against derivative trades or convertibles.\n\nSLB increases the liquidity of stocks as more and more players are able to sell or take positions. It keeps a\nbull market in check. Stock lending through the clearing house can help carry forward short sales and check\n\n\nvolatility in the share prices at the time of settlement. It facilitates timely settlement and avoids delivery\nfailures.\n\nSLB aids in the development of the derivatives markets. This scheme is largely used by the insti-\ntutional investors while writing complex option contracts. It enables investors to undertake arbitrage\nactivities either against the derivative trades or the convertibles.\n\nThe Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) exempted stock lending from capital gains, making it even\nmore attractive. With the depository system in operation and the process of dematerialization almost com-\nplete, the risk involved (the chance of not getting the same clean stock) in stock lending is substantially\nreduced. It also does not attract STT.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Rolling Settlement\n\nThe dematerialization of shares and introduction of settlements in demat form changed the face of the\nIndian stock markets. The next major reform in the new millennium affecting the stock markets was the\nintroduction of rolling settlement.\n\nThis concept is not new to the Indian stock market. The OTCEI was the first exchange to introduce\nrolling settlement when it started operations in 1992. Rolling settlement was not a success for the OTCEI\nas there was no margin trading facility for borrowing funds or shares.\n\nRolling settlement was introduced by the SEBI for the first time in January 2000 in selected scrips. Ini-\ntially, 10 scrips were brought under rolling settlement. Subsequently, on March 8, 2000, 153 more scrips\nwere introduced. Rolling settlement was introduced in the form of T+5 settlement system where \u2018T\u2019 is\nthe trade date and \u2018S\u2019 is the number of business days after the trade date on which delivery of securities\nand cash payments are due for settlement. In other words, T+5 means that all open positions at the end\nof trading date result in delivery and payment five working days later. If trading takes place on Thursday,\nit will be settled the following Thursday, so on and so forth. This cycle would be rolling and hence there\nwould be a set of transactions for delivery every day. Thus, rolling settlement means converting the mar-\nket into a cash market, since each day\u2019s transactions are settled in full.\n\nTable 8.4 illustrates Weekly Settlement and Rolling Settlement and Table 8.5 shows difference between\nweekly settlement and rolling settlement.\n\nRolling settlement system replaced the badla system from July 2, 2001. When 215 scrips were brought\nunder the rolling system, bringing the total to 414 scrips. By January 2, 2002, all scrips were brought under\nthe compulsory rolling mode. Internationally, most developed countries follow a T+3 cycle and are aim-\ning to move to a T+1 cycle (next day settlement) or a T+0 cycle where trades are settled on the day they\nare executed (same evening settlement). This system of T+0 is prevalent in Switzerland and volumes are\nphenomenal when compared to the T+3 system. Indian stock markets moved to the T+3 system from April\n2002, in line with the recommendations of the \u2018Group of Thirty\u2019 which suggested it as the minimum inter-\nnational standard.\n\nOn the advice of the SEBI, stock exchanges levy an additional charge to discourage late confirmations\nby the custodians and have provided a system for handling shortages of funds and securities in an expedi-\ntious manner to adhere to the schedule for payment.\n\nThe stock brokers are required to adhere to the following schedule in the T +2 rolling settlement.\n\nIn a T+2 settlement, confirmation and determination of obligation takes place on a T+1 basis, while\npay-in and pay-out of funds and securities happens on the second day of trading. Shorter settlement cycles\nlower the trading costs for market participants and reduce the risk of counter-party failure. The SEBI now\naims for aT +1 cycle. Ina T+1 settlement, as soon as an investor buys shares, the broker's trading termi-\nnal will give the buy order, the system will check the investor\u2019s bank account and debit funds and in turn,\ndeposit shares in his demat account within a few seconds.\n\nTABLE 8.4 \u2014 Weekly Settlement and Rolling Settlement\n\nDate Weekly Settlement T+5 Rolling Settlement\n1 Buy 200 Shares Buy 200 Shares\n2 Sell 100 Shares Sell 10 Shares\n6 Pay for 200 Shares and get the Shares\n7 Deliver 100 Shares and Get Paid for Them\n14 Pay the Net Price for 100 Shares\n15 Get 100 Shares\n\nSource: Shah, Ajay and Susan Thomas, \u2018Developing the Indian Capital Market\u2019 in J.

                        "extracted-text": "Advantages of Rolling Settlement\n\nThe basic advantage of rolling system over the badla system is its simplicity. The badla system was\nnon-transparent and unregulated and the investors\u2019 exposure to risk and fraud was very high. The\ninvestor had to keep track of different stocks as they had different settlement systems. With rolling\nsettlement, the investor has to merely keep track of the day of purchase/sale of scrips as all the scrips\nare settled in the same format on all trading screens.\n\nThis system eliminates arbitrage opportunities in scrips.\n\nIt improves the price discovery process as the settlement process is standardized and the participants\ncan focus more on market outcomes.\n\nThis improvement in price discovery would lead to a single, well-defined price that can be used for\ninformation processing by different economic agents.\n\nIt reduces settlement risk and narrows the bid-ask spreads (difference between the bid and offer\nprices) due to its transparent nature.\n\nIt encourages wider participation as institutional investors forbidden from doing badla or netting\ntrades within a settlement can now take advantage of this system as it shortens delay in settlement\nof transactions.\n\nIt eliminates fluctuations of prices which take place around settlement dates. With the setting up of\nclearing corporations, rolling settlement reduces the working capital requirements of brokerage firms.\nAs it reduces price manipulation and arbitrage, it helps in reducing volatility and turbulence in the\nmarkets.\n\nFinally, retail investors benefit as it shortens the delays for converting securities into cash and\nvice versa.\n\nIt is perceived that rolling settlement kills liquidity as it reduces speculation and arbitrage. This\nreduction in liquidity may be a short-term feature as investors and brokers need time to adjust to this new\nsystem and to digest the fact that they will not get any leverage. In rolling settlement, one cannot short\nsell a scrip which creates an impact on liquidity.\n\nIn the Indian stock markets, six to seven stocks account for nearly 70 per cent of the volume of\ntrading. When these heavily traded forward stocks are covered under rolling settlement, liquidity is\nbound to reduce for some time. Moreover, day trading has emerged and will grow in a short span of\ntime. Day traders are people who trade during the day and close all their positions at the end of the\ntrading day. They take advantage of the day time movements of scrip prices and indices by directly\nexecuting orders, resulting in increased liquidity. Besides day traders, FIIs are more comfortable with\nthe rolling settlement system and it is expected that money will be pumped into the Indian stock mar-\nkets resulting in high liquidity.\n\nAccording to a SEBI study titled \u2018Cost-Benefit Analysis of Contracting, Trading, Clearance and Set-\ntlement in Equities to T+1, the cost-benefit ratio of migrating to T+1 works to 0.85. This means for\nevery likely expense of 0.85 paise, there will be a benefit of Re 1 and the investors will be the biggest\nbeneficiaries as they will be able to save in the form of interest on margin money.\n\nThe prerequisites for the success of the rolling system\u2014margin trading, continuous net settlement,\ndepository, futures and options, and a strong banking system with electronic fund transfer facility\u2014are\nnow in place. These will help in improving the efficiency and prospects of success of this system. It is\nsuperior technology and banking infrastructure such as electronic fund transfers which will enable Indian\nmarkets to move to the T+ 1 or T+0 settlement system.\n\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Conclusion\n\nStock markets moved to the T+2 system from April 1, 2003. The SEBI intends to move to T+1.\nThe move towards T+ 1 is part of the capital market reforms initiated by the SEBI, especially after\nthe stock market scams. The rolling settlement system of share transactions prevents speculations in\nbetween the settlement periods. Movement to the T+1 system, requires real time gross settlement\n(RTGS) in banking transactions. RTGS would ensure that banking transactions are settled within a\nday\u2019s time. This would, in turn, facilitate share transactions to be settled within a day. For moving over\nto the T+1 system, the SEBI has implemented a straight through processing (STP) system to prevent\ndelays in share transfer from the buyer to the seller. The STP system reduces the time gap between\ntrading and settlement. It leads to greater transparency and reduction in counter-party risk. The STP\nsystem leads to an automatic debit or credit in the demat account and bank account of traders. The\n\nBox 8.4 Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS)\n\nThe RTGS system ensures transfer of funds on a real time and on a one-to-one basis (i.e., between a sender and a beneficiary) in an electronic\nmode. The system leads to reduced settlement and systemic risks, especially in high-value inter-bank transactions. The RBI launched RTGS\non March 26, 2004. In RTGS, payments are settled transaction by transaction and settlement of funds is final, irrevocable and done in real.\ntime. Moreover, funds settled can be used immediately. Under the RTGS system, inter-bank transactions, customer-based inter-bank trans-\nactions and net-clearing transactions of both high value and retail payments can be settled. Itis a fully secured system which uses digital\nsignatures and public-key encryption for safe and secure message transmission, It is beginning to enable transfer of funds in a cheque-less\nenvironment.\n\nThe threshold limit for high value transactions is one lakh and below this limit low-value transactions take place. Clearing and\nsettlement in the RTGS environment takes place electronically \u2014 based on instructions provided by banks to the clearing cell of the RBI.\nAtleast 72 banks have participated in the system, accounting for more than 90 per cent of the value of inter-bank settlement. Of the 72\nbanks, 32 participating banks offer customer-related RTGS fund transfer services through 840 branches in 134 major centres.\n\n\nRBI has already directed banks to speed up branch automation and networking. The RTGS is already\nlaunched in April 2005.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Straight Through Processing (STP)\n\nSTP was launched in December 2002 in a limited manner to enable market participants to smoothly tran-\nsit to a shorter settlement cycle of T +2 in April 2003.\n\nSTP allows electronic capturing and processing of transactions in one pass from the point of first deal\nto the final settlement. It allows any information generated at one end to reach its destination uninter-\nrupted by avoiding manual interference. The entire process of trade execution and settlement is electronic\nand carried on through a seamless connectivity between custodian, fund manager and broker. It avoids\nre-entry of the same details by different market participants.\n\nSTP is a prerequisite for a shorter settlement cycle. Initially, it was used by institutional participants\non a voluntary basis.\n\nNow there are various service providers like NST, IT (NSE subsidiary), NSDL Financial Technologies\nand Omgeo (Joint Venture between the Depository Trust Clearing Corporation and Thomson Financial).\nThese service providers provide STP connectivity to market participants. The RBI has also developed\nInfinet, a STP package devised only for banks and bank-related transactions.\n\nIn order to ensure inter-operability between market participants, the NSE has a sector STP Centralized\nHub. All institutional trades, executed on the stock exchanges are mandatorily processed through the STP\nsystem effective from July 1, 2004.\n\nBesides eliminating manipulation, STP also helps in reducing the settlement cycle, improving trans-\nparency, reducing counter-party risk, operational risk and avoiding punching errors.\n\nSTP and Manual Trade: A Comparison\n\nIn a manual trade, the broker issues a contract note which is then passed on to the custodian or a depository\n\nparticipant. There are multiple data entries from paper documents during the different stages in the manual trade\n\nwhich makes the process susceptible to errors, discrepancies, delays and manipulation of trade. In STP, however,\n\nthe contract note is issued in electronic forms and the entire trade is settled on the computer leaving no scope for\n\nmanipulation. Moreover, compared to manual trade, STP is faster, risk-free and eliminates any failure in trade.\nThe SEBI also prescribed the framework for the system flow of the STP, which is as follows.\n\n+ An STP user intending to send an instruction should send the message to his STP service provider\nafter digitally signing the same.\n\n* The STP service provider after verification of the signature should forward it to the recipient user, if\n\nthe recipient is availing services of the same STP service provider, or the STP centralized hub if the\n\nrecipient is not with the same STP service provider. In such a case, the STP service provider should\nbe required to prepare a message as per the STP centralized hub prescribed message format, enclose\nthe user\u2019s message, digitally sign it and then send it to the STP centralized hub.\n\nOn receipt of the message by the STP centralized hub, it should verify the signature of the sending\n\nSTP service provider and then send an acknowledgement to the sending STP service provider.\n\n* The STP centralized hub would then forward the message to the recipient STP service provider after\ndigitally signing on the message.\n\n+ The recipient STP service provider, on receipt of the message from the STP centralized hub, has to\nverify the signature of the STP centralized hub, verify if the recipient STP user is associated with\nitself and send an appropriate acknowledgment with digital signature to the STP centralized hub.\nThe STP centralized hub would, in turn, forward the acknowledgement (received from the recipient\nSTP service provider) duly signed to the sending STP service provider.\n\n+ The recipient STP service provider should forward the message to the recipient STP user who would\nverify the signature of the recipient STP service provider and sending STP user.\n\nSTP and RTGS will pave the way for T + 1 settlement.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Margin Trading\nMargin trading is a new concept in India. The RBI has allowed banks to finance margin trading in shares\nwe.f. September 18, 2001.\n\nMargin trading allows an investor to invest in excess of his financial capacity by providing only a part of the\nfunds for the deal. The balance funding comes from banks in the form of borrowing. Margin trading permits\ninvestors to buy shares by providing 40 per cent of the deal value as \u2018margin,\u2019 while borrowing 60 per cent from\nbanks. Banks provide finance to investors through stockbrokers for trading in actively traded scrips. Initially, 53\n\nscrips forming part of NSE Nifty and BSE Sensex were identified for margin trading. Banks extend funding for\nmargin trading within the overall existing ceiling for bank exposure to the capital market.\n\n\u2018The securities purchased by borrowing a portion of the deal from banks are used as collateral. Backed by\nthe collateral, an investor can buy assets which are greater in value than the value of the collateral. Hence,\nmargin trading is a form of leveraged trading which leads to an increase in the purchasing/selling power of the\nparticipants and helps them increase their earnings if the market price of securities move along expected lines.\n\nThe concept of margin trading is used as a means to infuse liquidity in the system. Banks, both private\nand public, can invest 5 per cent of total outstanding credit in equities with the leeway of fixing their own\nrates of interest. Today, banks are flush with funds and have immense potential to lend. However, they\nhave to safeguard their loans and take risk containment measures.\n\nMargin trading is a sort of deferral product. Investors generally use margins to own more shares with-\nout fully paying for them. However, margin trading creates a systemic risk that can lead to sharp volatility\nin the stock market.\n\n\u2018The Mechanism of Margin Trading Suppose an investor has \u00ae40,000 and he is willing to buy a share quoting\nat 240. Under the present settlement system, he can buy a maximum of 1,000 shares with his own money. With\n\u2018margin trading, he can buy as many as 2,500 shares worth & one lakh from his broker by paying 40,000 as\nmargin and by borrowing the balance %60,000 from a bank through his broker. The broker pledges the 2,500\nshares with the bank. The bank has a collateral of 71,00,000 backing the loan of %60,000.\n\nSuppose the market price of the share moves up to %50 and the investor sells the shares. Had the\ninvestor not taken the benefit of margin trading, he would have realized only 10,000 (1,000 shares x\n(\u00ae50-40)) as profit. With margin trading, he gained 25,000 (2,500 shares x (50-40). His net gain\nwould be equal to gains from the sale of shares less interest on bank borrowings.\n\nIf the market price of the share falls below 40, the bank will give a margin call under which the inves-\ntor will have to furnish additional funds/securities for the broker to pass on to the bank.\n\nThe RBI hiked the margins borrowers have to keep with banks for loans against shares and invest-\nments in primary equity issues. From December 28, 2004, the margin requirement for advances against\nshares, initial public offerings and issue of guarantee will be 50 per cent as against 40 per cent earlier. The\nRBI also advised banks to raise the minimum cash margin of 20 per cent to 25 per cent. This means that\nthe overall margin must have a 25 per cent cash component, which could be in the form of fixed deposit\ncertificates, while the balance would be shares valued at the current market price.\n\nMargin trading offers banks a unique opportunity to park short-term funds at a high rate of interest.\nEven small investors get an access to bank funds without being exploited by stockbrokers and other finan-\nciers. Margin trading is the cleanest form of leveraged buying of assets. It is a transparent mechanism for\nchannelizing funds into the stock markets. With margin trading, the chances of scams are also reduced.\n\nBanks will have to evolve adequate risk management systems for safeguarding loans given by them\nagainst a collateral of securities. Moreover, reforms in the payment system are needed to bring about\nimprovement in the infrastructure for funds transfer. Margin trading is an attractive mechanism which\nensures a no-default market with high levels of collateral and offers modest leverage to investors thereby\nincreasing liquidity in the stock market.\n\nSEBI Margin Trading Norms Margin trading through bank financing failed to pick-up as banks were\nreluctant to fund stock market purchases. With a view to providing more liquidity in the stock markets\nand creating a level-playing field between institutional and small investors, the SEBI introduced margin\ntrading with effect from April 2004. The SEBI has permitted brokers, banks, non-banking finance\ncompanies (NBFCs) registered with the Reserve Bank, insurance companies and financial institutions to\nfinance margin trading, i.e., borrowing money to part-finance stock purchases.\n\nThe Salient Features of the New Guidelines are as Follows |Member-brokers are allowed to provide\nmargin trading facility to their clients, in the cash segment, subject to the following conditions:\n\nSecurities Eligible for Margin Trading SEBI has categorized the securities under 3 groups, namely,\nGroup 1, Group 2 and Group 3. The securities having mean impact cost of less than or equal to 1 and\nhaving traded on atleast 80(+/~5) per cent of the days for the previous eighteen months, have been\ncategorized as Group 1. The securities in Group 1 would be eligible for margin trading facility.\n\nIn addition to the Group | securities, all the securities which are offered in the Initial Public Offerings\n(IPOs) and which meet the conditions for inclusion in the derivatives segment of the Stock Exchanges\nwould be eligible for Margin Trading Facility.\n\nEligibility Requirements for Brokers to Provide Margin Trading Facility to Clients Only corporate\nbrokers with a \u2018net worth\u2019 of at least %3.00 crore would be eligible to offer margin trading facility to\ntheir clients. The \u2018net worth\u2019 for the purpose of margin trading facility would mean \u2018Capital\u2019 (excluding\npreference share capital) plus free reserves less non allowable assets, i.e fixed assets, pledged securities,\nmember's card, non-allowable securities, bad deliveries, doubtful debts and advances (including debts\nand advances overdue for more than 3 months or given to associates), pre paid expenses, intangible assets\nand 30 per cent of the marketable securities.\u2019 The broker shall submit to the stock exchange a half-yearly\ncertificate, as on 31st March and 30th September of each year, from an auditor confirming the net worth .\nSuch a certificate shall be submitted not later than 30th April and 31st October of the year.\n\nNo-objection Certificate Before providing Margin Trading Facility to a client who has already availed\nof Margin Trading Facility from another broker, the broker is required to obtain a no-objection certificate\nin writing from the other broker. The other broker shall be required to convey his objection/if any, in\nwriting, within a period of 21 days from the date of receipt of query from the broker, failing which the\nbroker would be free to proceed with providing Margin Trading Facility to the client.\n\nAgreement The broker shall enter into an agreement with his client for providing the margin trading facility,\non the lines of the model agreement, enclosed as Annexure 1. The broker/exchange may modify the agreement\nonly for stipulating any additional or more stringent conditions, provided that no such modification shall have\nthe effect of diluting any of the conditions laid down in the circular or in the model agreement.\n\nSource of Funds for the Broker for Providing Margin Trading Facility to his Clients and Maximum\nPermissible Borrowing by any Broker\n\n. For the purpose of providing the margin trading facility, a broker may use his own funds or bor-\nrow from scheduled commercial banks and/or NBFCs regulated by RBI. A broker shall not be\npermitted to borrow funds from any other source.\n\n. The broker shall not use the funds of any client for providing the margin trading facility to another\nclient, even if the same is authorized by the client.\n\n3. At any point of time, the total indebtedness of a broker for the purpose of margin trading shall not\n\nexceed 5 times of his net worth (calculated as stated above).\n\n4. The \u2018maximum allowable exposure\u2019 of the broker towards the margin trading facility shall be\nwithin the self imposed prudential limits and shall not, in any case, exceed the borrowed funds\nand 50 per cent of his \u2018net worth\u2019.\n\n5. The term \u2018exposure\u2019 will mean the aggregate outstanding margin trading amount in the books\nof the broker for all his clients. While providing the margin trading facility, the broker shall be\nprudent and also ensure that there is no concentration on any single client. In any case, the expo-\nsure to any single client at any point of time shall not exceed 10 per cent of the broker's lendable\nresources (i.e., borrowed funds for the purpose o margin trading + 50 per cent of net-worth).\n\n. While providing the margin trading facility, the broker shall be prudent and also ensure that there is\nno concentration on any single client. In any case, the exposure to any single client at any point of\ntime shall not exceed 10 per cent of the \u2018total exposure\u2019 of the broker, (calculated as per (5) above).\n\nN\n\na\n\nMargin Requirements The initial and maintenance margin for the client shall be a minimum of 50 per\ncent and 40 per cent respectively, to be paid in cash. For this purpose;\n\n1, \u201cInitial margin\u2019 would mean the minimum amount, calculated as a percentage of the transaction\nvalue, to be placed by the client, with the broker, before the actual purchase. The broker may\nadvance the balance amount to meet full settlement obligations.\n\n2. \u2018Maintenance margin\u2019 would mean the minimum amount, calculated as a percentage of the mar-\nket value of the securities, calculated with respect to the last trading day\u2019s closing price, to be\nmaintained by the client with the broker.\n\nWhen the balance deposit in the client\u2019s margin account falls below the required maintenance margin, the\nbroker shall promptly make margin calls. However, no further exposure can be granted to the client on the\nbasis of any increase in the market value of the securities.\n\nThe exchange/broker shall have the discretion to increase the margins (as mentioned above) and in\nsuch a case, the margin call shall be made, as and when required. Fixed deposits with banks and Bank\nGuarantees shall be treated as cash equivalents and shall be considered as acceptable form of intial and\nmaintenance margins for the purpose of availing the Margin Trading Facility.\n\nLiquidation of Securities by the Broker in Case of Default by the Client The broker may liquidate\nthe securities if the client fails to meet the margin call made by the broker or fails to deposit the cheques\non the day following the day on which the margin call has been made or where the cheque deposited by\nthe client has been dishonoured.\n\nThe broker may also liquidate the securities in case the client's deposit in the margin account (after\nadjustment for mark to market losses) falls to 30 per cent or less of the latest market value of the secu-\nrities, in the interregnum between making of the margin call and receipt of payment from the client.\n\nHowever, the broker shall not liquidate or use in any manner the securities of the client in any situation\nother than the ones mentioned above.\n\nMaintenance of Records The broker shall maintain separate client wise accounts of the securities\npurchased on margin trading with depositories and shall enable the client to observe the movement of\nsecurities from his account (through internet). The broker shall also maintain a separate record of details\n(including the sources) of funds used for the purpose of margin trading.\n\nThe books of accounts, maintained by the broker, with respect to the margin trading facility offered\nby it, shall be got audited on a half yearly basis, The broker shall submit an auditor's certificate to the\nexchange/s, within one month from the date of the half year ending 31st March and 30th September of a\nyear certifying, inter alia, the extent of compliance with the conditions of margin trading facility.\n\nSEBI and the stock exchange/s shall have the right to inspect the books of accounts and/or any other\ndocuments maintained by the broker with respect to the margin trading facility.\n\nDisclosure of Exposure to the Margin Trading Facility The broker shall disclose to the stock\nexchange/s details on gross exposure including name of the client, Unique Identification Number (UIN)\nunder the SEBI (Central Database of Market Participants) Regulations, 2003, name of the scrip and if\nthe broker has borrowed funds for the purpose of providing margin trading facility, name of the lender\nand amount borrowed, on or before 12 noon on the following day. The stock exchange/s shall disclose the\nscrip wise gross outstanding in margin accounts with all brokers to the market. Such disclosure regarding\nmargin trading done on any day shall be made available after the trading hours on the following day,\nthrough its website.\n\nThe stock exchanges shall also put in place a suitable mechanism to capture and maintain all relevant\ndetails including member-wise, client-wise, scrip-wise information and source of funds of the members,\npertaining to margin trading on their exchange, both on daily as well as on cumulative basis.\n\nArbitration The arbitration mechanism of the exchange would not be available for settlement of\ndisputes, if any, between the client and broker, arising out of the margin trading facility. However, all\ntransactions done on the exchange, whether normal or through margin trading facility, shall be covered\nunder the arbitration mechanism of the exchange.\n\nUsage of Investor Protection Fund and Trade/Settlement Guarantee Fund The amounts lying in\nthe aforesaid funds would not be available for settling any loss suffered in connection with the margin\ntrading facility. However, the aforesaid funds will continue to be available for all transactions done on the\nexchange, whether normal or through margin trading facility.\n\nGeneral Provisions The brokers wishing to extend the facility of margin trading to their clients would\nbe required to obtain prior permission from the exchange/s where the margin trading facility is proposed\nto be provided. The exchange shall have the right to withdraw this permission at a later date, after giving\nreasons for the same.\n\nA broker should take adequate care and exercise due diligence before providing margin trading facil-\nity to any client. Any broker providing margin trading facility to a client shall ensure that the client has\nobtained a Unique Identification Number (UIN) under the SEBI (Central Database of Market Partici-\npants) Regulations, 2003.\n\nA client will be allowed to obtain margin trading facility from one broker per exchange for buying\nsecurities in that exchange. To ensure this, it shall be obligatory on the part of every broker to,\n\n1, obtain a declaration from his client whether he has availed of any margin trading facility from any\nbroker in any exchange, or whether his request for margin trading with any broker was rejected\nand if so, in both the cases, obtain the name of the broker and his registration number; and\n\n2. also verify the details from the concerned broker/s.\n\nBefore providing margin trading facility to a client who has already availed of margin trading facil-\nity from another broker in the same exchange, the broker shall ensure that the client has liquidated his\n\noutstanding in the margin trading account with the other broker, and obtain a certificate to this effect in\nwriting from that broker.\n",

The move will open up a new revenue stream for brokers in line with international\npractices. It will also allow investors to take a long-term call on the market and borrow funds to take up\npositions. Being a leverage mechanism, it injects liquidity in the market which, in turn, adds to the depth\nof the market and aids in price discovery. It is a mechanism which leads to the integration of money and\ncapital markets.\n\nOn the flip side, margin trading can be risky as it encourages speculation. To avoid this, the regulator\nwill have to strictly collect data on margin trading and educate investors about the perils of margin trading.\n\nMargin Trading scheme has been a non-starter among brokers. The norms are too stringent. Margin-\nfunding norms do not allow accepting stock as collaterals and 50 per cent initial margin is required to\npurchase a stock. This is why most of the brokers prefer the NBFC route.\n\n",

                        "extracted-text": "IMPACT OF REFORMS AND MEASURES ON\nSECONDARY MARKET ACTIVITIES\n\nReforms were undertaken to widen and deepen the secondary market to turn it into a vibrant market. A\nvibrant secondary market is a prerequisite for the development of an active primary market. Whether\nreforms have made any positive impact on the volatility, liquidity, size, and transaction cost is a matter\nof analysis.\n\n+ Volatility: Volatility of a stock measures the frequency with which changes in its market price take\nplace over a period of time. If a stock is highly volatile, i.e., if there are large fluctuations in its\nmarket prices, there is a risk and investors avoid these shares. Hence, volatility is a factor, which is\ntaken into consideration when assessing the risk-return trade offs. Moreover, volatility has macro-\neconomic implications in volatility of stocks. Volatility in the market is a function of information,\nmisinformation (rumours) and sometimes lack of information.\n\nVolatility is caused by a number of factors such as speculation, the trading and settlement\nsystem, the government budget, inflation, interest rates, announcement of corporate results, the\nextent of integration with international markets, the regulatory framework governing the stock\nmarket, rumours, day trading, and derivatives trading. All these factors directly or indirectly influ-\nence movements in share prices.\n\nThe coefficient of variation in both the BSE Sensex and the S&P CNX Nifty was high in the years\n1998-99 and 1999-2000. This indices a high volatility of Indian stocks. The factors responsible for high\nvolatility were as follows.\n\nInclusion of the new economy stocks, most of which were over-valued in the BSE Sensex.\nIncreased influence of international stock indices, especially the NASDAQ. The repercussion of the\ncrash in technology stocks on the NASDAQ was witnessed on Indian IT stocks also.\n\nHigh speculation when the badla system was prevalent led to large fluctuations in prices.\n\nDay trading increased which led to wild fluctuations in intra-day prices.\n\nForeign institutional investors FIls, exit the markets at the slightest whiff of trouble. This increases\nvolatility in the stock markets. Domestic investors follow FIIs and emulate their investment pattern.\nIf FIs buy, everyone buys and if Flls sell, everyone sells.\n\nIndian markets have high volume but they lack depth as the volumes are contributed by few insti-\ntutional participants. Indian markets lack hedge funds and pension funds, which can take a long-\nterm view of the markets. Moreover, domestic financial institutions like UTI, which used to act as\na counter-force in the time of crisis, have stopped being a force to reckon with. This lack of depth\nincreases volatility in the stock market.\n\nThe volatility in share prices was contained in 2000-01 and 2001-02 due to the introduction of rolling\nsettlement which restricts speculation. However, the volatility in share prices increased in 2003-04.\nThe stock markets were volatile in 2003-04 due to various factors.\n\n* The uncertainty relating to the formation of the new government after the general elections created a\nturbulence on May 17, 2004. The market ended the day with a net loss of 11.1 per cent as compared\n\nwith the previous day\u2019s close. The trading was halted twice during the day due to the application of\nthe index-based circuit breakers.\n\n+ External factors such as rising oil prices and apprehensions of rise in international rates contributed\nto high volatility.\n\n+ The announcement in the Union Budget 2004-05 regarding imposition of the Securities Transaction\nTax (STT) affected the market sentiments adversely.\n\n+ Huge activity in the F&O segment has contributed to volatility in the cash market. Most of the\n\nvolumes in the F&O segment arise from arbitrage trading to take advantage of price differentials in\n\nthe cash and futures markets. FIIs, too, indulge in cash-futures arbitrage. Volatility tends to increase\ntowards the close of every month, when futures expire. Squaring up of positions in the F&O market\neither by liquidating or roll over results in a corresponding fall in shares prices in the cash market.\n\nIna roll over, a trader liquidates the position for the current month and takes position for the forth-\n\ncoming month.\n\nShort selling followed by hectic short covering of positions on rumours led to volatility. A trader\n\ncan go short in the F&O market. Short selling is also allowed on an intra-day basis. Another option\n\nis to sell short in the cash market by borrowing shares. Big brokerages allow clients to sell short by\nlending shares from the pool account.\n\n+ Day traders thrive on intra-day movements of stocks and indices. A day trader purchases stocks\nat lower levels in early trade and sells them once the stock reaches his desired level. Uncertainty\nor lack of information means more opportunities for a day trader to enter and exit, resulting in\nincreased turnover and volatility in the market.\n\n+ Rumours such as hearsay of income-tax raids on brokers, FI investments slowing down, an immi-\nnent ban on participatory notes and fresh margins in the FI segment of the NSE play havoc with the\nstability of the markets.\n\n+ The SEBI, the regulatory agency of the capital market, did not act fast in clarifying its stand on the par-\nticipatory notes (PNs) which resulted in the Sensex shedding 470 points and over %1,25,000 crores in\nthe market capitalization during January 19-22, 2004. PNs are derivative instruments, which represent\nIndian shares issued overseas. Usually, registered FIIs or foreign brokerages issue PNs to those FIIs\nnot registered in India but who want an exposure to the Indian markets. The SEBI suspected that a few\n\u2018overseas corporate bodies (OCBs) were funded by non-resident Indians (NRIs) and were investing in the\nIndian markets through PNs. The SEBI banned fresh issuance of PNs to unregulated entities and granted\na grace period of 5 years for liquidation of the existing outstanding PNs. Issuance and transfer of PNs can\nnow be to regulated entities only.\n\nThere was a sharp increase in volatility in 2008-09 on account of the rise in crude-oil prices, deprecia-\ntion of dollar and global financial turmoil. Exchanges impose scripwise (20 per cent, 10 per cent, 5 per\ncent and 2 per cent) and index-wise circuit filters to contain volatility. But there is a need for exchanges\nand regulators to take swift actions to contain volatility.\n\nIndia\u2019s first volatility index\u2014India VIX\u2014was designed to indicate investors\u2019 perceptions of the mar-\nket\u2019s volati in the next 30 calendar days. The India VIX closed at 16.6 on March 31, 2016 as compared\nto 14.5 on March 31, 2015 registering an increase of 14.5 per cent, indicating investors\u2019 expectations of\nrising volatility.\n\nExchanges impose scrip-wise (20 per cent, 10 per cent, 5 per cent, and 2 per cent) and index-wise\ncircuit filters to contain volatility. But there is a need for exchanges and regulators to take swift actions\nto contain volatility.\n\nLiquidity _It is one of the most important indicators, that greatly influences stock market development and\nefficiency. It is also one of the factors affecting the price discovery mechanism. A market is considered to be\nliquid when large volume of trades can take place without any significant effects on price. When an investor\nis able to transact at a price close to the current market price in the stock market, the market is liquid.\n\nLiquidity is an important parameter taken into consideration by FIIs while investing in a market. A\nhighly liquid market implies higher FII inflows and reduced liquidity implies lower FII inflows, reduced\nmarket capitalization, poor sentiments, and inability of market participants to transact easily. Moreover,\ncorporates are also unable to raise money from the markets for investment. There are two methods for\nmeasuring stock market liquidity\u2014turnover ratio and value-traded ratio.\n\n+ Turnover ratio: It equals the total value of domestic shares traded divided by market capitalization.\nThis ratio measures the trading of domestic equities on domestic exchanges relative to the size of the\nmarket. High turnover is often used as an indicator of low transaction costs. The turnover ratio also\n\ncompliments the measure of stock market size since markets may be large but inactive. A large but\ninactive market will have a large market capitalization ratio but a small turnover ratio.\n\n+ Value traded ratio: It equals the total value of domestic shares traded on the major stock exchanges\ndivided by the gross domestic product (GDP). It measures organized trading of firm equity as a\nshare of the national output and, therefore, reflects liquidity on an economy-wide basis.\n\nThe value traded ratio captures trading relative to the size of the economy, while the turnover ratio measures\ntrading relative to the size of the market. Thus, a small liquid market will have a high turnover ratio but a small\nvalue traded ratio. Such a stock market would not provide significant liquidity to the economy as a whole.\n\nAn analysis of the turnover ratio and value traded ratio indicates that liquidity has increased in the\npost-reforms period. The all-India turnover ratio and value traded ratio exhibit an increasing trend in the\npost-reforms era. The high turnover was due to the formation of the NSE in 1994-95, The turnover of the\nNSE surpassed the turnover of the BSE in the subsequent years of its existence. This contributed to a very\nhigh all-India turnover in the second half of the 1990s.\n\nThe turnover ratio increased substantially after the introduction of screen-based trading by the NSE.\nThe turnover ratio increased from 21 in 1993-94 to 409.3 in 2000-01. This turnover ratio was one of the\nhighest in the world. The value-traded ratio rose from 53.1 per cent in 2004-05 to 108.9 per cent in 2007\u2014\n08. An increase in the value traded ratio reflects an increase in the liquidity on an economy-wide basis.\n\nThe average daily turnover on the NSE and the BSE is now in excess of USD 2 billion which reflects the\nincreasing liquidity in the market. The turnover ratio is poor in case of India compared with other developed\nand emerging markets. This is on account of concentration of trading in few stocks and higher promoter\nholding in companies. Flls are attracted to markets with high turnover ratio as it means lower impact costs.\n\nSize of the Stock Market The market capitalization ratio measures the size of the stock market\nand equals the value of listed domestic shares (market capitalization) divided by the GDP. In terms of\neconomic significance, the assumption underlying the use of this variable as an indicator of stock market\ndevelopment is that the size of the stock market is positively correlated with the ability to mobilize capital\nand diversify risk.\n\nThe value traded ratio complements the market capitalization ratio. Although market capitalization\nmay be large, there may be little trading. Market capitalization and value traded ratio together provide\ninformation about market size and liquidity.\n\nThe all-India market capitalization ratio which was 19.4 per cent in 1990-91 rose to 54.2 per cent in\n1991-92, the year after the reforms were initiated. This was a year of a sharp increase in share prices.\nHowever, this was an aberration and the ratio declined sharply to 30.6 per cent during 1992-93 as share\nprices plummeted. The ratio increased sharply to 46.8 per cent in 1999-2000 but declined to 27.2 per cent\nin 2000-01. The size of the market has more than doubled and new sectors such as information technology,\ncommunication, pharmaceuticals, and fast moving consumer goods account for a major share in market\ncapitalization. There was a sharp increase in the market capitalization ratio in 2005-06 and 2006-07 on\naccount of an improvment in macro-economic fundamentals and a rise in new listings.\n\nOn October 14, 2006, the market capitalization of BSE crossed the country\u2019s GDP. The market capi-\ntalization of all listed stocks on BSE rose to %33 lakh crore on October 14, 2006 and %34 lakh crore on\nOctober 16, 2006 exceeding the GDP figure of around %32 lakh during financial year 2006.\n\nAfter declining for three successive years, market capitalisation ratios showed improvement from\n2013-14 onwards.\n\nTransaction Cost Transaction costs consists of explicit costs such as brokerage, commission, and\nstamp duty, and implicit cost such as, impact cost, clearing and settlement cost due to counter-party risk,\npaper work, bad delivery and bid and ask spread. Transaction costs substantially impact returns, volumes,\nand volatility. Low transaction costs can induce the investor to trade more often which would lead to\nincreased volumes resulting in low volatility.\n\nTransaction costs were very high in the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s due to problems relating to\nphysical share certificates such as bad deliveries, theft, and paper work. Moreover, there was an involve-\nment of a chain of brokers in the execution of transactions and the method of trading was not transparent.\nThere were no guarantees, and brokerage charges were heavy.\n\nMany revolutionary changes have taken place in the Indian secondary market since November, 1994.\n\n+ The setting up of the NSE and the introduction of open electronic limit order book market by NSE\nand other exchanges.\n\n+ The emergence of a nationwide market through the spread of NSE VSATs and BOLT terminals.\n\n+ Reduction in brokerage fees and improved broking services owing to increased competition from\nNSE members and foreign brokers.\n\n+ Elimination of counter-party risk through the setting up of a clearing corporation\u2014National\nSecurities Clearing Corporation (NSCC)\u2014with strict enforcement of margins and exposure limits.\n\n+ The launch of a depository system in November, 1996 and majority of the shares compulsorily\ndematerialized.\n\nAll these developments have an impact upon transaction costs. An attempt was made by Shah and\nThomas (1997) to quantify transaction costs, which are shown in Tables 8.6 and 8.7.\n\nMarket impact cost is the cost faced by a user who places a market order as compared with an ideal price.\nIn other words, it is a cost associated with percentage degradation in price due to the execution of large\norders. The impact cost is considered as the most practical definition of liquidity. The impact cost is the per-\ncentage mark up from the (bid+ask)/2 suffered in executing a transaction. For example, if the bid~ask spread\nofa scrip is 10 to 20 paise and if the market price of the scrip is ruling at 8215, then, if an investor is able to\nbuy it at 2215.15, the impact cost is minimum. Higher the liquidity of the stock, lesser is the impact cost and\nvice-versa. Impact cost is lower in markets with increasing trading depth. This results in lower cost of equity\nand thereby improves returns to shareholders. Impact cost is important for fund managers. High impact cost\ncould lead to the index funds providing substantially lower returns than the benchmark index. According to\nthe Economic Survey 2002-03, the impact cost for the purchase or sale of 50 lakh Nifty portfolio dropped\nfrom 0.12 per cent in 2002 to 0.08 per cent in 2005 suggesting that the liquidity of stocks has improved.\n\nA new tax\u2014Securities Transaction Tax (STT) has been imposed on Indian investor. STT has to be paid\nat the time of making the transaction. If it is a share or an equity mutual fund unit being traded on stock\nexchanges and it is a delivery based transaction then, at the time of purchase, STT at the rate of 0.125 per\ncent has to be paid by the purchaser and an equivalent tax has to be paid by the seller. Further, sale of units\nback to a mutual fund entails a tax at the rate of 0.25 per cent for the investor. Recently, on July 1, 2017,\nGoods and Service Tax (GST) has been imposed on Securities Transactions. Now the transaction cost\nconsists of Brokerage cost, STT, exchange clearing cost, exchange transaction cost, stamp duty, Central\nGST (CGST), and State GST (SGST).\n\nTable 8.6 shows that there was an almost 50 per cent reduction in costs in 1997. With complete dema-\nterialization of shares in the future, the transaction cost is expected to come down by around 80 per cent.\n\nThe transaction costs declined substantially from 4.75 per cent in 1994 and 2.50 per cent in 1997 to\n0.60 per cent of selling/buying price in 1999. A round-trip transaction cost of a transaction of %50,000\nworks out at 2.30 per cent in 2006 \u2014 brokerage of about one per cent, impact cost about | per cent, securi-\nties transaction tax 0.25 per cent and depository transaction charges about 0.05 per cent.The transaction\ncost compares well with the global best markets. The reduction in transaction costs is an indicator of\nimprovement in market efficiency and stock market development.\n",

Technology has changed the face of the stock markets. New trading systems, new stock exchanges,\nnew players, new instruments, and new markets have come into existence. Today, the Indian equity market is\none of the most technologically developed in the world and is on par with other developed markets abroad.\nThe introduction of an online trading system, dematerialization, ban of the badla system, and introduction\nof rolling settlement have facilitated quick trading and settlements which lead to larger volumes. The set-\nting up of the National Stock Exchange of India Limited has revolutionalized the face of the stock markets.\nToday the NSE is the market leader and the 140-year-old BSE is lagging behind. The NSE, in a very short\nspan of time, has taken the leading position as it is perceived to be investor-friendly. In the future only two\nexchanges will survive\u2014the NSE and the BSE. With globalization, these exchanges will face stiff competi-\ntion internationally. They will have to gear themselves up to face international competition. They should\nstrive to increase transparency, strictly enforce corporate governance norms, provide more value added\nservices to investors, and take steps to increase investor confidence. These stock exchanges will have to plan\nstrategic tie-ups with their foreign counterparts to get an international platform.

                        "extracted-text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nDerivatives are one of the most complex of instruments. The word \u2018derivative\u2019 comes from.\nthe verb \u2018to derive.\u2019 It indicates that it has no independent value. A derivative is a contract\nwhose value is derived from the value of another asset, known as the underlying, which could\nbe a share, a stock market index, an interest rate, a commodity, or a currency. The underlying\nis the identification tag for a derivative contract. When the price of this underlying changes,\nthe value of the derivative also changes. Without an underlying, derivatives do not have any\nmeaning. For example, the value of a gold futures contract derives from the value of the\nunderlying asset, i.e., gold.\n\nTo understand the meaning of derivatives, let us take the example of a commodity such\nas cotton, which is the raw material for the textile industry. It may so happen that the price\nof cotton rises before and after the harvest but falls at the time of harvest. The farmer, who\nis exposed to such price fluctuations, can eliminate this risk by selling his harvest at a future\ndate by entering into a forward, or futures, contract. This forward, or futures, contract takes\nplace in the \u2018derivatives\u2019 market. The prices in the derivatives market are driven by the spot\nor cash market price of the underlying asset, which is cotton in this example.\n\nDerivatives are very similar to insurance. Insurance protects against specific risks, such as.\nfire, floods, and theft. Derivatives, on the other hand, take care of market risks\u2014volatility in\ninterest rates, currency rates, commodity prices, and share prices. Derivatives offer a sound\nmechanism for insuring against various kinds of risks arising in the world of finance. They\noffer a range of mechanisms to improve redistribution of risk, which can be extended to every\nproduct existing, from coffee to cotton and live cattle to debt instruments.\n\nIn this era of globalization, the world is a riskier place and exposure to risk is growing.\nRisk cannot be avoided or ignored. Man, however, is \u2018risk-averse.\u2019 This risk-averse charac-\nteristic of human beings has brought about growth in derivatives. Derivatives help the risk-\naverse individual by offering a mechanism for hedging risks.\n\nDerivative products, several centuries ago, emerged as hedging devices against fluc-\ntuations in commodity prices. Commodity futures and options have had a lively exist-\nence for several centuries. Financial derivatives came into the limelight in the post-1970\nperiod; today they account for 75 per cent of the financial market activity in Europe,\nNorth America, and East Asia. The basic difference between commodity and financial\nderivatives lies in the nature of the underlying instrument. In commodity derivatives,\nthe underlying is a commodity; it may be wheat, cotton, pepper, turmeric, corn, oats,\nsoyabeans, orange, rice, crude oil, natural gas, gold, silver, and so on. In financial deriva-\ntives, the underlying includes treasuries, bonds, stocks, stock index, foreign exchange,\nand currency.\n\nThe market for financial derivatives has grown tremendously both in terms of variety of\ninstruments and turnover. Derivatives can be futures, options, swaps, forwards, puts, calls,\nswap options, and index-linked derivatives. The value of the underlying assets of these deriv-\natives is more than USD 16 trillion (more than %50 lakh crore), which is about three times\nthe value of stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and twice the size of the\nUnited States GDP. The explosive growth of derivatives in the developed centuries is fuelled\nby the following:\n\n* The increased volatility in global financial markets.\n\n+ The technological changes enabling cheaper communications and computing power.\n\n+ Breakthrough in modern financial theory, providing economic agents a wider choice of risk man-\nagement strategies and instruments that optimally combine the risk and returns over a large number\nof financial assets.\n\n* Political developments, wherein the role of the government in the economic arena has become more\nof a facilitator and less of a prime mover. Thus, the move towards market-oriented policies and the\nderegulation in financial markets has led to an increase in financial risk at the individual partici-\npants\u2019 level.\n\n+ Increased integration of domestic financial markets with international markets.\n",

They\nenable hedging, which is the prime social rationale for future trading. Hedging is also the equivalent\nof insurance facility against risk from market price fluctuations.\n\nDerivatives enhance the liquidity of the underlying asset market. A liquid market is a market with\nenough trading activity to allow traders to readily trade goods for a price that is close to its true\nvalue. The trading volume increases in the underlying market as derivatives enable participation by\na large number of players.\n\nDerivatives lower transaction costs. These costs associated with trading a financial derivative are\nsubstantially lower than the cost of trading the underlying instrument.\n\nDerivatives enhance the price discovery process. Price discovery is the revealing of information\nabout future cash market prices through the futures market. The prices in the derivatives market\nreflect the perception of market participants about the future, and lead the prices of the underlying\nto the perceived future level. The prices of derivatives converge with the prices of the underlying at\nthe expiration of a derivatives contract. Thus, derivatives help in the discovery of future as well as\ncurrent prices.\n\nDerivatives can help the investors to adjust the risk and return characteristics of their stock portfolio\ncarefully. For instance, a risky stock and a risky option may be combined to form a riskless portfolio.\nThey also provide a wide choice of hedging structures each with a unique risk/return profile to meet\nthe exact requirements of each market participant.\n\nDerivatives provide information on the magnitude and the direction in which various market indices\nare expected to move. The cash markets lookout to the futures market for signals that could give\nmarket players information as to where the markets are heading. The measures that are widely\ntracked by the markets include Nifty discounts, which implies a lower value for Nifty futures con-\ntract compared to the cash price; open interest outstanding which is the total number of shares\noutstanding in the futures market; put-call ratios, which is the ratio of put options outstanding for\nevery call option; and FII purchases and sales in the derivatives segment.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "History of Derivatives Trading\n\nForward delivery contracts, stating what is to be delivered for a fixed price at a specified place on a speci-\nfied date, existed in ancient Greece and Rome. Roman emperors entered forward contracts to provide the\nmasses with their supply of Egyptian grain. These contracts were also undertaken between farmers and\nmerchants to eliminate the risk arising out of uncertain future prices of grains. Thus, forward contracts\nhave existed for centuries for hedging price risk.\n\nThe first organized commodity exchange came into existence in the early 1700s in Japan. The first\nformal commodities exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), was formed in 1848 in the US to\ndeal with the problem of \u2018credit risk\u2019 and to provide centralized location to negotiate forward contracts.\nFrom \u2018forward\u2019 trading in commodities emerged the commodity \u2018futures.\u2019 The first futures type contract\nwas called \u2018to arrive at.\u2019 Trading in futures began on the CBOT in the 1860s. In 1865, CBOT listed the\nfirst \u2018exchange-traded\u2019 derivatives contracts, known as the futures contracts. Futures trading grew out of\nthe need for hedging the price risk involved in many commercial operations. The Chicago Mercantile\nExchange (CME), a spin-off of CBOT, was formed in 1919, though it did exist before in 1874 under the\nnames of \u2018Chicago Produce Exchange\u2019 and \u2018Chicago Butter and Egg Board.\u2019 The first financial futures\nto emerge were the currency futures in 1972 in the US. The first foreign currency futures contracts were\ntraded on May 16, 1972, on the International Monetary Market (IMM), a division of the CME. The cur-\nrency futures traded on the IMM were the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Japanese yen, the Swiss\nfranc, the German mark, the Australian dollar, and the euro-dollar. Currency futures were followed soon\nby interest rate futures. Interest rate futures contracts were traded for the first time on the CBOT on\nOctober 20, 1975. Stock Index futures and options emerged in 1982. The first stock index futures con-\ntracts were traded on Kansas City Board of Trade on February 24, 1982.\n\nThe first of the several networks, which offered a trading link between two exchanges, was formed\nbetween the Singapore International Monetary Exchange (SIMEX) and the CME on September 7, 1984.\n\nOptions are as old as futures. Their history also dates back to ancient Greece and Rome. The first\naccount of options and its creator, Thales was published in Aristotle's Polities in 332 BC. Thales used\na small amount of money to secure the right to use olive presses during harvest season. During olive-\npicking time, he sold his options for a great deal more than he paid for them.\n\nOptions were very popular with speculators in the tulip craze of seventeenth century Holland.\n\u2018Tulips, the brightly coloured flowers, were a symbol of affluence; owing to a high demand, tulip bulb\nprices shot up. Dutch growers and dealers traded in tulip bulb options. There was so much speculation\nthat people even mortgaged their homes and businesses. These speculators were wiped out when the\ntulip craze collapsed in 1637 as there was no mechanism to guarantee the performance of the option\nterms.\n\nThe first puts and calls options were invented by an American financier, Russel Sage, in 1872. These\noptions were traded over the counter. Agricultural commodities options were traded in the nineteenth\ncentury in England and the US. Options on shares were available in the US on the over-the-counter (OTC)\nmarket only until 1973 without much knowledge of valuation. A group of firms known as Put and Call\nBrokers and Dealers\u2019 Association was set up in early 1900s to provide a mechanism for bringing buyers\nand sellers together.\n\nOn April 26, 1973, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) was set up at the CBOT for the\npurpose of trading stock options. It was in 1973 again that Black, Merton, and Scholes invented the\nfamous Black-Scholes option formula. This model helped in assessing the fair price of an option which\nled to an increased interest in trading of options. With the options markets becoming increasingly popular,\nthe American Stock Exchange (AMEX) and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange (PHLX) began trading in\noptions in 1975.\n\nThe market for futures and options grew at a rapid pace in the 1980s and 1990s. The collapse of the\nBretton Woods regime of fixed parities and the introduction of floating rates for currencies in the interna-\ntional financial markets paved the way for development of a number of financial derivatives, which served\nas effective risk management tools to cope with market uncertainties.\n\nThe CBOT and the CME are the two largest financial exchanges in the world on which futures con-\ntracts are traded. The CBOT now offers 48 futures and options contracts (with the annual volume at more\nthan 211 million in 2001). The CBOE is the largest exchange for trading stock options. The CBOE trades\noptions on the S&P 100 and the S&P 500 stock indices. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange is the premier\nexchange for trading foreign exchange options.\n\nThe most traded stock indices include S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Nasdaq 100,\nthe Nikkei 225. The US indices and the Nikkei 225 trade almost round the clock. The N225 is also traded\non the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\n\nEurex, the German Swiss derivatives exchange, was the world\u2019s biggest financial futures exchange at\nthe end of 2001. Eurex closed 2001 with a record volume of more than 556 million contracts account-\ning for a 18.8 per cent share among the international futures and options exchanges. Chicago Mercantile\nExchange (CME), the biggest US futures market, was the next in line, trading 333 million contracts in\n2001 (11.3 per cent share) while the CBOE traded 276 million contracts and London\u2019s International\nFinancial Futures Exchange (LIFFE) traded 177 million contracts.\n\nHistory of Derivatives: A Time Line\n\nThe Ancient: Derivatives\n\n1400s Japanese rice futures\n1600s Dutch tulip bulb options\n1800s Puts and calls options\n\nThe Recent: Financial Derivatives Listed Markets\n\n1972 Financial currency futures\n1973 Stock options\n\n1977 Treasury bond futures\n\n1981 Eurodollar futures\n\n1982 Index futures\n\n1983 Stock index options\n\n1990 Foreign index warrants and leaps\n1991 Swap futures\n\n1992 Insurance futures\n\n1993 Flex options\n\nOTC Markets\n\n1981 Currency swaps\n\n1982 Interest rate swaps\n\n1983 Currency and bond options\n1987 Equity derivatives markets\n1988 Hybrid derivatives\n\nSource: Fortune India, September 16-30, 1993, p. 5\n\nExchange\n\nUnderlying\n\nExchange\n\nUnderlying\n\nAmerican Stock Exchange Hang Seng, Nikkei\n\nChicago Board Options\nExchanges\nChicago Board of Trade\n\nNASDAQ 100, S&P 100,\nS&P 500\n\nCorn, Oats, Wheat, Silver,\nTreasury Bonds, Treasury Notes,\nMunicipal Bonds Index\n\nChicago Mercantile Cattle, Hog, Treasury Bills, LIBOR,\n\nExchange Eurodollar Yen, Deutsch Mark,\nCanadian Dollar, Franc Sterling,\nS&P 500 Index, S&P Midcap 400\nNikkei-225,\n\nCommodity Exchange Copper, Gold, Silver,\n\nEurotop100 Index\n\nCoffee Sugar & Cocoa Cocoa, Coffee, Sugar, Cotton\n\nExchange\n\nHong Kong Futures Hang Seng, Gold\nExchange\n\nInternational Petroleum\nExchange of London\n\nKansas City Board of\nTrade\n\nLondon International Fi-\nnancial Futures Exchange\n\nBrent Crude, Gas Oil\nWheat, KC Value Line Index\n\nSterling, Long Gilt, Euromark,\nEuroswiss\n\nGerman Government Bonds,\nItalian Govt.

Market risk is also referred to as \u2018systematic risk\u2019 since it cannot be diversified\naway because the stock market as a whole may go up or down from time to time.\n\nInterest rate risk: This risk arises in the case of fixed income securities, such as treasury bills,\ngovernment securities, and bonds, whose market price could fluctuate heavily if interest rates\nchange. For example, the market price of fixed income securities could fall if the interest rate\nshot up.\n\nExchange rate risk: In the case of imports, exports, foreign loans or investments, foreign currency\nis involved which gives rise to exchange rate risk.\n\nTo hedge these risks, equity derivatives, interest rate derivatives, and currency derivatives have\nemerged.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Types of Financial Derivatives\n\nIn recent years, derivatives have become increasingly important in the field of finance. Forwards, futures,\noptions, swaps, warrants, and convertibles are the major types of financial derivatives. A complex variety\nof composite derivatives, such as swaptions, have emerged by combining some of the major types of\nfinancial derivatives.\n\nForwards: A forward contract is a contract between two parties obligating each to exchange a par-\nticular good or instrument at a set price on a future date. It is an over-the-counter agreement and has\nstandardized market features.\n\nFutures: Futures are standardized contracts between the buyers and sellers, which fix the terms\nof the exchange that will take place between them at some fixed future date. A futures contract is\na legally binding agreement. Futures are special types of forward contracts which are exchange\ntraded, that is, traded on an organized exchange. The major types of futures are stock index futures,\ninterest rate futures, and currency futures.\n\nOptions: Options are contracts between the option writers and buyers which obligate the former\nand entitles (without obligation) the latter to sell/buy stated assets as per the provisions of contracts.\nThe major types of options are stock options, bond options, currency options, stock index options,\nfutures options, and options on swaps.\n\nOptions are of two types: calls and puts. A call option gives a buyer/holder a right but not an\nobligation to buy the underlying on or before a specified time at a specified price (usually called\nstrike/exercise price) and quantity. A put option gives a holder of that option a right but not an obli-\ngation to sell the underlying on or before a specified time at a specified price and quantity.\nWarrants: Warrants are long-term options with three to seven years of expiration. In contrast, stock\noptions have a maximum life of nine months. Warrants are issued by companies as a means of rais-\ning finance with no initial servicing costs, such as dividend or interest. They are like a call option\n\u2018on the stock of the issuing firm. A warrant is a security with a market price of its own that can be\nconverted into a specific share at a predetermined price and date. If warrants are exercised, the\nissuing firm has to create a new share which leads to a dilution of ownership. Warrants are sweeten-\ners attached to bonds to make these bonds more attractive to the investor. Most of the warrants are\ndetachable and can be traded in their own right or separately. Warrants are also available on stock\nindices and currencies.\n\nSwaps: Swaps are generally customized arrangements between counterparts to exchange one\nset of financial obligations for another as per the terms of agreement. The major types of\nswaps are currency swaps, and interest-rate swaps, bond swaps, coupon swaps, debt-equity\nswaps.\n\nSwaptions: Swaptions are options on swaps. It is an option that entitles the holder the right to enter\ninto or cancel a swap at a future date. Swaptions become operative at the expiry of the options.\nInstead of having calls and puts, swaptions have receiver swaption (an option to receive fixed and\npay floating) and a payer swaption (an option to pay fixed and receive floating).\n\n",

The investor pays only a fraction of the investment amount to take an exposure. The investor\ncan take large positions even when he does not hold the underlying security.\n\nMarket view is as important in the derivatives market as in the cash market. The profit/loss positions\nare dependent on the market view. Derivatives are double-edged swords.\n\nDerivatives contracts have a definite lifespan or a fixed expiration date. They are primarily a tool to\nemploy short-term expectations about a stock or an index to hedge or trade.\n\nThe derivatives market is the only market where an investor can go long and short on the same asset\nat the same time.\n\nDerivatives carry risks that stocks do not. A stock loses its value in extreme circumstances, while an\noption loses its entire value if it is not exercised.\n\nDerivatives contracts are flexible as they allow investors to translate a particular view into a variety\nof different trades, depending on their risk appetite and availability of capital. Suppose an investor\nis bullish on Infuses, then he can either buy Infuses futures or buy a call option or sell a put option.\nMoreover, investors can capitalise on a bearish view as well as either by selling futures or buying a\nput, or writing a call.\n\nMargin-based trading makes trading in derivative products attractive. The margin requirement is\nabout 12 per cent for futures and 8 per cent for options. One can trade in derivatives by paying just a\nsmall fraction of the total value. So, by depositing, say 25,000, it may be possible to trade in Nifty\nfutures worth %2 lakh.\n\n",

Information Technology (IT) has enabled this fast\ngrowth in the OTC derivatives markets. OTC derivatives contracts are more flexible than exchange-traded\ncontracts.

A hedger is a trader who enters the futures market to\nreduce a pre-existing risk.\n\nSpeculator While hedgers are interested in reducing or eliminating risk, speculators buy and sell\nderivatives to make profit and not to reduce risk. Speculators willingly take increased risks. Speculators\nwish to take a position in the market by betting on the future price movements of an asset. Futures and\noptions contracts can increase both the potential gains and losses in a speculative venture. Speculators\n\nare important to derivatives markets as they facilitate hedging, provide liquidity, ensure accurate\npricing, and help to maintain price stability. It is the speculators who keep the market going because\nthey bear risks which no one else is willing to bear.\n\nArbitrageur An arbitrageur is a person who simultaneously enters into transactions in two or more markets\ntotake advantage of the discrepancy between prices in these markets. For example, ifthe futures price of an asset\nis very high relative to the cash price, an arbitrageur will make profit by buying the asset and simultaneously\nselling futures. Hence, arbitrage involves making profits from relative mispricing. Arbitrageurs also help to\nmake markets liquid, ensure accurate and uniform pricing, and enhance price stability.\n\nAll three types of traders and investors are required for a healthy functioning of the derivatives market.\nHedgers and investors provide economic substance to market, and without them the markets would\nbecome mere tools of gambling. Speculators provide liquidity and depth to the market. Arbitrageurs help\nin bringing about price uniformity and price discovery. The presence of hedgers, speculators, and arbitra-\ngeurs, not only enables the smooth functioning of the derivatives market, but also helps in increasing the\nliquidity of the market.\n\n",

They are over-the-counter traded contracts. Forward\ncontracts are private agreements between two financial institutions or between a financial institution and\nits corporate client.\n\nIna forward contract, one party takes a long position by agreeing to buy the asset at a certain speci-\nfied date for a specified price and the other party takes a short position by agreeing to sell the asset on the\nsame date for the same price.\n\nThe main features of forward contracts are as follows:\n\n+ They are bilateral contracts wherein all the contract details, such as delivery date, price, and quantity,\nare negotiated bilaterally by the parties to the contract. Being bilateral in nature, they are exposed\nto counter-party risk.\n\nEach contract is custom designed in the sense that the terms of a forward contract are individually\nagreed between two counter-parties. Hence, each contract is unique in terms of contract size, expira-\ntion date, and the asset type and quality.\n\nAs cach contract is customized, the contract price is generally not available in public domain.\n\nThe contract has to be settled by delivery of the asset on the expiry date.\n\nIn case, the party wishes to reverse the contract, it has to compulsorily approach the same counter-\nparty, which being in a monopoly situation can command a high price.\n\nForward markets for some goods are highly developed and have standardized market features.\nSome forward contracts do have liquid markets. In particular, the forward foreign exchange market\nand the forward market for interest rates are highly liquid. Forward contracts\u2019 dominance is very high\nfor the purposes of hedging foreign exchange exposures, particularly in Europe. Forward contracts\nhelp in hedging risks arising out of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. For instance, an exporter who\nexpects to receive payments in dollars three months later can sell dollars forward and an importer\nwho is required to make payment in dollars can buy dollars forward, thereby reducing their exposure\nto exchange-rate fluctuations.\n\nForward markets are not free from limitations. As these contracts are customized, they are non-\ntradeable. Moreover, there is a possibility of default by any one party to the transaction and this gives\nrise to counter-party risk which is a very serious issue worldwide.\n",

A tick is a\nchange in the price of a contract be it up or down.\n\n+ Location of settlement.\n\nFutures is a type of forward contract. The structure, pay-off profile, and basic utility for both futures\nand forward are the same, However, futures contracts differ from forward contracts in several ways.\n\n+ Futures are exchange-traded contracts, while forwards are OTC contracts, not traded on a stock\nexchange.\n\n+ Futures contracts being traded on exchanges are standardized, that is, have terms standardized by the\n\nexchange. Only the price is negotiated. In contrast, all elements of forward contracts are negotiated\n\nand each contract is customized, that is, all the terms of a forward contract are individually agreed\n\nbetween two parties.\n\nFutures markets are transparent while the forward markets are not transparent, as forwards are over-\n\nthe-counter instruments. The latter are private bilateral agreements and as these agreements are not\n\nvisible to other parties, the forward market is not transparent. In futures market, everyone can see\n\nthe prices available as they are exchange traded.\n\nFutures contracts are usually more liquid than forward contracts, because they are standardized and\n\ntraded on futures exchanges. In contrast, most forward contracts, due to their customized nature,\n\nare less liquid.\n\n+ Futures contracts frequently involve a range of delivery dates whereas there is generally a single\ndelivery date in a forward contract.\n\n+ Futures contracts are marked-to-market daily whereas forward contracts are not.\n\nProfits and losses on a futures contract are realized on a daily basis (via the marking to market pro-\n\ncess). The profit or loss from a forward is realized when the contract matures.\n\nMost futures contracts are closed prior to delivery whereas a forward contract is not usually settled\n\nuntil the end of its life. Hence, futures allow flexibility as to the date of closing out. Most forward\n\ncontracts do lead to delivery of the physical onset or a cash settlement as they are not typically\n\ntradeable.\n\n+ A futures contract can be reversed with any member of the exchange whereas a forward contract can\n\nbe reversed only with the same counter-party.\n\nThe futures trading system has effective safeguards against defaults. Futures do not carry a credit risk,\n\nas there is a clearing house, which guarantees both payment and delivery. Forward contracts, on the\n\nother hand, are exposed to default risk by a counter-party as there is no such clearing house involved.\n\nFutures markets are regulated by a financial regulator, while forward contracts, in general, trade in\n\nan unregulated market.\n\nThus, forwards and futures are basically similar concepts. They differ only in terms of the institutional\nsetting in which they trade, the degree of flexibility, and cost efficiency. Futures are recognized as the best\nand most cost-efficient way of risk hedging.\n",

An investor\nwho purchases stock with his own capital is said to be long stock. A long position indicates a net\nover bought position.\n\nShort: A party is said to be short if he or she has sold the contracts. An investor who sells a stock that\nhe does not currently own is short stock. Short positions indicate an over-sold position.\n\nSpot price: The price at which an asset trades in the spot market.\n\nFutures price: The price at which the futures contract trades in the futures market.\n\nExpiry date: The last day on which the contract will be traded, at the end of which it will cease to\nexist. The expiry day is the last Thursday of the expiry month or the previous trading day if the last\nThursday is a trading holiday.\n\nContract size: The amount of asset that has to be delivered under one contract. For instance, the\ncontract size on the NSE\u2019s futures market is 200 Nifties.\n\nContract cycle: The period over which a contract trades. The index futures contracts on the NSE\nhave one (near) month, two (next) months and three (far) months expiry cycles which expire on\nthe last Thursday of the month. On the Friday following the last Thursday, a new contract having a\nthree-month expiry would be introduced for trading.\n\nMarking-to-market: The practice of periodically adjusting a margin account by adding or subtract-\ning funds based on changes in market value to reflect the investors\u2019 gain or loss. This is to ensure\nthere are no defaults.\n\nMargin: An amount of money deposited by both buyers and sellers of futures contracts to ensure\nperformance of the terms of the contract. The aim of margin money is to minimize the risk of default\nby either counter-party. The payment of margin ensures that the risk is limited to the previous day\u2019s\nprice movement on each outstanding position. However, even this risk is offset by the initial margin\nholdings. There are different types of margins such as initial margin, variation margin, maintenance\nmargin and additional margin.\n\nInitial margin: The amount that must be deposited in the margin account at the time a futures con-\ntract is first entered into. The purpose of initial margin is to cover the largest potential loss in one\nday. Both buyer and seller have to deposit margins. The technique of value-at-risk (VaR) is used for\ncalculating this margin. This margin is calculated on the basis of variance observed in daily price\nof the underlying over a specified historical period. The margin is kept in a way that it covers price\nmovements more than 99 per cent of the time. Usually three sigma (standard deviation) is used for\nthis measurement.\n\nMaintenance margin: The amount that is set aside to ensure that the balance in the margin account\nnever becomes negative is called maintenance margin. It is usually lower than the initial margin.\nIf the balance in the margin account falls below the maintenance margin, the investor receives a\nmargin call.\n\nVariation or mark-to-market margin: The amount that is deposited as a further collateral to meet\ndaily losses. This margin is required by the close of business, the following day. Any profits on the\ncontract are credited to the client\u2019s variation margin account.\n\nAdditional margin: The amount that may be called for by the exchange in case of sudden higher-\nthan-expected volatility. This is a preemptive move by the exchange to prevent breakdown.\n\nHedge ratio: The number of futures contracts required to buy or sell to offset risk. If the instrument\nto be hedged shows high volatility, then a larger number of future contracts are required than in the\ncase of a more stable instrument. This depends on the value of a futures contract, value of the port-\nfolio to be hedged, and sensitivity of the movement of the portfolio price to that of the index called\nbeta. The hedge ratio is closely linked to the correlation between the asset (portfolio of shares) to\nbe hedged and the underlying (index) from which futures is derived. When a stock index futures\ncontract is used to hedge a position in a portfolio of stocks or a position in an individual stock, the\noptimal number of futures contracts is equal to the beta of the position times the ratio of the value\nof the portfolio to the futures contract price.\n\nClosing out contracts: A long position in futures can be closed out by selling futures while a short\nposition in futures can be closed out by buying futures on the exchange. The net difference is settled\nin cash without any delivery of the underlying. Most contracts are not held till expiry, but closed out\nbefore that. If held until expiry, some are settled for cash and others for physical delivery.\n\nBasis: The difference between spot price of an asset and its futures price. Even through the spot\nand futures prices generally move in tandem with each other, the basis is not constant. Changes\nin interest rates or expected dividends cause unexpected changes in basis. Unexpected changes in\nbasis render hedges imperfect. Basis decreases with time and, on expiry, it is zero, and futures price\nequals spot price.\n\nContango: Under normal market conditions, futures contracts are priced above the expected future\nspot price. This is known as contango.\n\nBackwardation: When futures price prevail below the expected future spot price, it is known as\nbackwardation. This situation may prevail when the cost of carry is negative or when the underly-\ning asset is in short supply in the cash market but there is an expectation of increased supply in\nfuture.\n\nMaturity periods for futures contracts: In India, there are different maturity periods for the\nfutures contract\u2014one, two, and three months with the last Thursday of the month serving as\nexpiry date. Suppose at the end of July the one-month contract comes to an end, the August\ncontract automatically becomes a one-month contract, the September contract, a two-month con-\ntract and the October contract, a three-month contract. In the futures market, the broker through\nwhom the futures was bought has to be retained throughout the contract or till the conclusion of\nthe contract.\n\nSettlement basis: The settlement basis is mark-to-market and final settlement is cash settled on T +1\nbasis.\n\nSettlement price: Daily settlement price is the closing price of the futures contracts for the trad-\ning day and the final settlement price is the closing price of the underlying asset on the last\ntrading day.\n",

A clearing corporation performs full novation, that is, it interposes itself between both\nlegs of every trade, becoming the legal counter-party to both or alternatively provides an unconditional\nguarantee for settlement of all trades. It matches the transactions, reconciles sales and purchases, and\ndoes daily settlement. It also undertakes risk management of its members and carries on inspection,\nsurveillance, and so on. Besides collecting margin capital, it also monitors the net worth requirements\nof the members.\n\nThe National Securities Clearing Corporation Limited (NSCCL) undertakes clearing and settlement\nof all deals executed on the NSE\u2019s F&O (derivatives) segment. NSCCL has an online position monitoring\nsystem which monitors all clearing members\u2019 open positions on a real time basis.\n\nPricing Futures\n\n\u2018The study of futures prices is essential for understanding all features of the futures market. Futures prices\nbear important relationships with the spot price, expected future spot price, the basis, the spreads, and the\ncost of storage. These are fundamental factors that affect futures prices.\n\nSpot Price The price of a good for immediate delivery. It is also referred to as the cash price or the\ncurrent price.\n\nBasis The difference between cash price and the futures prices of a particular good.\nBasis=Current cash price ~ Futures price\n\nAs the futures contract approaches maturity, the basis narrows. At the maturity of the futures contract,\nthe basis is zero. This behaviour of the basis over time is known as convergence, i.e., convergence of\nfutures price towards the spot price. The basis is much more stable than the futures price or the cash price.\nThe futures price or the cash price may vary widely when considered in isolation, but basis tends to be\nrelatively stable. Hence, basis is important for speculation and hedging. Arbitrage opportunities can also\narise if the basis during the life of a contract is incorrect.\n\nSpreads A spread is the difference between two futures prices. Spreads may be classified as intra-\ncommodity spread and inter-commodity spread. If the two futures prices that form a spread are futures\nprices for futures contracts on the same underlying good but with different expiration dates, the spread\nis an intra-commodity spread. An intra-commodity spread indicates the relative price differentials for\na commodity to be delivered at two points in time. If two futures prices that form a spread are futures\nprices for two underlying goods, such as silver futures and gold futures, then the spread is an inter-\ncommodity spread.\n\nSpreads are important for speculators. Spreads are more stable when compared to futures prices. Arbi-\ntrage opportunities can arise if the spreads are incorrect.\n\nExpected Future Spot Price The expectations of market participants also help in determining the\nfutures prices. If market participants believe that silver will sell for 27,000 per kg in three months, then\nthe price of the futures contract for delivery of silver in three months cannot be 29,000 per kg.\n\nCost of Storage The price for storing the good underlying the futures contract also affects futures\nprices. The cost of storing is the cost of storing the underlying good from the present to the delivery date.\nIt is the cost of carry related arbitrage that drives the behaviour of the futures prices.\n\nCost of Carry Model of Futures Prices The cost of carry model determines futures prices in such a\nway that no arbitrage opportunities arise.\nThe assumptions of this model are as follows:\n\n* Markets are perfect\n\n+ All assets are infinitely divisible\n\n+ There are no transaction costs\n\n* No bid-ask spread exists\n\n+ There are no restrictions on short selling\n+ Forward and futures prices are equal\n\n+ Borrowing and lending rates are equal\n\n+ There are no limitations to storing\n\nThe price of the contract defined under this model is:\nF=S+C\n\nFutures price=Spot price +Carry costs\n\u2018The above equation can also be expressed as:\n\nF=S(1+r\n\nwhere\nF = Futures prices\n\nTe Time till expiration\n\nIf the above equation holds true, then there will be no arbitrage opportunities. If F<S (1+r)? or\nF>S (1+r)', arbitrage opportunities would exist.\n\nCarrying costs are the total costs to carry an asset forward in time. In other words, they are costs\nincurred for buying and holding on to the deliverable asset. The components of carrying costs are storage\ncosts, insurance costs, transportation costs, and financing costs. Storage cost is the cost of warehousing\nthe asset. Insurance cost is the cost of protecting the asset against fire, water, and other dangers, Transpor-\ntation cost is the cost of transporting the asset to different locations. Financing cost is the cost of financing\nthe asset. The cost of financing may be interest on borrowings for financing the asset.\n\nThese components may vary with contracts on different times and may even be negative. The hold-\ning cost for commodity futures is a sum total of all the four components. In the case of some financial\nfutures, such as equity futures, the holding cost is the cost of financing minus the carry return. The\ncarry return consists of the future value of the cash inflows that the deliverable asset provides to its\nholder. For example, dividend returns, actual or accrued interest income, and so on. Hence, for some\nfinancial futures,\n\nF=S+C-CR\n\nwhere CR=Carry return.\nThe cost of carry model gives a good idea about the futures price but does not provide a complete\ndetermination of futures prices due to market imperfections.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Hedging with Index Futures\n\nFutures contracts in India are available on two stock indices\u2014the S&P CNX Nifty and the BSE Sensex.\nA hedge reduces the price risk of an existing or anticipated position in the cash market. A hedge can\nhelp lock in existing profits. Hedging does not mean maximization of return! Its purpose is to reduce the\nvolatility of a portfolio by reducing the risk. Stock index futures are used to reduce stock market risk in\nthe anticipation that any losses arising from movements in stock prices are offset by gains from parallel\nmovements in futures prices. Hedgers sell futures when they are long the cash asset and buy futures when\nthey are short the cash asset.\n\nIn stock index futures, there is no delivery and receipt of stock. Stock index futures contracts are cash\nsettled.\n\nIt is necessary to know the beta of a stock to measure the extent to which it moves in line with the\nmarket index. The market index is assumed to have a beta (P) one (1). A stock with a beta of 0.5 is half.\nas volatile as the market index and a stock with 2 is one with double the degree of volatility. If the P of a\n\nstock is 1.2, then the stock tends to change by 20 per cent more than the stock index. The relatively large\nlosses (or profits) arising from high volatility require correspondingly large offsetting profits (or losses)\nfrom futures contracts and thus a large number of futures contracts.\n\nStock index futures are of immense importance to mutual funds.\n\nSome examples where hedging strategies are useful for mutual funds are as follows:\n\n+ Reducing the equity exposure of a mutual fund by selling index futures.\n\n+ Investing funds raised by new schemes in index futures so that market exposure is immediately\ntaken.\n\n+ Partial liquidation of portfolio by selling the index future instead of the actual shares where the cost\nof transaction is higher.\n\nBesides mutual funds, stock index futures help in neutralizing market volatility, arising out of sudden\nchanges from the FII flow of funds.\nThere are four hedging strategies in case of index futures:\n\n+ Long stock, short index futures\n+ Short stock, long index futures\n\n+ Hedging a portfolio with short index futures\n+ Hedging with long index futures\n\nLong Stock, Short Index Futures An investor might be a skilled stock picker but a poor market timer.\nHe might feel that the stock is intrinsically undervalued but the entire market may move against his\nthinking even though it is correct. His understanding that the stock is intrinsically undervalued is wrong\nand the stock is not worth more than the market price. Hence to remove risk from fluctuations of the\nmarket index, he takes a long position in a stock plus short position in index. With this strategy, he has\nhedged his index exposure.\n\nSuppose an investor adopts a position of 22 lakh long Infosys on September 1, 2001. He plans to\nhold the position till September 25, 2001. Suppose the beta of Infosys is 1.2. Hence the size of the\nposition that he needs on the index futures to completely remove the hidden index exposure (risk) is\n1.2 2,00,000=%2,40,000. On September 1, 2001, Nifty is 1000 and the nearest futures contract (with\nexpiration November 25, 2001) trading at about 1,020. Suppose each market lot of the futures is 200\nNifties. Hence this market lot is worth %2,04,000. The investor sells 200 Nifties to get the position.\nOn September 21, 2001, Nifty crashed because of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Centre. The\ninvestor unwinds both his positions. He has suffered a loss in the position on Infosys as the market price\ndropped but he earns a profit on short Nifty futures and thereby makes an overall gain.\n\nConsider an investor who buys 1,000 shares of Reliance at 7200 and hedges by shorting 300 Nif-\nties at 2992 each. He closes out his position at the closing price of the next day when Reliance has\ndropped 5 per cent and the Nifty futures have dropped 4 per cent. His Reliance position loses %10,000\n(%2,00,000-\u201421,90,000) and the short position on the Nifty earns him %11,904 (%2,97,600 \u2014 %2,85,696).\nHis overall profit on the position is 1,904.\n\nShort Stock, Long Index Futures If an investor feels that the stock was intrinsically overvalued, then\nhe should take a short position in the cash market and a long position in the index. This position is short\nstock plus long index and helps him to hedge his index exposure.\n\nConsider an investor who sells 1,000 shares of Reliance at %200 each and hedges by buying\n300 Nifties at 2992 each. He closes out his position at the closing price of the next day when Reliance has\nrisen by 5 per cent and the Nifty futures have risen by 4 per cent. His Reliance position loses 710,000 and\nthe long position on Nifty earns him 211,904 leading to an overall profit of 21,904.\n\nHedging a Portfolio with Short Index Futures An investor with a portfolio of shares may have a view\nthat stock prices will fall in the near future. Every portfolio contains a hidden index exposure. Hence,\nthe investor may hedge his portfolio by selling index futures, This strategy makes sense for short periods\nof time when he anticipates a short-term market volatility. This hedging strategy is designed to reduce\nbudget-related volatility. Market volatility increases one week before and two weeks after a budget.\nHence, many investors can avoid these fluctuations by hedging their portfolio with short index futures.\nConsider an investor who has a portfolio consisting of five shares and the total portfolio value\nis %1,90,000. The portfolio\u2019s beta is 0.95, For complete hedging, he needs to sell 0.95x1,90,000\nof the futures, that is, 21,80,500. On February 10, 2002, the Nifty is at 1,125. So he will sell 200\n\nNifties and his short position on the Nifty futures will expire on March 10, 2002, worth %2,25,000. On\nMarch 5, 2002, the Nifty falls to 963. This drop was due to the budget announcement on February 28, 2002.\nOn March 5, 2002, he buys back his futures thus ending his hedging. His portfolio value came down\nto 21,55,000 and his loss on portfolio amounted to %35,000. His profits on the futures hedging are\n%32,400 (%2,25,000 21 ,92,600). Hence, his net loss is 32,600. Had he not hedged his portfolio, his loss\nwould have been 235,000. If the budget announcement had led to a rise in the Nifty, then the investor\nwould have gained.\n\nThis strategy of selling index futures may be of great help to a balanced mutual fund scheme\nwhich decides to reduce its equity exposure. If the mutual funds actually sells its equity holdings,\nthen such selling would depress equity prices to the disadvantage of the scheme and increase cost\nand time taken. Instead of actually selling the required portfolio, the mutual fund can opt for selling\nindex futures at much less cost and with a low impact on the cash market. The mutual fund can then,\non the one hand, undertake actual sale of its holdings, depending on market conditions, and realise\nbest possible prices. On the other hand, the mutual fund can reduce or unwind the short index futures\nposition correspondingly.\n\nAnother advantage of this strategy for mutual funds is that they can preserve the value of portfolio\nduring times of market stress.\n\nHedging with Long Index Futures There are situations in which a person has funds or anticipates\nfunds in the near future and wants to invest in equity shares. However, investing in the stock market is a\ntime consuming process as a person may need to do equity research and decide his portfolio. Moreover,\ncertain mutual funds, such as a closed-ended fund, which has received funds through its initial public\noffering, or an open-ended fund, which has received funds by selling fresh units, require time for stock\nselection and investment. During this time, however, the index may rise. Hence, the investor/fund may\nhave to purchase shares at unusually high prices. This risk can be hedged by buying index futures. Later,\nthe investor/fund can gradually acquire shares and thereby reduce the long index position corresponding.\nThis strategy, therefore, enables the investor/fund to choose shares carefully and spend more time in\nplacing aggressive limit orders.\n",

If the speculator is bearish about the index, then he can sell index futures.\n\nLong Index Futures If the speculator thinks that the index will go up, he should buy the index futures.\nOnce a speculator is long index, using the futures market, he gains if the index rises and loses if the index\nfalls.\n\nConsider a speculator who feels that the index will rise. He buys on August 1, 2002, 200 Nifties with\nexpiration date on August 31, 2002. On August 1, 2002, the Nifty August contract cost him %950 and\nhence his position is worth %1,90,000. On August 16, 2000, Nifty rose to 2957 and the Nifty\u2019s August con-\ntract rose to 7970. He sells off his position at 7970 to make a profit of 74,000.\n\nShort Index Futures If the speculator thinks that the market index will fall, he should sell the index\nfutures. Once a speculator is short index using the futures market, he gains if the index falls and loses if\nthe index rises.\n\nFutures are available at different expirations. Longer dated futures are suitable for long-term forecasts\nof index movement and shorter dated futures are more liquid (e., one with the highest bid-ask spread).\n\u2018The most overpriced futures contract should be sold. There is also a third strategy available for speculat-\ning, which is referred to as basis trading.\n\nBasis Trading This is a strategy of playing the spreads, in which case the speculator trades the\n\u2018basis.\u2019 When a basis risk is taken, the speculator primarily bets on the cost of carry, which is the\ninterest rate in case of index futures going up or going down. In case of the cost of carry going up,\nthe speculator will pay the basis, and in case of the cost of carry going down, the speculator will\nreceive the basis.\n\nPaying the basis implies going short on a future with near month maturity while at the same time going\nlong on a future with longer term maturity. Receiving the basis implies going long on a future with near\nmonth maturity while at the same time going short on a future with longer term maturity.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Arbitrage Strategies\n\n\u2018The index arbitrage is the arbitrage between the index value and the prices of the underlying stocks.\n\n+ If an investor has funds, he can lend this money in the stock market. But he faces two types of\nrisk, namely, price risk of shares and credit risk of default. To avoid these risks, the lender can buy\nall stocks of Nifty in the cash market and simultaneously sell them at a future date on the futures\nmarket. The price risk is completely hedged and there is no default risk as the National Securities\nClearing Corporation Limited (NSCCL) acts as a counter-party.\n\n+ Similarly, if an investor has securities, he can lend these securities and earn a rate of return on them.\nThis mechanism is provided by the index futures market wherein the investor sells off all 50 stocks\nin Nifty and buys them back at a future date, using index futures. The money received from the sale\nof securities can be invested until the futures expiration. The NSE offers the NEAT software through\nwhich an investor can take buy or sell position.\n\n+ Arbitrage opportunities exist if the futures price is less than or greater than the spot price plus the\ncost of carry. If F>S (1+7)', arbitrageurs will borrow funds, buy the spot with these borrowed\nfunds, sell the futures contract, and carry the asset forward to deliver against the futures contract.\nThis is called cash-and-carry arbitrage. If F<S (1 +r)\", arbitrageurs will sell the asset, invest the\nproceeds from this sale, and buy futures cheap. This is called reverse cash-and-carry. This process\ncontinues till the prices are at equilibrium.\n\n+ Arbitrage opportunities arise when the basis between spot and futures or the spread between two\nfutures contracts is incorrect. When the spread between the two futures contracts narrows, the arbi-\ntrageur buys the far month contract and sells the near month contract. When the spread between\ntwo futures contracts widens, the arbitrageur sells the far month contract and buys the near month\ncontract. This mispricing is wiped off as soon as the market arrives at an equilibrium.\n\nIf investors expect a good budget and the market is already long on the March futures, then one could\n\nsell the March futures as March futures are already overvalued and buy the cheapest near month future.\nThe market will then converge to its fair value.\n\nCalendar spreads is a good strategy if the traders have a time-bound view. For instance, if a good mon-\n\nsoon is expected then one could buy the near month and sell the distant month futures.\n\nSimilarly, if it is anticipated that the interest rates will come down then one can buy the near month\n\nand sell the distant month futures. The distant month value could fall and/or the near month value could\nrise due to a change in the carrying cost.\n",

Over-the-counter (OTC) options are private\nagreements between two parties and are tailor-made to the requirements of the party buying the option.\nExchange-traded options are bought and sold on an organized exchange and are standardized contracts.\nMost exchange-traded options are American-style options.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Salient Features of Options\n\n+ Options have a fixed maturity date on which they expire; this is termed expiry date. European-style\noptions can be exercised only on the expiry date while American-style options can be exercised on\nany day before the expiry date. The expiry date is also known as the exercise date, the strike date,\nor the maturity date.\n\n* The price at which the option is exercised is called the exercise price, or strike price. The exercise\nprice is specified in the contract.\n\n+ The person who writes the option is the \u2018option writer.\u2019 The seller of an option is usually referred\nto as \u2018writer.\u2019 The option writer is obliged to buy/sell the shares if the holder (buyer) exercises his\noption. The writer of a call, option is generally bearish and writer of a put option is generally bull-\nish. The writer of a call option must deliver the stock and the writer of a put option must buy the\nstock at the strike prices if the option buyer or seller chooses to exercise his right. The profits/losses\nof options writers equal the losses/profits of the buyers. The maximum profit for the writer in case\nof an option unexercised is the premium received. The writer of a call has unlimited loss potential,\nwhile the writer of a put has limited loss potential. Option writing is risky and hence it requires\na higher degree of understanding risk management ability and an active, regular presence in the\nderivatives market regularly.\n\n* The option premium is the price paid for the option by the buyer to the seller.\n\n* The value of option (premium) depends on the exercise price, the time of expiration, the price\nof the asset involved, the variance of returns of the asset concerned, the risk free rate, and the\ndividends expected during the life of the option. The value of a call generally increases as the\ncurrent stock price, the time to expiration, the volatility, and the risk free interest rate increase.\nThe value of a call decreases as the strike price and expected dividends increase. The value of a\nput generally increases as the strike price, the time to expiration, the volatility, and the expected\ndividends increase. The value of a put decreases as the current stock price and the risk free interest\nrate increases. The non-quantifiable factors affecting the value of the option premium are market\nparticipants\u2019 varying estimates of the underlying assets\u2019 future volatility, an individual's varying\nestimates of future performance of the underlying asset based on fundamental or technical analy-\nsis, the effect of supply and demand both in the options market place and in the market for the\nunderlying asset and the depth of the market for that option\u2014the number of transactions and the\ncontract's trading volume on any given day.\n\nOption pricing models have been developed to assist the traders in keeping the prices of calls\nand puts in proper numerical relationship to each other and helping the trader make bids and offer\nquickly. The Black-Scholes option pricing model and the binomial model are the two most popular\nmodels used to determine the value of an option.\n\n+ An intermediary, usually a clearing house, interposes between the writer and the buyer, and guar-\nantees performance of the contract. It acts as the opposite party to any transaction. The parties can\nterminate their position at any time by making an off-setting transaction.\n\nBox 9.1 Value of Option\n\n\u2018A.call option represents a long position in a stock and a put option represents a short position; therefore, an increase in the stock price\n\u2018increases the value of a call option and reduces the value of a put. The difference between the stock price and the exercise price is known\nas payoff. The payoff from exercising a call option increases when the stock price increases and the exercise price declines. Hence, call\noptions with a lower strike price and put options with higher strike price are valuable. Moreover, the longer the time to expiration, higher\nare the opportunities for the option holder to exercise his option. Hence, both American calls and puts become more valuable as the time\nto expiration increases. Volatility is a measure of the degree of price movement in a particular stock. The increase in volatility is beneficial\nto the option holder as his downside is limited to the price he has paid for the option. An increase in the risk-free interest rate increases\nthe expected return required by investors in the stock and this leads to an increase in the value of a call option but decreases the value of a\nput. A dividend payment reduces the stock price and if higher the expected dividend during the life of the option, lower is the call option\u2019s\nvalue and higher is the put option\u2019s value.\n\n\nExample of a call option: An investor buys a call option to buy 100 Reliance shares at a price of\n300 on October 15, 2002. The current price is \u00a3250 and the premium (price) for the option is %25 per\nshare. The investor will have to pay %2,500 as the premium for buying the call option, which is also\nreferred to as the initial investment. He is entitled to get 100 shares of Reliance at a price of 7300 on\nOctober 15, 2002. If the market price of Reliance goes up to %400, the investor will exercise his right\nby paying %30,000, the original contract price. He can sell these shares in the market at the current\nprice of %400 and get %40,000. The net gain to the investor is 7,500 [(spot price\u2014strike price) -\npremium], that is, [(%40,000-%30,000)\u2014%2,500]. Suppose, the price of Reliance shares goes down to\n200 by October 15, the investor will not exercise his option as he is under no obligation to buy the shares.\nHis loss will be only %2,500, the premium he had paid to buy the call option.\nA call option has unlimited profit potential as there is no upper limit to the stock price.\n\nExample of a put option: An investor buys a put option to sell Reliance shares at a price of $300\nby October 15, 2002. He pays a premium of 825 per share to buy this option. Now if the share price of\nReliance goes down, to say, %200, the investor can exercise his right to sell these 100 shares at the strike\nprice of %300. He will buy 100 shares at 2200 per share to sell them at %300 per share. His net gain\nis 7,500 [(strike price -spot price)\u2014premium)], i.e., [(@30,000-220,000) -82,500]. Suppose, the share\nprice of Reliance goes up to %350, the investor will not exercise his option and his loss will be %2,500 he\nhad paid as premium. It is worthwhile exercising a put option only if the market price of the stock turns\nout to be lower than the strike price. If the strike price is greater than the stock price, the option has an\nintrinsic value. The buyer of an option pays a premium which consists of the intrinsic value, if any, plus\ntime value. The maximum profit from buying a put option is limited only by the fact that the stock price\ncannot fall below zero.\n\nAt any point, several puts are quoted in the market. For instance, Reliance 320, 300, 280, 260, and\n220. There are minimum of five strike prices available. On volatile scrips, the number of strike prices are\naround seven on an average. In case of puts, higher strike prices carry a higher premium and lower strike\nprices carry a lower premium. With lower strike puts, the protection starts late and the investor should\nbe willing to bear loss till the scrip reaches the strike price. With higher strike puts, protection starts the\nmoment the scrip quotes below the strike price.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Options Terminology\n\nUnderlying: The specific security/asset on which an option contract is based. It is the asset whose price\nmovement determines the value of the option.\nOption premium: The price paid by the buyer to the seller to acquire the right to buy or sell.\n\nStrike price: The pre-decided price at which the option may be exercised. It is also known as the exercise\nprice.\n\nThe strike price is linked to the price of the underlying asset in the cash market. The SEBI has stipu-\nlated a minimum of three strike prices\u2014one near the spot price of the asset, one above, and one below.\nBut both the BSE and the NSE offer options at five strike prices\u2014one close to the spot price, two above,\nand two below.\n\nStrike price intervals: The difference between two strike prices, which is a constant, is called strike price\ninterval. The NSE has set a strike price interval of 20 points on its Nifty options while the BSE has set\nstrike price intervals of 50 points on its Sensex options. If Nifty, closes at 71,100 on 26 September (the\nlast Thursday of the month), then on 27 September, the NSE will offer strike price of 1,060, 1,080, 1,100,\n1,120, and 1,140 on the Nifty December option series. The stock intervals of stocks in case of stock\noptions is linked to stock price and a slab structure has been developed by the NSE. For instance, if stock\nprice is below 2100, the strike price interval in case of stock options is %5; if stock price is 7100 to 2200,\nthe strike price interval is 710, and so on.\n\nExpiration date: The date on which the option expires is known as the expiration date. On the expiration\ndate, either the option is exercised or it expires worthless.\n\nExercise date: The date on which the option is actually exercised. In case of European options, the exercise\ndate is same as the expiry date while in case of American options, the options contract may be exercised\nany day between the purchase of the contract and its expiry date.\n\nOpen interest: The total number of options contracts outstanding in the market at any given point of time.\nIn other words, open interest represents the total number of option contracts that have not yet been exer-\ncised, expired, or squared off. A change in open interest in a stock indicates fresh positions being initiated\nor positions being closed. Open interest has to be read in conjunction with the change in price of the stock\nas well as volume. An increase in open interest with rising prices indicates a fresh entry of longs and a\ndecrease of open interest with rising prices indicates profit booking by long position holders. While an\nincrease in open interest with falling price indicates an increase of fresh short positions and decrease in\nopen interest with declining prices, indicates profit booking by short position holders.\n\nOption holder: One who buys an option which can either be a call or a put option. He enjoys the right\nto buy or sell the underlying asset at a specified price on or before specified time. His upside potential\n(profit) is unlimited while losses are limited to the premium paid by him to the option writer.\n\nOption seller/writer: One who is obligated to buy (in case of a put option) or to sell (in case of a call\noption) the underlying asset in case the buyer of the option decides to exercise his option. His profits are\nlimited to the premium received from the buyer while his downside is unlimited.\n\nOption class: All listed options of a particular type (i-e., call or put) on a particular underlying instrument.\nFor example, all Sensex call options or all Sensex put options.\n\nOption series: A series that consists of all the options of a given class with the same expiry date and\nstrike price, For example BSXCMY 300 is an option series which includes all Sensex call options that are\ntraded with a strike price of 2300 and expiry in May [BSX stands for BSE sensex (underlying asset), C\nfor call option, May is expiry date, and strike price is \u20ac300].\n\nAssignment: The process in which a randomly selected option seller is assigned the obligation to honour\nthe underlying contract when the holder of an option exercises his right to buy/sell.\n\nPut\u2014Call Ratio: \\t is the ratio of puts (right to sell) to calls (right to buy) traded in the market. This ratio\nrepresents the number of bearish versus bullish participants. A fall in the put-call ratio (PCR) implies\na higher number of call buyers in the market which indicates that the market sentiment is bullish. It can\nbe computed in two ways\u2014as the ratio of the number of puts traded to the number of calls traded, or the\nnumber of puts outstanding to the number of calls outstanding. The PCR can be calculated for a particu-\nlar stock (say, Infosys), or index (Nifty) or the market as a whole (all stocks in the derivatives segment).\nAn increase in the PCR can be caused by a rise in the number of puts traded/outstanding or a fall in the\nnumber of calls traded/outstanding.\n\nMoneyness: An option concept that refers to the potential profit or loss from the exercise of an option. An\noption may be in the money, out of the money, or at the money.\n\nIn-the-money (ITM) option: When the underlying asset price (S) is greater than the strike price (X) of the\ncall option, that is, S>X. An in-the-money option would lead to a positive cash flow to the holder if it\nwere exercised immediately. For example, a Sensex call option with strike of 4,900 is in the money when\nthe spot Sensex is at 5,100 as S>X. The call holder has the right to buy a Sensex at 4,900 and sell it at\n\n5,100 and make a profit. If the index is much higher than the strike price, the call is said to be deep in the\nmoney. In case of a put option, the put is in the money if the index is below the strike price.\nOut-of-the-money option: When the underlying asset price (S) is less than the strike price (X of the call\noption), that is, S<X. An out-of-the-money option would lead to a negative cash flow if exercised imme-\ndiately. If, in the above example, the Sensex falls to 4,700, the call option no longer has positive exercise\nvalue. The call holder will not exercise the option to buy Sensex at 4,900 when the current index is 4,700.\nIf the index is much lower than the strike price, the call is said to be a deep out-of-the-money option. In\nthe case of a put option, the put is out of the money if the index is above the strike price.\nAt-the-money option: When the option\u2019s underlying asset price is equal to the option\u2019s strike price, that is,\nS=X. It would lead to zero cash flow if exercised immediately.\n\nConsider an investor who buys a one-month Nifty 1,160 call option for a premium of 10. The spot\nvalue of Nifty is 1,140. Hence, the option is out of the money. If the Nifty crosses 1,160, the option is in\nthe money.\n\nCall Option Put Option\nIn-the-money \u2018Spot Price of Underlying Asset> Strike Spot Price of Underlying Asset<Strike Price\nPrice (S>X). (S<xX).\n\u2018At-the-money* Spot Price of Underlying Asset=Strike Spot Price of Underlying Asset=Strike Price.\nPrice.\nOut-of-the-money Spot Price of Underlying Asset<Strike Spot Price of Underlying Asset> Strike\nPrice (S<X). Price (S>X).\n\n* When the market price is very near to the strike price, the option is called near-the-money option.\n\nThe option premium can be broken down into two components\u2014intrinsic value of an option\nand time value of an option.\n\nIntrinsic Value of Options The intrinsic value of an option is the greater of zero, or the amount that\nis in-the-money. Only in-the-money options have intrinsic value. It is defined as the amount by which\nan option is in the money, or the immediate exercise value of the option when the underlying position is\nmarked-to-market.\n\nFor a call option: Intrinsic value =Spot price - Strike price\nFor a put option: Intrinsic value= Strike price - Spot price\nThe intrinsic value of an option must be a positive number or zero. It cannot be negative. For a call\noption, the strike price must be less than the price of the underlying asset for the call to have an intrinsic\nvalue greater than zero. In other words the intrinsic value of a call is max (S\u2014X, O), which means the\nintrinsic value of a call is the greater of S\u2014X or O. For a put option, the strike price must be greater than the\nunderlying price for it to have intrinsic value. In other words, the intrinsic value of a put is max (X~\u2014S, O).\n\nTime Value of Options The time value of an option is the difference between its premium and its\nintrinsic value. Time value is the amount option buyers are willing to pay for the possibility that the\noption may become profitable prior to expiration due to favourable change in the price of the underlying.\nThus, it is a payment for the possibility that the intrinsic value might increase prior to the expiry date. The\nmagnitude of the options\u2019 time value reflects the potential of the option to gain intrinsic value during its\nlife. Prior to expiration, options will almost have some time value, the exceptions are deep in-the-money\nEuropean options. When an option is sold, rather than exercised, time value is received in addition to the\nintrinsic value. Time value cannot be negative. An option loses its time value as its expiration date nears.\nTime value premium decreases at an accelerated rate as the option approaches maturity. At expiration, an\noption is worth only its intrinsic value.\n\nA call that is out of the money or at the money has only time value. Usually, the maximum time value\nexists when the option is at the money.\n\nOne of the factors that determine time value is the market expectation of price volatility. If the market\nexpectation of price volatility of an underlying asset is high, the time value will also be high, reflecting\nthe strong possibility of a substantial increase in intrinsic value.\n\nTime value premium is maximum when the stock price and the strike price are the same. When stock\nprice is far above or below the strike price, the option is worth only its intrinsic value. Consider a stock\nwhich is currently selling at %50. The call option to buy the stock at %49 costs %4. Here, the call premium\n\nis %4, which is a sum of both the intrinsic value and time value. The intrinsic value of the option is 71\n(50-49). The time value is %3 (4-1).\n\nCash settled: When the investor is paid the difference between the strike price and the market price on\nexpiry it is referred to as \u2018cash settled\u2019. Index options are always cash settled as physical settlement of the\nindex itself is impractical.\n\nDelivery-based settlement: When a put buyer delivers the scrips on the day of expiry and the seller is paid\nthe expiry price, it is referred to as a \u2018delivery-based settlement.\u2019 In case of calls, the buyer of a call gets\nthe delivery of the scrips and makes the payment. Delivery-based settlement is expected to be introduced\nin India in the coming future.\n\nLEAPS (Long-term Equity Anticipation Securities): In India, options generally expire within three months\nor less. LEAPS are a variation of standard option contracts in the sense that they are long dated with an\nexpiration date upto three years into the future. These long-term options provide the holder the right to\npurchase (in case of a call), or sell (in case of a put), a specified amount of the underlying stock at a pre-\ndetermined price for a specified period of time, which can be upto three years in the future. LEAPS enable\ninvestors to trade for the long-term without making an outright stock purchase.\n\nOption Greeks: Tools to measure the sensitivity of the option price to certain factors, such as stock price,\ntime to expiry, volatility, interest rate, and amount and timing of dividends. Sometimes options become\ncomplicated when used in combinations or two or more factors affect option price simultaneously which\nlead to complications in analysis. Analytical tools are available, which help in simplifying complicated\noption position. These analytical tools are collectively referred to as Greeks and individually as delta,\ntheta, gamma, rho and vega. Greeks are used by professional traders for trading and managing the risk of\nlarge positions in options.\nThe various option Greeks are as follows:\n\nDelta: Measures the sensitivity of an option\u2019s premium/price to a change in the value of the underly-\ning asset. Delta is the ratio of the change in an option\u2019s price for a small change in the price of the\nunderlying asset. An option\u2019s delta may be positive or negative. An option that has a positive delta will\nincrease in value as the underlying asset increases in value; it will decrease in value as the underlying\nasset decreases in value. A negative delta means that an option\u2019s price moves in an opposite direction\nfrom that of the underlying asset\u2019s price. A long call and short put have a positive delta as their values\nrise and fall along with the underlying asset. A long put and a short call have negative deltas.\nGamma: Measures the change in delta of an option for a change in the price of the underlying asset.\nGamma is expressed as a number between zero and one for both calls and puts. Gamma can be\npositive or negative. A positive gamma means that an options\u2019 delta rises and falls along with the\nunderlying asset. A negative gamma means that the delta of an option will decrease with the increase\nin the underlying price and will increase with the decrease in the underlying price. The long call and\nthe long put have a positive gamma as their delta increase and decrease with the underlying asset.\nThe short put and the short call have a negative gamma.\n\nTheta: Measures the rate at which an option\u2019s time premium diminishes as time passes. The theta of\nan option is expressed as a negative number so as to reflect the losing theoretical value of an option.\nTheta is always negative for both calls and puts as with a decrease in the time to maturity, the option\nloses value. Theta is the most negative for at-the-money option and low for deep in or out-of-the-\nmoney option. However, theta can be high for out-of-the-money options with high implied volatility.\nIn a delta-neutral portfolio, theta is used as a proxy for another option Greek, gamma. Options that\nhave a negative theta have a positive gamma and vice versa. Both, theta and gamma together provide\nuseful information concerning the risks of holding the position over time.\n\nRho: Measures the change in the option price for a change in the risk-free interest rates. In other words,\nit measures the sensitivity of option prices to changes in interest rates. Rho is a positive number for\ncalls and a negative number for puts. Long-term options have greater thos than short-term options.\nHence, the greater the amount of time to expiry the greater the effect of change in interest rates. Rho is\nusually ignored as a measure of risk as interest rates change slowly and in small magnitudes.\n\n+ Vega: Measures the sensitivity of an option\u2019s price to a change in its implied volatility. The options\nthat have the same strike prices but have longer time to expiry have larger vega as volatility has more\nopportunities to make its presence felt. Vega is the rate of change of the option price with respect\nto volatility of the stock. A high vega implies that the option is highly sensitive to small changes in\nvolatility.

If they are not traded, they\nwill not exist. The profit of one trader is the loss of another.\nHowever, futures and options are significantly different from cach other in the following ways:\n\nFutures are contracts to buy or sell specified quantity of underlying assets at an agreed price on or\nbefore a specified time. Both the buyer and seller are committed or obligated to buy/sell the under-\nlying asset. By contrast, in case of options, the buyer enjoys the right and not the obligation to buy\nor sell the underlying asset. Thus, options are rights for buyers and obligation for sellers.\n\nFutures contracts have symmetric risk profile for both the buyer as well as the seller, whereas options\nhave an asymmetric risk profile. In case of options, for a buyer or holder of the option, the downside\nis limited to the premium he has paid while the profits may be unlimited. For a seller or writer of an\noption, the downside is unlimited while profits are limited to the premium received from the buyer.\nFutures contracts prices are affected mainly by the prices of the underlying assets. Option prices are\ninfluenced not only by the prices of the underlying asset but also by the time remaining for expiry\nof the contract and volatility of the underlying asset. Thus, options provide exposure to a number\nof dimensions.\n\nIt costs nothing to enter into a futures contract whereas there is a cost of entering into an options\ncontract, termed as premium.\n\nRegulatory complexities are greater with options as compared to futures contract. Moreover, options\ntrading strategies can be highly complicated as compared to futures trading strategies.\n\nBoth, financial futures and options are available world over as they together provide the users with a\nwide array of hedging instruments.\n",

Corporations\nuse them in their financing decisions to control risk.\n\nOptions are a means of insurance against adverse price movement. A call option is a means of ensur-\ning a maximum purchase price and a put option provides a minimum selling price. A hedger uses options\nwhen the price movement is uncertain. So, options supply the insurance needed to overcome the uncer-\ntainty in prices.\n\nOptions provide high leverage as with a small investment in the form of premium, one can take expo-\nsure in the underlying asset of much greater value.\n\nThere is a pre-known maximum risk and a large profit potential for an option buyer.\n\nEmployers stock options (ESOPs) have become a popular compensation tool with more and more\ncompanies offering the same to their employees. ESOPs are subject to lock-in periods, which could\nreduce capital gains in falling markets. An ESOP holder can buy put options in the underlying stock and\nexercise the same if the market falls below the strike price and lock-in his sale price.\n\nMany investors trade options to speculate on the price movements of the underlying stock.\n\nInstitutional investors, such as mutual funds and pension funds, use options to adjust the risk-and-\nreturn characteristics of their portfolio.\n\nTrading in options is cheaper than trading in stocks due to lower transaction costs in options trading.\n\nOptions provide a means of taking a short-position on a stock by buying puts or writing calls. Options\nallow speculators to take views on the direction of stock price movements, on the speed and extent of such\nmovements, and on changes in market expectations and extent of price volatility.\n\nOptions help creating synthetic products which reveal and increase the trading potential of otherwise\nnot traded assets/contract.\n",

The buyer of an option has\nto pay a premium at the time the option is bought. As the buyer is not obliged to exercise an option, he can\nsimply disregard it or not exercise it, in which case he loses the premium paid.

But there is no upper limit to his potential profits if prices of\nthe underlying asset go up. His break-even point is equal to the strike price plus premium.\n\nConsider a share whose strike price is 100 per share and the call premium is %6 per share. If,\nat expiration, the share price is 2100 or lower, the option expires worthless. The call buyer will lose the\npremium of %6 per share. If the share price on the expiration date is 7106, the call buyer breaks even\n(7100 strike price plus %6 premium less %106 share price on expiration). At any share price above 8106, the call\nbuyer will profit. Hence, for every one rupee rise in the stock price, the call is worth @1 more.\n\n\u2018The buyer of a call option is said to have a long call position. There are no margin requirements for a\ncall option buyer. Time affects the call buyer adversely as with passage of time the value of the call option\nfalls to nearly zero.\n\nCall Option Seller For every buyer of an option, there must be a seller who is usually referred to as the\nwriter. The seller of the call option is said to have a short call position. The seller is moderately bearish\nas he expects the prices of the underlying asset to go down. As options are zero-sum games, profits of\nthe buyer must equal losses of the seller, and vice versa. The seller or writer of a call option must deliver\nthe stock at the strike price agreed upon if the buyer chooses to exercise the option. The call option seller\nreceives the premium from the buyer. He is subject to margin requirement. This margin can change on\na day-to-day basis, depending predominantly on the price of the scrip itself. The call option seller's risk\nprofile is unlimited, if prices go up. His profit potential or maximum profit is limited to the premium\nreceived. His break-even point is equal to the strike price plus premium received. A call option will fall in\nvalue if the underlying scrip or index falls. The investor, in such a case, should buy it back and earn profits.\nSuppose, Reliance is quoting at 2285 and the Reliance 280 call is quoting at %20. If Reliance falls to 7265\nin a week, the call might have moved down to 710. The investor, on buying it back, earns a profit of 710.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Pricing Options\n\nOptions values or prices are derived from theoretical models. The Black-Scholes option pricing model\nis the most popular model which provides the theoretical price of options. The other popular models are\nthe binomial model developed by Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein and the Addison Whaley model. These are\nslightly more sophisticated than the Black-Scholes model but option values derived from these models\nare not significantly different. The Black-Scholes option calculators are available on various websites,\nand spreadsheets come with a built in Black-Scholes options pricing formula. Hence, an investor need\nnot memorise the formula; he needs to just key in the basic parameters of the formula.\n\nBlack-Scholes Option Pricing Model This model was originally developed for European-style\noptions on non-dividend paying stocks by Fischer Black and Myron Scholes.\n\nThe Black-Scholes pricing model assumes that percentage change in the price of underlying follows a\nnormal distribution. This model uses lognormal rather than normal distributions to avoid the possibility of\nnegative stock prices. A variable with a normal distribution can take any positive or negative value, while\na lognormal distributed variable can take only positive values. A normal distribution is symmetrical, a\nlognormal distribution is skewed with the mean, median, and mode all different. According to Black and\nScholes, stock returns have a lognormal distribution meaning that the logarithm of the stock\u2019s return will\nfollow the normal (bell-shaped) distribution.\n\nAlthough not the first, the pricing model was the first model to reduce the number of computations\nnecessary for deriving the values.\n\nThe factors affecting the determination of options pricing are the underlying stock price, the exercise\nprice, time to expiry, volatility, and the risk-free rate.\n\nUnderlying stock price: The underlying stock price does not remain constant. Any future changes\nin the underlying stock price may affect the value of an option, hence the underlying stock price is\nimportant for determining the value of an option.\n\nStrike/exercise price: The strike price remains fixed throughout the life of an option and never\nchanges.\n\nTime until expiration: An option\u2019s expiration date is fixed for the life of the option. There is a direct\nrelationship between an option\u2019s price and amount of time until the option\u2019s expiration. Options\nthat have a distant expiry date trade at a premium relative to those that are approaching expiry. The\ntheoretical value of the option decreases as the time to expiry decreases.\n\nInterest rates: The interest rate is the cost of carrying the option. The higher the interest rate, the\nhigher the call price and the lower the put price. The lower the interest rate, the lower the call price\nand the higher the put price. The theoretical value of an option is affected by the correlation between\na change in interest rates and the amount of time until expiry.\n\nVolatility: Volatility is the fluctuation in the price of the underlying. It is a measure of the speed and\nmagnitude at which the underlying stock price changes. If the movement in the price of a security\nis quite high as compared to the index, the security is more volatile than the index. Volatility is\nthe standard deviation of the daily returns on an underlying. Volatility is a very important variable\naffecting an options price. The higher the volatility, the higher the option premium.\n\nThe other inputs or factors are readily determinable but determining volatility is a difficult task. More-\nover, as exposure to all other inputs or factors can be hedged away, the price of the option then entirely\ndepends on volatility.\n\nThere are different ways to measure volatility.\n\n+ Historical volatility is a measure of actual changes in an underlying over a specific period in the past.\nIt is often referred to as actual volatility or realized volatility. It measures how active a stock price is\nover a certain period of time. Short-term traders use shorter time periods such as 5-day, 10-day, 20-day\nand 30-day while intermediate and long-term investors use 60-day, 180-day or 360-day for measuring\nhistorical volatility. The most common measure of volatility is standard deviation. It is calculated by\ntaking the daily percentage price changes in a stock and finding the average of the deviations from the\nmean. The average is then expressed as an annualized percentage by multiplying the daily standard\ndeviation by the square root of 250, which is the average number of trading days in a year.\n\n+ Forecast volatility is an estimate of expected changes in an underlying over a specific period in the\nfuture.\nImplied volatility is the market's assessment of the expected volatility of the underlying. It acts as a\nproxy for option value. Options with different strike prices and expiration dates will have a different\nimplied volatility. Even within the same expiration, options with different strike prices will have a\ndifferent implied volatility. Implied volatility can be derived by entering the current market price of\nan option into the pricing model along with other factors. The number that is derived is the volatility\nthat the market is using to price the option\u2014the implied volatility. Hence, an option trader will first\nof all find out the historical volatility of a stock and factor into the historical volatility his anticipa-\ntions of the future to arrive at a best guess of future volatility of the stock.\n\nAfter arriving at his best estimate of future volatility of the stock, the trader will compare his estimate\nwith the volatility determined by the market known as the implied volatility.\n\nImplied volatility might or might not be equal to the trader\u2019s estimate of future volatility. If the implied\nvolatility is greater than the trader\u2019s estimate, it implies that either the market is expecting the future\nvolatility to increase or that the market is mispricing the option or that there is some good news about the\ncompany that could move the price favourably. If the implied volatility is less than the trader's estimate,\nit implies that the option is underpriced or the market believes that the stock will now trade at a low level\nor there is some bad news which might affect the price of the stock adversely.\n\nHence, volatility serves as a benchmark for knowing overpriced and underpriced options and the\nextent of mispricing.\n\nIn the Black-Scholes option pricing model, only two of the above factors are allowed to change,\nnamely, the time to expiry and the underlying stock price.\n\nBlack and Scholes use the stochastic calculus to define how the option price changes when stock price\nand time to expiry are changed.\n\nThe Black-Scholes model relating to non-dividend paying stocks can be expressed as follows:\nwhere\n\nC=S.N(d,)-Ke\u2122. Nd.)\nP=Ke\" N(-d,)-SN(-d,)\nwhere\ndj= In SIK + (r +0220 NT\ndy = d,-oNT\n\nwhere\nCis the call price.\nPis the put option price.\nSis stock price.\n\nN (is the cumulative normal distribution. N(d,) is called the delta of the option which is a measure\nof change in the option price with respect to change in the price of the underlying.\nKis the strike price.\n\ne is the exponential (which has the constant value of 2.7182818 and appears on most hand-held\ncalculators).\n\nr is the risk-free annualized interest rate as a decimal. If annual risk free rate is 12% then r is In\n1.12 or 0.1133.\n\nTis the time to expiry in years. If Tis given in days or months, it has to be converted into years. If\ntime to expiry is 22 days, then 7 in the formula should be 22/365=0.06.\n\n@ is the annualized standard deviation of stock returns (volatility) as a decimal. When\ndaily sigma are given they need to be converted into annualized sigma. @ annual=o dailyx\n(Number of trading days in a year. On an average, there are 250 trading days in a year. If daily o is\n1.95, then annualized sigma is 1.95 x v1.95 = 31 per cent or 0.31. e\u201d\u201d is a discount term similar to\n1(1+r)\u2019 and it discounts the present value of a future sum of money on a continuous basis.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "OPTIONS TRADING STRATEGIES\n\nOption Spreads\n\nThe risk profile of option buyers and sellers is different. Option buyers are exposed to unlimited profits\nand limited losses position and option sellers are exposed to unlimited losses and limited profits position.\nSpreads create a limited profit and loss profile for both buyers and sellers. An option spread involves tak-\ning a position in two or more options of the same type (i.e., two or more calls or two or more puts). For\nexample, buying a call and selling another call either with a different strike or a different expiration is\ntermed as a spread. A spread is used to take a bull position or a bear position, or to finance the purchase\nof other options. Option spreads are important for speculators.\n\nThere are different types of spreads and the degree of risk reduction differs among the different\ntypes of spreads. Option spreads may be categorized as vertical spread, horizontal spread and diagonal\nspread.\n\nVertical Spreads Vertical spreads involve the simultaneous buying and selling of options on the same\nunderlying instrument for the same expiration date but with different exercise prices. Vertical spreads are\nalso called price spreads.\n\n1. Bull spread: A spread that is created by buying a low strike price option and selling a high strike\nprice option on the same stock. It is designed to profit if the price goes up. When an investor thinks that\nthe market is more likely to rise than fall, he enters into a bull spread hoping that the market price will\nincrease. A bull spread can be created with calls or with puts.\n\nThe buyer of a bull spread buys a call with an exercise price below current index and sells a call option\nwith an exercise price above the current index. He hopes to profit from a rise in the index and hence the\n\nvis\n\nspread is termed as a bull spread. This bull spread limits both the upside potential as well as the downside\nrisk. The pay-off is the difference between the strike price of a call option bought and the strike price of\nthe call option sold (Figure 9.3).\n\nSuppose an investor buys one market lot of February 1,100 Nifty calls at 96 a call and sells\none market lot of February 1,200 Nifty calls for %60 a call. If Nifty closes between 1,100 and\n1,200, the pay-off is the amount by which the index exceeds 1,100. In this case, suppose the index\ncloses at 1,160 on the expiration date, then the pay-off is %60. The cost of setting up the spread is\n36 (96-60)\u2014the difference between the call premium paid and received. The net profit from the posi-\ntion is %24 (60-36).\n\nThe bullish option spread (with calls) produces a net initial debit since a low strike price option is more\nexpensive than a high strike price option.\n\nThe maximum profit is equal to the higher strike price less the lower strike price less net premium\npaid; the maximum loss is equal to lower strike premium less higher strike premium (or net premium\npaid). The breakeven price is equal to lower strike price plus net premium paid.\n\nThere are three types of bull spreads:\n\n* Both calls initially out of the money.\n* One call initially in the money, the other call initially out of the money.\n* Both calls initially in the money.\n\nThe first type is the most aggressive bull spread as it costs very little to set up and has a small prob-\nability of giving a relatively high pay-off. The second type is not so aggressive a bull spread while the third\ntype is the least aggressive most conservative bull spread. The decision as to which of the three spreads\nto undertake depends upon how much risk the investor is willing to take.\n\nProfit\nStrike Price B\n\nBreak-Even Point\n\nStrike Price A\nLoss\n\nFigure 9.3 Bull Spread\u2014Pay-off Using Call Options\n\nIn case of put options, the bull spread consists of buying a put with a lower exercise price and selling\na put with a higher exercise price. It produces a net initial credit as the high strike price option is more\nexpensive than the low strike price option. The maximum profit is equal to the net option premium\nincome (or net credit); the maximum loss is equal to the higher strike price less the lower strike price\nless net premium received, Break-even price is equal to the higher strike price less the net option pre-\nmium income.\n\n\u2018The margins on call-based bull spreads will be far lower than that on put-based bull spreads. The pos-\nsibility of losses in call-based spreads is negligible as the differential premium is paid upfront.\n\nAn investor can create 42 spreads on one scrip in one month series\u201421 spreads on calls and 21 on\nputs.\n\n2. Bear spread: An investor who enters into a bear spread has mild to moderate bearish perspective,\nie., he is hoping that the prices will decline. A spread that is designed to profit if the price goes down is\ncalled a bear spread. Bearish vertical spreads are created by buying a high strike option and selling a low\nstrike option. Bearish spreads can be created with calls or with puts.\n\nBearish vertical spreads with calls are created by the sale of a call with a low strike (exercise) price\nand purchase of call with a high strike (exercise) price. It produces a net credit strategy since a low strike\nprice option is more expensive than a high strike price option. The maximum profit is equal to the net\npremium received and the maximum loss is equal to the higher strike option price less the lower strike\noption price less the net premium received. The break-even price is equal to lower strike price plus net\npremium received. Thus, the bear spread with call options not only limits the trader's risk but it also limits\nthe profit potential, i.e., it limits both the upside potential as well as the downside risk (Figure 9.4).\n\n\nProfit\nStrike Price A\n\nBreak-Even Point\n\u2018Strike Price B\n\nFigure 9.4 Bear Spread\u2014Pay-off Using Call Options\n\nSuppose an investor buys one market lot of February 1,500 Nifty calls at %60 a call and sells one\nmarket lot of February 1,400 Nifty calls for 296 a call. If Nifty closes at 1,420 on the expiration date, his\nprofits gets reduced to the extent it falls short of the lower strike. In this case, the index falls short of the\nlower strike by 20. Hence, his pay-off is $96 -60-20=R16.\n\nIn case of bearish option spreads with puts, the investor buys a put with a high strike price and sells a\nput with a low strike price. This produces a net debit strategy as a high strike price option is more expen-\nsive than a low strike price option. The maximum profit is equal to the higher strike price option less\nthe lower strike price option less the net premium paid. The maximum loss is equal to the net premium\npaid. The break-even price is equal to the higher strike price less the net premium paid. Thus, the upside\npotential and downside risk is limited.\n\nA vertical spread is used by an investor when he believes that the prices will move only to the strike\nprice that generates maximum profit.\n\nHorizontal or Calendar Spread A horizontal or calendar spread is a spread where the options used\nhave the same strike price but different expiration dates. A calendar spread trading strategy is used by an\ninvestor who thinks that the market will be weak in the short-term but rally in the long-term. The investor\nmakes an attempt to gain from the declining time value of options. Calendar spread can be created with\ncall options as well as put options.\n\nA calendar spread can be created by selling a short maturity call option with a certain strike price and\nbuying a longer maturity call option with the same strike price. The two option series would be identical\nin every respect except the expiry month. The short option position is a liability while a long option posi-\ntion is an asset. The value of the liability declines more quickly than the value of the asset. Hence, the\noption should be allowed to run to the expiry date. As the longer maturity option is expensive, a calendar\nspread requires an initial investment. The investor makes a profit if the stock price at the expiration of the\nshort maturity option is close to the strike price of the short maturity option, otherwise a loss is incurred.\nThe downside risk is limited to the initial debit incurred for establishing the spread. The break-even point\nat expiry is the strike price plus premium. There is a risk of the sold option being called, i.e., exercised.\n\u2018A calendar spread can be created with call options as well as put options.\n\nIn a calendar spread with put options, the investor buys a long maturity put option and sells a short\nmaturity put option. In a bullish calendar spread, a strike price higher than the current stock price is cho-\nsen while a bearish calendar spread involves a lower strike price. In a reverse calendar spread, the investor\nbuys a short maturity option and sells a long maturity option.\n\nDiagonal Spreads This spread combines both vertical and horizontal features. In a diagonal spread,\nboth the expiration date and the strike price of the calls are different.\n\nA diagonal bull spread is adopted when the investor is bearish in the immediate near term and bullish\nin the long-term. In other words, the investor thinks that the market will be weak in the short-term but\nthen rally later. Hence, a near-dated call option is sold and a longer dated out-of-the-money call option is\nbought. The upside potential is unlimited if the bought option is held after the short option expires. The\ndownside risk is limited to the difference in strikes plus/minus the initial debit/credit when establishing\nthe spread. But there is a risk of the sold options being called or exercised.\n\nA diagonal bearish strategy is adopted when the investor thinks that the market will be flat or rise\nonly slightly in the short-term, but will then fall later. In this strategy, a near-dated put option is sold and\na longer-dated out-of-the-money put is bought. The upside potential is large if the bought option is held\nafter the short option expires. The downside risk is limited to the difference in strikes plus/minus the ini-\ntial debit/credit when establishing the spread but there is a risk of the sold options being called.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Volatility Trading\n\nVolatility trading is taking positions on changes in market expectations of price volatility. The main strate-\ngies for trading volatility are straddles, strangles, and butterflies. Straddles and strangles are examples of\n\u2018combinations\u2019 which are option trading strategics that involve taking a position in both calls and puts on\nthe same stock.\n\nStraddle Straddle is a position of buying a put and call with the same price and expiration date.\nStraddle is an expensive strategy as the trader pays two premiums. But a price swing in either direction\ncompensates this high cost.\n\nThe investor believes that the price of the underlying asset will either rise or fall significantly but does\nnot know the direction of the price movement. Major pronouncements such as divestment, budget time,\nacquisitions announcement by companies, and lawsuits to be decided on a particular day are good times\nto buy straddles.\n\nA long straddle is buying one put and one call option simultaneously on the same stock at the same\nexercise (strike) price with same maturity. A short straddle is a simultaneous sale of two such options at\nthe same strike price and expiration date (Figure 9.5).\n\nThe long straddle is also referred to as bottom straddle and short straddle as a top straddle. The pur-\nchaser of a long straddle takes the view that volatility will be high in the future, whereas the seller of a\nstraddle takes the view that volatility will be low (marginal). The profit potential on a long straddle is\nunlimited on the upside and limited on the downside, while profit potential on a short straddle is limited\nto the receipt of the premium, which occurs if the price at the expiration is the same as the strike price of\nthe options. The maximum loss on long straddle is the loss of premium paid and occurs if the price at the\nexpiration is the same as the strike price of the options while loss on a short straddle is unlimited on the\nupside and limited on the downside. A short straddle is a highly risky strategy.\n\nSuppose an investor feels that the stock price is likely to move significantly in the next three months.\nThe stock is currently trading at %690. A three-month call with a strike price of $700 costs %40 while a\nthree-month put with the same strike price costs 30. The trader buys both the put and the call. If the stock\nprice is 700 in three months, the strategy costs the trader 270 (40 plus %30). The buyer will profit from\nthis strategy only if the stock price moves further away from %700. Suppose the stock price is 7900 the\nstrategy leads to a profit of 7130 (\u00ae900-%700-%70). If the stock price moves down to %550, the strategy\nleads to a profit of 280.\n\nLong Straddle Short Straddle\nProfit Profit For Seller\n\u00b0 \u00b0\nFor Buyer Loss\nStock Price Stock Price\n\nFigure 9.5 Pay-off Profile of Straddles\n\nStrangle Like a straddle, a strangle is the buying/selling of a combination of one call option and\n\u2018one put option with same maturity. But unlike straddle, strangle has different exercise prices. Ina strangle,\nthe call has an exercise price above the stock price and the put has an exercise price below the stock\nprice.\n\nA long strangle is buying one put and one call option at different strike prices as the trader expects\na significant movement in prices. A long strangle is an aggressive form of straddle position. The profit\npotential is unlimited on the upside and limited on the downside while the maximum loss is the loss of\npremium paid.\n\nA short strangle is selling one call and one put option at different strike prices. The seller expects that\nthe market prices will move marginally or be less volatile. This is a conservative form of straddle position.\nThe profit potential is limited to the receipt of the premium and the loss is unlimited on the upside and\nlimited on the downside (Figure 9.6).\n\nLong Strangle Short Strangle\n\nProfit Profit\nor-* 7 fe) x x\nLoss Loss|\n\nFigure 9.6 Pay-off Profile of Strangle\n\nButterfly Spreads A butterfly spread is a combination of a bull and bear spread. This strategy is used\nwhen the investors expect that the stock prices will not significantly rise or decline by expiration. This\nposition is created by buying two call options, one with a relatively low strike price X1, and the other with\na relatively high strike price, X3 and selling two call options with a strike price X2, half way between X1\nand X3. Thus, X1<X2<X3.\n\nStrike Price (\u00ae) Call Price (\u00ae)\n85 10\n90 7\n95 5\n\nIn a butterfly spread, risk and profits are limited. Maximum profit is realized if the stock price at expira-\ntion is close to X2 (Figure 9.7).\n\nSuppose a stock is selling for 291. The prices of call options expiring in six months are quoted as fol-\nlows:\n\nThe investor can create a butterfly spread by buying one call with a %85 strike price (X1), buying another\ncall with a 295 strike price (X3) and selling two calls with a 290 strike price (X2). This costs the investor\n%10+%5\u2014(2x%7)=2 1. The net loss would be equal to 21, if the stock price moves outside the range of 886\nto %94, but would lead to a maximum profit of %4, if the stock price is %90 at the expiration date. If the stock\nprice is 290, the long call with an exercise price of 295 loses its full purchase price of 25. The long call with\nan exercise price of 285 loses %5 (5 stock profit minus 710 purchase price). Together, the long calls lose 210.\nThe short call gives a profit of 27 per option, for a profit of 214 on the two options. This gives a net profit of\n4 if the stock price is 290.\n\nBy using put options, the investor buys two puts, one with a low strike price and another with a high\nstrike price and sells two puts with an intermediate strike price.\n\nA limitation of this strategy is that it may be difficult to execute it quickly.\n\nProfit\n\n\u00b0 | 1 1 1 Stock Price\n\nLoss\n\nFigure 9.7 Pay-off from a Butterfly Spread\n\nA butterfly spread can also be created with the help of only put or a combination of one call and\none put.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Arbitrage with Options\n\nPure arbitrage is the process of making riskless profits from mispricing without the arbitrageur\u2019s own\nresources being used. If the arbitrageur\u2019s own capital is used, the process is known as quasi-arbitrage. An\narbitrageur buys/sells the derivative while simultaneously taking an opposite position on a synthetically\nconstructed derivative. Arbitrage tends to maintain certain option-price relationships. A systematic price\nrelationship must exist among the various assets that can be combined to create synthetic assets.\n\nPut-Call Parity The put and the call prices are related by a condition called put-call parity, Put-call\nparity is nothing more than the observation that buying a put is equivalent to selling the underlying and\nbuying a call, The put-call parity explains the relationship between put, call, stock, and bond prices. The\nput-call parity is a relationship between the price, c of a European call option on a stock, and the price, p,\nof a European put option on a stock. It is expressed as:\n\nS+p=c+\u2014\u2014\n? dant\nwhere,\n\u2018S = Spot price of the underlying\n= Price of European put option\nPrice of European call option\nExercise price of options\nT = Time to expiration\nr = Risk-free rate of interest\n\nAccording to the above equation, the value of a European call with a certain exercise price and exercise\ndate can be deduced from the value of a European put with the same exercise price and date, and vice\nversa.\n\nIn other words, pay-off from holding a call plus an amount of cash equal to a\nthat of holding a put option plus the underlying. (l+r)\n\nIS+pee ay ,then an arbitrage opportunity exists. Suppose S is Index, then we can think of\nF\n\nindex plus put as portfolio A and call plus cash [\n\nis the same as\n\nx\n(l+ry\nrelative to portfolio B, the arbitrageur would sell the securities in portfolio A and buy the securities in\nportfolio B.\n\nSuppose Nifty stands at 1065, the risk free rate of interest is 12 per cent per annum, the price of a\nthree-month Nifty 1060 call is 290.00 and the price of a three-month Nifty 1060 put is %60. In this case,\n\nxX\n\n1065 + 60 = 90 + 1060\n(1.12)\n\nJu portfolio B. If portfolio A is overpriced\n\n= 1125 > 1120.43.\n\nPortfolio A is overpriced relative to portfolio B.\n\nHence, to exploit the arbitrage, the arbitrageur should sell the index plus a put and buy a call. This strategy\ngenerates a positive cash flow of 71,035.00 (1,065 +60.00\u2014-90.00). When invested at the risk-free interest rate of\n12 per cent, this grows to 71,065.05. If the index at expiration of the option is greater than 1,060, the call will be\nexercised. If it is less than 1,060, the put will be exercised. In either case, the investor ends up buying the index\nat %1,060. Hence, the net profit on the entire transaction is %5.05 (i.e., 71,065.05\u20141,060).\n\nIf portfolio B is overpriced relative to portfolio A, an arbitrageur can short the securities in portfolio B\n(sell a call) and buy the index and a put.\n\nFor a dividend paying stock, the put-call parity relationship is\n\nx\n\nPut-call parity does not hold for American options.\n\nArbitrage Beyond Upper and Lower Bounds There are six factors affecting the value of an option\nbefore expiration. They are: the price of the underlying stock, the exercise price of the option, the time\n\nremaining until expiration, the risk-free rate of interest, the volatility of the underlying assets and dividends\nexpected during the life of the option. These factors set the general boundaries for option prices. If the\noption price is above the upper bound or below the lower bound, there are profitable opportunities for\narbitrageurs.\n\nUpper bounds: A call option gives the holder the right to buy a stock or an index for a certain price.\nAs the option can never be worth more than the stock/index, the stock price/index is an upper bound to\nthe option price.\n\nC<S, where\n\nC=Price of call option\n\nS=Current stock price/current index level\n\nIf the above relationship does not hold true, an arbitrageur can easily make a riskless profit by buying\nthe stock and selling the call option.\n\nA put option gives the holder the right to sell a stock/index for a price X. No matter how low the stock\nprice/index level becomes, the option can never be worth more than X. Hence, PSX.\n\nIf the above relationship does not hold true, the arbitrageur would make a profit by writing puts.\n\nLower bounds: The lower bound for the price of a call option is S\u2014X (1+r)\". If the price of a call is\nnot worth at least this much, then it will be possible to make riskless profits.\n\nIf the call is available at a premium which is less than the lower bound, that is, if S# X (l+r)7<C, the\narbitrageur can buy the call and short the stock/index and earn riskless profits.\n\nConsider a three-month Nifty call option with a strike price of 1,060. The spot index stands at 1,150.\nThe risk-free rate of interest is 12 per cent per annum. In this case, the lower bound for the option price\nis 1150-1060 (1 +0.12)\u00b05=1150\u20141030.40=%119.60. If the call premium falls below 2119.60, arbi-\ntrage opportunities exist. Suppose the call is available at 7115, an arbitrageur can buy the call and short\nthe index. This provides a cash flow of 21150 -%115=21035. If 21035 is invested for three months at 12\nper cent per annum, then 71035 grows to 71066.05. At the end of the expiry of the option, the index can\nbe either above 1,060 or below 1,060. If the index is above 1,060, the arbitrageur exercises his option\nand buys back the index at 1,060 making a profit of %1,066.05\u20141,060=%6.05. If the index is at say\n1,050, the arbitrageur buys back the index at the market price, ie., 1,050 and makes a higher profit of\n21,066.05 \u2014 1,050=%16.05.\n\nThe lower bound for the price of a put option is X (I+r)\"-S.\n\nThe price of a put must be worth at least this, otherwise it will be possible to make riskless profit.\n\nIf the price of a put is not worth at least this, then it will be possible to make a riskless profit. If the put\nis available at a premium which is less than the lower bound, that is, if X (l+r)-\u2019\u2014S<P, the arbitrageur\ncan buy both the put and the stock/index by borrowing money and earn riskless profits.\n\nConsider a two-month Nifty put option with a strike of 1,260. The spot index stands at 1,185. The risk-\nfree rate of interest is 12 per cent per annum. The lower bound for the put option is X (1+r)7-S= 1260\n(1+0.12)\"% =1185=851.50. Suppose the put is available at a premium of 40, the arbitrageur can bor-\nrow %1225 for two months to buy both the put and the index. At the end of the two months, the arbitra-\ngeur will be required to pay at 12 per cent per annum, %1249.50. At the end of the two months, the index\ncan be either below 1,260 or above 1,260. If the index is below 1,260, the arbitrageur will exercise the\noption of selling the index at 1,260, repaying the loan amount of 1249.50 and thereby making a profit\nof 210.50. If the index goes upto 1,270, the arbitrageur will discard the option, sell the index at 1,270,\nrepay the loan amount of 1249.50 and make a higher profit of 21270 \u20141249.50=%20.50.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Hedging with Options\n\nOptions are a means of hedging (insurance) against adverse price movement which have no directions.\nA call option is a means of ensuring a maximum purchase price and a put option ensures a minimum\nselling price. The purchase of a put option, or alternatively, selling of a call option are a means of hedg-\ning against a price fall. The purchase of a call option or, alternatively, selling of a put option are a means\nof protection from a price rise. The strategy of writing options is preferable if the price change is not\nsignificant or is modest whereas buying options is a better strategy if the price movement is significant\nor substantial.\n\nCovered Writing Covered writing refers to selling call options corresponding to assets held or selling\nput options when the liquidity for the purchase of the underlying asset is held. Writing covered calls\ninvolves writing call options when the asset that might have to be delivered are already owned. For\n\nexample, a writer writes a call on Infosys and at the same time holds shares of Infosys so that if the call\nis exercised by the buyer, he can deliver the stock.\n\nA call option that is not covered by an opposite position in the underlying asset is called a naked call.\nIn case of a naked call, if the option holder exercises his right, the writer will have to purchase the under-\nlying asset to meet his call obligation, his loss will be the excess of purchase price over the exercise price\nof the call reduced by the premium received for writing the call. However, in case of covered calls, the\nworst that can happen is that the investor is required to sell shares already owned at below their market\nvalue. Hence, covered calls are less risky than naked calls.\n\nAs the investor expects prices to remain stable/go mildly up, he establishes a position of long on\nunderlying and short on call, i.e., buying the stock and selling a call option on stock. It is similar to selling\na put option. This strategy reduces the cost of acquisition, but the receipt of premium limits the upside\npotential. It offers an opportunity to earn while holding the underlying.\n\nThe reverse of writing a covered call is a short position in a stock combined with a long position in a\ncall option.\n\nCovered Call This is a bearish strategy wherein the investor holds the underlying asset and sells a\ncall. Through this strategy, he avoids unlimited losses by selling the underlying assets that he is holding,\nwhenever the need arises. The number of call options sold will be determined by the investor's market\nview and the size of stock holding. The investor's maximum profit is equal to the strike price minus\nthe market price plus the premium received. (Figure 9.8) Moreover, an investor is subject to margin\nrequirements. Suppose an investor is currently holding Reliance, which is quoting at \u20ac280. He is bearish\non Reliance and feels that the price of Reliance will fall to 2250 in the next month. Hence, he sells a\ncall with strike price of 2270 for 825, which is his income. Suppose on the expiry date, the price of\nReliance shoots up to %300 (against his expectations). Hence, he as a seller of the call will pay 30\n(Reliance price on expiry and strike price, i.e., 300\u2014%270). As he holds the shares of Reliance, his\nloss on call is offset by the appreciation of his holding, which is 720 (\u00ae300-%280). His overall profit is\nequal to income from sale of call plus appreciation in holding minus payout on exercise of call=\u00ae25 +\n%20-830=215.\n\nThis covered call strategy can also be used by an investor who is bullish on a scrip but expects that\nthe price will not move beyond a particular limit. This strategy enables him to reduce his overall effective\ncost. Suppose Reliance is quoting at 2285 and an investor believes that the price of Reliance will not move\nbeyond %300 in the next month. The investor can buy the scrips or its futures for 285 and simultaneously\nsell a call on the scrip with strike price of %300 for 215. The investor thus reduces his effective cost of\nacquisition to %270 (2285 less %15 premium received). But there is a risk of opportunity loss if the market\nrises. The investor gives up all appreciation benefits beyond 2300.\n\nLb\n\nStrike Price\nFigure 9.8 Covered Call: Long Stock, Sell Call\n\nProfit/Loss.\n\nProtective Put Strategy This strategy involves buying a put option on a stock and the stock itself. A\nprotective put consists of a long position in a put option combined with a long position in the underlying\nasset. It is equivalent to a long position in a call option plus a certain amount of cash. A protective put\nstrategy is used when an investor expects market prices to go down. Protective put strategy escalates the\ncost of acquisition. But this escalated cost limits the downside risk.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "DERIVATIVES MARKET IN INDIA\n\nIn India, commodity fatures dates back to 1875. The government banned futures trading in many of the\ncommodities in the 1960s and the 1970s. Forward trading was banned in the 1960s by the government\ndespite the fact that India had a long tradition of forward markets. Derivatives were not referred to as\noptions and futures but as \u2018tezi-mandi.'\n\nIn exercise of the power conferred on it under Section 16 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act,\nthe government, by its notification issued in 1969, prohibited all forward trading in securities. However,\nthe forward contracts in the rupee dollar exchange rates (foreign exchange market) are allowed by the\nRBI and used on a fairly large scale. Futures trading is permitted in 41 commodities. There are 18 com-\nmodity exchanges in India. The Forward Markets Commission, under the Ministry of Food and Consumer\nAffairs, acts as a regulator.\n\nIn the case of capital markets, the indigenous 125-year-old badla system was very popular among the brok-\ning and investor community. The advent of foreign institutional investors in the nineties and a large number of\nscams led to a ban on badla. The foreign institutional investors (FIIs) were not comfortable with this system and\nthey insisted on adequate risk-management tools. Hence, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)\ndecided to introduce financial derivatives in India. However, there were many legal hurdles which had to be\novercome before introducing financial derivatives. The preamble of the Securities Contract (Regulation) Act,\nstates that the act was to prevent undesirable transactions in securities by regulating business of dealing therein,\nby prohibiting options, and by providing for certain other matters connected therewith. Section 20 of the act\nexplicitly prohibits all options in securities. The first step, therefore, was to withdraw all these prohibitions and\nmake necessary amendments in the act. The Securities Laws (Amendment) Ordinance, 1995, promulgated on\nJanuary 25, 1995, withdrew the prohibitions by repealing Section 20 of the SC(R)A, and amending its preamble.\n\nLater on, it was found that there was no regulatory framework to govern trading of derivatives. Hence,\nthe SEBI set up a committee under the chairmanship of Dr L. C. Gupta on November 18, 1996, to develop a\nregulatory framework for derivatives trading in India. The committee submitted its report on March 17, 1998.\n\nOne of the major recommendations of the committee was to expand the definition of \u2018securities\u2019 to\ninclude derivatives within its ambit so that trading in derivatives could be introduced and regulated under\nSC(R)A. In order to make the necessary amendments in the act, the Securities Contracts (Regulation)\nAmendment Bill, 1998, was introduced in the Lok Sabha on July 4, 1998, which was then referred to the\nStanding Committee on Finance (SCF) on July 10, 1998, for examination and reporting thereon. This bill\nlapsed following the dissolution of the 12th Lok Sabha. A new bill, the Securities Laws (Amendment)\nBill, 1999, incorporating the amendments proposed in the earlier bill and suggestions of the SCF was\nintroduced in the Lok Sabha on 28 October 1999. The act inserted Clause (aa) in Section 2 to define\nderivatives to include (a) a security derived from a debt instrument, share, loan whether secured or unse-\ncured, risk instrument or contract for differences or any other form of security, and (b) a contract which\nderives its value from the prices or index of prices of underlying securities. It also inserted sub-Clause (ia)\nin Section 2(h) to include derivatives within the ambit of securities. The act allows only exchange-traded\nderivatives and prohibits over-the-counter traded derivatives.\n\nIn June 1998, the SEBI constituted a group under the Chairmanship of Prof. J. R. Verma to recommend.\nmeasures for risk containment in the derivatives market to be followed by all exchanges. The group submit-\nted its report in October 1998 and the main recommendations were accepted by the SEBI in March 1999.\n\nOn March 1, 2000, the government lifted the three-decade-old prohibition on forward trading in secu-\nrities by rescinding the 1969 notification.\n\nDerivatives trading formally commenced in June 2000 on the two major stock exchanges, the BSE\nand the NSE. Futures trading based on the Sensex commenced at the BSE on June 9, 2000, while futures\ntrading based on the S&P CNX Nifty commenced at the NSE on June 12, 2000.\n\nThe SEBI set up a technical group to lay down the broad framework for risk management of index\noptions. The trading in index options commenced in June 2001 and trading in options on individual secu-\nrities commenced in July 2001. Trading in stock futures commenced in January 2002.\n\nNew products such as interest rate futures contracts and futures and options contracts were introduced\nin June 2003 and August 2003 respectively.\n\nFils and NRIs have been permitted to invest in all exchange traded derivative contracts.\n\nExchange traded derivatives contracts on a notional 10-year government bond have been allowed for\ntrading.\n\nStock brokers have been allowed to trade in derivatives.\n\nThe NSE is the leading stock exchange for both equity and derivatives trading. More than 99 per cent\nof the contracts take place on the NSE. The NSE has trained more than 11,200 investors in the intricacies\nof derivatives.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Derivatives Market at the NSE\n\nTrading Mechanism The futures and options trading system of the NSE, called NEAT-F&O trading\nsystem, provides a fully automated screen-based trading for the S&P CNX Nifty futures on a nationwide\nbasis and an online monitoring and surveillance mechanism. It supports an order-driven market and is\n\naccessed by two types of users: trading members and clearing members. The trading members (TMs)\nhave access to functions such as order entry, order matching, order and trade management while the\nclearing members (CMs) use the trader workstation for the purpose of monitoring the trading member(s)\nfor whom they clear the trades. They can also enter and set limits to positions which a trading member\ncan take. At present, there are more than 200 derivative members on the NSE. An investor has to sign\na client-broker agreement with a member of the derivatives segment before undertaking derivatives\ntrading. A fresh agreement is not needed for options trading if an agreement is already signed for index\nfutures trading. The investor has to pay a commission to his broker-member on the value (strike price\nplus premium) of his contract. Brokerage rates range between 0.1 and 0.2 per cent of the contract value.\nAn option buyer does not have to pay margins but an option seller has to pay daily marked-to-market\nmargins to the exchange. The broker-member is required to give a contract note for all options and futures\ntransactions done by an investor within 48 hours of the trade.\n\nThe minimum contract size in the derivatives market is 5 lakh and the market lot for every scrip is\nprescribed corresponding to the minimum size. A derivatives investor can deal only in multiples of the\nprescribed market lot. The market lot determines the margins or premium to be paid in order to enter into\na derivatives contract.\n\nThe NSE reduced the lot size for derivative trades in 24 stocks from April 1, 2005. The lot size was\npruned as the stock prices of these scrips had gone up. As a result, the value of derivative contracts\nexceeded the prescribed minimum value of %2 lakh. In many scrips, the value of derivative contracts\nexceeded %4 lakh and this prohibited many investors to participate in the derivatives market. Hence, the\nderivative contracts with a contract size/value of more than %4 lakh were halved and the revised market\nlot size was arrived at by dividing the existing market lot by two. The lot size of the S&P CNX Nifty is\n50, S&P CNXMINIFTY 20, Nifty Midcap 300, CNXIT 100, and Bank Nifty 50.\n\nTo start trading in the derivatives market, an investor has to make an initial deposit with a broker which\nmay vary from 15,000 to %50,000 depending on the size of the positions he wishes to take and the instru-\nment (futures/options) he is interested in. This deposit is collected by the broker to pay initial and mark-\nto-market margins. Margins have to be paid on all futures positions (long as well as short) and on short\noptions positions. Buying options requires no margins, only the upfront premium is to be paid. Margins\nare comparatively lower on trading in index futures and options rather than on stock futures and options as\nvolatility in the index is lower than in individual stocks. Brokerage rates in the derivatives market ranges\nfrom 5\u201425 paise, depending on the broker and the volume of business done.\n\nClearing and Settlement The National Securities Clearing Corporation Limited (NSCCL) undertakes\nclearing and settlement of all deals executed on the NSE\u2019s derivatives segment. It acts as a legal counter-\nparty to all deals on the derivatives segment and guarantees settlement. NSCCL has developed a\ncomprehensive risk containment mechanism for the derivatives market. The actual margining happens on\na daily basis and online position monitoring on an intra-day basis.\n\nSettlement System The Nifty Index futures are cash settled. Index options on the Nifty are European-\nstyle, which means that they can only be exercised upon maturity. In case of futures, settlement is done\non a daily basis by marking to market all open positions on the basis of daily settlement price. Members\nare required to pay the mark-to-market losses by T+ 1 day. The contracts are finally settled on the expiry\nof the Nifty Index Futures Contract. Index options contracts on the Nifty have a daily premium settlement\nand a formal settlement on the exercise day.\n\nMutual Funds and Derivatives The SEBI has permitted mutual funds to trade in derivatives. Mutual\nfunds can use derivatives only for hedging and portfolio balancing. Mutual funds have to hold the cash\nor underlying security equal to the total exposure they take in derivatives. Hence, there is no scope for\nspeculation. In other words, mutual funds cannot use leverage.\n\nOther guidelines of the SEBI state that a fund's offer document has to clearly state that the fund can use\nderivatives. The fund has to keep its trustees updated (informed) regularly. The mutual fund has to take an\napproval of the shareholders to take positions in the derivatives market.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Stock Index Options\n\nStock index options are options where the underlying asset is a stock Index. For example, the S&P CNX\nNifty or the BSE Sensex are the underlying securities. Index options were first introduced by the Chicago\nBoard of Options Exchange (CBOE) in 1983 on its index S&P 100. The CBOE is the largest exchange\nfor trading stock options. In index options, one buys or sells the \u2018entire stock market.\u2019 as a single entity.\nIndex options give an investor the right to buy or sell the value of an index, which consists of a certain\nnumber of stocks.\n\nIndex options enable investors to gain exposure to a broad market with one trading decision and with\none transaction. This reduces the transaction costs. The premium of index option, a percentage of the\nunderlying value, is also low.\n\nBoth individual investors and professionals, such as mutual fund managers, use stock index options.\nIndividual investors use stock index options to capitalize on market options (bullish, bearish, or neutral)\nby acting on their views of the broad market or one of its sectors. Professionals use stock index options as\ntools for enhancing market timing decisions and adjusting asset mixes for asset allocation.\n\nIn case of stock index options, an investor can exercise his option only on the last day. These are called\nEuropean-style options. Stock index options are cash settled.\n\nThe index options contract has a minimum size of %5 lakh and a maximum maturity of 12 months\nwith a minimum of three strikes: in the money, near the money, and out of the money. Both the NSE and\nthe BSE offer seven strike prices. The lot size for Nifty and Sensex is 200 units and 100 units, respec-\ntively. A portfolio-based margining approach is adopted so that an integrated view of the risk involved\nin the portfolio of each client is possible. For instance, if the Nifty is 1,500 and if an investor is bullish\non the market, he can buy one contract (of a lot size of 200) of Nifty October for say 220 each. The\ninvestor pays a premium of (820x200) %4,000. If the strike price is 81,550, the investor will break-even\nat the Nifty level of 1,570 (1,550+20). If at expiration, the Nifty rises by 5 per cent or rises to 1,575,\nthe investor makes a profit of &5 per Nifty (1,575~ 1,570) and a total profit of 21000 (5x 200). If Nifty\ngoes to or below 1,570 at expiration, the investor will not exercise the option and will lose the entire\npremium of 4,000.\n\nAll futures and options on stocks are American-style, while the index options and futures are Euro-\npean-style. Currently, both index and stock options are cash settled.\n\nIndividual Stock Options Individual stock options are contracts where the underlying asset is an\nequity stock. They are mostly American-style options, i.e., they can be exercised on any day during their\ntenure. Prices are normally quoted in terms of premium per share although each contract is for a larger\nnumber of shares.\n\nSuppose an investor bought a June Infosys put (a right to sell) on April 3 at a strike price of 23,800\npaying a premium of %650. On that day, spot Infosys was %3,300. The option is \u2018in the money\u2019 as the\nstrike price is greater than the spot price. If it is exercised immediately, the investors profit of 500\n(%3,800 \u2014%3,300) is less than the premium of %650 a shortfall of 7150. The investor will make a profit\nwhen Infosys falls below %3,150. Stock options are exercised at the closing spot prices of the underly-\ning stock.\n\nIndividual stock options provide a wide array of trading strategies to both hedgers and speculators.\nInvestors can insure their portfolio of equity stocks by buying a protective put. Individual stock options\nenable investors to enjoy more leverage in the form of greater exposure by paying a small amount of\npremium. Individual stock options are beneficial to ESOP (Employee Stock Options) holders. ESOPs are\nsubject to lock-in periods and this lock-in period could reduce capital gain in falling markets. Hence, an\nESOP holder can buy a put option in the underlying stock and exercise the same if the market price falls\nbelow the price of the stock.\n\nIn India, options contracts on individual securities are American style and cash settled (Table 9.1).\nCash settlement encourages large speculative practices. Cash settlement offers savings in delivery-related\ncosts and induces time and effort for participants. But manipulators on taking large long or short positions\n\nattempt to either inflate or depress the prices in the spot market. Hence, SEBI is planning to enforce deliv-\nery based settlement in option contracts on individual stocks.\n\nStock Index Futures Stock index represents a change in the value of a set of stocks over the base year.\nThis set of stocks constitute the index. For example, the BSE Sensex is a weighted average of the prices\nof 30 shares and S&P CNX Nifty is a weighted average of the prices of 50 shares.\n\nStock index futures are futures contracts where the underlying asset is the index. Trading in stock\nindex futures means that market participants are taking a view on the way the index will move. Stock\nindex futures are merely a tool to guess the mood of the market over the period of the contract. The\nmarket participants buy the entire stock market instead of individual securities by taking a position on\nindex futures. Index futures can be used for hedging, speculating, arbitrage, cash flow management,\nand asset allocation. Index futures are settled in cash but investors are required to pay a small frac-\ntion of the total contract as margins. With relatively small amount of margins, the investor can take a\nposition that is higher than the value of the risk capital actually invested. This is known as leverage or\ngearing. Stock index futures enable shuffling of portfolios to change the composition of assets. It car-\nries no risk of dishonour of commitment as the clearing corporation of the exchange is a counter-party\nto every trade.\n\nStock index futures are available on the BSE Sensex, S&P CNX Nifty, CNXIT, CNX Nifty Junior,\nCNX 100, Nifty Midcap 50 and the CNX Bank Indices (Table 9.2).

Thus, if the index value is\naround 1,000, then the appropriate value of a single index futures contract is %2,00,000. In case of\nthe BSE Sensex, the minimum market lot is fixed at 50 times the index. In other words, a minimum\nof 50 contracts of Sensex futures. If the index value is around 5,000, then the appropriate value of a\nsingle index futures contract on the BS) %2,50,000. The minimum tick size for an index futures\ncontract on NSE is 0.05 units and the minimum tick size on BSE is 0.1 Sensex points. Thus, a single\nmove in the index value on the NSE would imply a price (gain or loss) of 810 (%0.05%200 units) on\nan open position of 200 units. In case of BSE Sensex, the tick size is equivalent to %5 (tick size x\nmultiplier, i.e., 0.1 50).\n\nStock index futures are more suitable to institutional and large equity holders as they provide portfolio\nhedging facility. Pension funds in the US use stock index futures for risk hedging. Stock index is dif-\nficult to be manipulated as compared to individual stock prices. Moreover, stock index is much less than\nindividual stock prices. Due to low volatility, capital adequacy and margin requirements are low, which\ninduce more players to participate in the market.\n\nStock Futures Stock futures are futures contracts on the shares of individual companies. The contract\nspecification for stock futures on NSE is given in Table 9.1. Stock futures are simple compared to stock\noptions. Suppose an investor is bullish on Reliance which is currently quoting at 2290 per share. The investor\nexpects Reliance price to move up to 7340 in the next month, If the investor buys Reliance for 2290 and sells\nat 2350 he makes a profit of 50 which turns out to be a return of 17 per cent in one month. Instead of buying\nthe scrip if the investor buys stock futures, then he has to merely pay a margin of, say, 20 per cent and can earn\na profit of 250 on an investment of 258. His rate of return is 86 per cent in one month.\n\nAs stock futures in India are not linked to delivery, an investor should buy stock futures when he\npredicts an upward price movement and sell futures when he anticipates a downward price movement.\nStock futures provide the advantage of leverage. Traders can carry forward positions and investors can\ntake a position in the market by paying a small amount called margins. The risks are that losses will also\nget leveraged or multiplied as profits do. A safe strategy for an investor is to go long on futures when they\ntrade at a premium and short when the cost of carrying is negative.\n\nHedging effectiveness increases with stock futures rather than index futures. It is relatively easier to\narbitrage the difference in the price of the underlying stock rather than hedge the index.\n\nStock futures have features similar to the badla system. In vyaj badla, the broker used to buy\nshares at lower rates and sell at higher rates. Similarly, in stock futures, investors take advantage\nof price differences in the cash market and the futures market. But stock futures are superior to\nbadla as the cost of carrying futures (the interest or premium) is known to both the seller and the\nbuyer at the time of entering into a contract. In badla, the returns were dependent on the demand-\nand-supply situation of stocks/funds, and decided on a weekly basis. Similarly stock futures can\ncombine positions in futures as well as options to take advantage of upside profits and cover the\ndownside losses as well.\n\nThe number of contracts provided in options on index is based on the range in previous day\u2019s closing\nvalue of the underlying index and applicable as per Table 9.3.\n\nTABLE 9.3 | Strike Price Intervals\n\nIndex Level Strike Interval Strike Introduced\nUpto 2,000 50 41-4\n>2,001 Upto 4,000 100 6-1-6\n>4,001 Upto 6,000 100 6-1-6\n>6,000 100 TAT\n\nSource: NSE, Factbook, 2008-09.\n\nThe above strike parameters scheme are applicable for all long terms contracts also.\n\nIndividual stock futures are not very popular in some countries as price volatility in individual stocks\nis much higher than the index. price volatility leads to higher risk of clearing corporation and levy-\ning of higher margins. Hence, individual stock futures in some countries suffer from lack of depth and\ntrading. While, in India, due to its similarity with badla trading, stock futures have become popular and\ncontribute to 32 per cent of the total turnover of the derivatives segment. Since January 2008, the average\ndaily volume in stock futures in terms of the number of contracts being traded on the NSE is the highest\nin the world.\n\n",

The possible reasons for greater trading interest in the\noptions could be that the Security Transaction Tax (STT) on options is chargeable on option premium\nvalue, and thus could be lower in term of value than that of futures where it is chargeable on notional value\nand also the trading in options enable market participant's to deploy various trading strategies to earn\nupfront premium that may be used to off-set losses or enhance gains in their trading position in futures\nor in cash market.\n\nBetween the period FY 2004-05 to FY 2016-17, the compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) for\nturnover in cash market has been 11.39 per cent, whereas CAGR for turnover in equity derivatives has\nbeen 35.10 per cent. The market capitalization of listed companies (BSE) has grown by 17.82 per cent\nCAGR during this period. It is also observed that the ratio of turnover of equity derivatives to equity cash\nhas increased from 1.54 to 15.59 during the aforesaid period. The increase in the turnover over the years\nmay be attributed to various reasons including the higher index levels and increase in stock prices result-\ning in growth of national turnover, reduced STT on equity futures from 0.017 per cent to 0.01 per cent\nand introduction of commodity transaction tax at 0.01 per cent on non-agricultural commodity futures in\nthe Budget 2013, etc. Over the years, more than 95 per cent of equity derivative trading in India happens\non NSE.\n\nFutures and options on NIFTY are available for trading in other jurisdictions, namely, Singapore\nExchange Ltd.

The proprietary trades, i.e., trading by stock brokers on their pro-\nprictary account dominate trading in Index options. Non-Institutional Non-Proprietary category which\nincludes individual investors and proprietary category together contributed around 85 per cent of the total\ntrading volume in index options. One possible reason for the active trading by proprietary trades in deriva-\ntives especially options could be upfront income in the form of option premium on writing of options.\nForeign investors contribute between 15 per cent-20 per cent in the total volume across all product cat-\negories available in equity derivatives segment.\n\nSEBI has taken steps to develop the cash market by initiating measures, such as, introduction of new\nproducts, redesigning existing products, conducting investor awareness initiative, etc. SEBI has revised\nthe margin trading facility by rationalising initial margin requirements in cash market, permitting stocks\nas collateral for availing funding from stock brokers, ete.\n",

The debt market in most\ndeveloped countries is many times bigger than the other financial markets, including the\nequity market. The US bond market is more than USD 35 trillion in size with a turnover\nexceeding 500 billion daily, representing the largest securities market in the world. The size\nof the world bonds market is close to USD 47 trillion which is nearly equivalent to the total\nGDP of all the countries in the world.\n\nThe total size of the Indian debt market is currently estimated to be in the range of USD\n150 billion to 200 billion. India\u2019s debt market accounts for approximately 30 per cent of its\nGDP. The Indian bond market, measured by the estimated value of the bonds outstanding, is\nnext only to the Japanese and Korean bond markets in Asia. The Indian debt market, in terms\nof volume, is larger than the equity market. In terms of the daily settled deals, the debt and\nthe forex markets currently (2012-13) command a volume of 2575 bn against a meagre 7133\nbn in the equity markets.\n\nIn the post-reforms era, a fairly well-segmented debt market has emerged comprising the\nfollowing:\n\n* Private corporate debt market\n* Public sector undertaking bond market\n* Government securities market\n\n\u2018The government securities market accounts for more than 90 per cent of the turnover in\nthe debt market.

Banks were the major participants\nin the government securities market due to statutory requirements. The turnover in the debt\nmarket too was quite low at a few hundred crores till the early 1990s. The debt market was\nfairly underdeveloped due to the administered interest rate regime and the availability of\ninvestment avenues which gave a higher rate of return to investors.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the government needed a large amount of money for investment in\ndevelopment and infrastructure projects. The government realized the need of a vibrant, effi-\ncient, and healthy debt market and undertook reform measures. The Reserve Bank put in\nsubstantial efforts to develop the government securities market but its two segments, the\nprivate corporate debt market and public sector undertaking bond market, have not yet fully\ndeveloped in terms of volume and liquidity.\n\nThe debt market plays a key role in the efficient mobilization and allocation of resources\nin the economy, financing the development activities of the government, transmitting signals\nfor implementation of the monetary policy, facilitating liquidity management in tune with\nboth short-term and long-term objectives, and pricing of non-government securities in finan-\ncial markets.\n\n\nIt is the debt market which can provide returns commensurate to the risk, a variety of instruments\nto match the risk and liquidity preferences of investors, greater safety, and lower volatility. Hence, the\ndebt market has a lot of potential for growth in the future. The debt market is critical to the development\nof a developing country like India which requires a large amount of capital for achieving industrial and\ninfrastructure growth.\n\nRegulation of the Debt Market The RBI regulates the government securities market and money\nmarket while the corporate debt market comes under the purview of the Securities Exchange and Board\nof India (SEBI).\n\nIn order to promote an orderly development of the market, the government issued a notification on\nMarch 2, 2000, delineating the areas of responsibility between the Reserve Bank and the SEBI. The con-\ntracts for sale and purchase of government securities, gold related securities, money market securities and\nsecurities derived from these securities, and ready forward contracts in debt securities shall be regulated\nby the RBI. Such contracts, if executed on the stock exchanges shall, however, be regulated by SEBI in a\nmanner that is consistent with the guidelines issued by the RBI.\n",

Most primary debt issues are privately placed or auc-\ntioned to the participants while secondary market dealings are negotiated over the telephone. The\nNSE Wholesale Debt Market Segment (WDM) has emerged as an active platform for trading in debt\ninstruments. Recently, the BSE also started trading in debt instruments. The primary dealers act as\nmarket makers in the government securities market. The debt market has become more diversified\nwith the entry of new participants such as high net worth individuals, cooperative banks, large cor-\nporates, mutual funds, and insurance companies.\nThe major participants in the debt market are as follows:\n\n* Central and state governments: The central government raises money through the issue of dated\nsecurities and treasury bills to finance the budget deficit and other short-term and long-term finan-\ncial requirements. The Reserve Bank is the investment banker, which performs the task of raising\nmoney and issuing securities on behalf of the government.\n\nThe state government, municipalities, and local bodies also issue securities to finance their budg-\netary deficits and developmental projects,\n\n* Primary dealers: They are market makers appointed by the Reserve Bank and have emerged as\nactive intermediaries in the government securities market and money market.\n\n+ Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs): They issue tax-free and taxable bonds to meet their longterm\nand working capital needs. They also invest in debt securities to park their surplus funds.\n\n* Corporates: They are both issuers and investors in the debt market.\n\n+ Banks: They are the captive investors in the government securities market. They participate both as\nlenders and borrowers in the call money market and as arrangers and investors in the commercial\npaper market. They issue certificates of deposits (CDs) to finance their short-term requirements and\nbonds to finance their long-term requirements.\n\nBox 10.1 Risks Associated with Debt Secut\nRisks associated with debt securities:\n\nand Trading in Debt Securities\n\n* Default/Credit Risk: The issuer of a debt security may be unable to make timely payment of interest or principal amount or comply with\nthe provision of a bond indenture.\n\n+ Interest Rate Risk: Risk arising from an adverse change in the interest rate which affects the yield on the existing instruments.\n\n+ Reinvestment Rate Risk: The probability of a fall in the interest rate resulting in lack of options to invest the interest received at\nregular intervals at higher rates or at comparable rates in the market.\n\nRisks associated with trading in debt securities:\n\n* Counter-party Risk: Risk arising due to the inability of the opposite party to the contract to deliver either the promised security or\nthe sale value at the time of settlement.\n+ Price Risk: Risk arising on account of the inability to receive the expected price due to an adverse movement in the prices.\n\nSource: BSE\n\n+ Mutual funds: Mutual funds are the predominant investors, in the debt market. They have special-\nized debt funds such as money market mutual funds, gilt funds, and so on. They have also emerged\nas active participants and traders in the debt market.\n\n+ Insurance companies: They have been permitted to invest in the debt market and the limits of\n\ninvestment have been specified by the IRDA.\n\nForeign Institutional Investors (FIIs): They have been permitted to invest in government securities\n\nand corporate bonds. The limits of their investment have been specified.\n\n+ Provident Funds (PFs) and pension funds: They are large investors in government securities and\n\nPSU bonds. They are not active traders in their portfolios.\n\nCharitable institutions and trusts: They are large investors in government securities and bonds\n\nspecified in the bye-laws governing them. They are also not active traders in their portfolios.\n\nSatellite dealers (SDs) were also one of the participants in the debt market but the Reserve Bank\n\ndiscontinued their participation from May 2002.\n\nIn the government securities market, the Negotiated Dealing System (NDS) has replaced the system\nof negotiations through telephones. The Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL) has revolutionized\nthe clearing and settlement system in the government securities market. Both the NDS and the CCIL have\nbrought about a radical transformation in the debt market similar to that brought about by NSE in the\nequity market.\n",

The private placement market is more attractive because the cost of raising a loan is only half\nof that of raising loans from the market. Under the current guidelines, corporates are required to report\ndetails of resources raised through private placements to the stock exchanges~BSE and NSE. This was\naimed at giving investors a good idea of how the companies propose to use these funds and also guage the\nrisk return allowed. In mid-2006, the US private placement market was opened up for Indian companies.\nReliance Industries Limited became the first Indian company to tap the US private placement market,\nraising $300 million through a 10-12 year loan. More Indian companies are likely to tap this market.\n\nThe debt instruments are traded on the OTCEI, the BSE, and the WDM segment of the NSE. The BSE\nis the first exchange in the country to provide an electronic trading platform for corporate and other non-\ngovernment debt securities through the order-matching system. The clearing and settlement of the trades\nis undertaken through the clearing house of the exchange.\n\nAt present, bond deals in India are struck over phones, following which the players report the transac-\ntions on NDS. The negotiated dealing system (NDS) is used predominantly as a reporting platform. The\nRBI wants the price discovery, order matching and deals to take place on the NDS. The BSE, NSE and\nFIMMDA have launched trading and reporting platforms to promote transparency in corporate debt mar-\nket. FIMMDA is the reporting platform while NSE and BSE serve as both trading and reporting platforms.\n\nThe National Stock Exchange of India Ltd set up a separate segment for trading in debt securities\nknown as the Wholesale Debt Market segment of the exchange. In fact, the NSE commenced operations\nin June 1994 with the WDM segment of the exchange. Prior to the commencement of trading in the WOM\nsegment of the NSE, the only trading mechanism available in the debt market was the telephone. The NSE\nprovided, for the first time in the country, an online, automated, screen-based system known as NEAT\n(National Exchange for Automated Trading) across a wide range of debt instruments. NEAT supports an\nanonymous order-driven market and also provides on-line market information system.\n\nIn the WDM trading system, there are two markets: (a) Continuous Market, and (b) Negotiated Mar-\nket. In the continuous market, the buyer and seller do not know each other and they put their orders. If the\norders match, it results in a trade which is settled directly between the participants. In the NEAT-WDM\nsystem, all participants can set up their counter-party exposure limits against all probable counter-parties\nwhich enables them to reduce/minimize the counter-party risk. In the negotiated market, trades take place\noutside the exchange but are reported to the Exchange and disclosed to the market through NEAT-WDM\nsystem. In the negotiated market, no counter-party exposure limit needs to be involved as the participants\nare familiar with each other.This system is an order-driven system which matches the best buy and sell\norders on a price time priority and simultaneously protects the identity of the buyer and the seller. Trading\nunder this system leads to a risk-free, efficient price mechanism and transparency.\n\nInitially, government securities, T-bills, and bonds issued by public sector undertakings were made\navailable for trading. Now this range has been widened to include non-traditional instruments, such as\nfloating rate bonds, zero coupon bonds, index bonds, commercial papers, certificates of deposit, corporate\ndebentures, state government loans, SLR and non-SLR bonds issued by financial institutions and local\nbodies, units of mutual funds, and securitized debt.\n\nOn the NSE-WDM segment, brokers are involved merely in order execution for their clients. Besides bro-\nkers, there are two types of entities in this segment: trading members and participants. Trading membership is\nopen to corporates, subsidiaries of banks and financial institutions, satellite dealers and primary dealers who\nhave a minimum net worth of \u00ae2 crore. They can place orders and execute trades on the system. Participants take\ndirect settlement responsibility for trade executed on the exchange on their behalf by an NSE trading member.\n\nParticipants comprise large investors such as banks, primary dealers, and institutions who are not members of\nNSE and therefore, cannot directly transact but effect transactions through the NSE-WDM segment.\n\nThe government security trade on the WDM segment could be outright trade or repo transactions with\na flexibility for ing days of settlement which, in turn, is to be clearly specified. However, for non-\ngovernment securities only outright transactions are allowed. All outright secondary market transactions in\ngovernment securities are settled on T +1 basis from May 24, 2005. In case of repo transactions in govern-\nment securities, the first leg can be settled either on T +0 basis or T + 1 basis. All outright transactions of non-\ngovernment securities can be settled up to T+2. All trade in government securities is reported to RBI-SGL\nthrough the Negotiated Dealing System (NDS) or the order matching of RBI. The Clearing Corporation\nof India Limited (CCIL) provides settlement guarantee for transactions in government securities including\nrepos. The trades are settled on a net basis through the DVP-III system while the trades for non-government\nsecurities are settled on a gross basis directly between participants on delivery versus payment basis. The\nsettlement cycle for government securities was standardized to T+1 from May 11, 2005.\n\n",

It can raise funds through equity and debt. Equity is risk capital\nand there are limits to which a corporate can raise funds through equity shares. Corporates need to diversify\nfunding sources. Hence, they can raise capital cither through long-term borrowings from banks and financial\ninstitutions or by issuing debentures/bonds in the debt market. Banks do lend long-term loans but they do\nnot have the capacity nor the appetite for such long-term loans. Moreover, lending a large number of long-\nterm loans would create asset-liability mismatch problem for the banks as banks accept short-term deposits.\nBut, banks would be willing to invest in 10 to 20 years bonds issued by corporates if they have an exit route,\ni.e., they are in a position to sell the bonds when they need the money. This exit route is provided by the cor-\nporate bond market. The corporate debt market is a market wherein debt securities of corporates are issued\nand traded therein. A well-developed corporate bond market enables corporates to raise long-term capital\nfor long-gestation projects/acquisitions at a lower cost and thereby aid in economic growth. The corporate\ndebt market supplements the banking system. It enables a better asset-liability match for both corporates and\nbanks. Moreover, rating of debt securities by credit rating agencies helps in increasing investor confidence,\nwhich, in turn, enables investors to hold a diversified portfolio consisting of both debt and equity instru-\nments. As investors such as mutual funds, banks, and insurance companies need a steady flow of income to\ncater to the varying needs of their customers, they are major investors in this market. An active corporate\ndebt market fosters market discipline and nurtures credit culture.\n\nCorporates have resorted heavily to external commercial borrowings (ECBs) to meet their fund\nrequirements at lower cost. This could increase the vulnerability of corporates to both currency and\nliquidity risks and become a source of the transmission of severe external shocks to the domestic\neconomy. Therefore, it is important to develop the domestic corporate bond market to enable corporates\nto meet a substantial part of their funds requirement domestically.\n\nMoreover, Corporate debt market can provide small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with an alterna-\ntive avenue for sourcing funds besides bank financing. An access to active debt market would require\nrating which would help SMEs become more transparent and follow proper accounting, governance and\ndisclosure practices.\n\nThe Committee on Infrastructure Financing (Chairman: Shri Deepak Parekh) has estimated that\n251.46 trillion would be required for infrastructure development during the 12th Five Year Plan (2012-17)\nand that 47 per cent of the funds could come through the PPP route. According to the High Powered\nExpert Group Committee (Chairperson: Dr Isher Judge Ahluwalia) India will need to invest %39,187\nbillion between 2012 and 2031 to meet its urban infrastructure requirements. An active corporate bond\nmarket could enable market for municipal bonds issued by the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs).\n\nSEBI (Issue and Listing of Debt Securities) Regulations, 2008 define \u2018debt securities\u2019 as non-con-\nvertible debt securities which create or acknowledge indebtedness, and include debenture, bonds and\nsuch other securities of a body corporate or any statutory body constituted by virtue of a legislation,\nwhether constituting a charge on the assets of the body corporate or not, but excludes bonds issued by\nGovernment or such other bodies as may be specified by the SEBI, security receipts and securitized\ndebt instruments.\n\nThe investors in this market are banks, financial institutions, insurance companies, mutual funds,\nretirement funds, provident funds, and foreign institutional investors.\n\nPrivate sector companies raise funds from the debt market by issuing debentures. These debentures\nmay be convertible debentures, which can be converted into equity (partially or fully convertible deben-\ntures), or non-convertible debentures (NCDs). These are governed by the provisions of the Companies\n\n\nAct. Interest on these debentures is calculated on an actual 365-day basis. Tax deduction at source (TDS)\nis applicable. Convertible bonds is a preferred source of raising funds in volatile markets. In 2007, India\nwas the fourth most active market in the world in convertible debenture issuances.\n\nCorporates adopt either the public offering route or the private placement route for issuing debentures/\nbonds. The public issues of debentures are open to all investors and allotment is made on a pro-rata\nbasis. Coupon rates are fixed by the issuer and lead manager prior to the offering. In the case of privately\nplaced debentures, the terms of the issue are decided by negotiations between issuers and bidders. Some\nprivately placed debt instruments are subsequently listed on stock exchanges.\n\nThe private corporate sector has designed a hybrid variety of instruments combining the features of both debt\nand equity. A wide variety of instruments with longer maturity and with call and put options have been issued by\nthe private corporate sector. Many corporates have issued floating rate bonds (FRBs), besides fixed rate bonds.\n",

With the initiation of reforms and the development of equity\ncult, the proportion of debt issues in the total capital issues declined in the subsequent years.\n\nDebt issues comprise debentures and bonds. Convertible debentures were popular in 2001-02 as\nagainst non-convertible debentures which dominated the debt market in the preceding three years from\n1998-99 to 2000-01. Earlier, 20 per cent to 30 per cent of bond issues were \u2018bought-out\u2019 in nature, while\nthe rest was normal private placement. Bought-out deals flooded the bond market in 2002. In a bought-\nout deal, the entire issue is picked up by a single investor. It is unlike a private placement where a debt\npaper is sold to several investors. Corporates do not prefer the private placement route because in a private\nplacement, the issuer has to circulate the information memorandum to different market players and keep\nthe bidding open for about five days. During these five days, the market can change due to fresh political\nuncertainties, border tensions, or an interest rate view aired by a central banker. A bought-out deal avoids\nall these and hence has become a preferred route for corporates. In a bought-out deal, funds can be raised\nwithin a very short time and with little disclosure.\n\nThe average annual issuance in the private corporate bond market is close to 770,000 crore predomi-\nnantly through private placements.\n",

SEBI prohibits negotiated deals in respect of corporate listed debt securities.\nTrades of listed debt securities are to be executed on the basis of price and order matching mechanism of\nstock exchanges. The corporate debt securities are traded on the WDM segment of NSE, OTCEI, and on\nthe BSE (wef. January 9, 1996).\n\nSEBI has set up a reporting platform for post-trade transparency and introduced DvP in settlement of\nOTC trades in corporate bonds to eliminate settlement risk. It has allowed setting up of dedicated debt\nsegment on the exchangesBanks and PDs allowed by RBI to become members of stock exchanges to trade\nin corporate bonds.\n\nInvestment norms for banks and PDs have been relaxed by RBI to facilitate investment in corporate\nbonds.\n\nMeasures have been taken by SEBI to encourage investor interest/participation in the corporate bond\nmarket in terms of liberalizing the listing requirements, simplification of procedures and processes and\nsimplified disclosure norms\n\nRationalisation of FPI regulations has been put in place by SEBI for easier registration process and\noperating framework for overseas entities seeking to invest in Indian capital markets.\n\nIssue of long-term bonds by banks allowed with a minimum maturity of seven years to raise resources\nfor lending to (a) long term projects in infrastructure sub-sectors, and (b) affordable housing. These bonds\nhave been exempted from computation of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) and are therefore not\nbeen subjected to CRR/SLR requirements,\n\nInternational financial institutions like IFC were permitted to float rupee linked bond overseas to deepen\nthe off-shore rupee bond market so that IFC and other investors can raise rupees to invest in India. This has\nfacilitated development of benchmark yield for long term corporate bonds.\n\nThe secondary market for corporate debt has not yet fully developed in India. The volumes traded are\nquite low. The average daily volumes in the corporate bond market is around %2500 crore which is low.\nOn the BSE and the OTCEI, the volume of turnover is quite low, but the volume of turnover has picked\nup on the NSE-WDM segment.\n\nThe traded volume of debt was highest in the year 2004-05. A declining trend was witnessed in the\nsubsequent years. However, the traded volume of debt increased substantially in the year 2016-17. The\nproportion of traded volume of debentures to total turnover is low and owing to this, the size of the cor-\nporate debt market is small.\n\nThe corporate debt market has a large potential to grow. The following are the problems and the meas-\nures that need to be taken to solve the problems:\n\n+ The absence of a risk-free term structure of interest rates has restricted the development of new\nand innovative instruments in the debt market. There is a need to develop a smooth yield curve for\ngovernment securities market for efficient pricing of corporate bonds.\n\nThe corporate bond market needs well-capitalized market makers just like the primary dealers in the\ngovernment securities market. Market making should be encouraged to enhance liquidity.\nCooperative banks and charitable trusts are permitted to invest in corporate paper but permissions\nare granted only on a case-to-case basis for each specific issue rather than on the basis of broad\ninvestment guidelines. These banks and trusts should be permitted to invest in good quality rated\npaper by laying down broad investment guidelines.\n\n+ Provident funds (PFs) currently hold funds close to %1,00,000 crore. These funds are invested as per pre-\nscribed norms in government securities, state guaranteed papers, public sector debt, and recently in corporate\nbonds. PFs are traditionally risk-averse and hence have shied away from investing in private sector bonds.\nThese PFs can be encouraged to invest in private sector bonds by assuring them better return and safety.\nThe private placement of corporate bonds has restricted open market trading in these instruments.\nThe private corporate bond market is a market with a small investor base, mainly institutional play-\ners such as mutual funds insurance companies and banks who hold on to the securities till their\nmaturity. Moreover, they have low risk appetites, which make it increasingly difficult for lower\nrated-borrowers to raise debt directly. An active secondary market is needed for reaching a wider\ninvestor base, reducing borrowing costs, and lengthening maturities. Efforts should be made to acti-\nvate the secondary market by increasing the number of players and instruments.\n\nBanks prefer to lend to corporates rather than subscribing to their debt issuances. Banks limit their invest-\nment in corporate bonds either due to credit risks or due to the limits on exposures to particular sectors.\nThe corporate bonds held by banks can be sold to retail customers (investors) which banks do not do.\n\n+ There is a lack of uniform stamp duty structure. The stamp duty on debentures is 0.375 per cent ad\nvalorem. Promissory notes attract a duty of 0.05 per cent. Further, stamp duty is different in differ-\nent states for mortgage and assignment. Stamp duty should be lowered to reduce the cost of issue\nof bond paper. The R. H. Patil Committee on debt market reforms suggested that the maximum.\nstamp duty should be 0.25 per cent ad valorem with a cap of 825 lakh for 7-year instrument.\nThere are not enough underwriters for debt issuances leading to a decline in bond issues. Since\nearly 2008, foreign banks have begun to cut down on underwriting issues because of tight liquid-\nity conditions globally. Moreover, lack of investor demand for lower-rated paper led to a decline in\nunderwriting fees. Hence, few firms are willing to offer underwriting services.\n\nLack of investor awareness about the advantages of investing in rated debt instruments rather than\nunrated fixed deposits.\n\n+ The market for Credit Default Swaps (CDS) and repos has not taken off.\n\nA liquid and active corporate debt market can aid in industrial growth and reduce the pressure on\ninstitutional financing.\n\nAn active corporate bond market also helps in the diversification of risks in the financial system. In\norder to enable public and private sector firms to borrow for longer maturity periods in local currency to\nmeet their investment needs and avoid balance sheet mismatches and foreign currency exposures, there is\naneed to accelerate the development of local currency bond market.\n\nAn active corporate bond market could also provide institutional investors such as insurance compa-\nnies and provident and pension funds with quality long term financial assets, helping them in matching\ntheir assets and liabilities.\n\nA well-developed corporate debt market will enable the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to raise\nlong-term finance. A well-functioning debt market allows appropriate risk-return pricing thereby attract-\ning investors who are willing to take on higher risk for commensurate higher rewards.\n",

Banks were permitted to\nclassify their investments in non-SLR bonds issued by companies engaged in infrastructure activities and having\na minimum residual maturity of seven years under the Held to Maturity (HTM) category. The provisioning norms\nfor banks for infrastructure loan accounts have been relaxed. Banks have been given flexibility to invest in unrated\nbonds of companies engaged in infrastructure activities within the overall ceiling of 10 per cent.\n\nListing of privately placed debt paper in the secondary market is allowed. It is possible now for the\ndebt of a corporate to be listed even though the equity may not be listed.\n\nSecuritized debt paper has generated a great deal of interest and this paper is now traded in the secondary market.\n\nIn December 2007, to facilitate the development of primary corporate debt market, the SEBI simpli-\nfied issuance norms of corporate bonds by making the following changes:\n\n1. For public/rights issues of bonds, issuers now need to obtain rating from only one credit rating\nagency instead of from two, so as to reduce the cost of issuances.\n\n2. Bonds below investment grade are allowed to be issued to the public to suit the risk/return appetite of\ninvestors. The investor has to decide whether or not to invest in a non-investment grade debt instrument.\n\n3. Structural restrictions currently placed on debt instruments such as those on maturity, put/call\noption on conversion, etc. were removed. This was done to provide issuers flexibility in structur-\ning debt instruments to suit their requirements.\n\nThe BSE and NSE have launched trading and reporting platforms on January 1, and March 1, 2007,\nrespectively, to capture all information related to trading in corporate bonds. Later, in September 2007,\nFixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association of India (FIMMDA) started Corporate Bond\nTrade Reporting Platform. The trade matching platform is now order driven with essential features of\nOTC market. Both the stock exchanges disseminate information relating to corporate bonds comprising\nissuer name, maturity date, current coupon, last price traded, last amount traded, last yield (annualized)\ntraded, weighted average yield price, total amount traded, and the rating of the bond and any other addi-\ntional information. They also provide their services for clearing and settlement of corporate bonds traded.\n\nFIMMDA developed a reporting platform to promote transparency in corporate debt market. The\nFixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association of India (FIMMDA) is an association of\nScheduled Commercial Banks, Public Financial Institutions, Primary Dealers and Insurance Companies\nand incorporated as a Company under section 25 of the Companies Act,1956 on June 3rd, 1998. FIM-\nMDA isa voluntary market body for development of the bond, money and derivatives markets. It rep-\nresents market participants and acts as an interface with the regulators on various issues that impact\nthe functioning of these markets. It also undertakes developmental activities, such as, introduction of\nbenchmark rates and new derivatives instruments, etc. FIMMDA releases rates of various Government\nsecurities that are used by market participants for valuation purposes. FIMMDA also plays a constructive\nrole in the evolution of best market practices by its members so that the market as a whole operates trans-\nparently as well as efficiently.\n\nThe shut period in corporate bonds has been reduced to align it with that applicable for Govern-\nment Securities. The shut period in corporate bonds is similar to the record date in case of rights issues.\nGovernment securities/corporate bonds/debentures are traded in the secondary and hence keep chang-\ning hands. Issuer of debt securities pays interest to the holders registered in its register on a certain date\nknown as record date. Securities are not transferred in the books of issuer during the period in which\nsuch records are updated for payment of interest etc. Such period is called as shut period. For government\nsecurities held in demat form (SGL), shut period is three working days. To bring about uniformity in\nshut periods for corporate bonds, SEBI in June 2011 directed exchanges to do away with shut period for\ninterest payments or for part-redemptions. Further, SEBI directed exchanges to ensure that issuers have\na record date not more than 15 days prior to book closure for all prospective privately placed issues of\ncorporate bonds.\n\nIn September 2011, SEBI put in place framework for issue of Structured Products.\n\nStructured products are issued in India as debt instruments with returns linked to equity or other\nunderlying assets. In view of the nature of risk profile of such securities, additional disclosures were spec-\nified in offer documents for issue of structured products that seek listing on stock exchanges. Only issuers\n\nthat have a minimum net-worth of 100 crore are eligible to issue such instruments. Minimum ticket size\nfor subscribing to such securities is 710 lakh. Other norms include additional disclosures pertaining to\nriskiness of such instruments, scenario analysis showing its value under various market conditions, com-\nmission structure embedded therein and requirements for primary issuance and sale of securities to retail\ninvestors. Third party valuation of such securities by a credit rating agency has been made mandatory and\ndisclosed to the public.\n\nTradable lots in corporate bonds have been reduced to @1 lakh for all the entities. It has been made\nmandatory for all new issues of corporate bonds to have an actual day count convention. There are con-\nventions for calculation of the number of days that has elapsed between two dates for payment of interest.\nThe objective of any convention is to calculate (days in a month)/(days in a year). The actual number of\ndays elapsed between the two dates may be divided by 360, or by 365 or by actual number of days in a\nyear. Assume a bond with face value %100, coupon 9.50 per cent, last coupon paid on June 15, 2008, and\ntraded for value October 5, 2008. If the year is assumed to have 360 days, then the accrued interest is %9.5\n* 112/360=2.9556. If the year is assumed to have 365 days, then the accrued interest is 2.9151.\n\nFurther, to streamline the process of interest and redemption payments, the RBI has allowed issuers the\nuse of Electronic Clearing Services (ECS), Real time Gross Settlements (RTGS), or National Electronic\nFunds Transfer (NEFT).\n\nIn January 2008, Draft Regulations on Issue and Listing of Debt Securities were framed to provide for\nsimplified regulatory framework for issuance and listing of non-convertible debt securities issued by any\ncompany, public sector undertaking, or statutory corporation. The salient features of the draft regulations\ninclude: (i) rationalization of disclosure requirements; (ii) enhanced responsibilities of merchant bankers\nfor exercising due diligence; (iii) mandatory listing of private placement of debt by companies which\nwere earlier not listed; (iv) reissuances of corporate debt; and (v) a proposal to introduce rationalized list-\ning requirements for debt of a listed issuer. The regulations were notified on June 6, 2008.\n\n\u2018The Finance Minister also proposed to exempt corporate debt instruments issued in demat form and\nlisted on recognized stock exchanges from tax deducted at source (TDS).\n\nThe exposure norms for Primary Dealers (PDs) have been relaxed to enable them to play a larger role\nin the corporate bond market.\n\nCredit Default Swaps (CDS) have been introduced on corporate bonds since December 01, 2011 to\nfacilitate hedging of credit risk associated with holding corporate bonds and encourage investors participa-\ntion in long term corporate bonds. CDS has been introduced with all safeguards, such as, not allowing naked\nCDS for the users, mandating position limits for the market makers, compulsory reporting of transactions\nto the trade repository in CCIL, publication of CDS curve for valuation, and standardization of contracts.\n\nRevised guidelines have been issued for securitization of standard assets so as to develop bond market\nas well as provide investors a safe financial product. The interest of the originator has been aligned with\nthe investor and suitable safeguards have been designed.\n\n",

All future investments within the USD 51 bn Corporate Debt limit category, including the limits\nvacated when the current investment by an FPI runs off either through sale or redemption, shall\nbe required to be made in corporate bonds with a minimum residual maturity of three years.\n\n2. Furthermore, FPIs shall not be permitted to invest in liquid and money market mutual fund\nschemes.\n\n3. There will, however, be no lock-in period and FPIs shall be free to sell the securities (including\nthose that are presently held with less than three years residual maturity) to domestic investors.\n\nThe corporates are preferring to raise funds through the corporate bond market thereby reducing their\nreliance on bank credit. The percentage share of the outstanding amount of corporate bonds has increased\nfrom 17 per cent in the financial year 2011-12 to 20 per cent in 2015-16, whereas the percentage share\nof the amount outstanding with respect to the bank credit has gradually declined from 73 per cent in\n2011-12 to 65 per cent in the 2015-16.\n\nPrivate placement debt issues out-scored public issues. Private placement continued to be the preferred\nroute by investors for its perceived advantages of operational ease, minimal disclosures and lower costs.\nFinding ways to make public offerings more attractive will help to bring in the retail investors, and address\nthe liquidity problem in this segment\u2019s secondary market.\n\nReporting platforms for corporate bonds are maintained by BSE, NSE and MSEI. Reporting of sec-\nondary market transactions in corporate bonds was discontinued at FIMMDA with effect from April 1,\n2014. MSEI started the reporting in July 2013, but the volumes reported at the platform have been insig-\nnificant. NSE continues to be the largest reporting platform for OTC deals in corporate bond markets.\n\nWith effect from December 1, 2009, it has been made mandatory for all trades in corporate bonds\nbetween mutual funds, FPIs/sub-accounts, venture capital funds, foreign venture capital investors, portfo-\nlio managers, and RBI regulated entities (as specified by RBI) to be cleared and settled through the clear-\ning corporations of exchanges-the National Securities Clearing Corporation Limited (NSCCL) or the\nIndian Clearing Corporation Limited (ICCL) and the MSEI Clearing Corporation Limited (MSEI CCL).\n\nIn case of shortage of delivery, stock exchanges/clearing corporations may conduct financial close-\nout. The financial close out shall take place at the highest price on trade date (which becomes the trade\nprice) with a 1% mark-up on trade price.\n\nFurther, exchanges/clearing corporation shall introduce a uniform auction mechanism to deal with\nsettlement shortages by March 31, 2017.\n\nPartial credit enhancement to corporate bonds provided by banks during the lifetime of the bond:\n\n(a) To be eligible for PCE from banks, corporate bonds shall be rated by a minimum of two external\ncredit rating agencies at all times;\n\n(b) The rating reports, both initial and subsequent, shall disclose both standalone credit rating (i.\nrating without taking into account the effect of PCE) as well as the enhanced credit rating (taking\ninto account the effect of PCE).\n\n(c) For the purpose of capital computation in the books of PCE provider, lower of the two standalone\ncredit ratings and the corresponding enhanced credit rating of the same rating agency shall be\nreckoned.\n\n(d) Where the reassessed standalone credit rating at any time during the life of the bond shows\nimprovement over the corresponding rating at the time of bond issuance, the capital requirement\nmay be recalculated on the basis of the reassessed standalone credit rating and the reassessed\nenhanced credit rating, without reference to the constraints of capital floor and difference in\nnotches.\n\nAs announced in the Union Budget 2016-17, the investment basket of eligible instruments for investment\nby FPls under the corporate bond route has been expanded to include the following:\n\n(i) Unlisted debt securities: FPIs can invest in the primary issues of non-convertible debentures/\nbonds by a public company issued in demat form, provided that the issuing company does not\nuse the borrowing proceeds for real estate activities, purchase of land, investing in capital market\nor on-lending to other entities.

                        "extracted-text": "THE PUBLIC SECTOR UNDERTAKING BOND MARKET\n\nPublic sector undertaking bonds are medium-and long-term obligations issued by public sector\nundertakings.\n\nPSU bonds issues is a phenomenon of the late 1980s when the central government stopped/reduced\nfunding to PSUs through the general budget. PSUs float bonds in the primary market to raise funds. PSUs\nborrow funds from the market for their regular working capital or capital expenditure requirement by\nissuing bonds. The market for PSU bonds has grown substantially over the past decade. All PSU bonds\nhave a bullet redemption and some of them are embedded with put or call options. Many of these are\nissued by infrastructure related companies such as railways and power companies, and their issue sizes\nvary widely from %10-1,000 crore. PSU bonds have maturities ranging between five and ten years. They\nare issued in denominations of %1,000 each.\n\nThe majority of PSU bonds are privately placed with banks or large investors. In privately placed\nissues, rating is not mandatory while public issues are mandatorily rated by one or more of the four rat-\ning agencies in India. Historically, default rates of PSU bonds are negligible and PSUs are perceived as\nquasi-sovereign bodies. Usually, bonds issued by state-owned PSUs carry interest payment and principal\npayment guaranteed by the respective state government. Such guarantees are issued mainly to facilitate\nthe fund raising programmes for various long gestation infrastructure projects.\n\nPSUs are permitted to issue two types of bonds: tax-free and taxable bonds. Tax-free bonds are bonds\nfor which the amount of interest is exempted from the investor\u2019s income. PSUs issue tax-free bonds\nor bonds with certain exemptions under the Income Tax Act with prior approval from the government\nthrough the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) for raising funds for such projects. PSUs which have\nraised funds through the issue of tax-free bonds are central PSUs such as MTNL and NTPC, and state\nPSUs such as State Electricity Boards (SEBs) and State Financial Corporations (SFCs). The bonds issued\nby the State Financial Corporations are SLR eligible for cooperative banks and non-banking finance\ncompanies (NBFCs). Interest on these bonds is calculated on actual/365 days basis. Tax deduction at\nsource is applicable. In the pre-reforms period, that is, before 1991, the maximum interest rate on tax-\nable bonds was stipulated at 14 per cent and maximum interest rate on tax-free bonds was fixed at 10 per\ncent. The ceiling of banks\u2019 investment in PSU bonds was 1.5 per cent of incremental deposits. With effect\nfrom August 1991, the ceiling on interest rate on PSU bonds was removed and subsequently some of the\n\n\nPSUs floated bonds at an interest rate of 17 to 18 per cent. Later, ceiling on tax-free bonds was raised to\n10.5 per cent. The ceiling of bank\u2019s investments in PSU bonds was also removed which enabled banks to\ninvest freely in them.\n\nProvident funds were initially allowed to invest 15 per cent of their incremental deposit in PSU bonds.\nLater, this limit was increased to 30 per cent.\n\nThe revised guidelines for the issue of PSU bonds were issued in October 1993. The guidelines indicate\nthat the minimum maturity of tax-free bonds should be seven years whereas PSUs will have the freedom\nto fix the maturities of taxable bonds. The public issues shall be subject to guidelines issued by the SEBI.\n\nPSUs are allowed to issue floating rate bonds, deep discount bonds, and a variety of other bonds. All\nnew issues have to be listed on a stock exchange.\n\nInvestors in PSU bonds include banks, insurance companies, non-banking finance companies, provi-\ndent funds, mutual funds, financial institutions, and individuals.\n\nThere has been a declining trend in the amount raised through the issue of tax-free bonds. Since\n1991-92, taxable bonds have become popular as the ceiling on interest rate on taxable bonds was\nremoved. PSU bonds which traditionally were floated in the public issue market were privately placed in\nthe 1990s. The PSUs preferred the private placement route for the issue of bonds. They have not tapped\nthe primary market from 1997-98 to 2008-09. As the secondary market in PSU bonds is not active,\nPSUs prefer the private placement route. Moreover, it is easier and cheaper to raise funds through this\nroute. The PSUs continued to tap the private placement market for their capital requirements.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Secondary Market in PSU Bonds\n\nPSU bonds are generally issued and traded in the form of promissory notes or stock certificates. Promis-\nsory notes are transferable by endorsement and delivery while stock certificates are transferable by duly\nexecuted transfer deed and stamp duty is applicable unless specifically exempted.\n\nClearing and settlement is now in a registered form. PSU bonds require no transfer deed for registra-\ntion of new ownership and therefore are exempt from stamp duty. However, contract notes for transactions\nof PSU bonds require a stamp duty at 0.01 per cent.\n\nRepos are permitted if PSU bonds are in demat form. To improve the secondary market activity, the\nUnion Budget for 1999-2000 abolished stamp duty on transfer of dematerialized instruments.\n\nPSU bonds are traded on the WDM segment of the NSE and debt (F) segment of the BSE.\n\nPSU bonds have low liquidity though it is higher than that of government-guaranteed bonds or state govern\nment securities, Most trades are done through brokers. Brokerage costs and bid offer spreads are lower in case\n\u2018of PSU bonds than in the case of state government and government-guaranteed bonds. Trading takes place in\nmultiples of %5 lakh for state-run pension funds and other financial institutions, and in multiples of %1,00,000\nfor small trusts and retail investors. Daily trading volumes average %5 crore with a transaction size of 22 crore.\n\nPSU bonds offered better yield in the early 1990s. Owing to this, other cash-rich PSUs, mutual funds, and\ncommercial banks invested in these bonds. They were one of the most active instruments in the early 1990s.\nThe tax-free bonds were the most popular as the market used \u2018tax stripping repo strategies\u2019 to arbitrage tax\ndifferentials. This market was highly misused in the Securities Scam of 1992 as it was through this market that\nthe funds were diverted from the banking system. This market revived in 1993 when PSU bond issues were\nderegulated to a greater extent. This led to a significant increase in institutional activity in this segment.\n\nThe volume traded has no doubt increased since 2000-01 but the percentage share in the total volume\ntraded has decreased. The level of activity is quite low as most of the PSU bonds are privately placed lead-\ning to a reduction in the floating stock. The volume of activity has not picked up at a faster pace as retail\ninvestors are not interested in trading and there is an absence of standard norms.\n\nStandard norms and market practices should be laid down to bring about greater transparency and\nliquidity in this segment. A primary dealer system akin to government securities market can be introduced\nin the PSU bond market. This will enhance trading and liquidity in the secondary market which, in turn,\nwill help in the growth of the PSU bond market.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Government Securities Market in the Pre-1991 Period\n\nThe RBI was established in 1935, after which it issued government securities on behalf of the government\nand sold them to various institutions and the public at large. In the 1930s, the government issued securi-\nties at interest rates as low as 2.5 per cent, as the cheap money policy was adopted. After independence,\nthe RBI was nationalized; since then, it frames the monetary policy, structure of interest rates, and the\nprogramme of borrowing through government securities on instructions from the government.\n\nThe programme of borrowing was gradually stepped up in the 1950s to finance development projects\nin various sectors of the economy. The rates of interest on government securities were also gradually\nstepped up to enable resource mobilization. To facilitate this programme of higher borrowings, the RBI\ncarried out open market operations which helped in creating a genuine market for government securities.\nThe RBI appointed reputed firms of brokers and jobbers to carry out OMOs. Brokers were appointed for\ncarrying out transactions between commercial banks. The traders in government securities were com-\nmercial banks, life insurance companies, general insurance companies, charitable and religious trusts,\nprovident funds, and some individuals. There was daily trading in government securities either for long-\nterm investment or for switching from long-term to short-term securities or vice-versa. Till the 1950s,\ngovernment securities were more popular with individuals than with institutions.\n\nSince the 1960s and until the 1990s, the government securities market remained dormant. The govern-\nment was borrowing at pre-announced coupon rates from banks which were the predominant group of\ninvestors. To maintain the cost of borrowings at a low level, the coupon rates offered on government secu-\nrities remained negative, in real terms, till about the mid-1980s. During the 1980s, the volumes of both\nlong and short-term debt expanded considerably, especially the latter due to automatic accommodation\nthrough the issue of ad hoc T-bills. The RBI had little control over some of the essential facets of debt\nmanagement such as volume and maturity structure of securities to be marketed and the term structure of\ninterest rates. The maturity structure of market loans remained highly skewed in favour of a longer term\nof more than 15 years.\n\nThe government securities market was constrained mainly by the absence of a definite limit on the\nautomatic monetization of the central government budget deficits and by relatively low coupon rates\noffered on government securities to investors. Thus, a passive internal debt management coupled with\nautomatic monetization of budget deficit made the government securities market dormant and prevented\nit from being deep and vibrant.\n\nConsidering the significance of a vibrant government securities market and for activating an internal\ndebt management policy, a number of measures were announced in the middle of 1991 to reform the\ngovernment securities market.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Some Policy Measures Undertaken in the 1990s\n\nKeeping the above objectives in view, reforms were undertaken to strengthen the primary and secondary\nsegments of the government securities market. Policy measures were undertaken by the RBI to raise\nresources for the government in a cost-effective manner and to improve trading systems, clearing and\nsettlement infrastructure, and liquidity in the secondary market. The auction system for the sale of\nmedium-and long-term securities was introduced from June 3, 1992. Some innovative instruments such\nas conversion of auction T-bills into term securities, zero coupon bonds, capital indexed bonds, tap stocks\nand partly paid stock were introduced.\n\nFrom April 28, 1992, 364-day T-bill auctions were introduced and 91-day T-bill auctions from\nJanuary 8, 1993. On June 6, 1997, 14-day T-bills were introduced but they were discontinued from May 2001.\n\nAuctions of repurchase agreements (repo) of dated government securities were introduced from\nDecember 1992.\n\nTo develop the market, the Securities Trading Corporation of India (STCI) was set up in May 1994. It\nbegan its operations in June 1994.\n\nThe most notable policy development in the government securities market during 1994-95 was the\ndelinking of the budget deficit from automatic monetization by initially limiting the creation of ad hoc\nills and subsequently discontinuing them.\n\nThe NSE started trading in government securities from June 30, 1994.\n\nAs a move towards greater transparency, the transactions of government securities through SGL\naccounts have been made public by the Reserve Bank on a regular basis from September 1, 1994.\n\nA delivery versus payment (DVP) system for transactions in government securities was introduced\nwith effect from July 17, 1995. The DVP system synchronises the transfer of securities with cash payment\nthereby reducing the settlement risk in securities transactions and also preventing the diversion of funds\nin case of transactions routed through the SGL accounts. In 1999, the computer networking between\nRBI's SGL and NSDL was completed thus enabling electronic settlement for investors having depository\naccounts with the NSDL.\n\nThe RBI set up a strong regulatory system which required that every trade must settle with funds and\ndelivery of securities. IOUs and netting were prohibited. Trade reporting of the negotiated deals was made\ncompulsory at the WDM segment of NSE.\n\nIn May 1995, the government, for the first time, issued guidelines for non-government provident funds,\nsuperannuation funds, and gratuity funds to earmark 25 per cent of their total corpus for investment in\ncentral government securities.\n\nA well-developed government securities market enables other segments of the debt market to develop.\nAs a step towards this, the government went for diversification of instruments\u2014introduction of floating\nrate bonds indexed to yield on 364-day T-bills. Moreover, it re-issued securities of two-year, three-year,\nfive-year, and ten-year maturities at fixed coupon. Further, it permitted commercial banks to retail govern-\nment securities with non-bank clients.\n\nA scheme of ways and means advances (WMAs) was introduced effectively from April 1, 1997, to\naccommodate temporary mismatches between government receipts and payments. This scheme replaced\nthe practice of automatic monetization of deficit.\n\nFor building up a viable institutional framework and to diversify investor base, the RBI appointed\nprimary dealers (PDs) and satellite dealers to perform the role of market makers in government securi-\nties. Foreign institutional investors (FIs), with a ceiling of 30 per cent investment in debt instruments,\nhave been permitted to invest in dated-government securities. This ceiling of 30 per cent was removed in\nOctober 2008. In order to facilitate custodial and depository services to Flls in dated-government securi-\nties and T-bills, FII investments are now permitted through the SGL account of depositories, in addition\nto the SGL account of the designated banks, subject to certain conditions. The limit of FIl investment in\ngovernment securities is USD S billion.\n\nA flexible approach to the market borrowing programme of the state governments was introduced\nwhereby they were given the option to raise 5 to 35 per cent of their market borrowings in a flexible man-\nner as regards timing, maturity, and rate of interest.\n\nWith a view to moderating the adverse impact of a large borrowing programme, the RBI accepts\nprivate placement of government stock and releases them to the market when interest rate expectations\nbecome favourable. After a gap of nearly seven years, the government issued a long-term paper with a\nmaturity of 20 years in 1998-99.\n\nTo encourage retail participation in the primary market for dated government securities, an allocation\nof upto 5 per cent has been provided to retail investors on a non-competitive basis. Participation in the\nauction process on a \u2018non-competitive\u2019 basis is open to any person including firms, companies, corporate\n\nbodies, institutions, provident funds, trusts, and any other entity as may be prescribed by the Reserve\nBank as also to the investors who do not maintain current account (CA) or subsidiary general ledger\n(SGL) account with the Reserve Bank. However, non-competitive bidding in T-Bills is available only\nto State Governments and other select entities and is not available to the cooperative banks.In the case\nof auction for Treasury Bills, there is no ceiling for non-competitive bids. Only one bid is allowed to be\nsubmitted by an investor either through a bank or primary dealer.\n\nThe uniform price auction format for auctions which was confined to the auction of 91-day treasury\nbills was extended to the auction of dated securities. The central government issued two floating rate bonds\non the basis of uniform price auction on November 21 and December 5, 2001, on an experimental basis.\n\nThe trading entities have been allowed to sell government securities allotted to them in primary issues\non the same day thus enabling sale, settlement, and transfer on the same day.\n\nThere were instances of gridlock in the DVP system due to a shortfall of funds on gross basis in\nthe current account of one or more SGL holders. To take care of such unusual occurrences, a scheme\nof special fund facility was introduced with effect from October 3, 2000, to provide intra-day funds\nto SGL holders for facilitating settlement of securities transactions in case of gridlock. The scheme\nprovides for automatic invocation by the SGL account holder of undrawn refinance/liquidity support\nfrom the RBI for facilitating smooth securities settlement. All transferable government of India dated\nsecurities and treasury bills are eligible for automatic invocation of special intra-day fund facility from\nthe RBI.\n\nSome significant steps for further development of the government securities market which the RBI has\ntaken in 2001-02 are as follows:\n\nEnhancing fungibility and liquidity through consolidation by re-issuance of existing loans.\nPromoting retailing of government securities and introduction of floating rate bonds.\n\nElongation of the maturity profile of outstanding issuance including issuance of bonds with a\nmaturity of 25 years.\n\nDevelopment of new benchmark government securities by consolidating new issuance in key\nmaturities.\n\nSetting up of an electronic negotiated dealing system (NDS) and Clearing Corporation of India\nLimited (CCIL) for facilitating trading and settlement in government securities. The NDS (Phase I)\nwas operationalized from February 15, 2002 and CCIL too commenced its operations for clearing\nand settling of transactions in government securities including repos.\n\nA proposal by the RBI to the government to replace the existing Public Debt Act, 1944 by the\nGovernment Securities Act to simplify the procedures for transactions in government securities,\nallow lien marking/pledging of securities as also electronic transfer in dematerialized form is under\nconsideration of the government.\n\nThe electronic funds transfer (EFT) and real time gross settlement (RTGS) system are being put in\nforce by the RBI.\n\nA road map for developing separate trading for registered interest and principal of securities\n(STRIPS) was prepared, and put on the RBI\u2019s website for comments and suggestions from the\nmarket participants.\n\nThe regulatory and supervisory framework for the primary dealers had been strengthened in line\nwith international practices.\n\nAn indicative advance calendar for issuance of dated securities for the first half of 2002-03 was\nannounced in March 2002, to improve transparency in primary issuance of central government\nsecurities and to enable both institutional and retail investors to plan their investments.\n\nThe government also announced, on February 28, 2001 that comprehensive legislation will be intro-\nduced on securitization, and clarification will be issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to\npromote the issuance of STRIPS, zero coupon bonds, deep discount bonds, and the like.\n\nSome major developments in government securities market in 2002-03 were as follows:\n\n+ Introduction of the system of publishing a calendar by the RBI that outlines the issue of dated government\nsecurities every half year. The calendar for the financial year of 2002-03 was issued in March 2003.\n\n+ Screen-based order-driven trading in government securities on the stock exchanges was introduced\non January 16, 2003.\n\n+ CSGL account holders permitted to enter into repo transactions in government securities, effective\nfrom March 3, 2003.\n\n* Guidelines for uniform accounting of repo/reverse repo transactions were issued by the RBI.\n\n+ Under the securities lending scheme, the Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL) has been\npermitted to borrow required government securities from selected members.\n\n+ In accordance with the RBI policy of consolidation of government debt, the practice of re-issuances\nof existing government securities continued in 2002-03 also. Of the 31 securities issued during\n2002-03, 19 were re-issues. This accounts for 59 per cent (74,000 crore of the gross amount of\n21,25,000 crore raised through dated government securities under the market borrowing programme\nof the central government).\n\nRetail trading in government securities at select stock exchanges commenced in January 2003.\n\nThe countrywide anonymous, screen-based and order-driven trading in government securities was\nintroduced in January 2003 on the NSE, the BSE and the OTCEI. Following the recommendations of the\nWorking Group on screen-based trading in Government Securities, an anonymous, Screen-Based order\nmatching trading system was incorporated on the negotiated dealing system (NDS) from August 11,\n2004.\n\nThe RBI permitted market participants to sell government securities from April 2, 2004 against con-\nfirmed purchase contracts provided the previous purchase contracts were either guaranteed by the CCIL\nor have the RBI as the counterparty. This sale transaction was introduced to reduce the market risk of\nparticipants and facilitate rollover of repos. It was operationalized by switching over to the DVP III mode\nof settlement of government securities transactions under which securities are settled on a net basis.\n\nIn April 2005, listed corporates were allowed to undertake repos in government securities thereby\ngiving them a new avenue to deploy funds. The RBI also allowed urban cooperative banks (UCBs) and\nlisted companies having gilt accounts with banks to undertake repos, subject to eligibility criteria and\nsafeguards. Corporates will need to open a constituent subsidiary general ledger (CSGL) account with a\nbank to be able to undertake repo transactions.\n\nThe settlement of all outright secondary market transactions in government securities is on T+ 1 basis\nsince May 2005.\n\nThe Reserve Bank permitted sale of government securities allotted to successful bidders in primary\nissues on the day of allotment, with and between Constituents Subsidiary General Ledger (CSGL) account\nholders. It also permitted a buyer from an allottee in primary auction to resell the security.\n\nThe NDS-OM trading module was introduced on August 1, 2005 to provide NDS members with a\nmore advanced and efficient trading platform in government securities.\n\nIn February 2006, the Reserve Bank permitted banks which fulfilled certain ibility criteria to\nundertake primary dealer business departmentally. Banks and PDs were permitted to undertake intra-day\nshort sale in central government dated securities subject to the same being covered by outright purchase\nin secondary market within the same trading day. This period was extended to five trading days in Octo-\nber 2006. Stand-alone PDs were permitted to diversify their activities in addition to existing business of\ngovernment securities, subject to limits.\n\nThe NDS-OM members were permitted to enter into \u2018When Issued\u2019 transactions in central government\nsecurities that have been notified for issuance but not actually issued. The Government Securities Act,\n2006 was passed by the Parliament in August 2006.\n\nWith effect from January 1, 2008, the cover transactions of short sales and when-issued can be under-\ntaken outside NDS-OM, that is, through the telephone or through purchases in primary market. The sale\nleg of short sales continues to be undertaken on NDS-OM.\n\nIt is mandatory for NDS members, both bank and non-bank including primary dealers, to hold a cur-\nrent account and SGL account with the Reserve Bank for settlement of government security transactions.\nTo facilitate phasing out of current accounts of non-banks and non-PD entities with the Reserve Bank, a\nnew system of \u2018multi modal settlements\u2019 (MMS) in government securities market was introduced in June\n2008. Under this system, settlement of the securities leg of government security transactions undertaken\nby the non-bank and non-PD NDS members will continue to take place in the SGL account maintained\nwith the Reserve Bank, while the funds leg will settle through the fund accounts maintained by these\nentities with select commercial banks appointed as \u2018Designated Settlement Banks\u2019 (DSBs) by the CCIL.\nThree scheduled commercial banks-HDFC Bank, Axis Bank and Citibank-have been appointed as the\nDSBs. From June 30, 2008 onwards, secondary market transactions in government securities undertaken\nby mutual funds are being settled only through the DSBs.\n\n",

To illustrate, a 10-year government security can be stripped into a principal component and a set of\n20 individual coupons/assuming half-yearly coupon payments. Each of these 21 stripped securities can be\ntreated as zero coupon bonds which can be traded at varying yields. For example, When 7100 of the 8.32\nper cent GS 2023 is stripped, each cash flow of coupon(%4.16 cach half-year) will become coupon STRIP\n\nand the principal payment (100 at maturity) will become a principal STRIP. These cash flows are traded\nseparately as independent securities in the secondary market.\n\nThe conversion of one underlying security into a number of zero coupon securities called STRIPS\nincreases the breadth of the debt market and provides a continuous market which ultimately helps in\nimproving liquidity. It also leads to the development of a market determined zero coupon yield curve.\nThe creation of securities of varied maturities from a single security satisfies the needs of different inves-\ntors who have diverse risk profiles and investment horizons. STRIPS are discounted instruments with no\nperiodic interest payment and hence there would be no need for reinvestment of intermediate cash flows.\nThis would be an attractive feature for retail/noninstitutional investors. STRIPS benefits not only inves-\ntors, but also issuers. STRIPS allow the issuer to issue securities with long-term maturity for any amount.\nThese long-term securities can be stripped to meet the market needs for short-term securities. Moreover,\nthe supply of securities increases with stripping and this boosts secondary market activity. Further, banks\ncan issue STRIPS against the securities held by them. Thus, STRIPS facilitates the management of the\nbanks\u2019 asset-liability mismatches.\n\nThe RBI's policy of re-issuance of existing loans and alignment of coupon payment dates across loans\nfacilitating creation of volumes in certain benchmark securities is creating an environment for STRIPS.\nThe secondary market volumes have increased and the market has the requisite size to make STRIPS a\nsuccess. The necessary provisions have been made to facilitate the introduction of STRIPS in the Govern-\nment Securities Act which is to replace the existing Public Debt Act, 1944.\n\nIn April 2005, the RBI announced its plan to consolidate debt securities with the intention of provid-\ning better liquidity and price discovery in the market. This consolidation will combine different securities\ninto a particular maturity profile thus resulting in few securities with large issue sizes, which will be\ntraded more actively. For example, if there are 15 different securities available for trading in the market\nthat matures in the year 2015, these could be consolidated into one lot of securities which could mature in\n2015. This will encourage an active STRIPS market in government securities as the large issue size will\nallow the coupon component to be floated and traded separately.\n\nAccordingly, a new security, namely the 6.01 per cent Government Stock 2028 was issued on\nAugust 7, 2003 and its coupon payment dates were aligned to March 25/September 25. PDs which meet\ncertain laid down financial criteria, would be authorized to undertake stripping and reconstruction of\nsecurities. The Public Debt Office of the RBI would act as a registry of stripped bonds.\n\nThe salient features of the operational guidelines issued by the RBI are as follows:\n\n1. Any entity, including individuals, holding government securities that are eligible for stripping/\nreconstitution (as notified by RBI from time to time) can strip/reconstitute these securities.\nStripping/reconstitution, however, is permitted only in the eligible government securities held\nin Subsidiary General Leger (SGL)/Constituent Subsidiary General Ledger (CSGL) accounts\nmaintained at Public Debt Office, RBI, Mumbai. Hence, any participant desirous of strip-\nping/reconstituting government securities must open and maintain a demat account (SGL\naccount or a Gilt account with a constituent) and hold government securities in electronic\nform.\n\n2. The process of stripping/reconstitution of government securities shall be carried out at Public\nDebt Office, in the PDO-NDS as a straight-through process without any manual intervention.\n\n3. Holders of government securities shall place their requests for stripping/reconstitution with\nan authorized entity. Initially, all PDs would be eligible to authorize stripping/reconstitution\nrequests.\n\n4. Stripping/reconstitution may be done at the option of the holder at any time from the date of issu-\nance of a government security till its maturity.\n\n5. All dated government securities having coupon payment dates on January 2 and July 2, irrespec-\ntive of the year of maturity shall be eligible for stripping/reconstitution.\n\n6. The minimum amount of securities that needs to be submitted for stripping/reconstitution will be\n1 crore (face value) and multiples thereof.\n\n7. STRIPS will be reckoned as eligible government securities for SLR purposes and retain all the\ncharacteristics of government security. They will be eligible securities for market repo as well as\nrepo under LAF of RBI but with appropriate haircut.\n\n8. STRIPS, being zero coupon securities, trade at a discount and are redeemed at face value. To\nbegin with, STRIPS will be tradable only in the OTC market and such trades in STRIPS need to\nbe reported on NDS for clearing and settlement through CCIL.\n\nThe guidelines relating to STRIPS became effective from April 1, 2010.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Retailing of Government Securities\n\nThe existence of a strong retail segment is a prerequisite for the development of the government securi-\nties market. Individuals can buy government securities from the RBI's public debt office during auctions.\nHowever, most investors are not familiar with the functioning of the government securities market and\nmost of them perceive government securities as an instrument meant for institutional investors. Owing\nto this, the retail market of government securities did not develop. The RBI has made efforts to promote\nretailing of government securities.\n\nBanks are allowed to freely buy and sell government securities on an outright basis at prevailing\nmarket prices. They retail government securities to non-bank clients without any restriction on the period\nbetween sale and purchase. Further, the interest income on government securities was exempted from the\nprovision of tax deduction at source with effect from June 1997 to facilitate genuine trading in the second-\nary market. With no TDS, government securities become an attractive investment for those interested in\navoiding TDS, such as senior citizens.\n\nOne of the major objectives of setting up the primary dealer system and satellite dealer system was\nto increase the distribution channels and encourage voluntary holding of government securities among a\nwider investor base. The RBI has extended to them a scheme for availing liquidity support and the facility\nof repos (as lenders) for increasing the retail network.\n\nWith a view to enabling dematerialization of securities of retail investors, the National Securities\nDepository Limited (NSDL), the Stock Holding Corporation of India Limited (SHCIL) and the National\nSecurities Clearing Corporation Limited (NSCCL) were allowed to open SGL accounts with the RBI.\nThe RBI allowed NSDL and CDSL to open a second SGL account for depository participants who, in\nturn, can hold in custody, government securities on behalf of the ultimate investors. Retail investment in\ngovernment securities has been made easy via demat accounts. The procedural hassles have been consid-\nerably reduced.\n\nThe RBI encouraged the setting up of mutual funds dealing exclusively in government securities,\ncalled gilt funds, with a view to creating a wider investor base for them. The RBI provides special liquid-\nity support to the extent of 20 per cent of the investment in government dated securities. A primary dealer\nsells gilts with a minimum investment of 225,000 while gilt funds provide access to an individual investor\nwith a low investment minimum of 85,000. The awareness about gilt funds is rising as they are offering\ngood returns. PNB Gilts is using the Punjab National Bank branch network to popularize government\nsecurities with retail investors. It has tied up with NSDL to work around the problem of physical transfers\nand has also launched an advertising campaign to inform the public about the advantages of investing in\ngovernment securities. At present there are 15 dedicated gilt funds eligible to draw liquidity support from\nthe RBI.\n\nIn order to encourage retail participation, in particular by mid-segment investors such as urban\ncooperative banks (UCBs), non-banking financial companies, trusts, and others in the primary mar-\nket of government dated securities, the RBI announced on December 7, 2001, a scheme of non-\ncompetitive bidding facility. According to this scheme, retail investors would be allocated upto 5 per\ncent of the notified amount at the weighted rate that evolves in the case of competitive bidding. The\nscheme became operational on January 14, 2002, when an auction of a 15-year government stock\nwas held.\n\nRetail trading in stock exchanges, viz., national Stock Exchange (NSE) and Bombay Stock Exchange\n(BSE) and over the counter exchanges of India (OTCEI) commenced from January 16, 2003. For this pur-\npose, banks and financial institutions were permitted to open demat accounts with depository participants\nin addition to their SGL accounts. The minimum order size was kept low at 71,000 but trading through\nstock exchanges failed to activate retail participation.\n\nA few banks and primary dealers have taken usefl initiatives to promote retail investment in govern-\nment securities by offering these securities for sale at retail outlets. However, not much has been achieved\nby these efforts. Banks have been reluctant to market government securities to retail investors apprehend-\ning the creation of an adverse impact on their own deposits. Moreover, not much headway has been made\nin retailing government stock by NSE, NSDL, and so on which were given the facility of a second SGL\naccount.\n\nIt is the primary dealers who can effectively build awareness regarding the advantages of holding\ngovernment securities. They should be given all infrastructure support to create a retail market for gov-\n\u2018ernment securities. PDs and banks may also provide both sale and purchase facility to ensure that retail\ninvestors are assured of liquidity of such investments. Besides these, the stock exchange network and the\ngilt funds can be used to expand the retail segment of the government securities market.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "\u2018When-issued\u2019 Market in Government Securities\n\nThe Reserve Bank allowed short-selling of government securities in the secondary market. It permitted\nintra-day short-selling of government securities with a stipulation that such a sale would be covered by pur-\nchase of bonds from the secondary market on the same trading day. This measure is expected to enhance\nliquidity in the government securities market. In July 2006, scheduled commercial banks and primary\ndealers were allowed to cover their short positions in Central Government Securities within an extended\nperiod of five trading days and to deliver a shorted security by borrowing it through the repo market.\n\nThe RBI issued guidelines in May 2006 for the development of \u2018when-issued\u2019 market in government\nsecurities. \u2018When Issued\u2019 is a short form of \u2018when, as and if issued.\u2019 All \u2018when-issued\u2019 transactions are on\nan \u2018if\u2019 basis, to be settled if and when the actual security is issued. \u2018When-issued\u2019 market enables mar-\nket participants to trade in government bonds ahead of sale of such securities in a primary auction. This\nenables market participants to hedge themselves against movement in prices after the auction and build a\nsecondary market in the bonds. Moreover, it facilitates the distribution process for government securities\nby stretching the actual distribution period for each issue and allowing the market more time to absorb\nlarge issues without disruption. It also facilitates price discovery process by reducing uncertainties sur-\nrounding auctions. According to the guidelines, transactions in a security on a \u2018When Issued\u2019 basis shall\nbe undertaken in the following manner:\n\n1. \u2018When-issued\u2019 transactions can be undertaken in case of new securities as well as securities that\nare being reissued.\n\n2. \u2018When issued\u2019 transactions would commence on the notification date and cease on the working\nday immediately preceding the date of issue.\n\n3. All when-issued transactions for all trade dates will be contracted for settlement on the date of\nissue.\n\n4. At the time of settlement on the date of issue, trades in the when-issued security can be netted off\nwith trades in the existing security.\n\n5. When issued transactions may be undertaken only on NDS-OM.\n\n6. Any \u2018when-issued\u2019 trade must have a Primary Dealer as a counter-party (both counter-parties can\nbe PDs). In other words, non-PDs cannot be both buyer and seller in a when issued transaction.\n\n7. Only PDs can take a short position in the \u2018when-issued\u2019 market. Non-PD entities can sell the when-\nissued security only if they have a preceding purchase contract for equivalent or higher amount.\n\n8. Open positions in the \u2018when-issued\u2019 market are subject to the following limits:\na. Non-PD entities\u2014Long position, not exceeding 5 per cent of the notified amount.

In case a PD is unable to deliver securities to the buyer after the auction on the settlement (or\n\nissue) date, the transaction will be settled as per the default settlement mechanism of CCIL.\n10.

The \u2018when-issued\u2019 market\n\nallows PDs to get a better understanding of what amounts they need to underwrite in an auction. It\nalso gives them a better idea of what would be the likely yields for the security, enabling them to bid\naccordingly. As only 5 per cent of the total notified amount can be acquired by a single entity, there is a\nlikelihood for wider distribution of the stock. It allows market more time to absorb large issues without\ndisruption and facilitates price discovery by reducing uncertainty surrounding auctions.\n\nThe trading in \u2018when issued\u2019 market commenced with the auction of central government securities in\nthe calendar week August | to 8, 2006.\n\nIn the US, a vibrant \u2018when issued\u2019 market for bonds as well as equities exists.\n",

For the smooth conduct of the government's business, it was mutually agreed between\nthe central government and the RBI that a minimum cash balance of 750 crore on Fridays and %4 crore\non other days would be held by the central government. To adhere to this administrative arrangement,\nit was agreed that whenever the cash balances fell below %50 crore, the RBI would automatically issue\nfresh ad hoc T-bills of an amount that would restore the balance to 50 crore. This mechanism ensured an\nunlimited access to the RBI\u2019s resources. The ad hoc T-bills which were meant to be temporary, gained a\npermanent as well as a cumulative character. Indeed, it became an attractive source of financing govern-\nment expenditure since it was available at an interest rate of 4.6 per cent per annum since 1974.\n\nThe RBI's credit to government is a source of reserve money generation and any investment in\ncentral government's securities by the RBI results in monetization of government deficit. Monetized\ndeficit is the increase in the net RBI credit to the central government which is the sum of increase in the\nRBI's holdings of the government of India\u2019s dated securities, treasury bills, rupee coins, and loans and\nadvances from the RBI to the centre since April 1, 1997, adjusted for changes in the centre\u2019s cash bal-\nances with the RBI. The RBI was expected to compulsorily finance ad hocs. The increase in the central\nbank\u2019s credit to the government led to an increase in money supply and inflation. The RBI had no way of\ncontaining monetization of the budget deficit and effectively implementing its monetary policy. In order\nto restore the role of the monetary policy in the economy, the government entered into an agreement\nwith the RBI to put an annual ceiling on the issue of treasury bills, to reduce that ceiling over time, and\nfinally to eliminate ad hocs.\n\nThe process of elimination of ad hocs was designed in three stages:\n\n+ Through limits on creation of ad hoc T-bills which operated between 1994-95 and 1996-97.\n\n+ Through a transition period of two years which began on April 1, 1997, when ad hocs were elimi-\nnated, and the new system of ways and means was introduced. However, overdraft above ways and\nmeans was made permissible only beyond ten continuous working days; though at a cost.\n\n+ The full-fledged system of WMA has been operating effectively since April 1999.\n",

However, there are floating rate or zero coupon securities also. No TDS is\napplicable. All government securities are SLR eligible. The central government securities are eligible\nfor ready forward (repo) facility, whereas state loans are not eligible for repos. These securities are\nhighly liquid.\n\nPrimary Market Issuance of Government Securities\nGovernment securities are issued either through auction, sale, or private placement with the RBI.\n\nAuction Auction is a form of allocative mechanism whereby commodities and financial assets are\nallocated to individuals and firms, particularly ina market-oriented economy. The government's preference\nfor the auction system for selling securities stems from the ability of auctions to reveal more information\nabout price determination and improve the allocation process. Auctions are designed to generate higher\nvolumes for meeting the target market requirement without recourse to underwriting and/or devolvement,\nbroaden participation to ensure that bids are not concentrated or skewed, and ensure efficiency through\nlowering the cost of borrowing for the government. In June 1992, the government switched from the fixed\nprice tender offer to the auction system for sale of government securities. The government, as a part of\nits annual budget exercise, announces the borrowing programme for the financial year. The RBI, acting\nin the capacity of merchant banker for the government's borrowing programme, raises money on behalf\nof the government by auctioning securities from time-to-time depending on the government's need for\nmoney, interest rates, and liquidity in the banking system.\n\nThe primary market for central government securities starts with an auction. A brief outline of the\nauction process is given as follows:\n\n+ The RBI announces the quantum, maturity, and date of the auction.\n\n+ On the day of the auction, all the participants submit their bid to the RBI. The bid includes the quan-\ntum and the yield at which they are bidding.\n\n+ The RBI decides the cut-off yield on the basis of the competitive bids it has received and its own\nview of the interest rates.\n\n* Once the cut-off yield is decided, bids below the cut-off yield are accepted and bids above the cutoff\nyield are rejected.\n\n+ Ifthe amount for which the bids are received falls short of the total quantum for which the auction\nis conducted, the RBI devolves the shortfall on itself or on the primary dealers (to the extent of their\nunderwriting commitments).\n\n* The cut-off yield becomes the coupon rate of that particular security.\n\n+ Lately, in order to promote liquidity in a particular security and to reduce the number of different\ngovernment securities, the RBI has started issuing further tranches of existing securities in price-\nbased auction. Since the coupon rate and the maturity of the security are decided earlier, the bids\nare for the price. The auction procedure remains the same except that the bids higher than the\ncut-off price are accepted. Successful bidders are those that bid at a higher price, exhausting the\naccepted amount at the cut-off price. This multiple-price auctions are predominantly used in sell-\ning government securities. Since 1999-2000, most of the current primary issues of dated securi-\nties are through re-issues and price-based auctions, instead of yield-based auctions, to enable the\nconsolidation of securities. Such consolidation is necessary for ensuring sufficient volumes and\nliquidity in any one issue, to facilitate emergence of benchmarks, and development of separately\ntraded registered interest and principal of securities. The uniform price auction format for auctions,\nwhich was confined to the auction of 91-day treasury bills, was extended to the auction of dated\nsecurities in November 2001.\n\n+ The government auctions fixed rate, floating rate and inflation indexed bonds.\n\nThe government auctioned for the first time, on July 17, 2002, a bond with call and put features\nwherein the issuer can have the option to buy-back (call option) or the investor can have the option to sell\nthe bond (put option) at par value at the time of any of the half-yearly coupon dates starting after comple-\ntion of five years tenure from the date of issuance. The notified amount was 23,000 crore and the bond had\na maturity of 10 years. On any coupon date on or after five years, the government can call the bond with\ntwo months\u2019 notice. The investor also has the right to put the bond on the same terms.\n\nCompetitive and non-competitive bidding: Government Securities are issued through bidding\nwherein the competitive bidders are primary dealers, financial institutions, mutual funds, and banks.\nThe auction system was introduced in 1992 wherein the amount is notified but the coupon rate is\nauction determined. Since its inception, the multiple price auction method has been used. From 2001,\nboth the multiple price and uniform price auction methods are in use.The uniform price method is\nused when there is market uncertainty and for issuing new instruments as well as bonds with long\ntenor.\n\nNon-competitive bidding: The RBI introduced non-competitive bidding with a provision for\nallocation of upto 5 per cent of the notified amount in specified auctions of dated securities for\nallotment to retail investors on a non-competitive basis at the weighted average rate. The scheme\nwas operationalized from January 14, 2002, with the auction of 15-year government stock. Non-\ncompetitive bids are conducted to encourage participants who do not have sufficient expertise in\nbidding. The non-competitive bidders are state governments, municipalities, non-government\nprovident funds, and other central banks.\n\ni, Yield-Based Auction: A yield-based auction is generally conducted when a new Government security is issued. Investors bid in yield\nterms up to two decimal places (for example, 8.19 per cent, 8.20 per cent, etc.). Bids are arranged in ascending order and the cut-off yield\nis arrived at the yield corresponding to the notified amount of the auction. The cut-off yield is taken as the coupon rate for the security.\nSuccessful bidders are those who have bid at or below the cut-off yield, Bids which are higher than the cut-off yield are rejected. An il-\nlustrative example of the yield-based auction is given below:\n\nYield-Based Auction of a New Security\n\n+ Maturity Date: September8, 2018\n\n* Coupon: It is determined in the auction (8.22 percent as shown in the illustration as shown below).\n* Auction date: September 5, 2008*\n\n* Notified Amount: 21000 crore\n\n* September 6 and 7 being holidays, settlement is done on September 8, 2008, under T+ 1 cycle.\n\nDetails of Bids Received in the Increasing Order of Bid Yields\n\n\u2018Amount of Bid Cummulative Amount Price* with Coupon as\nBid No. Bid Yield @ in Crores) @ in Crores) 8.22 Per Cent\n\n1 8.19 per cent 300 300 100.19\n2 8.20 per cent 200 500 100.14\n3 8.20 per cent 250 750 100.13\n4 8.21 per cent 150 900 100.09\n5 8.22 per cent 100 1000 100\n\n6 8.22 per cent 100 1100 100\n\n7 8.23 per cent 150 1250 99.93\n8 8.24 per cent 100 1350 99.87\n\nThe issuer would get the notified amount by accepting bids up to 5. Since the bid number 6 also is at the same yield, bid numbers 5 and\n6 would get allotment pro-rata, so that the notified amount is not exceeded. In the above case, each would get %50 crore. Bid numbers 7\nand 8 are rejected as the yields are higher than the cut-off yield.\n\nii. Price-Based Auction: A price-based auction is conducted when Government of India re-issues securities issued earlier. Bidders quote\nin terms of price per 100 of face value of the security (e.g., 2102.00, 7101.00, 2100.00, 299.00, etc., per 2100/-). Bids are arranged in\ndescending order and the successful bidders are those who have bid at or above the cut-off price. Bids which are below the cut-off price\nare rejected. An illustrative example of price-based auction is given as follows:\n\nPrice-Based Auction of an Existing Security 8.24 per cent Gs 2018\n\n* Maturity Date: April 22, 2018\n\nCoupon: 8.24 per cent\n\n\u2018Auction date: September 5, 2008\n\nAuction settlement date: September 8, 2008*\nNotified Amount: %1000 crore\n\n* September 6 and 7 being holidays, settlement is done on September 8, 2008, under T+1 cycle.\n\n\nDetails of Bids Received in the Decreasing Order of Bid Price\n\nBid Number Price of Bid Amount of Bid @ in Cr) Implicit Yield Cumulative Amount\n1 100.31 300 8.1912 per cent 300\n2 100.26 200 8.1987 per cent 500\n3 100.25 250 8.2002 per cent 750\n4 100.21 150 8.2062 per cent 900\n5 100.20 100 8.2077 per cent 1000\n6 100.20 100 8.2077 per cent 1100\n7 100.16 150 8.2136 per cent 1250\n8 100.15 100 8.2151 per cent 1350\n\nThe issuer would get the notified amount by accepting bids up to 5. Since the bid number 6 also is at the same price, bid numbers 5 and 6\nwould get allotment in proportion so that the notified amount is not exceeded. In the above case each would get 50 crore. Bid numbers\n7 and 8 are rejected as the price quoted is less than the cut-off price.\n\nDepending upon the method of allocation to successful bidders, auction could be classified as Uniform Price based and Multiple Price\nbased. In a Uniform Price auction, all the successful bidders are required to pay for the allotted quantity of securities at the same rate, i.e.,\nat the auction cut-off rate, irrespective of the rate quoted by them. On the other hand, in a Multiple Price auction, the successful bidders are\nrequired to pay for the allotted quantity of securities at the respective price/yield at which they have bid. In the example under ({i) above,\nif the auction was Uniform Price based, all bidders would get allotment at the cut-off price, i.e., \u00a3100.20. On the other hand, if the auction\nwas Multiple Price based, each bidder would get the allotment at the price he/she has bid, i.e., bidder 1 at 7100.31, bidder 2 at 7100.26,\nand soon.\n\nSource: RBI, Government Securities Market in India\u2014A Primer, www.rbi.org.in\n\nRetail investors such as individuals, firms, companies, corporate bodies, urban cooperative banks,\ninstitutions, provident funds, trusts, and any other entity as may be prescribed by the RBI are allowed\nto participate in auctions as non-competitive bidders. These bidders are required to submit their\nbids through banks and PDs. Allocation for non-competitive bidding is within the notified amount\nand if the amount tendered by the non-competitive bidders is less than the reserved amount, all\nparticipants receive the full amount and the shortfall is transferred to a competitive position. If the\namount received is more than the reserved amount, a pro-rata allotment is made to applicants. A\nnon-competitive bidder is permitted to submit only one bid in the auction with a minimum amount\nof 710,000 and a maximum of 22 crore. Non-competitive bidders are issued securities at the weighted\naverage price determined in competitive auctions.\n\nThere does not exist a fixed calendar for auctions of dated government securities. However, the auc-\ntion of a dated security is announced in advance through a public notification. The securities are issued to\nsuccessful bidders in the form of stock certificates or by credit to their SGL account.\n\nSale Earlier, the RBI used to adopt the sale route instead of auctions. Here, the coupon rate and maturity\nare predetermined and the securities are sold to investors at par. This approach was used predominantly\nfor state loans upto 2005-06. Of late, some states have tried the auction method successfully. As part of\nits open market operations, the RBI often sells outstanding securities (devolved or privately placed with\nitself earlier) through its sale window at preannounced prices.\n\nPrivate Placement with the Reserve Bank There are times when there is very tight liquidity in the banking\nsystem or when investors expect very high yields on the one hand and on the other, the RBI wants to keep\nthe borrowing costs in check. Hence, it may not be possible for the RBI to hold an auction/sale. The RBI then\nplaces the securities with itself and funds the government. These securities are later sold in the market through\nits sale window at an opportune time. In this way, the RBI also signals its view on the interest rate.\n\nMarket Borrowings, Ownership Pattern, Maturity Structure, and Interest Rates\n\nThe developments in the government securities market are generally influenced by the central gov-\nernment\u2019s actual borrowing vis-a-vis the budgeted amounts, maturity, structure of the debt issued or\n\nproposed to be issued, absorptive capacity of the market, and policies relating to domestic debt manage-\nment. With a view to developing an active market for government securities, this market is being organ-\nized in such a way that the government reduces its dependence on credit from the RBI and other banks.\nThere has been an increase in the market borrowings of the central government. Since 1990-91, the bor-\nrowing programme of both the centre and the states handled by the RBI increased more than 50-fold from\n211,000 crore in 1990-91 to 26,000 billion in 2016-17. The major reasons for this increase were as follows:\n\n+ A significant increase in repayment obligations arising out of high levels of domestic debt. For\ninstance, in 1998-99, repayment liabilities of the central government absorbed 33 per cent of gross\ndebts raised from the market as against only 16 per cent in 1991-92.\n\n+ The abolition of ad hoc and tap T-bills from 1996-97. These bills constituted a resource base for the\ngovernment and with their discontinuance, the government had to borrow heavily from the market.\n\n+ The fiscal deficit exceeding the target by a wide margin. As a result, a large part of the fiscal deficit\nis financed through market borrowing. Since 2009-10, the central government financed nearly\n90 per cent of its fiscal deficit through market borrowings as against 18 per cent in 1990-91. The\nrevenue component of fiscal deficit is rising at a faster rate than the fiscal deficit itself. This means\nthat the government is borrowing more for consumption rather than investment purposes.\n\nLarge government borrowings have an adverse effect on interest rate. The nominal interest rates rise\non debt which make the debt market relatively more attractive than the equity market. Corporates find\nit difficult to raise funds through equity due to the depressed state of the equity market. This increases\ntheir debt-equity ratio and cost of borrowings which, in turn, affect the competitiveness of the private\nsector. Interest payments account for 35 per cent of government revenues. Large market borrowings\nwhen it is used to finance current expenditure, crowds out private investment, increases interest rate and\nimposes high debt burden on future generations. Thus, high level of government borrowings create a\nvicious circle.\n\nIn view of the large borrowing programme of the central government, the RBI has made efforts to sof-\nten the medium-and long-term interest rates on government securities either through direct devolvement\nor private placement combined with open market operations. In addition, since April 1999, the RBI has\nbeen reissuing the existing stocks through price-based auctions, thereby limiting the number of outstand-\ning stocks. This passive consolidation strategy has been adopted due to the large market borrowings of\nthe government. The RBI has also adopted the strategy of elongating the maturity profile of securities.\n\nThe Government announced net market borrowings for 2017-18 in the Union Budget at %4,232 billion\n(BE), which included planned buyback of securities of 750 billion. The Union Budget has also provided\nfor 2250 billion for switching of securities, which is a debt management strategy that aims at reducing\nnear-term redemption pressure and elongating the maturity of debt.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Ownership Pattern of Central and State Government Securities\n\nThe subscribers to government securities are the RBI, commercial banks, insurance companies, mutual\nfunds, provident funds, and others.\n\nNotwithstanding various reform measures to develop and widen the primary market for government\nsecurities, the market continues to be dominated by captive investors such as commercial banks and\ninsurance companies. Banks have traditionally been the dominant investors of the government securities\ndue to SLR requirements. The investment of commercial banks constitutes, on an average, 35 per cent of\nthe stock of government securities even though the SLR of the banks was significantly lowered to 23 per\ncent in 2013. Banks have found it advantageous to invest in government securities beyond the statutory\nrequirements due to attractive market related interest rates offered since 1992-93, zero-risk nature of\nthese securities, and depressed commercial credit market.\n\nThis narrow ownership base has a two-fold implications for the government. First, the large magnitude\nof borrowing puts pressure on the absorptive capacity of the market, particularly when the commercial\nbanks hold excess government securities. Therefore, their choice regarding further subscription to gov-\nernment paper depends upon the attractiveness of return on other competing assets, particularly on loans\nand advances. When the industrial outlook improves and the demand for credit takes off, banks may not\nshow their willingness to subscribe to government securities. Secondly, the concentration of the debt mar-\nket in a few large investors introduces an element of rigidity in the downward adjustment of interest rate\n\u2018on government securities, particularly in the event of fulfilling the targeted market borrowing programme\nof the government.\n\nThe RBI's holding of government securities declined steeply in 1994-95 to 2.0 per cent from 20.3\nper cent in 1990-91. This reflects that the government securities market has developed after reforms.\n\nHowever, this trend reversed in 1997-98 with the surge in the RBI's holdings to 10.7 per cent as special\nsecurities in the bank\u2019s portfolio were converted to marketable lots with a view to facilitating open market\noperations. The RBI\u2019s holding of government securities increased to 14.6 per cent in 2016.\n\nThe Reserve Bank\u2019s absorption of primary issues: The RBI's absorption of primary issues came down\ndrastically from 49.3 per cent in 1990-91 to 1.8 per cent in 1994-95. This was due to the higher absorptive\ncapacity of the market. The RBI's subscription increased in the year 1998-99 due to the central government's\nrecourse to gross market borrowings; and to contain the impact of high government borrowings, it privately\nplaced the issues with itself. The monetary impact of the government borrowings was contained by offloading\nthese securities in the market at a favourable time through open market operations.\n\nThe Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003 stipulates that the Reserve Bank\ncannot participate in the primary auctions of government securities from April 1, 2006. The Reserve Bank\u2019s\nsubscription to primary issues substantially declined during 2004-05 and during the year 2005-06, gross issues\nof 210,000 were privately placed with the Reserve Bank at the end of the year. The RBI did not subscribe to\nprimary issues of the central government since 2007-08.\n\nMaturity structure of central government dated securities outstanding: With a move towards\nmarket related interest rates for meeting the borrowing requirements of the central government, there\nhas been a significant shift in the maturity pattern of central government dated securities. A significant\ntransformation in the maturity structure has been noted. The maturity structure of dated securities was\nhighly skewed at the short end. The government's heavy dependence on short-to medium-term securities\nfor the mobilization of market borrowing was due to uncertainty in market conditions and investor's\npreference for short-term maturities. Moreover, it was a conscious policy on the part of the government\nto minimise the cost of borrowing by placing a large part of the borrowings at the shorter end of the\nmarket. This maturity structure tilted towards short-term securities which led to significant higher gross\nborrowings to adhere to the repayment schedule. To avoid such high cost borrowings and redemption\npressure entailing refinance risk, the government has avoided excessive maturities at the short end and the\ntrend is towards issue of long-term securities since 1999-2000.\n\nThe low inflation rate and development of the government securities market helped in the successful elon-\ngation of maturity.\n\nInterest rates in the primary market: The yield rates in the primary market refer to the interest cost\nat which the government borrows from the market. The interest rates in the primary market are influenced\nby the prevailing liquidity conditions, RBI\u2019s intervention by way of devolvement and private placement,\nand amount and frequency of issues during the year.\n\nThe weighted average interest rate of dated securities of the centre progressively rose from 11.41 per\ncent in 1990-91 to 13.75 per cent in 1995-96. The increased recourse to borrowing from the market and\nspells of tight liquidity put pressure on interest rates. Since 1996-97, the interest rates have declined;\nin the year 1999-2000, the interest rates were very close to the interest rates in 1991-92. Inspite of an\nincrease in the market borrowing of the central government, the RBI was in a position to contain the inter-\nest rates. The RBI accepts the private placement of government stocks and releases them to the market\nwhen interest rate expectations become favourable. This policy of the RBI moderates the adverse impact\nof large borrowings by the central government. Moreover, liquidity conditions also softened in the money\nmarket which helped in containing the interest rates. The yields on primary issues of dated government\nsecurities eased during the year 2003-04. However, in the subsequent years there was a sharp increase in\nthe weighted average interest rates of dated securities on account of hardening of interest rates and tight\nliquidity conditions. The weighted average yields have declined since 2015-16 and were 7.5 per cent in\n2016-17.\n\nYield curve: The shape of the yield curve reflects the relationship among yields of securities that\ndiffer only with respect to their term of maturity. The curve depicts the various rates at which the same\nborrower is able to borrow for different periods of time. The most closely watched yield curve in any\ncountry is that of the government securities\u2019 which is the closest approximation of a risk-free yield.\nOther yield curves, such as the one for corporate borrowers, are best understood in comparison with\nthe risk-free yield.\n\nThe yield curve is drawn against two axes: the vertical showing yield and the horizontal giving the\nterm in years. The precise shape of the yield curve varies slightly from day-to-day and can change sig-\nnificantly from month to month. Normally, a yield curve is upward sloping which indicates a higher yield\nfor longer maturity security. If long-term interest rates rise relative to short-term interest rates, the curve\nsteepens. If short-term interest rates rise relative to long-term rates, the curve flattens.\n\nWeighted Average Coupon Rates on Government of India Dated Securities\n\nBox 10.4 Yield and Bond Prices\n\nThe price of a bond in the market is dependent on forces of demand and supply, economic\nconditions, general money market conditions, interest rates prevalent in the market, future\ninterest rate expectations, and credit quality of the issuer.\n\nYields and bond prices are inversely related. When the interest rates in the market rise,\nthe price of outstanding bonds will fall until the yield of these bonds is high enough to match\nthe high interest rates on the new bond issues and the effect is vice versa when interest rates\nfall.\n\nAfter a three-year period of positive returns on the notional one-year zero-coupon bond,\nnegative returns were experienced in 2004 as the interest rates had gone up. An increase in\ninterest rates leads to a fall in the bond prices which results in negative returns.\n\nA number of studies confirm that the slope of the yield curve contains significant informa-\ntion about the future path of macro-economic variables in a number of countries. The yield\ncurve is used to forecast short-term interest rates. When investors repeatedly purchase money\nmarket instruments rather than long-term instruments, and if a steeper yield curve emerges,\nit implies that they expect the money market yield to be higher in future than it is now. An\ninverted yield curve emerges when short-term interest rates are higher than long-term interest\nrates. Such a yield curve indicates that there is credit squeeze by the central bank. This credit\nsqueeze is based on lower inflation expectation. Hence, investors in longer term instruments\nwillingly accept lower nominal interest rates than one available on short-term instruments.\nThis behaviour leads to an inverted yield curve.\n\nVarying liquidity conditions and lack of adequate trading depth in the secondary market\nfor government securities caused frequent shifts in the term structure of interest rates in the\nprimary market.\n\nThe yield curve became inverted in 1993-94 due to spells of tight liquidity conditions.\nA downward shift was witnessed in 1994-95 but it shifted upward again in 1995-96 and\n1996-97. Differences in the short and long-term inflationary expectations and temporary\nimbalances in the short-term money market and foreign exchange markets led to an inverted\nyield curve. The yield curve declined in 1997-98 and 1998-99 due to the RBI's policy of\nprivate placement to itself and a comfortable liquidity position in the money market. The\nyield curve of 2001-02 reflects a decline in both short and long-term yield rates. The yield\ncurve flattened during 2003-04 as the long-term yields fell due to surplus liquidity. The yield\ncurve shifted upwards during the year 2006-07, 2007-08 and 2011-12 with the increase in\nthe interest rates across the maturity spectrum (Figure 10.1).\n\nThe yield curve started shifting downwards from 2015-16 onwards.\n\nThe low yields were a result of measures such as planned and predictable issuances, suit-\nability of instruments as per investor preferences and improved transparency through timely\nand appropriate communication to the market.\n\n",

Over the Counter (OTC)/Telephone Market\n\nIn this market, a participant, who wants to buy or sell a government security, may contact a bank/Pri-\nmary Dealer/financial institution either directly or through a broker registered with SEBI and negotiate\nfor a certain amount of a particular security at a certain price. Such negotiations are usually done on\ntelephone and a deal may be struck if both counterparties agree on the amount and rate. Transactions\nundertaken between market participants in the OTC/telephone market are expected to be mandatorily\nreported on the NDS platform within 15 minutes after the deal is put through over telephone.\n\nii. Negotiated Dealing System\n\nThe Negotiated Dealing System (NDS) for electronic dealing and reporting of transactions in govern-\nment securities was introduced in February 2002. It facilitates the members to submit electronically,\nbids or applications for primary issuance of Government Securities when auctions are conducted. NDS\nalso provides an interface to the Securities Settlement System (SSS) of the Public Debt Office, RBI,\nMumbai thereby facilitating settlement of transactions in Government Securities (both outright and\nrepos) conducted in the secondary market. Membership to the NDS is restricted to members holding\nSGL and/or Current Account with the RBI, Mumbai.\n\nIn August, 2005, RBI introduced an anonymous screen-based order matching module on NDS, called\nNDS-OM. This is an order driven electronic system, where the participants can trade anonymously by plac-\ning their orders on the system or accepting the orders already placed by other participants. NDS-OM is oper-\nated by the Clearing Corporation of India Ltd. (CCIL) on behalf of the RBI. Direct access to the NDS-OM\nsystem is currently available only to select financial institutions like Commercial Banks, Primary Dealers,\nInsurance Companies, Mutual Funds, etc. Other participants can access this system through their custodians,\nie., with whom they maintain Gilt Accounts. The custodians place the orders on behalf of their customers like\nthe urban co-operative banks. The advantages of NDS-OM are price transparency and better price discovery.\n\nIn the case of NDS-OM, participants place orders (price and quantity) on the system. Participants can\nmodify/cancel their orders. Order could be a bid for purchase or offer for sale of securities. The system,\nin turn will match the orders based on price and time priority. That is, it matches bids and offers of the\nsame prices with time priority. The NDS-OM system has separate screen for the Central Government,\nState Government and Treasury bill trading. In addition, there is a screen for odd lot trading for facilitat-\ning trading by small participants in smaller lots of less than 85 crore (i.e., the standard market lot). The\nNDS-OM platform is an anonymous platform wherein the participants will not know the counterparty to\nthe trade. Once an order is matched, the deal ticket gets generated automatically and the trade details flow\nto the CCIL. Due to anonymity offered by the system, the pricing is not influenced by the participants\u2019\nsize and standing.\n\nGilt Account holders have been given indirect access to NDS through custodian institutions. A mem-\nber (who has the direct access) can report on the NDS the transaction of a Gilt Account holder in gov-\nernment securities. Similarly, Gilt Account holders have also been given indirect access to NDS~-OM\nthrough the custodians. However, currently two gilt account holders of the same custodian are not\npermitted to undertake repo transactions between themselves.\n\ntock Exchanges\n\nFacilities are also available for trading in Government securities on stock exchanges (NSE, BSE)\nwhich cater to the needs of retail investors.\n",

The settlement cycle for\ndated security auction is T+1, whereas for that of Treasury bill auction is T+2. On the settlement date,\nthe fund accounts of the participants are debited by their respective amounts paid and their securities\naccounts (SGL accounts) are credited with the amount of securities that they were allotted.\n\nSecondary Market\n\nThe transactions relating to Government securities are settled through the member's securities/current\naccounts maintained with the RBI, with delivery of securities and payment of funds being done on a\nnet basis. The Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL) guarantees settlement of trades on the set-\ntlement date by becoming a central counter-party to every trade through the process of novation, ie., it\nbecomes seller to the buyer and buyer to the seller.\n\nAll outright secondary market transactions in Government Securities are settled on T+1 basis while in\ncase of repo transactions in Government securities, the market participants will have the choice of settling\nthe first leg on either T+0 basis or T+1 basis as per their requirement.\n\nSubsidiary general ledger account: +The RBI acts as a depository-cum-clearing house and settlement\nis through accounts maintained with the RBI called the subsidiary general ledger (SGL) accounts. The\nphysical securities are dematerialized and the relevant holdings are in the form of book entries. Every\nparticipant in the government securities market maintains SGL and current accounts with the RBI. Those\nnot eligible to maintain direct accounts with the RBI have the facility to open constituent SGL accounts or\nSGL II accounts with banks who have direct SGL accounts. The RBI has permitted the National Securities\nClearing Corporation Limited, banks, insurance companies, financial institutions, and primary dealers to\noffer constituent SGL account facility to an investor who is interested in participating in the government\nsecurities market. Any trade among participants are settled via this facility. The parties exchange the\nrelevant SGL instruction receipts and the mode of transaction is delivery versus payment (DVP). The\nDVP system ensures settlement by synchronising the transfer of securities with cash payment. In the first\nphase, the RBI settled the payment of securities only on DVP-I basis where both funds and securities were\nsettled on a gross basis. For all transactions undertaken directly between SGL participants, the settlement\nperiod was of T+0 or T+1 days while for transactions routed through brokers of the NSE, the BSE, or\nthe OTCEI, the settlement period was upto T+5 days. Participants had the flexibility to decide the terms\nof settlement. Trades were settled by T+3, if desired by participants. This reduced settlement risks in\nsecurities transactions also prevented diversion of funds through SGL transactions.\n\nThe RBI launched the third phase of delivery versus payments (DVP III) on April 2, 2004. DVP-III\nis an enhancement to the DVP-II form of settlement, as it allows netting of transactions in government\nsecurities. DVP-III has boosted trading and improved liquidity in bonds market. This new system has\ncome as a major relief to the market for repos. Earlier, participants could not sell bonds on the same\nday of the maturity of the repo contract as the RBI credited the securities account, called the SGL\naccount, a day after the trade book place. Under DVP-III, participants are able to sell bonds the same\nday and protect themselves against price risk. DVP-III allows short sales of bonds to the extent that the\nsecurities should be contracted for purchase (but are not credited to the SGL account), provided such a\npurchase is guaranteed by the Clearing Corporation of India Ltd (CCIL) or the RBI is a counterparty,\nto the deal. The settlement cycle of such a sale should be either the same as that of the purchase or a\nsubsequent day, so that the delivery obligation under the sale contract is met by the bonds acquired\nunder the purchase contract. The purchase leg of the transaction needs to precede the sell leg. If the\nsecurities are purchased on \u2018T +0\" basis (settlement on the same day), then it can be sold either on\n\u2018T+0 or \u2018T+1\u2019 (settlement a day later) basis. If it is bought on \u201cT+ 1, it can be sold on \u201cT+1\u201d on the\nday of purchase or \u2018T+0\u00b0/*T + 1\u2019 on the next day. DVP-III has also enabled participants to roll over repo\ncontracts, which are guaranteed by the CCIL. The security prices and interest rates on repos need to be\nrenegotiated on the roll over.\n\nSGL accounts are maintained by the public debt office. The PDO oversees the settlement of trans-\nactions through SGL and enables the transfer of securities from one participant to another. The seller\nfills up the SGL form, the buyer countersigns it, and the seller sends this form to the RBI. The buyer\ntransfers funds towards payment. Inter-bank government securities trades are settled on the same busi-\nness day while trades with non-bank counterparties settle either on the same day or upto five business\ndays after the trade date. Secondary market trades in government securities between banks are car-\nried on upto 1.00 p.m. on business days and settled on the same day. Trades after that are settled the\nnext day.\n\nThe transfer of government securities does not attract stamp duty or transfer fee. Moreover, there is no\ntax deduction at source on these securities.\n\nTrade in the physical form is settled by the parties directly. Securities are delivered in the form of a\nphysical certificate along with the transfer deed duly executed by the authorized signatures of the trans-\nferor. The transferee has to lodge the certificates with the RBI for transfer. The settlement cycle for\nsecondary market government securities transactions has been standardized to T+1 with effect from\nMay 11, 2005.\n\nSteps to develop the secondary market: With financial sector reforms, efforts have been made to\ndevelop and widen the government securities market. Of late, the government has realised that a vibrant\nliquid secondary market fosters the growth of the primary market and hence the emphasis has shifted to\nthe development of a liquid and broad based secondary market.\n\nSubsidiary general ledger transactions were introduced to foster the growth of the secondary market\nby imparting a greater clement of transparency. The Discount and Finance House of India (DFHI) was\nallowed to participate in treasury bills and dated securities. The market infrastructure was strengthened by\nsetting up of the Securities Trading Corporation of India in May 1994 to impart liquidity to government\nsecurities. The primary dealer system and the satellite dealer system were set up to strengthen the securi-\nties market infrastructure and to bring about an improvement in the secondary market trading, liquidity,\nand turnover.\n\nThe move to market related rates of interest has strengthened the development of the secondary\nmarket.\n\nThe RBI issued guidelines to banks for the retailing of government securities with non-bank clients\non June 8, 1996. This move was a part of the measures to develop the secondary market in government\nsecurities and to make the market deep and broad based.\n\nThe RBI introduced the delivery versus payment mode of settlement for subsidiary general ledger\ntransactions in government securities, electronic payment system to initiate balance inquiry and extended\nthe MICR cheque clearing to non-metropolitan centres. It has been decided by the RBI to set up a very\nsmall aperture terminals (VSATs) which will not only provide reliable communication to the financial\nsector but would also improve the payments and clearing systems, facilitate funds transfer, and help in the\nbuilding up of securities settlements on a centralized basis.\n\nThe RBI encouraged the setting up of mutual funds dealing exclusively in gilts for encouraging retail\nparticipation. These funds, known as gilt funds, exclusively invest in government securities and the RBI\nprovides liquidity support to the extent of 20 per cent of their investment by way of reverse repos in cen-\ntral government securities outstanding at the end of the previous calendar month.\n\nThe RBI provides two-way quotes\u2014buy and sell quotes\u2014through its sale window to infuse liquidity\nin the secondary market for government securities. It offers two-way quotes on a select list of securities to\nimprove liquidity. It continuously revises the sale/purchase prices and the list of securities.\n\nThe RBI has planned to adopt the true real time gross settlement (RTGS) model system for govern-\nment securities clearance and settlement. In RTGS, all transactions (claims or counter-claims) are settled\nimmediately, that is, on a gross basis and this obviates the need for any clearing arrangement. However,\nparticipants under the RTGS system have to maintain sufficient liquidity throughout the trading cycle\nto instantly honour every claim that is placed against them. The RBI has proposed to provide intra-day\nliquidity support to the participants to maintain minimum cash balances.\n\nSecondary market transactions in government securities: The transactions in government securities\nhave been made through the SGL since September 1994. The turnover consists of outright transactions as\nwell as repos in eligible securities and treasury bills.\n\nThe steady growth in turnover and outright transactions reflects the increasing depth attained by the\ngovernment securities market and the emergence of an active secondary market in government securities.\n\nSecondary Market Turnover in the Wholesale Debt Market Segment of NSE The National\nSecurities Clearing Corporation Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the NSE obtained permission\nfrom the RBI to open subsidiary general ledger accounts to offer constituent SGL facility to a wide range\nof investors. It has set up a common clearing and settlement framework for its SGL constituents to remove\nthe counter-party risks, The majority of trades in government securities takes place through telephone but\na large number of trades get routed through NSE brokers.\n\n\u2018The trades in Government securities on the WDM segment of NSE have increased substantially. The\nshare of the WDM segment in the total turnover of non-repo (outright) transactions have also increased.\nThe transactions in dated securities account for a substantial share of transactions on the WDM seg-\nment. Banks and trading members are the dominant participants in WDM segment and WDM trades\nrespectively.\n",

The MTDS has been articulated for a period of\nthree years (2015-16 to 2017-18). It is premised on three broad pillars: low costs, risk mitigation and\nmarket development in line with the sound international practices while factoring in domestic economic\nand financial conditions. The low cost objective is pursued through measures such as planned and pre-\ndictable issuances, suitability of instruments as per investor preferences and improved transparency\n\nthrough timely and appropriate communication to the market. The strategy adopted to contain rollover\nrisks include switches/buybacks, elongation of maturity and placement of limits on issuances and annual\nmaturities. Interest rate risks were dealt with by keeping the floating rate debt low; foreign currency risks\nwere addressed by issuing debt in domestic currency, developing a stable domestic investor base and a\ncalibrated opening of the g-secs market to foreign investors.\n\nThe Reserve Bank will continue to develop the government securities market by introducing new\ninstruments, expanding the investor base and strengthening market infrastructure.\n\nThe borrowing programme of the central government is sought to be smoothly completed, while\nreducing costs and mitigating risks by adopting the following measures:\n\n(i) Continuing the practice of front loading of market borrowings through dated securities.\n(ii) Switching of securities for effective liability management keeping in view the evolving market\nconditions.\n\n(iii) Pursuing the objective of elongating the maturity to contain rollover risks.\n\n(iv) MTDS articulated for three years will be reviewed and rolled over for the next three years\n(2016-17 to 2018-19).\n\n(v) Cash Coordination Committee (CCC) comprising members from the Government of India\nand the Reserve Bank will work towards better information sharing, cash flow forecasting and\nmanagement.\n\n(vi) Features of the Sovereign Gold Bond (SGB) scheme launched during 2015-16 will be improved\nupon for greater acceptability and expansion of the retail investor base.\n(vii) With the objective of enhancing liquidity and giving a retail push to the secondary market for\ngovernment securities, a market making scheme will be formulated.\n(viii) The Reserve Bank will continue to make efforts towards market development, providing\ngreater predictability and ease of access to the g-sec auction process by market participants.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Tools for Managing Liquidity in the Government Secu\nThe RBI uses basically two tools to manage liquidity in the government securities market. These are: repos\nand open market operations. Repos have already been discussed in Chapter 4. The RBI manages short-term\nliquidity through repos and reverse repos and long-term liquidity through open market sales to absorb liquidity\nin conjunction with private placement/devolvement and open market purchases in tight liquidity conditions.\n\nOpen Market Operations\n\nOpen market operation is an important tool of liquidity management. OMOs are actively used to neu-\ntralise excess liquidity in the system and to contain wide fluctuations in the domestic money and foreign\nexchange markets. It is an actively used technique of monetary control in developed countries such as\nthe UK and USA. OMOs directly affect the availability and cost of credit. Its two objectives are: to\ninfluence the reserves of commercial banks, in order to control their power of credit creation and to affect\nthe market rates of interest.\n\nOMOs involve the sale or purchase of government securities by the central bank. When the RBI sells\ngovernment securities in the market, it withdraws a part of the deposit resources of the banks, thereby reduc-\ning the resources available with the banks for lending. The bank\u2019s capacity to create credit, that is, give fresh\nloans, depends upon its surplus cash, i.e., the amount of cash resources in excess of the statutory CRR stipu-\nlated by the RBI. The open market sale of securities reduces the surplus cash resources of banks as these\nresources are used to purchase government securities. Banks have to contract their credit supply to generate\nsome cash resources to meet the CRR. The supply of bank credit which involves the creation of demand\ndeposit falls and money supply contracts. The reverse happens when the RBI undertakes open market pur-\nchase of government securities. The open market purchase of securities leads to a reduction in the stock of\nsecurities of the seller bank and an expansion in the free surplus cash which augments the credit creation\ncapacity of banks. The result is an expansion in the supply of bank credit and an increase in money supply.\n\nOMOs do not alter the total stock of government securities but change the proportion of government\nsecurities held by the RBI and commercial and cooperative banks. Open market sales result in a fall in\nnet RBI credit to government (NRCG) and an increase in the other banks\u2019 (co-operative and commercial)\ncredit to government (OBCG) without affecting the budget (fiscal) deficit in anyway.\n\nThe RBI resorts to private placement when market conditions for government securities are not\nfavourable and conducts open market sales later when liquidity conditions turn favourable. Thus, the RBI\ninfluences the resource position of banks, yields on government securities, and cost of bank credit through\nthe open market sale and purchase of government securities.\n\n\nThe RBI can buy or sell or hold government securities of all maturities without any restrictions. The\nbank purchased and sold government securities upto 1991-92 out of the surplus funds of IDBI, EXIM\nBank, NABARD, and other institutions under a special buy back arrangement. Till 1991-92, the market\nof OMOs was quite narrow as interest rates were administered and the government securities market\nwas not broad based either. However, with the initiation of several measures to promote both primary\nand secondary markets in government securities, the OMO market has become active and OMOs have\nemerged as an important tool of debt management. Accordingly, various steps have been taken to alter\nthe composition, maturity structure, and yield of government securities. The RBI also introduced the sale\nof securities from its own account on the basis of repo. Besides this, the bank offers for sale only a select\nnumber of securities which it wishes to undertake in response to market conditions, instead of maintain-\ning a list including all dated securities in its portfolio. The RBI has also put on its purchase list a couple\nof securities for cash with a view to providing liquidity to at least a few securities.\n\nIn a move to augment the stock of marketable securities for active OMOs, special securities of value\naggregating %15,000 crore at 4.6 per cent were converted into marketable securities of 10-year, 7-year, and\n8-year maturities at 13.05 per cent, 12.59 per cent, and 11.19 per cent on June 3, June 18, and August 12,\n1997, respectively. The cost of additional interest on account of this conversion is fully borne by the RBI\nand is paid to the government as part of transfer of profits from year to year.\n\nThe RBI included treasury bills of varying maturities in the OMOs in 1998-99. The resort to OMOs\nepitomizes the move from direct to indirect instruments of monetary control.\n\nOMOs have been successfully used by the RBI to groom or switch operations, ie., the sale of long-\nterm scrips in exchange for short-term loans. This helps in lengthening the maturity structure of govern-\nment securities which, in turn, becomes favourable for the working of the monetary policy.\n\nThe volume of RBI net sales (sales \u2014 purchase) increased over the years except in the year 1994-95\nwhen tight money market conditions prevailed. Since 1996-97, OMOs have come into a sharper focus.\nThe stock of marketable securities was augmented by conversion of special securities into marketable\nsecurities for conducting active OMOs. During 1996-97, outright sale of securities came into prominence\nto absorb excess liquidity which was due to large capital inflows and to maintain domestic interest rate\nand exchange rate at reasonable levels. The RBI did not purchase any security during 1998-99 through its\nOMO window. The open market sale rose significantly by 290 per cent in 1998-99. An important aspect\nin the OMO during 1998-99 was the inclusion of treasury bills of varying maturities. In 2000-01, due to\nuncertain foreign exchange market conditions and unfavourable market conditions for government secu-\ntities, the RBI privately placed securities with itself. The securities were subsequently sold on-tap basis\nand through OMO auctions.\n\nThe RBI conducted a series of open market purchases aggregating %5,084 crore during September\n18-October 10, 2001, to support the government securities market in the face of the steep fall in the\ngovernment securities prices due to adverse external developments after September 11, 2001. Subse-\nquently, with stability in market conditions and easing of liquidity, it resorted to open market sales. These\nsales helped the RBI to absorb surplus liquidity on an enduring basis, stabilizing the prices of government\nsecurities, and offloading the securities privately placed with it. The RBI once again purchased govern-\nment securities in 2008 and in the subsequent years to ease liquidity conditions in the market.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Infrastructure Development of the Government Securities Market\n\nThe government securities market constitutes the principal segment of the debt market. The develop-\nment of any market requires the strengthening of the market infrastructure with large number of market\nplayers who have divergent perceptions about the market and who would continuously provide liquidity.\nOne of the initiatives taken to develop the government securities market during the first stage of the\nreform process was the setting up of Securities Trading Corporation of India. The STCI, together with\nDiscount and Finance House of India, had the task of developing an active secondary market in govern-\nment securities.\n\nThe RBI introduced the primary dealer system and satellite dealer system to further strengthen the\nmarket infrastructure.\n\nPrimary Dealer System\n\nThe primary dealer (PD) system was first introduced in the US in 1960. In the US, there are 25 primary\ndealers, most of which are banking or investment banking institutions. Other countries with a successful PD\nsystem include Argentina, Brazil, Canada, France, Hungary, Italy, Korea, Mexico, Singapore, Thailand, and\nthe UK. The obligations of PDs in these countries include participating in the primary market, serving as a\n\nmarket maker in the secondary market and providing market-related information to the central bank. Some\nadvances countries such as Australia, Germany, and New Zealand have not yet established the PD system.\n\nA system of primary dealers was introduced in India in 1996, to further strengthen the market infra-\nstructure and to make it more liquid and broad based. The objectives of the introduction of this system\nwere as follows.\n\n* To strengthen the government securities infrastructure and facilitate government's market borrowing\nprogramme.\n\n* To bring about improvements in the secondary market trading, liquidity and turnover in government\nsecurities.\n\n+ To encourage a voluntary holding of government securities amongst a wider investor base.\n\n* To make PDs an effective conduit of OMOs.\n\nThe major focus of PDs would be on increasing the turnover of government securities rather than\nbecoming a mere repository of this system. Hence, their role would be to act as market makers by provid-\ning two-way quotes in the secondary market, thereby ensuring liquidity and support to the primary market\noperation. In the long run, this system would facilitate the transfer of market-making activities from the\nRBI to PDs.\n\nPDs can be subsidiaries of scheduled commercial banks, subsidiaries of all-India financial institu-\ntions, companies under Companies Act, 1956 engaged predominantly in government securities market,\nand subsidiaries of foreign banks/securities firms. Every PD has to maintain minimum net owned funds\nof %50 crore deployed daily in the government securities market. To ensure stability of PDs in times\nof volatile interest rates, the minimum capital requirement has been increased from 250 crore to 2150\ncrore. PDs which intend to diversify into other permissible activities need to have net owned funds of\n2250 crore as against %100 crore earlier.\n\nBanks which do not have a partly or wholly owned subsidiary can undertake PD business if they fulfill\nthe following eligibility criteria:\n\n1. Minimum net owned funds (NOF) of 71,000 crore,\n2. Minimum capital adequacy ratio (CRAR) of 9 per cent and net NPAs of less than 3 per cent and\na profit making record for the last three years.\n\nThey are also required to ensure that, at any point of time, there is a minimum balance of 2100 crore of\ngovernment securities earmarked for PD business. Bank-PDs will not have separate access to call money\nmarket and liquidity adjustment facility (LAF).\n\nPDs as institutional entities fall in the category of non-banking finance companies. PDs are reg-\nistered with and regulated by the Reserve Bank of India, irrespective of whether they accept public\ndeposits or not.\n\nNumber of PDs DFHI and STCI were accredited as primary dealers on March 1, 1996. On June 1, 1996,\nfour more PDs\u2014SBI gilts, PNB gilts, Gilts Securities Trading Corporation Limited, and ICICI Securities\u2014\nbecame operational. As on March 31, 2016, there were 21 approved PDs in the gilts market. Of these,\nseven were non-bank entities (stand alone PDs) and the remaining 14 were banks undertaking PD business\ndepartmentally(Bank PDs) registered as NBFCs under section 45 IA of the RBI act, 1934. The stand alone\nPDs are Securities Trading Corporation of India Ltd, SBI DFHI Ltd., ICICI Securities Ltd., PNB Gilts Ltd.,\nMorgan Stanley-PD, Nomura FI Sec. Ltd. and Goldman Sachs.\n\nObligations Upon PDs The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003\nstipulates that the Reserve Bank cannot participate in the primary auctions of government securities\nfrom April 1, 2006. Due to this, the responsibility of supporting government securities auctions has\nshifted to the primary dealers (PDs). PDs are expected to play an active role in the government securities\nmarket, both in its primary and secondary market segments. In order to enable PDs to perform their role\neffectively, the RBI has cast certain obligations upon PDs. The major roles and obligations of PDs are:\n\n1. PDs are required to support primary market auctions for issue of Government dated securities and\nTreasury Bills as per the minimum norms for underwriting commitment, bidding commitment\nand success ratio as prescribed by RBI from time to time.\n\n2. PDs should offer two-way prices (market making)in Government securities, through the Negoti-\nated Dealing System-Order Matching (NDS-OM), over-the-counter market and recognized Stock\nExchanges in India and take principal positions in the secondary market for Government securities.\n\n3. PDs should maintain adequate physical infrastructure and skilled manpower for efficient partici-\npation in primary issues, trading in the secondary market, and to advise and educate investors.\n\n4. A Primary Dealer shall have an efficient internal control system for fair conduct of business, set-\ntlement of trades and maintenance of accounts.\n\n5. A Primary Dealer will provide access to RBI to all records, books, information and documents\nas and when required.\n\n6. PDs\u2019 investment in Government Securities and Treasury Bills on a daily basis should be at least\nequal to its net call/notice/repo (including CBLO) borrowing plus net RBI borrowing (through\nLAF/Intra-Day Liquidity/Liquidity Support) plus the minimum prescribed NOF.\n\n7. PDs should annually achieve a minimum turnover ratio of 5 times for Government dated securi-\nties and 10 times for Treasury Bills of the average month-end stocks. The turnover ratio in respect\nof outright transactions should not be less than 3 times in government dated securities and 6 times\nin Treasury Bills (Turnover ratio is computed as the ratio of total purchase and sales during the\nyear in the secondary market to average month-end stocks).\n\n8. A PD should submit periodic returns as prescribed by RBI from time to time.\n\n9. PDs\u2019 operations are subject to prudential and regulatory guidelines issued by RBI from time\nto time.\n\nFacilities Extended by the RBI to PDs To strengthen this system and to make PDs fulfill their\nobligations, the RBI extends to them various facilities which include:\n\n1. Access to Current Account facility and Subsidiary General Ledger (SGL) Account facility (for\nGovernment securities) with RBI.\n\n2. Permission to borrow and lend in the money market including call money market and to trade in\nall money market instruments.\n\n3. Memberships of electronic dealing, trading and settlement systems (NDS platforms/INFINET/\nRIGS/CCIL).\n\n4, Access to the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) of RBI.\n\n5. Access to liquidity support from RBI under a scheme separately notified for standalone PDs.\n\n6. Favoured access to open market operations by Reserve Bank of India.\n\nSources and Application of Funds Call/Notice Money Market\n\n1. PDs are permitted to borrow funds from call/notice/term money market and repo (including\nCBLO) market.\n\n2. PDs are allowed to borrow from call/notice market, on an average in a reporting fortnight, up to\n225 per cent of their net owned funds (NOF) as at the end March of the preceding financial year.\n\n3. PDs may lend up to 25 per cent of their NOF in call/notice market. The limit will be determined\nby PDs on an average basis during a \u2018reporting fortnight.\u201d\n\n4, These limits on borrowing and lending are subject to periodic review by Reserve Bank of India.\n\nLiquidity Support from the RBI In addition to access to the RBI's Liquidity Adjustment Facility,\nstand alone PDs are also provided with liquidity support by the Reserve Bank of India against eligible\nGovernment securities including State Development Loans (SDLs). The parameters based on which\nliquidity support will be allocated are given below:\n\n1. Of the total liquidity support, half of the amount will be divided equally among all the stand-alone\nPDs. The remaining half (i.e., 50 per cent) will be divided in the ratio of 1:1 based on market\nperformance in primary market and secondary market. Performance in primary market will be com-\nputed on the basis of bids accepted in the T-Bill auction and G-sec auction in the proportionate\nweights of 1 and 3. Similarly, the secondary market performance will be judged on the basis of\noutright turnover in T-Bills and dated Government securities in the proportionate weights of 1 and 3.\n\n2. The PD-wise limit of liquidity support will be revised every half-year (April-September and\nOctober-March) based on the market performance of the PDs in the preceding six months.\n\n3. The liquidity support to PDs will be made available at the \u2018Repo rate\u2019 announced by the Reserve Bank.\n\n4. The liquidity support availed by a PD will be repayable within a period of 90 days. The penal rate\nof interest payable by PDs if liquidity support is repaid after 90 days is Bank rate plus 5 percent-\nage points for the period beyond 90 days.\n\nInter-Corporate Deposits _Inter-Corporate Deposits (ICD) may be raised by Primary Dealers sparingly\nand should not be used as a continuous source of funds. After proper and due consideration of the risks\n\ninvolved, the Board of Directors of the PD should lay down the policy in this regard, which among others,\nshould include the following general principles:\n\n1. While the ceiling fixed on ICD borrowings should in no case exceed 50 per cent of the NOF as at\nthe end of March of the preceding financial year, it is expected that actual dependence on ICDs\nwould be much below this ceiling.\n\n2. ICDs accepted by PDs should be for a minimum period of one week.\n\n3. ICDs accepted from parent/promoter/group companies or any other related party should be on\n\u2018arms length basis\u2019 and disclosed in financial statements as \u2018related party transactions.\u201d\n\n4, Funds raised through ICDs are subject to ALM discipline.\n\nPDs are prohibited from placing funds in ICD market.\n",

The share under MUC will be uni-\nform for all PDs, irrespective of their capital or balance sheet size. The remaining portion of the\nnotified amount will be underwritten through an Additional Competitive Underwriting (ACU)\nauction.\n\n}. RBI will announce the MUC of each PD and the balance amount which will be underwritten under the\n\nACU auction. In the ACU auction, each PD would be required to bid for an amount at least equal to its\nshare of MUC. A PD cannot bid for more than 30 per cent of the notified amount in the ACU auction.\n\n. The auction could be either uniform price-based or multiple price-based depending upon the\n\nmarket conditions and other relevant factors, which will be announced before the underwriting\nauction for each issue.\n\n. Bids will be tendered by PDs within the stipulated time, indicating both the amount of the under-\n\nwriting commitment and underwriting commission rates. A PD can submit multiple bids for\nunderwriting. Depending upon the bids submitted for underwriting, RBI will decide the cut-off\nrate of commission and inform the PDs.\n\n. Underwriting commission: All successful bidders in the ACU auction will be paid underwriting\n\ncommission on the ACU segment as per the auction rules. Those PDs who succeed in the ACU\nfor 4 per cent and above of the notified amount of the issue, will be paid commission on the MUC\nat the weighted average of all the accepted bids in the ACU. Others will get commission on the\nMUC at the weighted average rate of the three lowest bids in the ACU.\n\n. In the GOI securities auction, a PD should bid for an amount not less than their total underwriting\n\nobligation. If two or more issues are floated on the same day, the minimum bid amount will be\napplied to each issue separately.\n\n. Underwriting commission will be paid on the amount accepted for underwriting by the RBI, irre-\n\nspective of the actual amount of devolvement, by credit to the current account of the respective\nPDs at the RBI, Fort, Mumbai, on the date of issue of security.\n\nme\n\n9. In case of devolvement, PDs would be allowed to set-off the accepted bids in the auction against\ntheir underwriting commitment accepted by the Reserve Bank. Devolvement of securities, if any,\non PDs will take place on pro-rata basis, depending upon the amount of underwriting obligation\nof each PD after setting off the successful bids in the auction.\n\n10. RBI reserves the right to accept any amount of underwriting up to 100 per cent of the notified\namount or even reject all the bids tendered by PDs for underwriting, without assigning any reason.\n11. An illustration pertaining to the underwriting procedure is given in Annexure III.\n\nDated securities of state governments\n\n1. On announcement of an auction of dated securities of the State Governments for which auction\nis held, RBI may invite PDs to collectively bid to underwrite up to 100 per cent of the notified\namount of State Development Loans (SDL).\n\n. A PD can bid to underwrite up to 30 per cent of the notified amount of the issue. If two or more issues\nare floated on the same day, the limit of 30 per cent is applied by taking the notified amounts separately.\n\n|. Bids will be tendered by PDs within the stipulated time, indicating both the amount of the underwriting\ncommitments and underwriting commission rates.

Each PD will individually commit, at the beginning of the year, to submit bids for a fixed percent-\nage of the notified amount of Treasury Bills in each auction.\n\n2. The minimum bidding commitment amount/percentage for each PD will be determined by the\nReserve Bank, in consultation with the PD. While finalizing the bidding commitments, the RBI will\ntake into account the net owned funds (NOF), the offer made by the PD, its track record, and its past\nadherence to the prescribed success ratio. The amount/percentage of minimum bidding commit-\nment so determined by the Reserve Bank will remain unchanged for the entire financial year or till\nthe conclusion of agreement on bidding commitments for the next financial year, whichever is later.\n\n3. In any auction of Treasury Bills, if a PD fails to submit the required minimum bid or submits a\nbid lower than its commitment, the Reserve Bank may take appropriate action against the PD.\n\n4. A PD would be required to achieve a minimum success ratio of 40 per cent of bidding commit-\nment for Treasury Bills auctions which will be monitored on a half yearly basis. A PD is required\nto achieve the minimum level of success ratio in each half year (April to September and October\nto March) separately.\n\nPrimary dealers can undertake \u2018When Issued\u2019 transactions in government securities, sale of securities\nallotted in primary issues on the same day and short sale in Central Government dated securities.\n\nPDs are expected to play an active role in providing liquidity to the Government securities market and\npromote retailing. They are allowed to make full use of the facility to distribute Government securities to\nall categories of investors through the process of placing and picking-up orders on the exchanges. PDs may\nopen demat accounts with a Depository Participant (DP) of NSDL/CDSL in addition to their accounts with\nRBI. Value free transfer of securities between SGL/CSGL and demat accounts is enabled by PDO-Mumbai\nsubject to guidelines issued by RBI's Department of Government and Bank Accounts (DGBA).\n\nDiversification of Activities by Stand-alone Primary Dealers\n\nPrimary Dealers reported a loss of 2700 crore during 2004-05 on account of an upturn in interest rates\nand yields. The Reserve Bank permitted PDs to diversify their activities in addition to their existing busi-\nness of government securities from July 4, 2006 subject to certain conditions such as:\n\n1. PDs, desirous of diversifying their activities should have a minimum net owned funds (NOF) of\n2250 crore as against %50 crore for a PD, which does not propose to diversify its activities.\n\n2. The eligible PDs may bifurcate their operations into core activities and non-core activities. The\ncore activities should involve dealing in government securities, interest rate derivatives, security\nreceipts issued by securitization companies/reconstruction Companies, asset backed securities\n(ABS), mortgage backed securities (MBS) and other fixed income securities such as commercial\npapers and certificates of deposit, dealing and underwriting in corporate/PSU/FI bonds/deben-\ntures, lending in call/notice/term/repo/CBLO market and providing broking services in govern-\nment securities .The non-core activities of PDs may include investment/trading in equity/units\nof equityoriented mutual funds/advisory services/merchant banking and other specified activities\nsuch as professional clearing services, distribution of mutual fund units, and distribution of insur-\nance products. PDs are not allowed to undertake broking in equity, trading/broking in commodities,\ngold and foreign exchange. However, all PDs are required to ensure predominance of investment\nin government securities business by maintaining atleast 50 per cent of their total financial invest-\nments (both long-term and short-term) in government securities at any point of time.\n\n3. The exposure to non-core activities shall be subject to risk allocation. PDs may calculate the\ncapital charge for market risk on the stock positions/underlying stock positions/units of equity\noriented mutual funds using Internal Models (VaR based) based on the prescribed Reserve Bank\nguidelines, The capital charge for market risk so calculated should not be more than 20 per cent\nof the NOF as per the last audited balancesheet.\n\n4. PDs are not permitted to set-up step-down subsidiaries. PDs that already have step-down subsidiar-\nies (in India and abroad) may restructure the ownership pattern of such subsidiaries. If the PD is a\nsubsidiary of a holding company, the step-down subsidiary of the PD may become another direct\nsubsidiary of the holding company. In case the PD itself is a holding company, then the step-down\nsubsidiary may take up the PD activity and the holding entity may take up activities other than those\npermitted for PDs. The restructuring should be completed within a period of six months.\n\nThe Reserve Bank also gave primary dealers the option to merge with the bank which promoted them.\nThese Bank PDs have to fulfill the eligibility criteria and are subject to all obligation applicable to\nstand-alone PDs. They have also to adhere to the following prudential norms:\n\n1. The capital adequacy requirement for a bank will also apply to its PD business.\n\n2. The government securities under PD business are reckoned for the SLR requirement.\n\n3. The investment valuation guidelines as applicable to banks with regard to \u2018held for trading\u2019 port-\nfolio are also applicable to the portfolio of government securities earmarked for PD business.\n",

PDs should frame and implement investment and operational policy guidelines on securities\n\ntransactions which should be approved by their Boards. While laying down these guidelines, the\nPDs should strictly adhere to Reserve Bank\u2019s instructions, issued from time to time. The effective-\nness of the policy and operational guidelines should be periodically evaluated.\n\n. PDs should necessarily hold their investments in Government securities portfolio in SGL with\n\nRBI. They may also have a dematerialized account with depositories (NSDL/CDSL). All pur-\nchase/sale transactions in Government securities by PDs should be compulsorily through SGL/\nCSGL/Demat accounts.\n\n. PDs should hold all other investments such as commercial papers, bonds and debentures, pri-\n\nvately placed or otherwise, and equity instruments, only in dematerialized form.\n\n. All problem exposures, which are not backed by any security or backed by security of doubtful\n\nvalue, should be fully provided for. Where a PD has filed suit against another party for recovery,\nsuch exposures should be evaluated and provisions made to the satisfaction of auditors. Any claim\nagainst the PD should also be taken note of and provisions made to the satisfaction of auditors.\n\n. The profit and loss account should reflect the problem exposures if any, and also the effect of\n\nvaluation of portfolio, as per the instructions issued by the Reserve Bank, from time to time. The\nreport of the statutory auditors should contain a certification to this effect.\n\nInvestment in Non-government Securities The RBI issued norms for investment by PDs in non-SLR.\ndebt in March 2004. These guidelines cover PDs\u2019 investments in non-government securities (including\ncapital gains bonds, bonds eligible for priority sector status, bonds issued by Central or State public\n\nsector undertakings with or without Government guarantees and bonds issued by banks and financial\ncompanies) generally issued by corporates, banks, FIs and State and Central Government sponsored\ninstitutions, SPVs, etc. These guidelines will, however, not be applicable to (i) units of equity oriented\nmutual fund schemes where any part of the corpus can be invested in equity, (ii) venture capital funds,\n(iii) commercial paper, (iv) certificate of deposit, and (v) investments in equity shares. The guidelines\nwill apply to investments both in the primary market and the secondary market. According to the norms,\n\n1. The investment of PDs in unlisted non-SLR securities should not exceed 10 per cent of their\nportfolio. PDs\u2019 investment in paper issued by securitization and reconstruction companies and\nsecuritized debt in the nature of asset backed securities (ABS) and mortgage-backed securities\n(MBS) will be included in the 10 per cent ceiling for unlisted debt.\n\n2. PDs should not invest in non-SLR papers with an original maturity of less than one year, other than\ncommercial paper and certificates of deposits. PDs are barred from investing in un-rated non-SLR\nbonds. The RBI has excluded investment in mutual fund schemes, which invest their entire corpus\nin debt securities from these norms for PDs. In addition, PDs are required to report their secondary\nmarket transactions in corporate bonds done in the OTC market on FIMMDA\u2019s reporting platform.\n\nSupervision of PDs\n\nPDs have been brought under the purview of the BFS in 2002-03 in view of their growing systemic\nimportance in terms of the following attributes : (a) their large number, (b) highly leveraged portfolios\nwith short-term funds, (c) substantial share in the government securities market, and (d) a significant\nposition in the money market, comparable with banks. The RBI also undertakes on-site inspection of each\nPD besides the off-site supervision through prescribed periodic returns.\n\nThe off-site surveillance of PDs is done on the basis of three basic returns\u2014PDR I, II, and III. PDR I\nis daily statement of sources and uses of funds and is used to monitor the deployment of call borrowing\nand the RBI liquidity support, leverage, and duration of PDs portfolio. PDR I return has been revised\nto capture more details on sources such as ICDs and CPs. PDR I! is a monthly statement on the basis of\nwhich bidding commitments, success ratio, underwriting performance, and secondary market turnover\nof PDs are monitored. PDR III is a quarterly return on the basis of which the capital adequacy of PDs is\nmonitored. Apart from these regular returns, additional details are called for as and when necessary. The\nALM guidelines for NBFCs with some modifications were also made applicable to PDs. A new quarterly\nreturn\u2014PDR IV was introduced from the quarter ended March 31, 2004. PDR IV is a quarterly return on\ncertain balance sheet and profit and loss indicators.\n",

Measurement of Risk Weighted Assets The details of credit risk weights for various on-balance\nsheet and off-balance sheet items and methodology of computing the risk weighted assets for the credit\nrisk are listed in Annex-II. The procedure for calculating capital charge for market risk is detailed in\nAnnex-IIl.\n\n4. Capital Adequacy Requirements\n(i) The capital charge for credit risk and market risk as indicated in Annex-II and Annex-III, shall\nbe maintained at all times.\n\n(ii) In calculating eligible capital, it will be necessary first to calculate the SPD\u2019s minimum capital\nrequirement for credit risk, and thereafter its market risk requirement, to establish how much\nTier-I and Tier-II capital is available to support market risk. Of the 15% capital charge for credit\nrisk, at least 50% shall be met by Tier-I capital, that is, the total of Tier-II capital, if any, shall\nnot exceed one hundred per cent of Tier-I capital, at any point of time, for meeting the capital\ncharge for credit risk.\n\n(iii) Subordinated debt as Tier-II capital shall not exceed 50 per cent of Tier-I capital.\n\n(iv) The total of Tier-II capital shall not exceed 100% of Tier-I capital.\n\n(v) Eligible capital will be the sum of the whole of the SPD\u2019s Tier-I capital, plus all of its Tier-II\ncapital under the limits imposed, as summarized above.\n\n(vi) The overall capital adequacy ratio will be calculated by establishing an explicit numerical link\nbetween the credit risk and the market risk factors, by multiplying the market risk capital charge\nwith 6.67, ie., the reciprocal of the minimum credit risk capital charge of 15 per cent.\n\n(vii) The resultant figure shall be added to the sum of risk weighted assets worked out for credit risk\npurpose. The numerator for calculating the overall ratio will be the SPD\u2019s total capital funds\n(Tier-I and Tier-II capital, after applicable deductions, if any).\n\n5. Diversification of SPD Activities\n\n(i) The guidelines on diversification of activities by SPDs shall be as contained in the operational\nguidelines for primary dealers.\n\n(ii) The capital charge for market risk Value-at-Risk (VaR) calculated at 99 per cent confidence\nlevel, 15-day holding period, with multiplier of 3.3 for the activities defined below shall not be\nmore than 20 per cent of the Net Owned Fund (NOF) as per the last audited balance sheet:\n\n(a) Investment/trading in equity and equity derivatives\n(b) Investment in units of equity oriented mutual funds\n\n(c) Underwriting public issues of equity\n(d) Participation in currency futures market\n\n(iii) SPDs shall calculate the capital charge for market risk on the stock positions/underlying stock\npositions/units of equity oriented mutual funds using Internal Models (VaR based).\n",

With a view to encouraging wider participation of all classes of investors, including retail, in\nG-See, trading in G-Sec through a nationwide, anonymous, order driven screen-based trading\nsystem on stock exchanges, in the same manner in which trading takes place in equities, has been\npermitted. Accordingly, trading of dated G-Sec in demat form is allowed on automated order\ndriven system of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India, the Bombay Stock Exchange Ltd.,\nMumbai (BSE), the Over the Counter Exchange of India (OTCEI) and the MCX Stock Exchange.\nThis trading facility is in addition to the reporting/trading facility in the NDS. Being a parallel\nsystem, the trades concluded on the exchanges will be cleared by their respective clearing corpo-\nrations/clearing houses.\n\n2. SPDs shall play an active role in providing liquidity to the G-Sec market and promote retailing.\nThey shall, therefore, make full use of the facility to distribute G-Sec to all categories of investors\nthrough the process of placing and picking-up orders on the exchanges. SPDs may open demat\naccounts with a Depository Participant (DP) of NSDL/CDSL in addition to their accounts with\nRBI. Value free transfer of securities between SGL/CSGL and own demat account is enabled by\nPDO-Mumbai subject to guidelines issued by Department of Government and Bank Accounts\n(DGBA), RBI.\n\n3. For trading of G-Sec on stock exchanges the following shall be adhered to by SPDs:\n\n(i) SPDs shall take specific approval from their board to enable them to trade in the stock\nexchanges.\n\n(ii) SPDs shall undertake transactions only on the basis of giving and taking delivery of securi-\nties.\n\n(iii) Brokers/trading members shall not be involved in the settlement process. All trades shall\nbe settled either directly with clearing corporation/clearing house (in case they are clearing\nmembers) or else through clearing member custodians.\n\n(iv) The trades done through any single broker shall also be subject to the current regulations on\ntransactions done through brokers.\n\n(v) A standardized settlement on T+1 basis of all outright secondary market transactions in\nG-Sec has been adopted to provide the participants more processing time for transactions\nand to help in better funds as well as risk management.\n\n(vi) In the case of repo transactions in G-Sec, however, market participants will have the choice\nof settling the first leg on either T+0 basis or T+1 basis, as per their requirements.\n\n(vii) Any settlement failure on account of non-delivery of securities/non-availability of clear\nfunds will be treated as SGL bouncing and the current penalties in respect of SGL transac-\ntions will be applicable. Stock exchanges will report such failures to the respective PDOs.\n\n(viii) SPDs who are trading members of the stock exchanges may have to put up margins on\nbehalf of their non-institutional client trades. Such margins are required to be collected\nfrom the respective clients. SPDs shall not pay up margins on behalf of their client trades\nand incur overnight credit exposure to their clients. So far as the intraday exposures on cli-\nents for margins are concerned, the SPDs shall be conscious of the underlying risks in such\nexposures.\n\n(ix) SPDs, who intend to offer clearing/custodial services, shall take specific approval from\nSEBI in this regard. Similarly, SPDs who intend to take trading membership of the stock\nexchanges shall satisfy the criteria laid down by SEBI and the stock exchanges.\n\nPrimary Dealers Association of India\n\nPDs formed an autonomous, Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO), Primary Dealers Association of India\n(PDAI) in 1996. The role of PDAI is as follows:\n\n* To promote a liquid debt market and set common standards for market participants.\n+ To achieve a harmonious integration of different segments of markets.\n\n+ To build a healthy relationship between different segments of market participants.\n+ To remove some legal, procedural, and administrative bottlenecks in the efficient functioning of the\nmarket.\n\nBanks and PDs together formed another autonomous self-regulatory body, Fixed Income Money\n\nMarket and Derivatives Association of India (FIMMDAI), in 1997.\n\nThese two SROs have been proactive and are closely involved in contemporary issues relating to the\ndevelopment of the money market and government securities market. The credit for upgrading the techno-\nlogical infrastructure in these two markets goes to these two SROs. The representatives of the PDAI and\nFIMMDAL are members of the Technical Advisory Group on Money and Government Securities Markets\nof the Reserve Bank. The FIMMDAI has now taken over the responsibility of publishing the yield curve\nin the debt markets. The FIMMDAI prepared the guidelines for standard procedures and documentation\nto be followed by the participants in the commercial paper market and certificate of deposit market. Cur-\nrently, the FIMMDAI is working towards the development of uniform documentation and accounting\nprinciples of the repo market.\n\nOperations of PDs PDs bid substantially higher as against their bidding commitments in the primary\nmarket.\n\nIn the secondary market also, PDs achieved a higher turnover. In the secondary market, PDs individu-\nally achieve a minimum annual total turnover ratio (outright and repo transactions) of 5 times in dated\ngovernment securities and 10 times in T-Bills. PDs also achieve the minimum annual outright turnover\nratio of 3 times in dated G-Sec and 6 times in T-Bills. This reflects that PDs have made an effort to provide\nliquidity to the secondary market in government securities in their existence of twenty years. In a short\nspan of time, PDs have sharpened their trading skills which has helped them in earning a greater return\non assets. Besides this, factors such as a sharp decline in long-term interest rates, high liquidity, increase\nin investor preference for government securities, and thrust on the retailing of government securities have\nhelped PDs in increasing the turnover in government securities.\n\nThe RBI, by way of a circular on July 26, 2002 made it mandatory for PDs to make public their per-\nformance accounts and results by way of newspaper advertisements.\n\nThe RBI divested its entire holdings in two PDs\u2014Securities Trading Corporation of India and Dis-\ncount and Finance House of India to avoid any potential conflict of interest generated by the ownership\nof regulated financial institutions.\n\nYields on government securities moved up by around 150 basis points during the year 2004-05. All\nPDs made losses as the soft interest rate regime ended. This resulted in low volumes, volatility in prices\nand low profitability. Moreover, PDs have to fulfill their bidding obligations and turnover requirements\nwhich has had an impact on their profitability. This led to a decline in the number of active PDs in the\nmarket, thus, limiting competition.\n\nThe RBI has proposed to provide exclusivity to PDs in primary issuances through the introduction of\nbook building for government security issues. Introduction of book building will necessitate that every\nplayer subscribing to an issue goes through the PD, who will run the book for an issue of government\nsecurities. This will enable the PD to make an effective bid as he will be aware of the quantity and price\nat which the demand for the issue is coming in and also provide an alternative revenue streams for PDs.\nMoreover, business opportunities for primary dealers are expected to decline with the reduction in the\nfiscal deficit, hardening of government security yields and with electronic trading of securities and auc-\ntions. Hence, the RBI is considering proposal to permit primary dealers to invest in overseas sovereign\nbonds, and allow setting of joint ventures/wholly owned subsidiaries abroad to enable them to diversify\ntheir balance sheets.\n\nPDs entirely rely on trading in government and corporate bonds to earn revenues. Recently, they have\nurged the RBI to allow them into other areas such as equities, interest rate futures, foreign exchange, and\ncommodities to reduce their dependence on bonds to earn revenues.\n\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Conclusion\n\nPDs have done a remarkable job in strengthening the government securities market infrastructure and\nimproving the liquidity and turnover in the secondary market. PDs have emerged as dominant investors\nin the primary market issuances of government securities. The strengthening of the PD system enabled\nthe RBI to successfully exit from the primary market with effect from April 1, 2006. However, there is\nstill a long way to go for PDs. PDs together or their association, PDAI, should put in more efforts in the\nfollowing areas for the healthy development of the government securities market:\n\nPDs or PDAI should take initiative in building awareness of government securities amongst individ-\nual investors so that a retail market for government securities is developed. Retailing of government\nsecurities is necessary to impart liquidity to the government securities market.\n\nOne of the basic obligations of PDs is to offer two-way quotes in government securities, thereby\nproviding continuous liquidity in the market. There is a need for greater transparency in the market-\nmaking function of PDs which, in turn, would impart credibility to PDs\u2019 operations. This will also\nhelp in retailing of government securities.\n\nPDs should continuously disseminate information to the RBI regarding market development. This\nwould help the bank to know when to intervene in the market.\n\nPDs should strengthen their capital base to reduce their dependence on call money borrowings. This\nwill automatically reduce any risk arising on account of market volatility.\n\nIn Stage II of LAP, one-third of the liquidity support normally available to them at fixed rate of\ninterest would then be available at market rates. This calls for a careful future business planning on\npart of PDs.\n\nPDs should adopt proper risk management practices to improve their returns.\n\nPDs should expand their branch network and spread their operations to other places to cater to the\ninvestment requirements of corporates and other large investors in government securities.\n\nThey need to be more proactive and business minded.\n\nSatellite Dealers In order to widen the scope for organized dealing and distribution arrangement in\nthe government securities market and to support the system of primary dealers, the RBI introduced a\nsupporting infrastructure in the form of satellite dealers (SDs). SDs form the second tier of trading and\ndistribution of government securities.\n\nThe guidelines for registration of satellite dealers in government securities market were announced\non December 31, 1996. According to the guidelines, subsidiaries of scheduled commercial banks and\nall-India financial institutions (AIFIs), and companies incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956\nwith minimum net owned funds of 85 crore were eligible to be SDs. In pursuance of these guidelines,\nthe RBI granted approval to 16 entities for registration as SDs in the government securities market.\n\nSDs were permitted to issue commercial papers for raising resources and could avail of liquidity\nsupport from the RBI and the facility of ready forward transactions. Some of the satellite dealers were\npromoted as primary dealers.\n\nThe network of satellite dealers was created to promote the retailing of government securities but the\nperformance of the satellite dealers was not found to be satisfactory. The RBI decided to discontinue the\nsystem after obtaining the view of the Primary Dealers Association of India. Accordingly, no new SDs\nwill be licensed and existing SDs were required to make action plans satisfactory to the RBI for termina-\ntion of their operations as SDs by May 31, 2002.\n",

Test runs on the NDS started in November 2001 and Phase I was operationalized from February\n15, 2002, with 41 participants.\n\nThe NDS provides an online electronic bidding facility in the primary auctions of central/state gov-\nernment securities, OMOs/LAF auctions. It enables screen-based electronic dealing and reporting of\ntransactions in money market instruments including repo, secondary market transactions in government\nsecurities, and dissemination of information on trades with the least time lags.\n\nThe NDS is integrated with the securities settlement system (SSS) of the Public Debt Office as also\nwith the CCIL to facilitate paperless settlement of transactions in government securities and treasury\nbills and bring about improvement in services to investors in government securities.

DVP-II refers to settlement of securi-\nties on a gross basis (trade-by-trade basis) while funds will settle on a net basis.\n\nBanks, PDs, and financial institutions having SGL accounts and current accounts with the RBI are eli-\ngible to participate in the NDS. It provides an electronic dealing platform for these participants in govern-\n\n\nment securities. It enables the execution of deals in both the computer matching mode or a chat mode for\nnegotiating deals on the system itself. Members are expected to report all the trades negotiated outside the\nsystem for settlement. It facilitates member participation in the primary auctions of government securities\nand treasury bills by submitting their bids/applications for auctions/floatation through their own terminals\nor pooled terminals. The pooled terminal facility is provided at all regional offices for use by SGL account\nholders not having member terminals. The NDS is used by the RBI for extending the liquidity adjustment\nfacility to eligible members. All entities having SGL accounts with the RBI were advised to become mem-\nbers of the NDS by May 31, 2002. Till August 5, 2002, 138 SGL account holders were members of the NDS.\nOn an average, 526 deals were reported daily on the NDS, of which 473 deals for 11,688 crore were ready\nfor settlement during the quarter ended June 2002. These deals comprised money market deals (109 deals\nfor 28,762 crore), outright government securities trades (344 deals for 22,080 crore) and repo transactions\namong member participants. The settlement of the government securities transactions through the CCIL\nconstituted 91.3 per cent of the total government securities trades dealt/reported on the NDS.\n\nThe RBI plans to set up an electronic trading platform for repos in government securities which will\nfunction in addition to the existing voice-based system.\n\nAs the trading facilities\u2014both negotiated and quote driven\u2014were hardly used, a new platform was\nstarted on the NDS of the Reserve Bank\u2014the NDS-OM (the NDS\u2014Order Matching System) for trading\nin government securities on August 1, 2005. NDS-OM is an anonymous platform which allows sellers and\nbuyers to interface by placing quotes. Transactions are executed by matching quotes. Initially banks and\nprimary dealers were the only two participants allowed to trade using the new system. Mutual Funds which\nare NDS members and large pension/provident funds like the Central Board of Trustees/Seamens/Coal\nMiners\u2019 funds and insurance companies were later on permitted to access the NDS-OM market by opening\ntemporary current/SGL accounts with the Reserve Bank. Primary dealers are executing trades on behalf of\nnon-bank participants which will drive brokers out of business. The NDS-OM enables odd lot trading, trad-\ning of new securities in the when-issued market and trading of CSGL entities. It has become the preferred\nmode of trading in the government securities market accounting for 60 per cent of trading in this market.\n\nThe NDS has brought about significant improvements in secondary markets also. It has helped in\nincreasing the level of transparency of the dealings in government securities, T-bills, and other instru-\nments. The system has facilitated screen-based trading, provision of on-line trade information, and\nreporting through trade execution system for settlement, thereby improving market efficiency. It has also\nfacilitated dissemination of price information on a real time basis to market participants, thus enabling\nthem to execute trades effectively.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Clearing Corporation of India Limited\n\nThe Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL) was registered on April 30, 2001 under the Companies\nAct, 1956. The State Bank of India is the chief promoter of the CCIL. Its other promoters are banks, finan-\ncial institutions, and PDs. It has been set up as an ordinary, limited liability, non-government company\nunder the Companies Act, 1956 with an equity capital of 850 crore. It functions like a business entity that\nis subject to corporate tax on its business profits.\n\nItacts as the central counter-party in the settlement of all trades in government securities, treasury\nbills, money market instruments, repos, inter-bank foreign exchange deals, and derivatives of any kind\nwhere the underlying instrument is a security or money market instrument. The CCIL is the clearing\nand settling agency in respect ofall trades by institutional players suchas banks, DF ls, primary dealers,\nmutual funds, corporates, and NBFCs who account for more than 98 per cent of the total trades. It also\nsupports through its fully owned subsidiary, ClearCorp Dealing Systems (India) Ltd., three trading\nplatforms in the forex and money market segments. It launched its forex dealing platform, FX-\nCLEAR on August 7, 2003 to meet the requirements of the inter-bank foreign exchange market in\nIndia. It developed an anonymous trading platform, NDS-OM in August 2005 to facilitate trans-\nparent and efficient trading in the government securities market. It launched an electronic screen-\nbased quote driven dealing system-NDS-CALL on September 18, 2006 for call, notice, and term\nmoney operations.\n\nAfter trade has been concluded on the negotiated dealing system (NDS), CCIL takes up the respon-\nsibility of settlement of trade via INFINET. During the settlement process, CCIL assumes certain risks,\nwhich may arise due to a default by a member to honour its obligations. For this, CCIL has designed the\ng system and collects initial margin and mark to market (MTM) margin from members in respect\nof their outstanding trade. Initial margin covers the likely risk from future adverse movement of prices\n\n\nof the securities while mark to market margin covers the notional loss (i.e., the difference between the\ncurrent market price and the contract price of the security covered by the trade) already incurred by any\nmember. In addition, CCIL also collects volatility margin and operates a settlement guarantee fund (SGF)\nwherein each member contributes to it.\n\nCCIL has put in place settlement arrangements on the Securities and Forex segments. In the\nsecurities segment, the settlement operation has been switched over to DVP III mode with netting of\nboth funds and securities which has facilitated the rollover of repos. This has enabled participants to\nbuy and sell securities on the same day subject to the stipulations of the Reserve Bank. It has also\nenabled members to reduce the risks from failed trades arising out of the defaults by their counter-\nparties. By becoming central counter party to the trades done by its members, the CCIL absorbs\nrisks.\n\nCCIL acts as a central counter-party for forex trading also. Every eligible foreign exchange contract\nentered into between members, gets novated and is replaced by two new contracts\u2014between CCIL and\neach of the two parties, respectively. The rupee leg is settled through the member's current account with\nthe Reserve Bank and the US Dollar leg through CCIL\u2019s account with the designated settlement banks\nat New York. The settlement through CCIL has reduced the gross dollar requirement by more than 90\nper cent.\n\nThe CCIL manages various risks such as credit and market risk, liquidity risk and operational risk to\navoid serious system failures.\n\nIn securities transactions, the CCIL covers the credit and market risk by making members maintain\ninitial margins as well as mark-to-market margins to cover future adverse movements of securities and\nnotional loss respectively. Members are required to maintain adequate balances in the settlement guar-\nantee fund (SGF) in the form of eligible government securities/treasury bills and cash (minimum 10 per\ncent) to cover the margin requirements in respect of their trades.\n\nIn foreign exchange transactions, the CCIL resorts to loss allocation mechanism to manage credit and\nmarket risk and restricts the membership to authorized dealers only.\n\nTo ensure liquidity for uninterrupted settlements, CCIL has arranged rupee securities through member\ncontributions to the SGF, rupee funds through line of credit with various banks, and US dollar funds by\nway of a fully collateralized line of credit with the settlement bank. It has commenced settlement of forex\nforward trades with guarantee from the trade date from October 20, 2008.\n\nTo deal with operational risk, CCIL is developing a fully automated system for processing trades. A\ndisaster recovery site is being set up at the Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technol-\nogy (IDRBT), Hyderabad, to ensure business continuity in case of a disaster.\n\nThe CCIL clears all transactions in government securities and repos reported on the NDS of the RBI\nand also rupee/USD free spot and forward deals. All repo transactions have to be necessarily put through\nthe CCIL and all outright transactions upto 220 crore have to be settled through the CCIL. Government\nsecurities trades up to %20 crore have to be settled compulsorily through the CCIL. Since most transac-\ntions are of a value below 220 crore, more than 80 per cent of the government securities transactions are\ncompulsorily routed through the CCIL. This move is aimed at protecting retail investors in the govern-\nment securities market against counter-party risks and defaults and enable higher retail participation in\nthe government securities market. For larger transactions, the market players have the option of settling\ntransactions either through the CCIL or directly through the SGL account system of the RBI.\n\nThe RBI has asked banks to report all spot transactions in listed and unlisted non-SLR securities\n\u2018on the NDS and settle through the CCIL. This measure is expected to increase transparency in the\nnon-SLR segment. The CCIL provides guarantee to non-SLR trades which will reduce default risks.\n\nThere were 153 active members in CCIL\u2019 securities clearing settlement as on March 31, 2009. The\nsize of the guarantee fund was %4,380.64 crore. The CCILs turnover in the government securities segment\nincreased to %62,54,579 crore in 2008-09 from %26,92,129 crore in 2004-05. The CCIL cleared and set-\ntled an aggregate volume of %3,20,16,852 crore in 2008-09 across its securities, forex, and CBLO seg-\nments. The caps placed by the RBI on call money borrowings by banks and PDs, the increased activity in\nthe repo market and the general upswing in the securities market boosted the CCILs turnover.\n\nThe CCIL proposes to launch a screen-based Repo Dealing System which would facilitate deal-\ning in basket repos and special repos. Basket repo enables grouping of the underlying security into\ndifferent baskets based on instrument category, liquidity and outstanding maturity profile. Special\nrepo enables the borrowers/lenders to specify the security against which they want to borrow/lend. It\nis also developing a trading system and a system to undertake guaranteed settlement of trades in the\nIRS/FRA market.\n\n\nThe CCIL, which offers clearing and settlement facilities for inter-institutional government securities\ntransactions and inter-bank foreign exchange transactions, has been recognized as a systemically impor-\ntant payment system (SIPS).\n",

Safety of the settlement has been ensured through\nstrict monitoring of the deals by banks and primary dealers and through the delivery versus payment\nmechanism.\n\nThe consolidation of the government stocks by re-issuances of existing loans has imparted liquidity\nto the existing stocks and limited the number of floating stocks.\n\nRetail participation has been encouraged through the scheme of non-competitive bidding facility.\nThe RBI introduced the NDS to enhance transparency in trading practices. The CCIL has been set\nup to significantly improve settlement systems and market efficiency and integrity. The NDS and\nthe CCIL, have brought about a radical transformation in the government securities market which is\nsimilar to that which the NSE brought about in the equity markets.\n\nThe government securities market has benefitted from the emergence of self-regulatory bodies, such\nas, the Primary Dealers Association of India and Fixed Income Money Markets and Derivatives\nAssociation (FIMMDA).\n\nIn order to manage the maturity profile and reduce rollover risks of the government debt in a proac-\ntive manner, buybacks and switches are conducted by the RBI which has modulated redemption\npressures and reduced the quantum of gross borrowing requirement.\n\nTo cater to the demand from long-term investors like insurance companies and pension funds, a 40-\nyear security was also issued in 2015-16.\n\n",

The\nderegulation of lending rates, free pricing of equity issues, entry of private sector institu-\ntional investors including foreign institutional investors, opening up of the banking sector\nto the private sector, allowing Indian companies to directly tap the foreign capital markets,\nand so on are some of the major reforms which have changed the scenario of the Indian\nfinancial system. This new found freedom has increased competition in the Indian corpo-\nrate sector.\n\nThe capital market is an important source of meeting the growing long-term financial\nrequirements of corporates, both in private and public sectors.\n\nOn the one hand, due to the colossal fund requirements of both corporates and financial\ninstitutions, the competition has become intense among the various classes of issuers to\ncorner a share of the investors\u2019 funds, and on the other hand, investors are proving to be\nincreasingly finicky and savvy. Hence, to cater to the differing requirements of both issuers\nand investors, it has become essential for issuers (borrowers) to innovate and design new\nfinancial instruments. Financial engineering has been at the back of these innovations, which\nhave revolutionalized the business world.\n",

It is a concept\nwhich has been introduced primarily to take care of the falling market or to provide a cushion in times\nof falling interest rates in the economy. It helps the issuer to hedge the loss arising due to interest rate\nfluctuations.\n\nIn India, the State Bank of India (SBI) was the first to introduce bonds with floating rates for retail\ninvestors. The SBI floating rate bonds were linked to the bank\u2019s term deposit rate which served as an\nanchor rate. The treasury bill rate can also be the anchor rate. The interest rate is linked to the anchor rate\nas it reflects the economic indicators. The NSE Mibor is used now-a-days as the anchor rate for floating\nrate bonds.\n\nTo make this bond attractive to investors, the interest rate always has a fixed mark-up price over and\nabove the anchor rate. In case of IDBI bond issues, the fixed mark-up was 2 per cent and the anchor rate\nwas the 364-days treasury bill rate.\n\nFloating rate bonds ensure that neither the borrower nor the lender suffer due to volatile interest rates.\nIf the interest rate rises, the lender (investor) benefits, as he earns a higher interest and if the interest rate\nfalls, it is advantageous to the borrower, as he can raise funds at a low cost.\n\nBorrower companies issue floating rate bonds with a cap or a floor. The cap is the maximum inter-\nest that the issuer can pay while the floor is the minimum interest that a subscriber earns, leading to an\nadvantage, both to the issuer and the subscriber.\n\nMost of the outstanding government market loans are in the form of plain vanilla fixed rate bonds.\nThe government issued, in November/December 2001, two floating rate bonds with maturity periods of\n5 years and 8 years for a total amount of 25,000 crore in view of the asset-liability management (ALM)\nand risk-weight needs of the major investors such as banks. FRBs serve as diversifying instruments in\ndebt management as they take advantage of the term premium while minimizing the refinancing risk.\nHowever, FRBs are vulnerable to interest rate risk.\n\nFRB is an innovative instrument in a falling interest rate regime but it requires an active secondary\ndebt market.\n",

The issuer\nbecomes free from intermittent cash flow problems and the funds can be deployed in infrastructure pro-\njects which involve long gestation periods.\n\nMany variations of DDBs and zero interest bonds have come into the market. Some of them are as\nfollows:\n\nZero Interest Secured Premium Convertible Bond The investor can convert his bond into an equity\nshare at 30 per cent discount on average price at the end of one year. If the conversion price is lower than\nthe face value, the issuer will redeem the difference. A similar option of conversion into two equity shares\nis available on the maturity of the bond.

They are a class of shares\nwhich carry voting rights with varying rates of dividend. In fact, differential shares can be issued with\nno voting rights but high dividends or, with varying rights and dividends. If the voting right of the share-\nholder is taken away, the shareholder is compensated by higher returns. This concept originated in Canada\nand was highly successful. This concept was introduced in India through the Companies (Second Amend-\nment) Act, 2000. According to this law, a company can issue shares with differential rights \u2018as to voting\nor dividend or otherwise.\u201d\n\nCompanies are now allowed to issue shares with differential voting rights including non-voting shares,\nto the extent of 25 per cent of the total share capital, provided, they had profits that could be distributed,\nin the preceding three years. However, companies will not be allowed to convert their equity capital, with\nregular voting rights. into shares with differential voting rights and vice-versa.\n\nDifferential shares are positioned between ordinary equity shares and preference shares. The prefer-\nence shareholders are entitled to certain assured dividends but no voting rights while ordinary equity\nshareholders have voting rights in proportion to the number of shares held but are not entitled to any\nassured return,\n\nRules for Issue of Differential Shares The issue of differential voting rights shares has to be approved\nby shareholders in a general meeting. Further, listed companies are required to obtain the shareholders\u2019\napproval also through a postal ballot. The issue of such shares has to be authorized by the articles of\nassociation of the company.\n\nThe companies proposing to issue shares with differential rights should not have been convicted of\nany offence under the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, Securities Contract (Regulation)\nAct, 1956, and Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), 1999. The companies which have defaulted\nin filing annual returns in the preceding three years or have failed to repay deposits or interests thereon or,\nredeem debentures or pay dividends on the due date, will not be eligible to issue shares with differential\nrights. Additionally, the companies should not have defaulted in addressing investors\u2019 grievances.\n\nA company issuing differential shares should not fail to give dividends for three consecutive years.\nOtherwise these shares will be converted into equity shares. If the company fails to give dividends for\nthree consecutive years, the investors will not be able to exercise their voting powers during the period\nand will also not receive any return.\n\nThe companies planning to issue such shares will have to append in their notice to the shareholders, an\nexplanatory statement detailing the differences in the rights they will carry, and the scale or in proportion\nto which the voting rights of such shares or types of shares will differ. Also, the entitlements on rights\nand/or bonus issues among different classes of shareholders will have to be predetermined and mentioned\nupfront.\n\nBenefits of Differential Shares The differential shares provide varied benefits to both investors and\nissuers. The majority of the shareholders in India do not bother about the voting rights. Hence, a large\nsection of investors would favour shares without voting rights but with higher dividend entitlements.\n\nThe issue of shares with differential rights imparts flexibility to promoters to raise funds without dilut-\ning their stakes. The differential shares can be effectively used as an anti-takeover tool. This instrument\nreduces dependence on outside funds and hence is a good cash management tool for new business firms.\nThe differential shares help in leveraging the capital structure of the issuing company.\n\nDifferential shares are more beneficial to the issuers than investors. Investors lose control over the\naffairs of the company. Moreover, international experience shows that there is a problem of low liquidity\nwith this instrument. Hence, both, the government and the issuer should take initiatives for increasing the\nliquidity of this instrument.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Securitized Paper\n\nIt is a popular fund-raising technique in the developed markets such as the US and the UK. Asset securiti-\nzation began in the US in the 1960s with the pooling of residential mortgages. Now, this concept extends\nto a whole range of financial assets such as receivables and mortgages held by businesses and financial\nfirms.\n\nSecuritization is a process by which a company raises money by selling off its receivables. These\nreceivables are sold off to cash-rich investors by converting them into securities. The receivables are sold\nat a discount to the investors which represents the yield.\n\nPut in simple terms, securitization is a process through which illiquid assets are packaged and con-\nverted into tradable securities known as pass-through certificates (PTCs). These securities are also referred\nto as asset-backed securities (ABSs). If the instrument securitized is a housing loan, the resultant instru-\nment is referred to as mortgage backed securities (MBSs). In case of bond receivables, they are known as\ncollateralized bond obligations (CBOs) and in case of industrial loan receivables, they are referred to as\ncollateralized loan obligations (CLOs).\n\nIn securitization, the assets to be securitized are identified on the basis of their creditworthiness. Then,\nthe security is rated by a specialized credit rating agency. The pool is sold to a special purpose vehicle\n(SPV) which acts as a trustee. SPV is the entity that owns the assets once they are securitized. The assets\n\nare held by the SPV to ensure that the investors\u2019 interest is secure even if the originator goes bankrupt. The\nSPV is usually in the form of a trust. The SPV issues the asset backed security and the task of collecting\nthe interest due on the underlying asset is left either to the seller or a third party.\n\nAn asset backed security can be of four types: pass-through, asset-backed bond, pay-through, and real\nestate mortgage investment conduit (REMIC). A pass through security represent a pro-rata share of assets\nin a pool wherein principal and interest payments are passed through to investors on a schedule similar\nto the assets. These assets do not remain on the issuer's balance sheet. An asset backed bond is a debt\nobligation wherein the schedule of the payment of interest and the principal differs from that of the asset.\n\u2018The assets remain on the issuer's balance sheet. Pay-through assets are similar to the asset-backed bonds\nexcept that they do not remain on the issuer\u2019s balance sheet. In real estate mortgage investment conduit,\nthe principal and interest payments are passed through to one or more regular classes of securities and one\nresidual class. Assets are transferred to the REMIC in a non-taxable manner. In India, PTCs are issued\nand are more popular.\n\nThe securities can then be listed on the NSE. As the securities are negotiable instruments and listed,\nthey can be traded in the secondary market.\n\nSince the securities are assets for the seller, the process is called asset securitization. However, once it\nis listed on a stock exchange, it becomes a debt product for the investor and hence, the process is called\n\u2018debt\u2019 securitization.\n\nThe key drivers of securitization are raising low cost funds through new sources in an off the balance\nsheet manner. For the issuer, once an asset is securitized, it goes off the balance sheet. It offers a higher\nyield to the investor and adds value to his investment portfolio.\n\nSecuritization is far superior to bills discounting or factoring. Bills discounting is a short-term\nsource, while securitization is a medium to long-term source. The quantum of paper work is higher in\nbills discounting than in securitization. Factoring is quite similar to securitization as the factor buys the\nreceivables of a company at a discount. However, there is no rating or creation of a secondary market in\nfactoring. Moreover, factoring has evolved as a trade financing tool rather than for medium-or long-term\nfinancing.\n\nSecuritization Deals The first securization relating to auto financing took place between Citi Bank and\nICICI Bank in 1990-91.\n\nIt is more than a decade since this concept was introduced in India but the level of activity was quite\nlow. Only a few corporates and some state electricity boards securitized their assets. Since the onset of\nthe twenty-first century, volumes in securitization have surged up.\n\nICICI successfully offloaded loan assets worth 77,000 crore in 2001 to raise funds for the merger\nwith ICICI Bank. This boosted the activity in securitization. In the first quarter of 2002-03, ICICI Bank\nsecuritized corporate loans worth %2,250 crore and housing loans worth %50 crore to meet its statutory\nliquidity requirements after the merger. The securitization activity got a further boost with the introduc-\ntion of the \u2018Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest\nOrdinance 2002\u2019 which was promulgated in June 2002. This ordinance has given a legal status to secu-\nritization as an activity.\n\nIn February 2000, Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDCO), securitized assets worth\n21,500 crores from its infrastructure portfolio. The municipal corporations across the country have raised\nmore than %600 crores through securitization or structured obligations.\n\nThe current trend among banks and financial institutions is to issue PTCs to off-load illiquid assets\nfrom their balance sheets by converting them into marketable securities. This enables the issuers to realise\nup-front cash which in turn could be utilized for more efficient asset\u2014liability management (ALM) and\nmaintain the capital adequacy ratio.\n\nThe increasing popularity of securitization can be known from the number of securitized transactions\nrated by credit rating agencies. Crisil has rated 14 securitized transaction worth %363 crore during April\u2014\nJune 2002-03 as compared to only two transactions worth %52.7 crore in April-June 2001-02. Icra too\nhas rated higher transactions in 2002-03.\n\nSecuritization is witnessed more in auto-financing than in housing receivables as yield levels are\nhigher in the former. But now the issuers are coming out with a variety of securitization deals. Citi-\nbank has securitized bank\u2019s personal loan portfolio of 284.1 crore. Citibank has also launched an\non-tap securitization programme called, Citi SPOT which is a master set of terms and conditions\nunder which companies can undertake a series of multiple securitization issuances in a year. ICICI\nhas introduced \u2018securitized notes\u2019 structure instead of the traditional PTCs. The securitized notes are\nquite similar to PTCs but they give more flexibility to structure the underlying cash flows to meet the\n\n\ninvestors\u2019 needs. Securitized deals are now being tailor-made for the investors in terms of structure,\ntenor and coupon rate.\n\nDomestic mutual funds, invested heavily into securitized papers such as asset backed securities (ABS)\nfor trading profits as returns, were diminishing from other fixed income products as well as trading\nopportunities.\n\nIn October 2004, ICICI Bank offloaded 12 per cent of its retail auto loan portfolio through a %823.5\ncrore securitization deal\u2014the largest of its kind in India. The issue consisted of four senior tranches\n(strips), namely Al, A2, A3, and P strips. Strips Al, A2, and A3 had an average tenor of 7 months,\n18 months, and 27 months respectively, while the size of strips Al, A2, A3, and P were %268 crore,\n2248 crore, 111 crore, and 2198 crore, respectively. ICICI Bank acted as the sole originator, structure,\nand arranger for private placement.\n\nPrivate sector banks like ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank securitized retail loans to foreign banks and\npublic sector banks in 2006. Through such sales, they earned liquidity and got additional capital to rein-\nvest in assets further. Increase in the asset base led to a reduction in their operating costs. Moreover, such\nasset sales enable banks to transact more business without augmenting their regulatory capital.\n\nSecuritization Law The Ordinance on Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and\nEnforcement of Security Interest was promulgated on June 24 2000. The ordinance will help banks\nand financial institutions to turn their assets in to tradeable securities, in setting up asset reconstruction\ncompanies (ARCs) to recover their bad assets, and clean their balance sheets to a great extent. This law\nwill also provide for statutory recognition for hypothecation.\n\nTo create a market in securitized debt, the government has floated a company called the Asset Recon-\nstruction Company India Ltd. (ARCIL), wherein, the government holds a 49 per cent stake, ICICI a\n24.5 per cent stake, and the rest is held by financial institutions.\n\nFactors Inhibiting the Growth of this Market _Inspite of the recent surge in securitization, the size\nof the market of this instrument is quite small. There have been many constraints in the pace of growth\nof this product.\n\nLack of liquidity in the secondary market. The secondary market, which provides an exit route to\ninvestors, is non-existent.\n\nLack of clarity on a number of legal issues relating to issuers. For instance, there is no clarity on\nreporting requirements, securitization accounting, and process.\n\nLack of regulatory framework for SPVs.\n\nA narrow investor base confined to mutual funds, private banks and foreign banks.\n\nLack of awareness and participation from public sector banks.\n\nMost of the securitized paper is sold on a private placement basis, thereby, limiting its growth potential.\nCertain provisions of the income tax law inhibit the process.\n\nEven after the introduction of the ordinance on Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial\nAssets and Enforcement of Security Interest, it is not clear to which authority the originator should\nreport before the launch of the issue.\n\nAt present, there are no laws governing the recognition of the income of various entities engaged in\nthe securitization deals.\n\n+ The securitization process becomes expensive because of the stamp duty. This stamp duty varies\nacross states. Stamp duty structures on industrial loans across states is a major impediment for the\nsecuritization of these loans. Public sector banks\u2019 portfolio is dominated more by industrial loans\nas opposed to retail loans.\n\nThe Securities Contract Regulation Act (SCRA) does not include securitized debt in the definition\nof \u2018securities\u2019 nor does it recognize special purpose vehicles, which issue securitized debt known\nas pass through certificates. This impedes the listing and trading of securitized paper. Listing of\nsecuritized paper improves transparency and leads to better price discovery.\n\nFor securitization to grow at a rapid pace, there is a need to increase the investor base by persuading\npublic sector banks, provident funds, trusts, and foreign institutional investors to invest in this market,\ndevelop standard procedures and accounting standards, introduce changes in tax laws, and develop an\nactive secondary market. The dealings in securitized instruments need to be transparent. A formal regula-\ntory framework for securitization is needed. The RBI has set up a working group to suggest modalities for\nwidening the investor base, improving the quality of assets, creating liquidity for trading in such assets,\nand related issues.\n\nThe Reserve Bank issued draft guidelines on assets securitization in February 2006, to protect interests\nof investors in securitized debt. The regulations provide for a liquidity facility, which helps borrowers to tide\nover temporary cash shortages and may result due to timing differences faced by special purpose vehicles,\nbetween the receipt of cash flows from the underlying assets and the payments to be made to investors.\n\nAccording to the guidelines:\n\nLiquidity facility should be drawn only where there is a sufficient level of non-default assets to cover\nthe drawings.\n\nLiquidity facility to meet temporary mismatches in receivables should not be drawn for the purposes\nof providing credit enhancement, covering losses of SPVs, serving as a permanent revolving fund-\ning and covering any losses incurred in the underlying pool of exposures.\n\n+ Liquidity facility should not be available for meeting recurring expenses of securitization, funding\nacquisition of additional assets by SPV, funding the final scheduled repayment of investors and\nfunding breach of warranties.\n\nSecurities-issued SPVs would be in the nature of non-SLR securities. The counter party for inves-\ntors will not be SPV, but the underlying assets, of which, the cash flow, are expected from the bor-\nrowers. Therefore, such investments will be included to reckon overall exposures to any individual\nor group borrower, industry or geographic area wherever the obligators in the pool constitute 5 per\ncent or more of the receivables or 85 crore, whichever is lower.\n\nThe profits from securitization should be amortized over the life of the securitized asset. Hence,\nbanks will not be able to use securitization to show good results in a bad year.\n\n+ Banks have to bring in the required capital for the credit enhancement facility provided by the origi-\nnator. Credit enhancement is the support provided, including through cash collaterals, to enhance\nthe credit rating of the securitized assets.\n\n",

Collectively, CDO consists of collateralized bond obligations, col-\nlateralized loan obligations, and credit linked notes that emanate from the same financial family. Banks\nand financial institutions use this instrument to meet regulatory obligations and to increase their revenues.\nUnder the Basel Accord formulated in 1988 by the Basel Committee on Banking and Supervision, banks\nin most of the developed countries are required to maintain a risk-based capital of 8 per cent of the out-\nstanding balance of commercial loans. These high risk-based capital requirements make the holding of\n\u2018commercial loans unattractive as the margins on these loans are also low. By securitizing loan portfolios,\nbanks are not only in a position to trim their balance sheets but they are able to generate funds from these\nportfolios,\n\nThe structure of a CDO consists of multiple layers called tranches which are formed by pooling under-\nlying assets. Each tranch will have a pool of assets from corporate loans and bonds of similar seniority\nand maturity. These tranches are then rated by a credit rating agency and marketed.\n\nThese instruments offer higher yield to investors but the risk of default is high. Off-balance sheet\nfinancing has earned disrepute globally after the Enron fiasco. Many CDOs had Enron credit as part of\ntheir underlying exposure and these were defaults. This instrument is being increasingly used by Euro-\npean banks and the Bank of Japan besides American banks.\n\nThe ICICI Bank\u2019s first CDO issue failed to takeoff in March 2002 and was recalled because of unfa-\nvourable market conditions and lack of regulatory guidelines. In February 2004, the bank altered the\nproduct structure by bringing down the average maturity of the issue to around two years. The 100 crore\nCDO issue was mopped up by institutional investors. The ICICI bank sold corporate loans, given to 15\nborrowers of varying sizes across 11 industries, through this issue to raise new assets as well as enhance\nexposure management in terms of specific sectors.\n\nCDOs are new in the Indian market and new products take time to gain market acceptance. However,\nwith an increase in investor awareness and setting up of a regulatory framework, this instrument will be\npreferred by Indian banks and financial institutions in times to come.\n",

Inverse float bonds are bonds carrying a\nfloating rate of interest that is inversely related to short-term interest rates. The floating rate could be the\n\nMibor (Mumbai inter-bank offer rate) or some other rate. If the Mibor falls, the return for the investor\nrises and vice versa. The actual rate payable on these bonds is arrived at by subtracting the floating rate\nfrom a fixed benchmark rate. Suppose the fixed benchmark rate is 12 per cent and the six-month Mibor is\n6 per cent, then the interest rate payable on these bonds is 6 per cent (12-6).\n\nThese bonds enable investors to earn high returns in a low interest rate environment. As interest rates\nare highly volatile, the investor has to observe the interest rate behaviour carefully over the entire bond\nperiod, else he could end up getting a poor return. Thus, both the investor and the issuer have to hedge the\ninterest rate risk. If the interest rates go up, the issuer benefits as the coupon rate of his bonds will decline\ninspite of higher interest rates.\n\nInverse float bonds were introduced in the US market in 1990. In India, the Aditya Birla Group,\nGrasim, and Hindalco issued inverse float bonds in August 2002. The Cholamandalam Investment and\nFinance Company Limited (CIFCL) were the first non-banking finance company to raise funds through\nthe issue of inverse floaters.\n",

The Indian municipalities need a sum\nof %28,500 crore to finance a number of basic projects. The financial health of municipalities is in a\npoor state. Till now, only the large municipalities were able to tap the market through issuance of such\nmunicipal bonds. Large municipalities issued bonds worth 71,500 crores. These bonds had limited appeal\nbecause the annual cumulative ceiling on municipal bond issues was a measly 7150-200 crore and the\ntax-free status was available only for select issues. At times, these bonds were made saleable through\ngovernment guarantee.\n\nThe Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation was the first urban local body to raise funds through munici-\npal bonds. It was the first urban local body to receive a general obligation rating for its municipal bonds\nin February 1996 and raise funds through municipal bonds without a state government guarantee. The\nBangalore Mahanagar Pallike (BMP) was the first to issue municipal bonds for 7125 crore, with seven-\nyear maturity and a coupon of 13 per cent per annum in December 1997.\n\nUnder the new proposal approved by the Central Government in June 2006, the bonds would have a\ncoupon rate of interest of 8 per cent and be tax-free. All urban local bodies in a state will form a State\nPooled Finance Entity (SPFE) which will enter the bond market on a regular basis. In turn, the SPFE\nwill provide a secure flow of debt to the projects proposed by the municipalities. This will hedge risks\nagainst longer spectrum of activities than an individual urban legal body (ULB). The municipal bonds\nto be issued by the SPFE will be rated by a credit rating agency so as to improve its marketability. To\nensure that there is absolutely no default risk, the funds raised by the SPFE will be invested in triple A\nrated papers only, till they are deployed in projects. The centre will also deploy a sum of %400 crore as\nseed capital to finance the SPFEs. This will limit the extent of the financial exposure of the centre to\nthese bonds.\n\nThe Indian municipal bond market constitutes a mere 0.1 per cent of the total corporate bonds traded\nin India in contrast to the US municipal bond market which accounts for about 12 per cent of the total\ncorporate bond market. The preference of Indian investors, including insurance companies and banks,\nto invest in securities with shorter maturity, regulatory restrictions on investment allocation, and a fewer\nnumber of tax-free bonds acts as constraints on the development of this market.\n\nGlobally, municipal bonds constitute a huge market. In the US, investors hold about $1.7 trillion worth\nof municipal bonds. The investors of these long tenure and tax-free bonds are households and mutual\nfunds. The daily trading in these bonds is about $11 billion.\n\nSEBI issued a framework (Regulations) for public issue of debt securities by municipalities, and list-\ning and trading of such securities in July, 2015.\n",

The country needed a strong capital goods sector to support and accelerate the pace of\nindustrialization. The existing industries required long-term funds for their reconstruction, moderniza-\ntion, expansion, and diversification programmes while the new industries required enormous investment\nfor setting up gigantic projects in the capital goods sector. However, there were gaps in the banking sys-\ntem and capital markets which needed to be filled to meet this enormous requirement of funds. Some of\nthem are listed below:\n\n1. Commercial banks had traditionally confined themselves to financing working capital require-\nments of trade and industry and abstained from supplying long-term finance.\n\n2. The managing agency houses, which had served as important adjuncts to the capital market,\nshowed their apathy to investment in risky ventures.\n\n3. Several malpractices, such as misuse of funds, excess speculation, and manipulations were\nunearthed. Owing to this, the investors were not interested in investing in the capital market.\n\n4, There were a limited number of issue houses and underwriting firms that sponsored security\nissues.\n\nHence, to fill these gaps, a new institutional machinery was devised\u2014the setting up of special finan-\ncial institutions, which would provide the necessary financial resources and know-how so as to foster the\nindustrial growth of the country.\n\nThe first step towards building up a structure of development financial institutions was taken in 1948\nby establishing the Industrial Finance Corporation of India Limited (IFCI). This institution was set up\nby an act of parliament with a view to providing medium-and long-term credit to units in the corporate\nsector and industrial concerns.\n\nIn view of the immensity of the task and vast size of the country, it was not possible for a single\ninstitution to cater to the financial needs of small industries spread in different states. Hence, the neces-\nsity for setting up regional development banks to cater to the needs of small and medium enterprises\nwas recognized. Accordingly, the State Financial Corporations Act was passed in 1951 for setting up\nstate financial corporations (SFCs) in different states. By 1955-56, 12 SFCs were set up and by 1967\u2014\n68, all the 18 SFCs now in operation came into existence. SFCs extend financial assistance to small\nenterprises.\n\nEven as the SFCs were being set up, a new corporation was established in 1955 at the all-India\nlevel known as the National Small Industries Corporation (NSIC) to extend support to small indus-\ntries. The NSIC is a fully government-owned corporation and is not primarily a financing institution. It\nhelps small-scale industries (SSIs) through various promotional activities, such as assistance in securing\norders, marketing the products of SSIs, arranging for the supply of machinery, and training of industrial\nworkers.\n\nThe above institutions had kept themselves away from the underwriting and investment business as\nthese were considered to be risky. Due to the absence of underwriting facilities, new entrepreneurs and\nsmall units could not raise equity capital nor could they get loan assistance owing to this weak financial\nposition. To fill this gap, the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India Limited (ICICI) was\nset up in January 1955 as a joint stock company with support from the Government of India, the World\nBank, the Commonwealth Development Finance Corporation and other foreign institutions. The ICICI\nwas organized as a wholly privately-owned institution; it started its operation as an issuing-cum-lending\ninstitution. It provides term loans and takes an active part in the underwriting of and direct investments\nin the shares of industrial units.\n\nIn 1958, another institution, known as the Refinance Corporation for Industry (RCI) was set up by\nthe RBI, the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), and commercial banks with a view to pro-\nviding refinance to commercial banks and subsequently to SFCs against term loans granted by them\nto industrial concerns in the private sector. When the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI)\nwas set up in 1964 as the central coordinating agency in the field of industrial finance, the RCI was\nmerged with it.\n\nAt the state level, another type of institution, namely, the State Industrial Development Corporation\n(SIDC) was established in the 1960s to promote medium-and large-scale industrial units in the respective\nstates. The SIDCs promoted a number of projects in the joint sector and assisted in setting up industrial\nunits. In recognition of the crucial role played by them in the promotion of industries in different states,\nthe SIDCs were made eligible for IDBI refinance facilities in 1976. Thus, they became an integral part of\nthe development banking system of the country.\n\nState Small Industries Development Corporations (SSIDCs) were also established to cater to the\nrequirements of the industry at the state level. They helped in setting up and managing industrial estates,\nsupplying of raw materials, running common service facilities, and supplying machinery on hire\u2014\npurchase basis.\n\nBy the early 1960s, a plethora of financial corporations catering to the financial needs of a variety\nof industries had come into existence. However, the need for an effective mechanism to coordinate and\nintegrate the activities of the different financial institutions was increasingly felt. Furthermore, many\ngigantic projects of national importance were held up as these financial institutions were not able to sup-\nply the necessary capital in view of their own limited resources. Hence, the establishment of a financial\ninstitution with a substantially large amount of capital resource and capable of functioning independently,\nunhindered by statutory rigidities, became inevitable.\n\nThe Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) was set up in 1964 as an apex institution to establish\nan appropriate working relationship among financial institutions, coordinate their activities, and build a\npattern of inter-institutional cooperation to effectively meet the changing needs of the industrial structure.\nIDBI was set up as a wholly owned subsidiary of the RBI. The IFCI became a subsidiary of the IDBI so\nthat it might play an enlarged role. In February 1976, the IDBI was restructured and separated from the\ncontrol of the RBI.\n\nAn important feature of industrial finance in the country is the participation of major investment insti-\ntutions in consortium with other all-India financial institutions. The Unit Trust of India (UTD, established\nin 1964, the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), established in 1956, and the General Insurance\nCorporation of India (GIC), established in 1973, work closely with other all-India financial institutions to\nmeet the financial requirements of the industrial sector.\n\nSpecialized institutions were also created to cater to the needs of the rehabilitation of sick indus-\ntrial units, export finance, and agriculture and rural development. In 1971, the Industrial Reconstruction\nCorporation of India Limited (IRCI) was set up for the rehabilitation of sick units. In January 1982, the\nExport-Import Bank of India (EXIM Bank) was set up. The export finance operations of the IDBI were\ntransferred to the EXIM Bank with effect from March 1, 1982. With a view to strengthening the insti-\ntutional network catering to the credit needs of the agricultural and rural sectors, the National Bank for\nAgriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) was set up in July 1982.\n\nThese financial institutions have a network of branches and are supported by technical consultancy\norganizations. Their strategies, policies, and industrial promotional efforts subserve the national objec-\ntives of rapid industrial growth, balanced regional development, creation of a new class of entrepreneurs,\nand providing self-employment opportunities. They have not only provided medium-to long-term finan-\ncial assistance to industry in the form of project finance, but have also rendered a wide range of services\nincluding providing risk capital, underwriting of issues, preparing and evaluating project reports, dissemi-\nnating technical advice, and refinancing.\n\nThe national-level institutions, known as All India Financial Institutions (AIFIs), comprise two All\nIndia Development Banks (AIDBs), also known as term-lending institutions three refinance institutions,\ntwo investment institutions and one specialized financial institutions. The term-lending institutions are\nIndustrial Finance Corporation of India Limited (IFCI), Export-Import Bank of India (EXIM Bank) and\nTourism Finance Corporation of India Limited (TFCI).\n\nAt the state level, there are 18 state financial corporations (SFCs) and 28 state industrial development\ncorporations (SIDCs).\n\nThe Specialized Financial Institutions comprise Infrastructure Development Finance Company\nLimited (IDFC).\n\nThe investment institutions are the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) and General Insurance\nCorporation of India (GIC).\n\nThe refinance institutions are National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD),\nSmall Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI), and National Housing Bank (NHB). These institu-\ntions extend refinance to banks as well as non-banking financial intermediaries for lending to agriculture,\nsmall scale industries, and housing finance companies (refer Figure 12.1).\n\n\nAll Financial Institutions\nl\n\nAil india Financial Institutions] State-level Other\nInstitutions Institutions\nI\nq 1 1\nAll India Refinance Investment Specialized\nDevelopment Institutions Institutions Financial 7 bcs Ecac leas\nBanks (Term () NABARO (1982) (i) LIC (1956) __ Institutions SiO. eeyeiSoey\nLending Institutions) (iy sIDBI (1990) (i GIC (1972) IDF (1997)\n\n(IFC!\n(ii) EXIM Bank (1982)\n(ii) TFC!

                        "extracted-text": "CHANGING ROLE OF DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS\n\nFinancial institutions were functioning in a highly regulated regime upto 1991. DFIs were mostly engaged\nin consortium lending and they offered similar services at uniform prices. In the administered interest rate\nregime, the cost of borrowings of DFIs was substantially lower than the return on financing (lending). Long-\nterm lending involves uncertainties and to handle this, the DFIs used to get concessional funds upto the 1990s.\nThe RBI and the central government used to finance these institutions by subscribing to the share capital,\nallowing them to issue government guaranteed bonds and extending long-term loans at concessional rates.\nHowever, this concessional lending was phased out in the 1990s with the initiation of financial sector reforms.\nInterest rates were deregulated and the facility of issuing bonds eligible for SLR investments was withdrawn.\nAt present, these financial institutions have to rely on equity and debt markets for financing their needs. DFIs\nhave resorted to market-based financing by floating a number of innovative debt and equity issues. They also\nraise resources by way of term deposits, certificates of deposits and borrowings from the term money market\nwithin the umbrella limit fixed by the RBI in terms of net owned funds. More stringent provisioning norms\nhave come into operation. Many of the DFls including IDBI have lost their tax-exempt status,\n\nMoreover, with deregulation, the distinction between different segments of financial intermediaries\nhas blurred. The commercial banks and NBFCs are now financing the medium-and long-term capital\nneeds of the corporate sector and DF ls have started extending short-term/working capital finance. This\nhas led to a stiff competition between banks and DFIs. Commercial banks have a competitive edge over\nDFs in terms of their branch network, infrastructure, client base and flexibility in operations. These have\nprovided them the benefit of economies of scale and backed by low-cost deposits, they deliver low cost\nservices to clients which DFIs cannot. Moreover, DFIs are saddled with huge amount of non-performing\nassets (NPAs) which are a result of large amount of disbursements in certain old economy sectors and\ngreenfield projects with a lack of concern on quality and recovery of funds. As a result, the focus of DFIs\nhas shifted from the purpose for which they were set up.\n\nWith globalization and liberalization, the financing requirements of the corporate sector has under-\ngone a tremendous change. Many foreign players have entered into strategic alliances with Indian firms.\nThere was an increase in research and development activities as well as the diversification plans of firms.\nInvestment in technology and infrastructure became crucial. With a view to taking advantage of new\nopportunities, the financial institutions started offering a wide range of new products and services. DFIs\nset up several subsidiaries/associate institutions which offer various services such as commercial banking,\nconsumer finance, investor and custodial services, broking, venture capital finance, infrastructure financ-\ning, registrar and transfer services, and e-commerce.\n\n\nCorporates are now eyeing domestic and international stock markets to raise medium-and long-term\nfunds for large projects as it has become not only easy to raise funds through these markets but it is\ncosteffective also. Moreover, these markets are offering a wide range of innovative products and riskhedg-\ning mechanisms. Competition has made the traditional business model of DFIs redundant.\n\nDFls are in the process of converting themselves into universal banks. ICICI has become a universal\nbank by a reverse merger with its subsidiary ICICI Bank. IDBI has also transformed itself into a universal\nbank. IDBI was merged with its private banking arm IDBI Bank, in 2003-04. The new entity repositioned\nitself as a bank that focuses on development financing as mandated in legislation, while offering retail\nbanking services. The name of \u2018Industrial Development Bank of India\u2019 has been changed to \u2018IDBI Bank\nLimited\u2019 with effect from May 7, 2008. IDFC, a development financial institution focusing on the devel-\nopment of infrastructure, was issued a banking license by the Reserve Bank of India in 2015. It started its\noperations as a bank by launching 23 branches on October 1, 2015.\n\nThe RBI has issued guidelines for DFIs to become commercial banks. These guidelines are the same as\nfor commercial banks under the Banking Regulation Act. It is envisaged that there will be only two types\nof financial intermediaries in future, ie., commercial banks and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs).\n\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Universal Banking\n\nUniversal banking is a one-stop shop of financial products and services. Universal banks provide a com-\nplete range of corporate financial solutions under one roof\u2014everything from term finance, working cap-\nital, project advisory services, and treasury consultancy. Universal banking encompasses commercial\nbanking and investment banking, including investment in equities and project finance. It refers to a bank\nundertaking all types of business\u2014retail, wholesale, merchant, private, and others under one organiza-\ntional roof. It means a complete breakdown of barriers between different categories of financial interme-\ndiaries such as commercial banks, FIs, and NBFCs.\n\nUniversal banking helps the service provider to build up long-term relationships with the client by\ncatering to his different needs. The client also benefits as he gets a whole range of services at a low cost\nunder one roof. Globally, banks such as Deutsche Bank, Citibank, and ING Bank are universal banks.\n\nIn India, the trend towards universal banking began when financial institutions were allowed to finance\nworking capital requirements and banks started term financing. This trend got a momentum with the\nreport of Narasimham Committee II, suggesting that development finance institutions should convert\nultimately into commercial banks or non-bank finance companies (NBFCs). The Khan Committee, which\nwas set up by the RBI to examine the harmonization of business of banks and development financial\ninstitutions, endorsed this conversion. It was of the view that DFIs should be allowed to become banks\nat the earliest. The committee recommended a gradual move towards universal banking and an enabling\nframework for this purpose should be evolved. In January 1999, the RBI released a discussion paper for\nwider public debate on universal banking. The feedback indicated the desirability of universal banking\nfrom the point of view of efficiency of resource use. In the mid-term review of monetary and credit policy\n(1999-2000), the RBI acknowledged that the principle of universal banking \u2018is a desirable goal.\u2019 In April\n2001, it set out the operational and regulatory aspects of conversion of DFls into universal banks.\n\nICICI was the first financial institution to convert itself into a truly universal bank. The concept of uni-\nversal banking provides the financial institutions an access to the retail market wherein high margins are\ninvolved. This concept is slowly gaining popularity among banks as the interest spread has squeezed in the\npast few years and non-performing assets (NPAs) have increased in banking activity. A foray into universal\nbanking would help the banks to diversify beyond the traditional portfolio of loans and investment and\nextend to treasury, capital market operations, infrastructure finance, retail lending, and advisory services.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Developmental and Promotional Activities of IFCI\n\nIFCI has been instrumental in translating the government's development priorities into a reality by contri-\nbuting to the development of industry exports infrastructure and generation of employment. It has played\na pivotal role in removing the regional imbalances by sanctioning 47 per cent of its total assistance\nto 2,172 units located in backward areas. It has played a key role in the development of cooperatives in\nthe sugar and textiles sectors. It has promoted technical consultancy organizations (TCOs), primarily in\n\nless-developed states, to provide necessary services to the promoters of small-and medium-sized indus-\ntries in collaboration with other banks and institutions. It has founded and developed institutions such as\nthe Management Development Institute (MDI), the Investment and Credit Rating Agency (ICRA), the\nTourism Finance Corporation of India (TFCI) and the Rashtriya Gramin Vikas Nidhi (RGVN). It, along\nwith other institutions has also promoted the Stock Holding Corporation of India Limited (SHCIL), the\nDiscount and Finance House of India Limited (DFHI), the National Stock Exchange (NSE), the Over the\nCounter Exchange of India (OTCEN), the Securities Trading Corporation of India (STCI), LIC Housing\nFinance Limited, GIC Grih Vitta Ltd, and Biotech Consortium India Ltd. (BCIL).\n\nA major contribution of IFCI has been in the early assistance provided by it to some of today\u2019s leading\nIndian entrepreneurs who may not have been able to start their enterprises or expand without the initial\nsupport from IFCI.\n\nSince 1998-99, the assistance sanctioned and disbursed by IFCI has declined. During 2000-01, sanc-\ntions and disbursements under direct finance constituting 99.4 per cent and 99.5 per cent of overall sanctions\nand disbursement declined by 10.8 per cent and 35.3 per cent, respectively. Sanctions and disbursements\nunder project finance accounting for 97.5 per cent and 94.7 per cent of the total sanctions and disbursements\ndeclined by 8.3 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively in 2000-01. The decline was recorded across all the\nproducts under project finance. The assistance sanctioned and disbursed during 2003-04 was largely by way\nof restructuring assistance and they were %1391.6 crore and 278.2 crore respectively.\n\nIFCI started reporting losses from 1999. In 1999, it reported a loss of 2267.70 crore which increased to\n%884.7 crore in 2001-02. Spreads (the difference between interest income and expense) have begun to nar-\nrow across the financial sector due to stiff competition. This has had an impact on the profitability of IFCI.\nThe non-performing assets (NPAs) of the company at 3,937.2 crore had touched 46 per cent of its total\nassets of 28,183.2 crore. Its capital adequacy ratio was just 3 per cent, way below the stipulated 12 per cent.\n\nThe income from operations during the subsequent financial years further declined due to the reduc-\ntion in interest earning assets and non-recognition of income on non-performing assets.\n\nIFCT\u2019s financial health had deteriorated and the state of affairs displayed a dismal picture of the com-\npany. The reasons attributable to this dismal state of affairs of the company were as follows:\n\n+ Operational inefficiency: The cost of borrowing had exceeded the income from operations.\n\n* Political interference: IFCI was used as a handmaiden of pol ans and most of the loans have\nbeen sanctioned under political pressures.\n\n+ Traditional sector financing: IFCI had sanctioned majority of the loans in traditional sectors such\nas iron and steel, textiles, synthetic fibres, cement, synthetic resins, plastics, and so on. These tra-\nditional sectors were facing rough times due to demand recession, price fluctuations, abolition of\nimport controls, gradual reduction of tariffs, among others. Hence, this led to a rise in NPAs of IFCI.\n\n+ Higher provisioning for non-performing assets: Project financing is the major activity of IFCI\nand revenue arising from this activity constitutes a substantial portion of its revenues. These projects\nhave a long gestation period. The RBI has tightened the provisioning norms for NPAs and stipulated\nthat loans related to projects under implementation have to be classified as NPAs. Hence, the com-\npany had to make larger provision at the end of the year, dampening the net profit level.\n\nThese huge NPAs made IFCI terminally ill. IFCI had raised 21,237 crore through public issue and\n213,689 crore in private placements for lending operations. This amount had to be paid back to public sec-\ntor banks, mutual funds, trusts, and provident funds that invested in these tax-free instruments. IFCI had\na %900 crore redemption obligation on bonds, guarantee commitments of %800 crore, foreign currency\nloan of USD 100 million and rupee loans of %300 crore. Any default could cause systemic risks and could\nweaken confidence in the system. IFCI\u2019s rating had plummeted to default category, which means it could\nnot raise funds to lend profitably.\n\nThe Government of India, based on the recommendations of the Basu Committee appointed for sug-\ngesting a restructuring plan for IFCI, declared a 21,000 crore package for IFCI in late 2001. This package\nconsisted of two parts: %400 crore was given by the government by way of subscription to long-term con-\nvertible debentures and the remaining %600 crore was contributed by the government- controlled institu-\ntional shareholders of IFCI on a pro-rata basis. IDBI is the principal shareholder of IFCI with a 31.71 per\ncent shareholding and it had to make the largest contribution among the FIs. But the IDBI itself was in\ntrouble and the government was drawing out a bailout package for it also. In this situation, the State Bank\nof India (SBI) lent a helping hand by contributing towards IDBI\u2019s share. But this package also could not\nsave IFCI from the burgeoning NPAs and declining capital adequacy ratio.\n\nThe government appointed the international consulting giant McKinsey to suggest the amount of\nfunds needed to revive IFCI and a course of action to get the company back into the profit zone. McKin-\nsey suggested that IFCI should be divided into two companies: one with good assets and the other with\n\nbad assets. The company with good assets would provide financing to mid-sized companies and undertake\nfee-based services. The business model for the good bank entailed merger with a potential universal bank.\nAn asset reconstruction company should be set up with a capital of 2200 crore to take care of the bad\nloans worth %4,000 crore. The bailing out would cost the government around 25.26 billion to %88 billion\nand the cost of liquidation would be between 788-122 billion. The one-time cost to the government for\nbailing out the institution was pegged at 211,200 crore. The government approved a package of %5,525\ncrore in 2002 to turnaround the country\u2019s oldest DFT. It was proposed to merge IFCI with IDBI Limited.\nThe attempts to merge IFCI with IDBI failed.\n",

The charter establishing SIDBI envisaged SIDBI to be \u2018the principal finan-\ncial institution for the promotion, financing and development of industries in the small scale sector and to\ncoordinate the functions of other institutions engaged in similar activities*.\n\nSIDBI commenced its operations on April 2, 1990, by taking over the outstanding portfolio and activi-\nties of IDBI pertaining to the small scale sector. In pursuance of the SIDBI (Amendment) Act, 2000, and\nas approved by the Government of India, 51.1 per cent equity shares of SIDBI held by IDBI have been\ntransferred to public sector banks, LIC, GIC, and other institutions owned and controlled by the central\n\ngovernment. Presently SIDBI has 33 banks, insurance companies, investment and financial institutions as\nits shareholders in addition to IDBI, which continues to hold 19.21 per cent share in SIDBI. IDBI Bank\nLtd, State Bank of India and LIfe Insurance Corporation of India are its three largest shareholders. Dur-\ning 2016, the Government of India subscribed to the equity capital of SIDBI which increased its paid-up\ncapital to 7487 crore.\nFour basic objectives are set out in the SIDBI charter. They are:\n\n1. Financing\n\n2. Promotion\n\n3. Development\n\n4. Coordination for orderly growth of the small scale industrial sector\n\nSmall-scale industries are the industrial units in which the investment in plant and machinery does\nnot exceed 210 million. The small-scale sector, consisting of 5.1 crore units, forms the backbone of the\nIndian economy, contributing to around 45 per cent of India\u2019s total manufacturing sector output, around\n40 per cent of total exports and providing employment to nearly 11.7 crore, manufacturing more than\n6,000 products. The major issues hindering the growth of small-scale industries are technology obsoles-\ncence, managing inadequacies, delayed payments, poor quality, incidence of sickness, lack of appropriate\ninfrastructure, and lack of marketing network. This sector needs to be nurtured and provided strong sup-\nport services for its long-term profitable growth. SIDBI tries to strike a balance between financing and\nproviding support services for the development of the small-scale sector.\n\nAs an apex institution, SIDBI makes use of the network of the banks and state financial institutions,\nwhich have retail outlets for coordinating the development of the small scale sector. It has initiated a sys-\ntem of dialogue and obtaining feedback from the representatives of institutions of small scale industries\nwho are on the SIDBI\u2019s National Advisory Committee and Regional Advisory Committees. SIDBI has\nentered into Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) with 18 banks, government agencies, interna-\ntional agencies, development institutions, and industry associations to facilitate a coordinated approach\nfor the development of the small scale sector.\n",

Micro-credit outstanding crossed 29000 crore. It\ninitiated the first ever loan syndication for an MFI.\n\nSIDBI\u2019s growth is directly linked to the growth of SSI sector. And this sector stands at the cross roads\nand no more in a safe zone due to lack of number of concessions and liberalization and progressive\ninternationalization of trade, deregulation, growing access of foreign capital, and dereservation. To fur-\nther compound problems, despite government and SIDBI initiatives to come forward to offer guarantees\nagainst loans to small and tiny enterprises, banks have stayed away from financing them.\n\nSmall and medium enterprises were the hardest hit on account of the global liquidity crisis. The\ngovernment announced stimulus packages to provide support to this sector. The SIDBI was provided\na special facility of 87,000 crore to refinance banks, state financial corporations, NBFCs, and MFIs for\nlending to SMEs. The SIDBI has also introduced supportive measures like additional 15 per cent credit\nassistance to all existing borrowers, special scheme under receivable finance scheme, ensuring timely\npayment for receivables of MSMEs, reduction in PLR, and restructuring of advances.\n\nAfter making a beginning as essentially a refinance institution, SIDBI has grown into a multi-faceted\norganization. It has served the small sector well by providing a wide range of products and resource sup-\nport services in its 26 years of existence. SIDBI should endeavour to contain non-performing assets and\nbuild quality long-term assets and thereby become a strong and vibrant financial institution.\n\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Rural Infrastructure Development Fund\n\nThe development of a strong rural infrastructure is a prerequisite for increasing productivity of land, capi-\ntal, and labour, improving the quality of life, and reducing vulnerability of rural power. Rural infrastruc-\n\nture includes irrigation structures, rural lands, bridges, water supply, sanitation, rural energy, rural market\nyards, education, health, communication, and information technology. Investment in rural infrastructure\ncreates new economic opportunities and activities, generates additional employment and income, and\nfacilitates and improves delivery of other rural services.\n\nInvestment in rural infrastructure declined in the eighth five-year plan period. The state governments\nfailed to develop and maintain rural infrastructure due to resource crunch. Moreover, the commercial\nbanks which were to channelize at least 18 per cent of their total lending to agriculture were unable to\nfulfill the commitment. To provide loans to state governments for the creation of rural infrastructure at\nreasonable rates, RIDF was set up in 1995-96 under the initiative of the central government. The scheme\nwas operationalized by NABARD.\n\nUnder the scheme, the central government through budgetary outlays/contribute and commercial\nbanks by way of deposits in relation to their shortfall in agriculture/priority lending to the corpus fund\nof RIDF.\n\nRIDF was set up with an initial amount of 22,000 crore, (RIDF I). The Tranche-I was made up of\ncontributions by way of deposits from scheduled commercial banks operating in India to the extent of\nshortfall in their agriculture lending, subject to a maximum of 1.5 per cent of the net bank credit. In\nthe years 1996-97 and 1997-98, the union budgets allocated 2,500 crore. In the subsequent branches,\nthis amount was raised to %3,000 crore in 1998-99, 3,500 crore 1999-2000, %4,500 crore in 2000-01,\n25,000 crore in 2001-02, 25,500 crore in 2002-03 and 2003-04, %8,000 crore in 2004-05 and 2005\u2014 06,\n10,000 crore in 2006-07, 212,000 crore in 2007-08, 214,000 crore in 2008-09 and 2009-10, %16,000\ncrore in 2010-11, 218,000 crore in 2011-12, 220,000 crore in 2012-13 and 2013-14, 25,000 crore in\n2014-15 and 2015-16. With the allocation of 225,000 crore for 2016-17 under RIDF XXII, the cumula-\ntive allocation has reached %2,67,500 crore, including 718,500 crore for funding rural roads under Bharat\nNirman. In order to encourage commercial banks to directly lend to priority sector, interest rates earned\nby commercial banks on RIDF deposits are kept inversely related to the shortfall in lending to agricul-\nture. Further, credit risk weights for both direct priority sector lending and RIDF deposits had been fixed\nat 100 per cent.\n\nRIDF is used to finance incomplete or ongoing projects in minor, medium, and major irrigation\nalong with flood protection, watershed management, and soil conservation. It also includes activities\nsuch as construction of rural roads and bridges, harvesting of rain water and construction of terminal\nrural markets, fish jetties and cold storage, primary school buildings, primary health centres, village\nhaats, anganwadi centres, shishushiksha kendras, forest management, mini hydel and system improve-\nment projects under power sector, rural drinking water supply, and citizens\u2019 information centres under the\nIT sector.\n\nRIDF now covers 36 activities, which can be classitied under the following three broad categories:\n\n(i) Agriculture and related sectors which are eligible for loans upto 95 per cent of project cost.\n(ii) Social sectors, where loans can be upto 90 per cent of project cost in all other States.\n\n(iii) Rural connectivity where loans are extended upto 90 per cent of project cost in north-eastern and\n\nhilly states, and 80 per cent of project cost in all other States.\n\nThe scope of RIDF was progressively widened to allow lending to gram panchayats, SHGs and other\neligible organizations for implementing village level infrastructure projects.\n\nThe implementation of sanctioned projects is closely monitored by NABARD. The period of loan is\nseven years with a moratorium of two years. The interest rates are linked to the bank rate.\n\nNow the eligible institutions are state governments/union territories, state owned corporations/state\ngovernment undertakings, state government sponsored/supported organisations, panchayat raj institu-\ntions/Self Help Groups (SHGs)/NGOs [provided the projects are submitted through the nodal department\nof state government (i.e., finance department)].\n",

Farm Sector\n\n+ Watershed Development Fund: Watershed development programme includes the improvement of pro-\nductivity of land, ground water recharge and conservation of soil and moisture. The Government of India\nset up the Watershed Development Fund (WDF) with NABARD in 1999-2000 with a corpus of %200\ncrore contributed equally by the Government of India and NABARD. This fund is utilized to implement\nparticipatory watershed projects in 100 districts of 14 states. The corpus of the fund was augmented\nto @1,125.21 crore as on March 31, 2009. The projects are implemented in two phases, viz., Capacity\nBuilding Phase (CBP) and Full Implementation Phase (FIP). The watershed development programme\nis a sustainable development programme which aims to improve water conservation, irrigation facil-\nity, afforestation, agro forestry, micro irrigation, and land use pattern leading to increased agricultural\nproductivity in drought prone and desert prone areas, which ultimately results in increased income for\nfarmers. So far, 1,177 watershed projects have been successfully implemented by NABARD in 19 states.\nAn area of 18.38 lakh hectares has been treated with various soil and water conservation measures. The\nactual project implementation is taken up by village level community organizations, such as Village\nWatershed Committees (VWCs), Panchayats or corresponding institutional arrangements .\n\n+ Tribal Development Fund (TDF): It was created in 2004 with an initial corpus of %50 crore, for\ndeveloping the tribal dominated areas through the wadi concept. It also includes taking-up micro-\nenterprises by the landless, women empowerment, community health, training and capacity build-\ning, and building people\u2019s organizations. Since its inception, the programme has benefited around\n4.85 lakh families across 27 states. With the intention of ensuring sustainability of the interventions\nmade, the programme is carried out with active partaking (shramdhan) of the local folk. Small and\nmarginal farmers of the scheduled tribe community and other socio-economically weak sectors\n\u2018owning not more than five acres of land are eligible to participate in the programme.\n\n+ Farm Innovation and Promotion Fund (FIPF): It was set up with a corpus of %5 crore in 2005\nto promote innovative and feasible concepts/projects in agriculture and allied activities, develop-\nment of marketable prototypes, technology patenting, extension support, marketing, etc. Projects\nfinanced include commodity exchange, rainfed rabi cropping, ultra-high density, orcharding in\nguava, village farm development, protected vegetable cultivation in villages, and efficient use\nof carbon and plant nutrients under dryland agriculture. Financial assistance was extended to\npilot projects on augmenting productivity, for imparting training and capacity building, exten-\nsion services and community development. 5016 new farmers\u2019 clubs were promoted during the\nyear. A project on promotion of basmati and traditional scented rice varieties was launched in\ncollaboration with ICAR-IARI in 11 states. Pilot projects on value chain management of onion,\ntomato and potato are being successfully implemented in Nasik, Maharashtra; Karnal, Haryana;\nand Hooghly in West Bengal. 23 projects were sanctioned in 10 states of the country benefiting\n12,087 tribal families.\nPilot Project for Integrated Development (PPID) of Backward Blocks: It was launched in 2003\nand the project aimed at enabling integrated development through credit and convergence of devel-\nopment programmes in these blocks. The duration of PPID I was restricted to three years only.\nCapacity Building for Adoption of Technology (CAT) scheme: NABARD undertakes sensitiza-\ntion of farmers to facilitate them in adopting new/innovative methods of farming through exposure\nvisits and training.\n+ Village Development Programme (VDP): It was introduced in 2007 and envisages developing\nfive villages in each of the PPID blocks. A village development committee comprising mainly of\nprogressive villagers takes care of plan preparation, implementation, monitoring, etc.\nFarmers Technology Transfer Fund (FTTF): It was operationalized from April 1, 2008 with a\ncorpus of 825 crore with the aim of promoting technology transfer for enhancing production and\nproductivity in agriculture and farm-related activities.\nFarmers\u2019 Club (FC): This programme aims to organize farmers around a common agenda to facili-\ntate access to credit, technology, markets, and extension services. NABARD extends uniform sup-\nport of 10,000 for three years to commercial banks, RRBs, co-operative banks, and grassroot level\norganizations (NGOs, PRIs, KVKs, Post Offices, etc.) for promoting and nurturing of FCs. The\npromoting agency takes steps to make the clubs self-sustaining over a period of three to five years,\nwhen funding support by institutional agencies will be withdrawn.\n\nCommodity Futures Trading: In order to enable the farming community to reap the benefits\n\nof commodity futures trading, NABARD in collaboration with the Forward Market Commission\n\n\n(FMC) has undertaken the responsibility of organizing exposure workshops for skill upgradation of\nfarmers to ensure their participation in the market.\n\n+ Government Projects: NABARD also discharges the functions of implementing/project coordinat-\ning agency for various area specific projects of the government of India.\n\na. Kutch drought proofing project NABARD has been implementing this project since 2005\nthrough community-based organizations and NGOs.\n\nb. Cattle development projects NABARD is the co-ordinating agency and facilitator for chan-\nnelizing funds, ensuring its utilization, project supervision, and monitoring.\n\nc. Special project on livelihood based development under implementation since 2006-07. The\nproject aims to cover 11,500 BPL families in each district at an approved cost of 214.97 crore\nfor Sultanpur and 214.90 crore for Rae Bareli. NABARD is the project holder on behalf of\nMoRD while BAIF and Dr. Reddy Foundation (DRF) are implementing it.\n\nd. Dairy and poultry venture capital fund The programme is under implementation since 2005\u2014\n06. Assistance is extended as interest free loan upto 50 per cent of the outlay for identified\ncomponents under dairy and poultry sectors. NABARD is the nodal agency for operational-\nizing the scheme and administering the Fund.\n\n+ Externally Aided Projects: NABARD receives assistance from KfW, Germany and disburses assis-\ntance under the KfW-supported externally aided projects, which are in various stages of implemen-\ntation. The following are the on-going projects.\n\na. The KFW-NABARD-V-Adivasi development programme in Gujarat. This programme has been\nunder implementation since 1994-95 in Valsad and Dangs districts through BAIF Develop-\nment Research Foundation, Pune. The in-built credit programme is being implemented through\nGram Vikas Mandals (GVM) since 1998-99.\n\nb. The KfW-NABARD-IX-Adivasi development programme in Maharashtra. The successful wadi\nmodel of Gujarat is being replicated in Nasik and Thane districts of Maharshtra. The pro-\ngramme with a project period of 10 years (2000-2010) aims to support 13,000 tribal families\nby developing wadis on their marginally productive lands. A bilateral aid agreement between\nthe Indian and German government\n\nc. NABARD anchors four programmes, viz.: (i) Participatory Watershed Development Pro-\ngramme under Watershed Development Fund (EDF) in 15 States; (ii) Prime Minister's Relief\npackage for distressed districts in four States; (iii) Integrated Watershed Development Pro-\ngrammes ([WDP) in Bihar; and (iv) Indo-German Watershed Development Programme\n(IGWDP) in Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Rajasthan. These four programmes\ncover an area of around 17.8 lakh ha. The central theme and the methodology governing all\nthese programmes is the successful partnership based on strong commitment by State and\nlocal agencies, community leaders and local people at all the stages of implementation of the\nprogramme. The difference is only about the source of funding.\n\nd. Indo-German Watershed Development Programme (IGWDP): This programme is a bilateral aid\nagreement between the Indian and German governments and is being implemented since 1992 in\nMaharashtra through NGOs and village-level community-based organizations with an objective\nto develop micro-watersheds for achieving sustainable production system through people's par-\nticipation. This programme has two phases: Phase I\u2014capacity building phase and Phase II\u2014full\nimplementation phase. Phase I and Phase II are complete. Phase II is an integrated programme\nfor the regeneration of natural resources through the rehabilitation of watersheds to be imple-\nmented by Village Watershed Committees (VWCs) in association with NGOs. Phase III involves\nacommitment of Rs 140 crore from kfw, Germany. In addition to Maharashtra, IGWDP has been\nextended to three states, viz., Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Rajasthan\n\nImpact of the Programme\n\n+ Improvement in availability of drinking water.\n+ Rise in groundwater recharge, leading to increased irrigation, production, and productivity.\n\n+ Improved local employment reducing distress migration.\n\n+ Indirect impact: Improved quality of life, housing, and health.\n\n+ Formation and credit linkage of large number of women.\n\nKEW, Germany has committed to provide grant assistance of 851.52 crore to selected projects exe-\n\ncuted by NGOs, exclusively towards investment financing and consultation costs for the rehabilitation\nof watersheds in Gujarat. It has also committed grant assistance of %61.60 crore under the Indo-German\n\nWatershed Development Programme in Rajasthan for watershed development in five districts (Banswara,\nChittorgarh, Dungarpur, Pratapgarh, and Udaipur).\n\n+ Umbrella Programme on Natural Resource Management (UPNRM): It is the new loan-\ncum-grant based programme being piloted by NABARD from 2007-08 under Indo-German col-\nlaboration. It envisages a shift from: (i) project-based to programme based funding; and (ii) grant-\nbased to loan-based funding in the NRM sector.\n\n2. Non-farm Sector\n\n\u2018The non-farm sector includes investment activities of artisans, small-scale industries, village and tiny\nindustries, handicrafts, handlooms, and others. The rural non farm sector (RNFS) has a lot of employment\ngeneration potential in rural areas. NABARD provides refinance as well as promotional support for the\ndevelopment of this sector. Promotional support is provided to establish replicable models for generat-\ning/enhancing opportunities for employment and income generation in a sustainable, demonstrative and\ncost effective manner by providing grant/revolving fund assistance, etc. to NGOs, voluntary associations,\ntrusts and other promotional organizations.\n\nRural Innovation Fund (RIF): This fund was constituted in 2005 to provide support for innova-\ntive projects in farm, non-farm, and micro-finance sectors with potential to generate employment\nopportunities.\n\nSwarojgar credit card scheme: NABARD, in consultation with the GOI and the RBI, formulated\nin August 2003 the Swarojgar Credit Card (SCC) scheme for the benefit of small borrowers to take\ncare of their investment and working capital requirements. As on March 31, 2013, the banking sec-\ntor had issued 13.96 lakh SCC involving an aggregate credit limit of %5813.95 crore.\n\n+ District Rural Industries Project (DRIP): This project was introduced in 1993-94 in five select\ndistricts with the objective of creating sustainable employment opportunities in rural areas through\nenhanced credit flow to RNFS with promotional measures in a coordinated manner. Encouraged\nby the success of this project, NABARD extended the project to 80 districts across the country.\nThe emphasis of NABARD is on credit intensification efforts through credit plus approach, cluster\ndevelopment, credit delivery innovation, development of emerging and high growth sub-sectors,\nand credit related promotional programmes. Training of officers of primary lending institutions\n(PLIs) and other partner agencies has been a thrust area under DRIP.\n\nScheme for strengthening of Rural haats: It was introduced in 1999 in DRIP districts, and was\nextended to all districts, village bazaar boards, SHG, NGO and to PRI/PACS, The ceiling under\nthe scheme was increased from 3 lakh to %5 lakh and coverage extended to include permanent\nstructure/s as per local requirements.\n\nCluster programme for rural industries: The Government of India has launched the National pro-\ngramme for Rural Industrialization (NPRI) for development of rural clusters. NABARD has approved\ndevelopment of 81 rural clusters in a phased manner during the 5-year period (2006-10). NABARD's\nrole is that of a facilitator coordinating with participating agencies and preparing action plans with\nactive involvement of the government, development agencies, banks, and artisans. The broad sectors\nidentified for development on priority basis under the programme are agriculture and allied activities,\ncashew processing, food processing, rural SME, handicrafts and handlooms, marketing and trading,\nand adequate supply of quality raw material, agri/rural touism, and rural community.\n\nRural Entrepreneurship Development Programme (REDP) and Skill Development Progra-\nmme (SDP): This programme was introduced in the early 1990s to support rural unemployed youth\nin setting up their own business. NABARD extends grant assistance to agencies with professional\ncompetence for conducting entrepreneurship development programmes for unemployed rural youth.\nTill March 2009, 11,905 REDPs/SDPs were supported benefiting over 3 lakh youth.\n\n3. Other Schemes\n\n+ Kisan Credit Card (KCC) Scheme: This scheme was started in August 1998 to grant credit to\nfarmers. The scheme aims at provision of adequate and timely support from the banking system to\nthe farmers for their cultivation needs including purchase of inputs in a flexible and cost effective\nmanner. In addition to short-term loans for agriculture purposes, loans for consumption needs are\nalso granted.\n\nLoans disbursed under KCCs have been brought under Rashtriya Krishi Bima Yojana of the Gen-\neral Insurance Corporation. KCC holders are also being provided personal accident insurance cover of\n250,000 for death and 225,000 for disability. Banks extend crop loans only through KCC.\n\nCooperative banks accounted for the largest share of cards (44 per cent) followed by commercial\nbanks (42 per cent) and RRBs (14 per cent). NABARD initiated a pilot project linking the KCC to the\nfarmer's mobile phone which significantly reduces transaction cost. A farmer may not have a mobile\nphone, but his KCC account is linked to the biometric authentication (hands and fingers) of Aadhaar\nor NPR, so that the KCC account holder is able to transact business almost anywhere. During 2012,\nNABARD launched a very successful pilot with Pallavan Gramin Bank, sponsored by Indian Bank,\nthat leveraged the deep penetration of mobile telephony in villages, linking mobile numbers of the\nfarmers to their Kisan Credit Cards, enabling them to order and pay for their seeds, fertilizers and other\ninputs from the comfort of their homes and save substantially on time, transportation costs and the risk\nof handling cash. Even for banks and input dealers, handling cash was removed, thus reducing even\ntheir transaction costs. A study by IIBF showed that farmers not only saved costs but even got price\ndiscounts. The short term component of the KCC limit is in the nature of revolving cash credit facil-\nity with no restriction on the number of debits and credits. Besides the mandatory crop insurance, the\nKCC holder has the option to take benefit of any type of assets insurance, accident insurance (including\nPAIS), and health insurance (wherever product is available) and have premium paid through his KCC\naccount. Premium has to be borne by farmers/bank according to the terms of the scheme.\n\nThe Government of India has set up a target of converting three crore Kisan Credit Cards into RuPay\nCards.\nAgricultural debt waiver and debt relief scheme, 2008: This scheme was announced in the Union\nBudget 2008-09 to restructure the indebtedness of farmers and remove difficulties faced by farming\ncommunities, especially small and marginal farmers. NABARD implemented the scheme as nodal\nagency for co-operative banks and RRBs. About 193 lakh farmer-borrowers of cooperative banks\nand RRBs are estimated to have benefitted under the Scheme.\nCapital Investment Subsidy Schemes: Since 2000-01, NABARD is the nodal agency to oversee\nimplementation of the various Capital Investment Subsidy (CIS) schemes of the government of India\nthrough administering subsidy and monitoring the progress with bankers and Gol. During 2008\u2014\n09, four CIS schemes, viz., (i) construction of cold storages, onion godowns and rural godowns;\n(ii) development/strengthening of agriculture marketing infrastructure, grading and standardiza-\ntion; (iii) establishing Agri-Clinic and Agri-Business Centres (ACABC) by agriculture graduates;\nand (iv) supporting bankable projects for commercial production of organic inputs like bio-fertil-\nizer, vermiculture hatchery and composting units of fruit and vegetable wastes, etc., under National\nProject on Organic Farming (NPOF) were implemented.\nWomen empowerment: NABARD has formulated different programmes for development of\nwomen and credit flow to women.\nGender sensitization programmes: NABARD has been conducting gender sensitization meets/\nworkshops for various levels of bankers at the district and state level. These programmes create\nawareness among bankers regarding gender concerns in credit and, thereby help to accelerate bank-\ning facilities and credit flow to women.\nWomen development cells: NABARD set up, in 1995, a scheme providing grant support for setting up\nof Women Development Cells (WDCs) in RRBs and cooperative banks. The objective of the scheme\nis to strengthen the institutional capabilities in addressing gender issues in credit and supportiveness.\nAssistance to Rural Women in Rural Non-Farm Development (ARWIND): This scheme has\nbeen formulated with the objective of entrepreneurial development among rural women. Under\nthis scheme, assistance is available for setting up of units for rural women entrepreneurs, common\nfacility centres, setting up of mother units, and organizing women. NABARD provides 100 per cent\nrefinance to banks under this scheme.\nAssistance for Marketing of Non-Farm Products of Rural Women (MAHIMA): This scheme\nwas introduced in 1997, for supporting various initiatives for promoting marketing of items pro-\nduced by women. Women are given assistance relating to marketing activities, such as market sur-\nvey, technology upgradation, branding, labelling, packaging, publicity, setting up of showrooms/\nsale outlets in NABARD provides 100 per cent refinance to banks under this scheme.\nDevelopment of Women through Area Programme (DEWTA): This programme aims to address\nvarious needs of women, identified by women themselves in respect of skill, upgradation, and\ncapacity building.\nOther development initiatives: NABARD has taken various initiatives to develop the north-east-\nem region, provide environmental promotional assistance to NGOs and other research organiza-\ntions, promote cultivation of medicinal and aromatic plants, finance agriculture graduates for setting\nup agri-clinics and agribusiness centres, develop backward blocks, and extend refinance for rural\n\nhousing.\n",

It is one of the important financial\npillars of the financial system which plays a vital role in the success/failure of an economy.\nBanks are one of the oldest financial intermediaries in the financial system. They play an\nimportant role in the mobilization of deposits and disbursement of credit to various sec-\ntors of the economy. The banking system is the fuel injection system which spurs economic\nefficiency by mobilizing savings and allocating them to high return investment. Research\nconfirms that countries with a well-developed banking system grow faster than those with\na weaker one. The banking system reflects the economic health of the country. The strength\nof economy of any country basically hinges on the strength and efficiency of the financial\nsystem, which, in turn, depends on a sound and solvent banking system. A sound banking\nsystem efficiently deploys mobilized savings in productive sectors and a solvent banking sys-\ntem ensures that the bank is capable of meeting its obligation to the depositors. The banking\nsector is dominant in India as it accounts for more than half the assets of the financial sector.\n\nSection 5(I\\(b) of the Banking Regulation Act defines banking as \u2018the accepting, for\nthe purpose of lending or investment, of deposits of money from the public, repayable on\ndemand or otherwise and withdrawable by cheque, draft, order or otherwise.\u2019 Section 5(1)(c)\ndefines banking company as \u2018any company which transacts the business of banking in India\u2019.\nHowever, the acceptance of deposits by companies for the purpose of financing their own\nbusiness is not regarded as banking within the meaning of the act. The essential character-\nistics of the banking business as defined in Section 5(b) of the Banking Regulation Act are\nas follows:\n\n+ Acceptance of deposits from the public\n\n+ For the purpose of lending or investment\n\n+ Repayable on demand or otherwise\n\n+ Withdrawable by means of any instrument whether a cheque or otherwise\n\nFrom the definition, two important functions of commercial banks emerge: acceptance of\ndeposits and lending of funds. For centuries, banks have borrowed and lent money to busi-\nness, trade, and people, charging interest on loans and paying interest on deposits. These two\nfunctions are the core activities of banking.\n\nBox 13.1 Indian Financial System-Share by Asset Size (2017)\n\nSegment \u2018Market Share of Financial Assets (Percentage)\nBanks Bt\n\nFinancial Institutions, Insurance com- 15\n\npanies and Housing finance companies\n\nNon-banking Financial Institutions 12\n\nMutual Funds 613\n\nProvident and Pension Funds 9\n\nTotal 100\n\nSource: RBI, Financial Stability Report, 2017\n",

For economic growth to take place, it is essential that these savings are\nmobilized and channelized for capital formation which, in turn, accelerates economic growth. Banks are\nimportant financial intermediaries between savers and borrowers. Banks mobilize savings by accepting\ndeposits. Deposits may be categorized into: (i) Demand Deposits; and (ii) Time Deposits.\n\nDemand deposits are deposits which can be withdrawn without notice and can be repaid on demand.\nCurrent accounts and savings accounts are classified as demand deposits.\n\nTime deposits are deposits which are repayable after a fixed date or after a period of notice. Fixed\ndeposits, recurring/cumulative deposits, miscellaneous deposits, and cash certificates are classified as\ntime deposits.\n\nA significant proportion of funds is contributed by deposits which account for more than 80 per cent\n\u2018ies of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs).\n\n",

The creation of credit is an important function of a bank and this func-\ntion distinguishes banks from the non-banking institutions. Banks create deposits in the process of their\nlending operations. When the bank mobilizes savings, it lends the amount that remains after providing for\nreserves. The amount lent is either deposited in the same bank or in some other bank. For instance, when\na bank extends overdraft facility or discounts a bill of exchange, the bank first of all credits this amount in\nthe account of the customer, who creates a deposit. The bank, after keeping aside a certain portion of this\ndeposit in the form of reserves, lends this amount. This process continues and repeats in all the banks or in\nthe banking system as a whole. This leads to the creation of credit, which, in turn, increases the liabilities\nand assets in the banking system.\n\nFor instance, a bank receives %1,000 in the form of deposits. The bank after keeping aside, say, 10 per\ncent in the form of reserves, lends the remaining amount, i-e., 7900. The amount lent is either deposited\nin the same bank or in some other bank. The bank again, after keeping aside reserves of 10 per cent, lends\nthe remaining amount, i.e., 2810. This process continues and repeats in all banks simultaneously leading to\ncreation of credit. Credit creation leads to an increase in the total amount of money for circulation.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "DEVELOPMENT OF BANKING IN INDIA\n\nThe history of banking dates back to the thirteenth century when the first bill of exchange was used as\nmoney in medieval trade.\n\nBanking in India has its origin in Vedic times, i.e., 2000-1400 ac. Indigenous bankers and money lend-\ners have played a vital role for centuries. Modern banking in India emerged between the eighteenth and\nthe beginning of the nineteenth centuries when European agency houses erected a structure of European\ncontrolled banks with limited liability. In 1683, the first bank was set up in Madras by the officers of East\nIndia Company. The first joint stock bank was Bank of Bombay, established in 1720 in Bombay, followed by\nBank of Hindustan in Calcutta, which was established in 1770 by an agency house. The principle of limited\nliability, which was first applied to joint stock companies in 1860, was a landmark in Indian banking.\n\nThe first \u2018Presidency bank\u2019\u2014the Bank of Bengal\u2014was established in Calcutta on June 2, 1806 with a\ncapital of 750 lakh to cater to the requirement for modern banking services, uniform currency to finance\nforeign trade and remittances by British army personnel and civil servants. The Government subscribed\nto 20 per cent of its share capital. The Bank of Bombay was the second Presidency bank set up in 1840\nfollowed by the Bank of Madras in July 1843. As these banks were set up in the three Presidencies that\nwere the units of administrative jurisdiction in the country for the East India Company, they were known\nas Presidency banks and were governed by Royal Charters.\n\nThree presidency banks\u2014the Bank of Bombay, the Bank of Madras, and the Bank of Bengal\u2014which\nwere set up between 1809 and 1843, were amalgamated into the Imperial Bank of India in 1921. The role\nof the Imperial bank was that of a commercial bank, a banker's bank and a banker to the government. The\nImperial Bank of India eventually became the State Bank of India.\n\nThe cooperative banking movement had already evolved in India in the last decade of the nineteenth\nCentury. The late Shri Vithal L Kavthekar pioneered the urban cooperative credit movement in the year\n1889 in the then princely State of Baroda. The second urban cooperative bank was the Peoples\u2019 Coopera-\ntive Society in 1905 in Bangalore city in the princely State of Mysore. These banks catered to the require-\nments of urban lower income group population.\n\nThe Swadeshi Movement of 1906 provided a great thrust to set up joint stock banks of Indian owner-\nship. The first Indian owned bank was the Allahabad Bank set up in Allahabad in 1865 followed by Punjab\nNational Bank which was set up in 1895 in Lahore. Between 1906 and 1913, many Indian owned banks\nsuch as Bank of India, Central Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank, Indian Bank, and Bank of\nMysore were set up. The major function of these banks was to finance foreign trade while domestic trade\nwas largely handled by the Multani shroffs and moneylenders.\n\nIn 1930, there were 1,258 banking institutions registered under the Indian Companies Act, 1913.\n\nBetween 1928 to 1934, the period of Great Depression, a large number of small banks failed due to their\nloans going bad. To check the bank failures and to cater to the requirements of agriculture, the Reserve Bank\nof India Act, 1934 was enacted and the Reserve Bank of India was set up in 1935. There was an increase in\nthe number of reporting banks with low capital base, after the Reserve Bank was set up. However, the Reserve\nBank did not have adequate powers of control or regulation. Commercial banks were governed by the Com-\npany Law and the permission of the Reserve Bank was not required even for setting up of a new bank.\n\nBetween 1941 and 1945, the number of banks rapidly increased from 473 to 737 but these banks suf-\nfered from certain limitations such as inadequate capital structure and unsound methods of operations and\nmanagement. Between 1947 and 1969, banks were under private ownership of the maharajas, or kings,\nof the princely states of India. These banks used to serve rich families and industrial houses and this nar-\nrowed the growth of banking system. To overcome these limitations, the government, in consultation with\nthe RBI, enacted the Banking Companies Act in 1949 (later renamed as the Banking Regulation Act).\nThe Banking Companies Act of 1949, the first regulatory step by the Government of independent India,\ngave extensive powers to the Reserve Bank for banking supervision as the central banking authority of\nthe country, It included various powers such as protecting the interests of depositors, organization, man-\nagement, audit and liquidation of the banking companies, control over opening of new banks and branch\noffices, powers to inspect books of accounts of the banking companies, and preventing voluntary winding\nup of licensed banking companies. Through elimination and mergers, the number of banking institutes\nwas reduced. The RBI accelerated the task of consolidation in 1960, when the scope of the Banking Com-\npanies Act was widened. Between 1954 and 1966, 217 weak banks were either amalgamated or liquidated\nor their liabilities and assets transferred to other banks.\n\n\u00a2 the reach of banking services, the Government nationalized the Imperial Bank of\ninto the State Bank of India in 1955. The objective of nationalization was \u2018extension\nof banking facilities on a large scale, more particularly in the rural and semi-urban areas, and for diverse\nother public purposes\u2019. The ownership of SBI was vested with the Reserve Bank which has now been\ntransferred to the Government of India.\n\nIn order to ensure the safety of deposits of small depositors in banks in India, the Deposit Insurance\nCorporation Act, 1961 was enacted and the Deposit Insurance Corporation of India was set up in January\n1962. The deposit insurance increased the trust of the depositors in the banking system which enabled\nhigher deposit mobilization.\n\nThe number of bank branches rose significantly between 1951 and 1967, as a result of which the aver-\nage population per branch fell from 1,36,000 in 1951 to 65,000 in 1969. Inspite of increase in number of\nbranches, the rural population could not avail banking services on account of concentration of branches in\nurban areas, and a higher credit flow directed to industrial houses. To break the nexus between industrial\nhouses and banks and improve the flow of credit to agriculture, the government once again used the tool\nof nationalization of major banks in the country.\n\nIn 1969, 14 banks were nationalized to promote macro-economic objectives such as economic growth,\nbetter regional balance of economic activities, and the diffusion of economic power. The nationalization was\neffected by an ordinance, which was later replaced by an act of parliament known as the Banking Companies\n(Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970. The banking sector was identified as the key instrument\nfor economic development. Fourteen erstwhile private sector banks were nationalized on July 19, 1969, and\nanother six, viz, Andhra Bank, Corporation Bank, New Bank of India, Oriental Bank of Commerce, Punjab\nand Sind Bank, and Vijaya Bank, with deposit liabilities of 2200 crore and above in 1980. One of the objectives\nof nationalization was to extend the reach of organized banking services to rural areas and to the neglected\nsections/sectors of society. With a view to achieving these objectives, the policy makers imposed a strict credit\nrationing approach, prescribed formula-based lending and high-directed credit obligations.\n\nThe Reserve Bank also launched the Lead Bank Scheme (LBS) in December 1969, to mobilse depos-\nits and to step up lending to weaker sections of the economy. Under this scheme, a \u2018lead bank\u2019 designated\nfor the district was responsible for taking lead role in surveying the credit needs of the population, devel-\nopment of banking and of credit facilities in the district allotted to it.\n\nInspite of these measures, the commercial banks failed to cater the needs of rural people, especially\nthe small and marginal farmers. The cooperatives also lacked resources to meet the requirements of small\nand marginal farmers. Hence, a separate banking structure known as the Regional Rural Banks was set\nup on February 9, 1976.\n\nBetween 1969 and 1992, there was a rapid expansion of branch network. The number of bank branches\nincreased from 8,262 to 60,570, deposits rose from %4,646 crore to %2,37,566 crore, advances from\n3,599 crore to %1,31,520 crore in 1991 reflecting a rapid growth of banking activity. The banking sys-\ntem spread to rural areas. Small-scale, tiny, and cottage industries, and small entrepreneurs benefited\nfrom the spread of the banking system. The significance of the informal (unorganized) sector declined\nwith the spread of the banking system. The share of priority sector in the total banking grew. In 1969,\n14 per cent of bank credit was apportioned to priority sectors whereas by 1990, this share had gone up to\n43 per cent. Banking density improved from 64,000 people per branch in 1969 to just 14,000 people per\nbranch in 1991 [Box 13.2 (A)]. India\u2019s gross domestic savings (GDS) rose from 15.7 per cent in 1970 to\n24.20 per cent in 1991 and banking deposits grew at a rapid 19 per cent compounded annual growth rate.\nHowever, the government also had easy access and control over public funds. As banks were merely tools\nin the hands of the government, banks had no incentive to make profits and improve the financial health.\n\n\nNationalization killed competition and stifled innovations in banking. Trade unions became strong in\nbanks with political patronage and they resisted any form of change in the banking system.\n\nBanks functioned in a regulated environment with administered interest rate structure, quantitative\nrestrictions on credit flows, fairly high reserve requirements, and pre-emption of significant proportion\nof lendable resources for the priority and the government sectors. These resulted in sub-optimal use of\ncredit, low levels of investment and growth, decline in productivity, and erosion of profitability of the\nbanking sector in general. The government realised the need to upgrade the operating standards, health,\nand financial soundness of banks to internationally accepted levels.\n\nAlthough a series of reforms were undertaken from 1985 onwards, the first phase of comprehensive\nreforms in the banking sector was undertaken in June 1992 by implementing the recommendations of\nthe Narasimham Committee I (1991) on the financial system. The recommendations of the committee\nwere a fundamental departure from the then existing banking sector regulations. The major objective\nof the reforms was to create a viable and efficient banking system, which would thereby improve the\nproductivity and efficiency of the financial sector. The major policy changes brought about emphasized\nderegulation and liberalization. The first phase of reforms focused on cleaning up bank balance sheets and\nbringing about greater disclosure and transparency in accounting. The RBI laid down clear policies for\nasset classification, income recognition, loan-loss provisioning, and investment valuation with mandatory\ncompliance of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) capital adequacy standards.\n\nThe initial years of these reforms were very painful for banks. Twelve of the 27 public sector banks\nreported losses. The government had to infuse capital aggregating 220,466 crore over the period 1992-93\nto 1998-99 to enable the banks to meet the prescribed capital adequacy standards. To overcome the crisis,\nthe financially weak New Bank of India was merged with the large profitable Punjab National Bank in the\nearly nineties. As a group, public sector banks turned around from a net loss position of 0.99 per cent of\ntotal assets in the fiscal year 1993 to a net profit position of 0.25 per cent of total assets in 1995. Two pub-\nlic sector banks, the State Bank of India and the Oriental Bank of Commerce, came out with their maiden\ninitial public offerings (IPOs) which led to a dilution of government ownership in banks for the first time.\n\nCompetition was infused in the banking system for the first time in 1993 when the RBI granted per-\nmission to set up private sector banks and foreign banks were allowed to open branches. Despite competi-\ntion, banks were in a position to post higher profits due to volume expansion and fewer poor quality loans.\n\nThe second phase of banking reforms is underway. The reforms aim to strengthen the banking sector\nthrough rigorous operational, prudential, and accounting norms, improvement in the credit delivery sys-\ntem and gradual narrowing of the divergences in regulatory framework of different types of institutions.\nIt is expected that the Indian banking system will emerge as strong and efficient in the new millennium.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Nationalized Banks\n\nIn 1969, fourteen big Indian joint stock banks in the private sector were nationalized. The nationali-\nzation was effected by an ordinance which was later replaced by an act of parliament, known as the\nBanking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970. This was the second phase\nof nationalization. Six commercial banks in the private sector with deposits over 2200 crore were\nnationalized on August 15, 1980\u2014the third phase of nationalization. In all, 28 banks were national-\nized from 1955-1980. At present, there are 27 nationalized banks: the State Bank of India and its six\nassociates and 19 nationalized banks (New India Bank was merged with Punjab National Bank) and\nIDBI which is classified as other public sector bank. The major objectives of nationalization were to\nwiden the branch network of banks particularly in the rural and semi-urban areas which, in turn, would\nhelp in greater mobilization of savings and flow of credit to neglected sectors such as agriculture, and\nsmall-scale industries.\n\nWith the amendment to the Banking Companies Act, public sector banks are now allowed to access the\ncapital market to raise funds. This has led to a dilution of the shareholding of the government. In case of\na nationalized bank, a ceiling of 20 per cent on all types of foreign investment in the paid-up capital has\nbeen stipulated in terms of the provisions of Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertak-\nings) Acts, 1970-80.\n\nPublic sector banks have an edge over private sector banks in terms of size, geographical reach and\naccess to low-cost deposits. Huge size enables them to cater to the large credit needs of corporates.\nGeographical reach through a large number of branches increases their access to low-cost deposits and\nlowers the portfolio risk through diversification. The access to low-cost deposits enables them to lend to\nthe corporates at competitive rates. Low-cost deposits are current account and savings account deposits.\nCurrent account deposits earn no interest and hence are the cheapest and the most volatile source of funds\nfor a bank. Savings account deposits are more stable than current account deposits but carry a higher\ninterest rate of 3.5 per cent. But the effective cost of these deposits is about 3 per cent as interest is paid\non the lowest balance between the 10th and 20th of each month and not the average balance mentioned.\nAbout 70 per cent of public sector bank branches are located in rural areas as against 25 per cent for new\nprivate sector banks.\n\nThe nationalized banks are a dominant segment in commercial banking. The bulk of the banking business\nin the country is in the public sector. Public sector banks have expanded their branch network and catered to the\nsocio-economic needs of a large mass of the population, especially the weaker section and in the rural areas.\nPublic sector banks dominate with 75 per cent of deposits and 71 per cent of advances in the industry.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Private Sector Banks\n\nFor over two decades, after the nationalization of 14 larger banks in 1969, no banks were allowed to be\nset up in the private sector. In the pre-reforms period, there were only 24 banks in the private sector. The\nNarasimham Committee, in its first report, recommended the freedom of entry into the financial system.\nIt stated that the RBI should permit the establishment of new banks in the private sector provided they\nconform to the minimum start-up capital and other requirements. The committee also recommended\nthat there should not be any difference in treatment between the public sector and private sector and any\nrestrictions in operation in this regard should be removed. The RBI considered the above recommenda-\ntions and allowed banks to be set up in the private sector. The banks which have been setup in the 1990s\ntaking into consideration the guidelines of the Narasimham Committee are referred to as new private sec-\ntor banks. The RBI guidelines on entry of new private sector banks observed that while recognizing the\nimportance and role of the public sector, there is increasing recognition of the need to introduce greater\ncompetition, which can lead to higher productivity and efficiency of the banking system.\n\nPrivate Sector Banks means banks licensed to operate in India under Banking Regulation Act, 1949,\nother than Urban Co-operative Banks, Foreign Banks and banks established under specific Statutes.\n\nToday, there are 21 private sector banks in the banking sector: 12 old private sector banks and 9\nnew private sector banks. These new banks have brought in state-of-the-art technology and aggressively\nmarketed their products. These banks reported profits in the very first year of their existence. The public\nsector banks are facing a stiff competition from the new private sector banks. Pursuant to the guidelines\nissued in January 1993 the old private sector banks having networth of less than %50 crore were advised\nto attain the level of 250 crore by March 31, 2001, and prepare action plans for augmenting capital funds\nto the level of 2100 crore.\n\nThe guidelines for entry of new banks in the private sector were revised in January 2001. The\nguidelines prescribed an increase in initial minimum paid-up capital from %100 crore to 200 crore.\nMoreover, the initial minimum paid up capital shall be increased to %300 crore in subsequent three\nyears after commencement of business. The guidelines also enable a non-banking finance company\n(NBFC) to convert into a commercial bank, if it satisfies the prescribed criteria of (a) minimum net\nworth of 200 crore; (b) a credit rating of not less than AAA (or its equivalent) in the previous year;\n(\u00a9) capital adequacy of not less than 12 per cent; and (d) net NPAs not more than 5 per cent. The guide-\nlines do not permit a large industrial house to promote any new bank. Individual companies, directly\nor indirectly connected with large industrial houses, are permitted to participate in the equity of a new\nprivate sector bank upto a maximum of 10 per cent, but would not have controlling interest in the bank.\nThe guidelines also stipulate that preference would be given to promoters with expertise of financing\npriority areas and in setting up banks specializing in the financing of rural and agro-based industries.\nThere are at present nine new private sector banks\u2014the latest entrants are IDFC Bank and Bandhan\nBank Ltd.\n\nNorms for issue and pricing of shares were revised in 2001-02. Banks are free to price subsequent\nissues once their shares are listed on the stock exchanges but the RBI's prior approval would be necessary\nfor initial public offerings (IPOs) and preferential shares. Bonus issues are now delinked from the rights\nissue. In case of issue of bonds and shares, banks will have to adhere to SEBI\u2019s guidelines. The level of\nforeign participation in private sector banks has been enhanced to strengthen the corporate governance,\nrisk management, and technological competence of these banks. Some private sector banks have been\nsuccessful enough to attract foreign capital.\n\nForeign investment in private sector banks is now permissible upto a composite ceiling of 74 per cent of the\npaid-up capital of the bank. This would include FDI, investments under Portfolio Investment Scheme (PIS) by\nFils, NRIs. However, the FII investment limit cannot exceed 49 per cent, within the aggregate foreign invest-\nment ceiling of 74 per cent of the paid-up capital and at all times, atleast 26 per cent of the paid-up capital\nwould have to be held by residents.\n\n\u2018New private sector banks to withstand the competition from public sector banks came up with innova-\ntive products and superior service. They tapped new markets such as retailing, capital markets, bancas-\nsurance and tie-ups with automobile dealers for vehicle finance. They accessed low-cost NRI funds and\nmanaged the associated forex risk for them. HDFC Bank, a private sector bank, had the lowest cost of\ndeposits in 2003-04. It is the only bank with deposit cost less than 4 per cent. Not only do the new private\nsector banks have lower cost of deposits as compared with the PSU banks, but they also have been able to\ndecrease their interest outgo on deposits by a higher margin in 2003-04.\n\nGiven the greater efficiency of private banks, public sector banks started loosing market share and have\nbeen doing so at about one per cent per annum.\n\n\nIn its recent draft guidelines on ownership in private banks, the RBI has proposed that no individual\nentity can hold more than 10 per cent stake in a private sector bank. The cross-holding among private\nsector banks (including foreign banks operating in India) is capped at 5 per cent. Together with the 10 per\ncent cap on voting rights, irrespective of the size of the holding, these limits would mean a premature end\nto foreign investment in India\u2019s private banks.\n\nThe RBI norms propose dispersing ownership of private sector banks for the following reasons:\n\n+ To cap private and foreign bank holdings at 5 per cent.\n\nTo restrict banks and Fls from acquiring over 5 per cent in another bank\u2019s equity.\n\nTo reduce the holding of banks and FI holdings over the stipulated limit to prudential limits.\n\nTo restrict the investment of corporate entities, individual investors or a group of investors to\n10 per cent.\n\nTo restrict FDI by a single entity to 10 per cent.\n\nTo ensure a minimum networth of %300 crore.\n\nThe investment of 10 per cent of banks\u2019 capital funds in other banks to include equity shares, prefer-\nence shares, hybrid debt capital investment and other approved instrument besides tier-II capital.\n\nHoldings above this level would be subject to approval by the RBI. This restriction or stringent limits on\nownership by one entity are proposed in the draft guidelines because banks are highly leveraged entities.\nWith a relatively small amount of equity capital, private parties gain access to large amount of public\nfunds. The temptation to take undue risk and to do so to benefit connected industrial entities is great when\nmost of the risk is being borne by somebody else. As banks are central to the payment system, the entire\nsystem is exposed to risk.\n\nThe government is pressing ahead with its move to remove a major obstacle to enhancing foreign invest-\nment in private Indian banks\u2014the restriction on voting rights to 15 per cent, whatever the scale of own-\nership. Many banks such as Citibank, Standard Chartered, HSBC, and ABN Amro can acquire upto a\n74 per cent stake in Indian private banks and set up wholly-owned subsidiaries in India\u2014this will facilitate\ninflow of FDI and expertise in the banking sector.\n",

They are also eligible for inclusion in the second schedule of the Reserve Bank of India Act,\n1934. The minimum paid up capital for such a bank is \u00b05 crore and the promoters\u2019 contribution for such\na bank is at least 82 crore.

KYC requirements\n\ni. At their discretion, PBs may (like all other banks) decide not to take the wet signature while\nopening accounts and instead rely upon the electronic authentication/confirmation of the terms\nand conditions of the banking relationship/account relationship keeping in view their confi-\ndence in the legal validity and authenticity of such authentications/confirmations. However,\nall the extant regulations concerning KYC including those covering the central KYC registry\nand any subsequent instructions in this regard, as applicable to commercial banks, would be\napplicable to PBs.\n\nii, PBs should ensure that every customer, including the customers of mobile companies on-\nboarded comply with the KYC regulations, which could include simplified account opening\nprocedures.

                        "extracted-text": "Foreign Banks in India\n\nAs at end March 2016, there were 43 foreign banks operating in India with 331 branches. In addition, 45\nforeign banks were operating in India through representative offices. The Standard Chartered Bank leads\nthe pack with 92 branches in India.\n\nThere are four main drivers of foreign banks presence in India, (i) the desire of banks to follow\ntheir home customers abroad; (ii) the attractiveness of local profit; (iii) opportunities in the host coun-\ntries, and (iv) the presence of mechanisms to mitigate information costs of doing business in foreign\nmarkets.\n\nForeign banks have been operating in India since decades. A few foreign banks have been operating in\nIndia for over a century. ANZ Grindlays had been in India for more than hundred years, while Standard\nChartered Bank has been around since 1858. Many foreign banks from different countries set up their\nbranches in India during the 1990s\u2014the liberalization period. A total of 27 new foreign banks opened\nbranches in India following the reforms of 1991, in addition to the 18 which were already operating in\nIndia.\n\nSome of the foreign banks have set up different entities which are operating in India as subsidiaries in\nthe form of either non-banking financing companies or limited companies in the non-financial sector in\nIndia that undertake diverse businesses such as dealing in securities, leasing and finance, and information\nand technology. Also, foreign banks have wholly-owned subsidiaries to run their global business process\noutsourcing jobs.\n\nThe presence of foreign banks in India has benefitted the financial system by enhancing competition,\ntransfer of technology and specialized skills resulting in higher efficiency and greater customer satisfac-\ntion. They have also enabled large Indian companies to access foreign currency resources from their\noverseas branches in times of foreign currency constraint. They are active players in the money market\nand foreign exchange market which has contributed to enhancing the liquidity and deepening of these\nmarkets in terms of both volumes and products.\n\nIn terms of the Press Note No. 2 (2004 series) issued by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry on\nMarch 5, 2004, the FDI limit in private sector banks was raised to 74 per cent under the automatic route\nincluding the investments made by foreign institutional investors. Foreign banks will be permitted to have\neither branches or subsidiaries not both. They may operate in India through any one of the three channels\nnamely, (i) branch/es; (ii) a wholly owned subsidiary; or (iii) a subsidiary with aggregate foreign invest-\nment upto a maximum of 74 per cent in a private bank. If foreign banks convert their branch operations\ninto subsidiaries they will be in a position to increase their reach through branch expansion but they will\nhave to pay dividend tax and adhere to a higher priority lending requirement of 40 per cent of advances\nagainst the existing 32 per cent.\n\nNew foreign banks are allowed to conduct business in India after taking into consideration the finan-\ncial soundness of the bank, international and home country ranking, rating, international presence, and\neconomic and political relations between the two countries.\n\nForeign banks in India have to mandatorily lend 32 per cent of their adjusted net bank credit (net\nbank credit plus investments made by banks in non-SLR bonds held in held-to-maturity category)\nor credit equivalent of the off-balance sheet exposures, whichever is higher, as on March 31, of the\nprevious year to the priority sector. The off-balance sheet items include guarantees, letters of credit,\nderivative and forex exposures. Foreign banks having shortfall in lending to the stipulated priority sec-\ntor target and sub-targets will be required to contribute to the Small Enterprises Development Fund\n(SEDF), to be set up by Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI). Foreign banks having\na shortfall in lending to priority sector target of 32 per cent on a pro-rata basis will contribute 50 per\ncent of the corpus. The remaining 50 per cent will be contributed by foreign banks having an aggregate\nshortfall in lending to the small scale industries (SSI) sector and exports sector of 10 per cent and\n12 per cent, respectively.\n\nA foreign bank which does not have a branch presence, can pick up a maximum of 10 per cent\nstake in a private bank. If the bank already has a presence in India, the maximum permissible stake\nis 5 per cent.\n\nForeign banks need to park 20 per cent of their profits from India operations with the RBI. These prof-\nits are kept as cash, as unencumbered approved securities or a combination of the two.\n\nThe Reserve Bank has put a 15 per cent cap on the extent of voting control that a foreign bank can\nenjoy in a domestic bank that it buys. This has put on par foreign owners of Indian banks with existing\ndomestic investors (who already have such a voting cap). Parity is also sought to be introduced into own-\nership stipulations by increasing the extent of equity that a controlling Indian group can hold, from 49 per\ncent now to the 74 per cent.\n\n\nThe foreign banks are keen on acquiring Indian banks but the cap of 15 per cent on voting rights\nimposed on private sector banks has hampered their plans. Moreover, present norms do not allow foreign\nbanks to hold more than 15 per cent of the banking sectors\u2019 assets.\n\nForeign banks compete with new private banks rather than with public sector banks. While foreign\nbanks have increased their business volumes, their growth has not kept pace with the rapid expansion by\nprivate Indian banks which have been giving them a run for their money. The foreign banks\u2019 share in the\ncountry\u2019s banking assets is 10.1 per cent. Their business figures do not include off-balance sheet items\nsuch as guarantees to corporates and interest rate and foreign currency derivatives which are a significant\nsource of revenue for these banks. Their share in the aggregate off-balance sheet business of the Indian\nbanking system was 63.8 per cent as on June 30, 2008.\n\nStandard Chartered Bank is the undisputed leader among the foreign banks with assets of over\n30,000 crore followed by Citibank which is a distant second. Stanchart has a network of about 80\nbranches which is fairly big compared to other foreign banks. Stanchart acquired Grindlays business in\nWest Asia and South Asia in 2000. In India, ANZ Grindlays had 29 branches in 15 cities while StanChart\nhad 19 branches in eight cities. The takeover of the business in India helped StanChart jump from the fifth\nplace among foreign banks operating in India to the top of the chart, displacing Citibank. The deal helped\nStanChart becoming the leading bank in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and second in the U.A.E.\nDespite its British origins, the bank has evolved more as an Asian-oriented bank.\n\nForeign banks will compete not on size but ability under Basel III, to lower their requirements of regu-\nlatory capital by using sophisticated risk management practices.\n\nForeign banks such as Standard Chartered, Citibank and ABN Amro have a strong presence in the\nmetros and most big cities of India.\n\nForeign banks that come under the eligible criteria are allowed to set up business in India by the\nReserve Bank of India (RBI). The set-up can be established through a single mode of presence, i.e., either\nthrough branch mode or a Wholly OwnedSubsidiary (WOS) mode. Currently, the foreign banks have\nacquired its presence in India through its branches dispersed all over the country.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India has now decided to issue licence to foreign banks only if they have estab-\nlished their branches in India by setting up wholly owned subsidiary. Setting up a subsidiary leads to a\ncreation of separate legal entity with its own capital base and local board of directors. It also ensures that\nthere is a clear demarcation between the assets and liabilities of the WOS and its parent bank. Moreover,\nthe regulation of WOS also becomes easier for the regulator as it brings WOS on par with the domestic\nbanks, thereby, enabling the protection of local retail depositors.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India have made it mandatory for all foreign banks that has entered India after\nAugust 2010 to revamp their branches into wholly owned subsidiaries.\n\nThe guidelines also stipulate that the WOS would be given with capital gains tax and stamp duty ben-\nefits and allowed to acquire local private banks. The minimum capital requirement for setting up WOS\nwould be as follows:\n\na. The initial minimum paid-up voting equity capital for a WOS shall be 85 billion.\n\nb. The newly set up WOS of the foreign bank would be required to bring in the entire amount of\ninitial capital upfront, which should be funded by free foreign exchange remittance from its\nparent bank.\n\nc. Incase of any existing foreign bank that has its branch in India, that desires to be transformed\ninto a WOS should follow the below criteria:\n\n+ It should convert its branch capital into the capital of WOS. The components, elements and\neligibility criteria of the regulatory capital instruments for the WOS would be as applicable to\nthe other domestic banks as stipulated in the Basel III Capital Regulations.\n\n+ Itshall have a minimum net worth of 5 billion.\n\n+ If the net worth upon conversion is less than the minimum capital prescribed under these\nguidelines, then the shortfall shall have to be brought in, towards the infusion of equity,\nupfront from its parent as inward remittance.\n\nd. The WOS shall meet the Basel III requirements on a continuous basis from the time of its\nentry/conversion. WOS shall, however, maintain a minimum capital adequacy ratio, on a con-\ntinuous basis for an initial period of 3 years from the commencement of its operations, at 10\nper cent, iie., 1 per cent higher than that required under the phased implementation of Basel\nTIL. In addition to this, WOS shall also maintain capital conservation buffer and other buffers\nas applicable under extant capital adequacy framework.\n\nForeign banks like DBS Bank and SBM Bank (Mauritius), have opted to convert their branches into a\nsubsidiary.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Setting up of Off-shore Banking Units\n\nThe phenomenal advances in telecommunications and the convergence of information technology have\nchanged the structure of the banking system. Indian banks have increased exposure to international banking\npractices by setting up overseas branches. This cross-border diversification of assets and liabilities has\nincreased the volume and nature of risks. Moreover, the international liabilities of banks in India have far\nexceeded their international assets making them vulnerable to external shocks.\n\nIndian banks have been allowed to set up off-shore (overseas) banking units (OBUs) in special economic\nzones (SEZs). These OBUs operate virtually as foreign branches in India. Off-shore banking refers to bank-\ning operations that cover only non-residents and excludes domestic banking. These OBUs offer concessions\nin the form of lower taxes and levies. These OBUs are exempt from CRR and SLR requirements. The\nReserve Bank has stipulated certain licensing conditions on OBUs. They can deal only in foreign currencies\nand certain restrictions on dealing with the Indian rupee and access to the domestic money market have been\nimposed on them. However, these OBUs are free from control of interest rates. They offer to the exporters\nthe benefits of fine margins on loans and better forex rates. Some of them offer innovative products such as\nmulti-currency fixed deposits, short-term forex loans and ECBs at internationally competitive rates.\n\nThe State Bank of India opened up the first off-shore banking unit at the SEERZ, Andheri, Mumbai in\nJuly 2003 and is planning to set up more units at Kochi, Kandla and Surat. During 2003-04, ten banks were\ngiven \u2018in principle\u2019 approval to open 14 overseas banking units (OBUs) in special economic zones (SEZs).\nUpto September 2006, seven OBUs have become operational out of which five are located in SEEPZ, Mum-\nbai and one each in SEEPZ, Noida and Kochi. Of these, six banks including ICICI Bank, Punjab National\nBank, Bank of Baroda and Union Bank have begun operations in different special economic zones.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Mobilization, Lending and Investment of Funds\n\nMobilization of Funds Banks depend on deposits and non-deposits to meet their resource requirements.\nDeposits constitute the largest source of funds for the banks. Banks mobilize deposits from the household\nsector, corporate sector, financial institutions, rest of world-non-resident (NRI) and foreign consulates and\nembassies-deposits, and government. Bank deposits from the government sector include deposits held by the\nlocal authorities, quasi government bodies including state electricity boards, and public sector corporations\nand commercial undertakings apart from the Central and State Governments.\n\nBanks raise deposits in the form of time and demand deposits. Time deposits can be categorized into\nshort, medium and long-term deposits. Demand deposits can be categorized into current deposits and\nsavings deposits. The treatment of apportionment of savings deposits into two components\u2014demand and\ntime\u2014was revised in March 1978. Scheduled commercial banks are required to treat the average of the\nmonthly minimum balances in savings accounts eligible for interest payments as \u2018time\u2019 liability, while\nthe remaining portion is to be treated as the \u2018demand\u2019 liability of the savings account. Banks calculate\nthe proportions between \u2018demand\u2019 and \u2018time\u2019 liabilities twice a year as at end-June and end-December.\nBecause of tax benefits on long term deposits, higher interest rates on deposit schemes for senior citizens,\nand strong deposit mobilization efforts by banks due to higher credit demand, banks have been in a posi-\ntion to mobilise higher amount of time deposits.\n\nCertificate of deposits (CDs) are short-term time deposits, issued by banks during periods of tight\nliquidity at relatively higher discount rates as compared with term deposit rates. CDs provide greater\nflexibility to investors such as corporates, and financial institutions for investing their short-term surplus\nfunds.\n\n\nForeign deposits are mobilized through special deposit schemes designed for nonresidents by banks, in\nboth foreign currency and local currency. Non-Resident External Rupee Account [NR(E)RA] was intro-\nduced for the first time in February 1970 which was followed by Foreign Currency Non-Resident (Account)\n[FCNR(A)] in November 1975 to tap the savings of Non-resident Indians (NRIs) employed in oil-rich\ncountries. The FCNR(A) scheme, where foreign exchange risk was borne initially by the Reserve Bank\nand subsequently by the Government, was withdrawn in August 1994. A new scheme known as Foreign\nCurrency Non-Resident (Bank) [FCNR(B)], in which the foreign exchange risk was borne by banks, was\nintroduced. The FCNR(B) account can be opened by depositing foreign currency specified by the RBI in the\nform of term deposits only and is on a repatriable basis. The period of fixed deposit is minimum one year\nand maximum five years. In April 2002, a new NRE scheme known as the Non-resident External Rupee\nAccount NR(E)RA scheme was introduced. The account is denominated in Indian rupees and is repatriable.\nUnder this scheme, Savings, Current, Recurring, Fixed Deposit accounts can be opened. Ceilings on interest\nrates on NR(E)RA deposits and FCNR (B) deposits are linked to the LIBOR/SWAP rates and are reviewed\nfrom time to time, depending on monetary and macroeconomic developments. Another new scheme, Non-\nResident Ordinary (NRO) Rupee Deposits account, similar to NR(E)RA, was introduced. In case of this\nscheme, banks are free to determine interest rates for term deposits. Since November 17, 2005, the interest\nrates on NRE saving deposits are the same as applicable to domestic savings deposits.\n\nBanks raise non-deposit resources through public issues-both debt and equity-in the domestic capital\nmarket and borrowings both at home and abroad. Banks have raised large amount of funds from the\ncapital market on account of sharp expansion of balance sheets, tightening of capital adequacy norms and\nincrease in risks weights on certain categories of advances as a prudential measure to protect the balance\nsheets of banks during phases of rapid credit expansion. They have also raised long-term funds from the\nforeign capital markets in the form of ADRs/GDRs.\n\nBanks raise short-term funds by borrowing in the call/notice money market, repo market, and CBLO\nmarket. Banks borrow from the Reserve Bank in the form of export credit refinance facility, financial\ninstitutions such as NABARD, EXIM Bank, and erstwhile IDBI by way of call/term funding and the rest\nof the world sector to tide over temporary mismatch between sources and uses of funds. Financial institu-\ntions constitute the main source of funds in the form of borrowings for banks.\n\nBanks also resort to external commercial borrowings (ECBs) and inter-bank borrowings in India and\nabroad to raise funds. Banks are allowed to tap foreign currency borrowings for granting pre-shipment\ncredit in foreign currency (PCFC)/export bills rediscounting (EBR) to exporters and use funds gener-\nated through buy-sell swaps in the domestic foreign exchange markets for granting such loans, subject\nto aggregate gap limit approved by the Reserve Bank. Banks have to put in place a system of appropriate\nrisk management as borrowings are exposed to interest rate and exchange rate risks.\n\nLending of Funds Lending or the extension of credit is the major activity of a commercial bank. Banks\nin India have traditionally been the main source of credit for small borrowers and various sectors of the\neconomy such as agriculture, industry, infrastructure, services and government. Prior to the early 1990s,\nthe lending by banks was directed according to plan priorities. In the post-reforms period, bank lending is\ndetermined by both supply and demand factors. Banks now strive to earn highest return on their portfolio\nwith minimum risk. Their portfolio consists of four categories of assets, viz., cash in hand and balances\nwith the central bank; assets with the banking system; investments in Government and other approved\nsecurities; and loans and advances. Among these, loans and investments are the two most important assets\nwhich can earn higher rates of return.\n\nLending to Agriculture Banks provide short-term credit for seasonal agricultural operations such as\ncrop cultivation and long-term credit for creation of assets such as, purchase or replacement of tractors\nand farm equipment, installing diesel pump sets or electric motors, laying cement pipelines/field channels\nand drip/sprinkler irrigation system, construction of farm sheds, purchase of produce transport vehicles,\ndairy animals and so on. Banks provide both direct and indirect finance for agriculture. Direct finance\nis agricultural credit advanced directly to the beneficiary/borrower by institutions such as cooperatives,\nscheduled commercial banks (including regional rural banks) and State Governments. Indirect finance\ncomprises loans advanced for storage and market yards and for setting up of other agricultural allied\nactivities and is routed through some other agency.\n\nThe credit flow to agriculture was high between 1950 and 1980 but it declined during 1990s. However,\nthere was an upward trend in credit flow to agriculture since 2003-04 on account of policy initiatives\nundertaken by the Reserve Bank and the Government to increase the flow of credit to agriculture. The\ncredit flow has been below the priority sector target of 18 per cent for agriculture since early 1990s. Banks\nperceive high risks in lending to agriculture sector on account of various factors such as dependency of\n\nagriculture on vagaries of monsoon, lack of clear and secure land titles for mortgage, lack of knowledge\nof instruments for managing systemic risks such as crop insurance, irrigation or price risk.\n\nThe public sector banks are required to formulate special agricultural credit plans (SACP) to enhance\nflow of credit to the agriculture sector. Under SACP, banks fix targets for achievement during the financial\nyear. Banks also issue Kisan Credit Cards to farmers which enable them to purchase agricultural inputs\nand draw cash for their production needs.\n\nLending to Priority Sector In order to ensure that the bank credit flowed to the vital sectors of the\neconomy and according to national priorities, the concept of priority sector lending was developed. Based\non the report submitted by the Informal Study Group on Statistics Relating to Advances to the Priority\nSectors, three sectors-agriculture, exports and small industries were identified as priority sectors. The\nReserve Bank prescribed a modified return for reporting priority sector advances and certain descriptive\nguidelines without stipulating any ceilings in February 1972. The scope and extent of priority sector has\nbeen modified since then with several new areas and sectors being brought within the purview of this\nsector taking into account the structural changes in the economy.\n\nThe priority sector norms were revised in April 2007. The priority sector definition was streamlined to\ninclude only those sectors that impact large and weaker sections of the population and which are employ-\nment-intensive such as agriculture, and tiny and small enterprises. The broad sectors under the revised\nnorms include agriculture (both direct and indirect), small enterprises (direct and indirect), retail trade\nin essential commodities and consumer cooperatives stores, micro credit, education loans, and housing\nloans.\n\nThe guidelines on priority sector were revised by the RBI in April 2015 and December 2016 which\nare stated below.\n",

Priority Sector Lending Certificates The Priority Sector Lending Certificates (PSLCs) scheme\nintroduced by the Reserve Bank in April 2016 provides for the purchase of these instruments by banks\nin the event of a shortfall in their achievement of PSL targets/sub-targets. It simultaneously incentivizes\nsurplus banks by making available a mechanism to sell their over-achievement thereby enhancing or\nlending to the categories under the priority sector. The PSLC mechanism does not involve the transfer of\ncredit risk or underlying assets.\n\nFour types of PSLCs such asgeneral, agriculture, small and marginal farmers and micro enterprises\ncan be bought/ sold by banks. The entities eligible for trading in PSLCs include public sector banks, pri-\nvate sector banks, regional rural banks, urban co-operative banks and small finance banks.\n\nBanks have been provided with an online anonymous trading platform through the Reserve Bank\u2019s\nCore Banking Solution (CBS) portal called e-Kuber for trading in PSLCs. PSLCs have a standard lot\nsize of 82.5 million or multiples thereof and are valid till the end of the financial year, i.c., March 31,\nirrespective of the date of issuance. The total volume traded at the end of September 2016 was about\n2140 billion.\n\nLending to Industry Banks finance both short-term working capital and long-term requirements of\nindustry. Banks lend to both large and small enterprises. An \u2018enterprise\u2019 means an industrial undertaking\nor a business concern or any other establishment, by whatever name called, engaged in the manufacture\nor production of goods, in any manner, pertaining to any industry specified in the First Schedule to the\nIndustries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951 or engaged in providing or rendering of any service\nor services. Large corporates rely on both internal such as retained earnings and external sources of funds\nsuch as equity and borrowings to finance their short-term and long-term capital requirements. Within\nexternal sources, bank credit is the preferred source of finance.\n\nThe Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 has defined micro, small, and\nmedium enterprises. (a) In the case of the enterprises engaged in the manufacture or production of\ngoods pertaining to any industry specified in the first schedule to the Industries (Development and Reg-\nulation) Act, 1951, (i) a micro enterprise is an enterprise, where the investment in plant and machinery\ndoes not exceed %25 lakh; (ii) a small enterprise is an enterprise, where the investment in plant and\nmachinery is more than 825 lakh but does not exceed %5 crore; or (iii) a medium enterprise is an enter-\nprise, where the investment in plant and machinery is more than %5 crore but does not exceed %10 crore;\n(b) In the case of the enterprises engaged in providing or rendering of services, (i) a micro enterprise\nis an enterprise, where the investment in equipment does not exceed 210 lakh; (ii) a small enterprise is\nan enterprise, where the investment in equipment is more than 710 lakh but does not exceed 22 crore;\nor (iii) a medium enterprise is an enterprise, where the investment in equipment is more than 2 crore\nbut does not exceed 5 crore.\n\nBanks have conventionally lended to large enterprises. It is sometimes assumed that large firms constitute\nthe main drivers of economic activity. Small is not only beautiful but is also indispensable. The importance of\nsmall and medium enterprises (SMEs) to Indian economy is indisputable. The share of SMEs was over 40 per\ncent of total value added in the economy and about 33 per cent of total exports. With the economy booming,\n\n\nst\n\nthe number of SMEs are growing by leaps and bounds. In order to grow big, SMEs need to build economies\nof scale to achieve cost competitiveness. A large number of SMEs lack financial muscle. They require financial\nsupport to truly become \u2018agents of change\u2019. The credit extended to SMEs has gone down in relation to credit\nto industry and other sectors. These enterprises are varied and large in number which requires different lend-\ning and risk management techniques, processes, and skills. Moreover, lack of reliable information about them,\ninability to provide adequate collateral, and lack of credit history have made it difficult for banks to lend funds\nto them. Recognizing the importance of SMEs, many banks have taken initiatives such as setting up a special\ncell for SMEs and simplified loan products for improving credit flow to SMEs. The Small Industries Develop-\nment Bank of India (SIDBI) has floated a rating agency SMERA for the SME segment.\n\nInfrastructure Financing Banks also finance infrastructure projects by way of term loans, bonds and\nguarantees. Prior to 2002-03, DFls were the major source of finance for infrastructure projects. Since\n2002-03, with an increase in public-private-partnerships (PPPs) in infrastructure, banks have been the\npreferred source of finance. In order to facilitate financing of infrastructure projects, banks are allowed to\nexceed exposure norm of 40 per cent of the bank\u2019s capital funds by an additional 10 per cent (ie., up to 50\nper) in case of credit exposure of borrowers belonging to a group and the exposure norm of 15 per cent\nof the bank\u2019s capital funds by an additional 5 per cent (i.e. up to 20 per cent) in case of credit exposure\nto single borrower. Banks are also allowed to assign a concessional risk weight of 50 per cent for capital\nadequacy purposes, on investment in securitized paper relating to an infrastructure facility provided it\ngenerates income/cash flows which would ensure servicing/repayment of the securitized paper.\n\nFor funding large infrastructure projects, banks also syndicate loans-in which different banks come\nforward to share the loan amount. Banks also lend to special purpose vehicles (SPVs) in the private sec-\ntor, registered under Companies Act for directly undertaking infrastructure projects. Banks extend credit\nfacility by way of working capital finance, term loan, project loan, subscription to bonds and debentures/\npreference shares/equity shares acquired as a part of the project finance package which is treated as\n\u2018deemed advance\u2019 and any other form of funded or non-funded finance facility. Banks are permitted to\nissue guarantees favouring other lending institutions in respect of infrastructure projects, provided the\nbank issuing the guarantee takes a funded share in the project at least to the extent of 5 per cent of the\nproject cost and undertakes normal credit appraisal, monitoring and follow up of the project. Credit expo-\nsure of banks is the highest in power and telecommunication sectors.\n\nLending to the Household Sector Banks lend funds to the household sector in the form of housing loans,\nauto loans, advances to individuals against fixed deposits, credit card, educational loans and loans for purchase\nof consumer durables. These are categorized as retail loans as the average size of loans is very small and loans\nare widely distributed over a large number of borrowers. During the first phase of banking reforms, banks were\ngiven freedom to decide the quantum, rate of interest, margin requirement, repayment period and other related\nconditions of retail loans which enabled banks to aggressively market retail loans. Increased job opportunities,\nrising income levels, higher tax incentives to salaried class, boom in the real estate sector, and technological\ninnovations such as ATMs led to a higher demand for consumer durables and housing which, in turn, led to a\nsharp growth of retail loans. Because of low risk, adequate collaterals, and higher returns, banks expanded their\nretail portfolio. Retail loans are the prime drivers of credit growth.\n\nLending to the Sensitive Sectors Scheduled commercial banks have exposure to sensitive sectors such as\nreal estate, capital market, and commodities. Banks\u2019 exposures to commercial real estates include shopping\nmalls, office buildings, warehouses, hotels and land acquisition, development, and construction. Banks\u2019\nexposure to capital market includes loan against shares, direct investment in equity and equity mutual funds,\nadvances against shares/bonds/debentures or other securities or on clean basis to individuals for investment\nin shares (including IPOs/ESOPs), convertible bonds, convertible debentures, and units of equity-oriented\nmutual funds etc., advances for any other purposes where shares or convertible bonds or convertible\ndebentures or units of equity oriented mutual funds are taken as primary or collateral security, secured and\nunsecured advances to stockbrokers and guarantees issued on behalf of stockbrokers and market makers,\nloans sanctioned to corporates against the security of shares/bonds/debentures or other securities or on\nclean basis for meeting promoter\u2019s contribution to the equity of new companies in anticipation of raising\nresources, bridge loans to companies against expected equity flows/issues, underwriting commitments taken\nup by the banks in respect of primary issue of shares or convertible bonds or convertible debentures or units\nof equity oriented mutual funds, financing to stockbrokers for margin trading, all exposures to Venture\nCapital Funds (both registered and unregistered) and intra-day exposures.\n\nExposure Limits The RBI has prescribed regulatory limits on banks\u2019 exposure to individual and group\nborrowers in India to avoid concentration of credit.\n\nA. Individual Basis: The aggregate exposure of a bank to the capital markets in all forms (both fund\nbased and non-fund based) should not exceed 40 per cent of its net worth as on March 31 of the previous\nyear. Within this overall ceiling, the bank\u2019s direct investment in shares, convertible bonds/ debentures,\nunits of equity-oriented mutual funds and all exposures to Venture Capital Funds (VCFs) [both registered\nand unregistered] should not exceed 20 per cent of its net worth.\n\nB. Consolidated Basis The aggregate exposure of a consolidated bank to capital markets (both fund\nbased and non- fund based) should not exceed 40 per cent of its consolidated net worth as on March 31\nof the previous year. Within this overall ceiling, the aggregate direct exposure by way of the consolidated\nbank\u2019s investment in shares, convertible bonds / debentures, units of equity-oriented mutual funds and all\nexposures to VCFs ([both registered and unregistered)] should not exceed 20 per cent of its consolidated\nnet worth.\n\nThe above-mentioned ceilings are the maximum permissible and a bank\u2019s Board of Directors is free to\nadopt a lower ceiling for the bank, keeping in view its overall risk profile and corporate strategy.

Investment\nin SLR securities: Investment of banks in government securities and other approved securities is catego-\nrized as SLR investments. Banks are required to invest a prescribed minimum of their net demand and\ntime liabilities in Government and other approved securities under the BR Act, 1949.\n\nScheduled commercial banks were holding SLR securities of around 28 per cent of their net demand\nand time liabilities (NDTL) during June 2017 as compared to the required 20 per cent. Banks SLR invest-\nments have gradually came down from a peak of 42.7 per cent of NDTL on April 16, 2004 to 28 per cent\nin June 2017. Banks are now exposed to market risks on their debt investment portfolio held in excess of\nregulatory requirement. Strategies to minimize this risk include reducing the excess investment portfolio\nand increase their lending, lowering the portfolio duration and using interest rate derivatives.\n\nThe entire investment portfolio of banks (including SLR securities and non-SLR securities) is classified\nunder the three categories of \u2018Held to maturity\u2019, \u2018Available for sale\u2019 and \u2018Held for trading\u2019. Indian banks are\npermitted to classify a maximum of 25 per cent of their investments portfolio in the category held to maturity\n(HTM) which is carried at book value and is not required to be valued on marked-to-market (MTM) basis.\nBonds in HTM are not marked-to-market and therefore no provision has to be made on HTM securities\nfollowing a fall in prices (or rise in interest rates). However, bonds in the available for sale (AFS) category\nand the held for trading (HFT) category have to be marked-tomarket. Thus, a bank can avert a higher pro-\nvisioning and a possible loss by transferring more gilts to the HTM category. Banks have to classify their\ninvestment securities into this category in the first quarter of the financial year and subsequent changes to the\n\nclassification are not allowed during the year. Bonds in the \u2018Available for sale\u2019 category will be marked-to-\nmarket at the year-end or at more frequent intervals. The bonds in the \u201cHeld for trading\u2019 will be revalued at\nmonthly or at more frequent intervals. The market value for the purpose of periodical valuation of investments\nincluded in the \u2018Available for sale\u2019 and \u2018Held for trading\u2019 would be the market price of the scrip as available\nfrom the trades/quotes on the stock exchanges, price of SGL transact ions and price list of RBI.\n\nThe RBI had earlier advised banks to gradually build up on their investment fluctuation reserve\n(IFR) of upto 5 per cent of their HFT and AFS investment portfolio to help manage interest rate risks.\nIFR is treated as tier I capital, and banks have transferred their entire IFR balances to General Statu-\ntory Reserve.\n\nIndian Banks need a large amount of capital over the next five years to maintain regulatory capital\ncommensurate with the expected 25-30 per cent credit growth in this period. The stronger banks can use\ntheir investment fluctuation reserve (IFR) or reduce their excessive provisioning of the past few years to\nremain adequately capitalized. But the weaker banks need to raise capital by offering equity shares as they\ndo not have the options enjoyed by the stronger banks.\n",

The Government of India set\nup the Narasimham Committee (1991) to examine all aspects relating to structure, organization, and func-\ntioning of the Indian banking system. The recommendations of the committee aimed at creating a competi-\ntive and efficient banking system. Measures like capital adequacy, income recognition, asset classification,\nnorms for investment, entry of private sector banks, gradual reduction of SLR and CRR were recommended\nand implemented to strengthen the banking system. These recommendations changed the face of Indian\nBanking. Public sector banks faced a stiff competition with the entry of private sector banks.\n\nAnother committee which deserves mention is the Khan Committee, which was constituted by the RBI\nin December 1997 to examine the harmonization of the role and operations of development financial institu-\ntions (DFIs) and banks. It submitted its report in April 1998. The major recommendations of the committee\nwere a gradual move towards universal banking; exploring the possibility of gainful mergers between banks;\nbanks and financial institutions; encompassing both strong and weak entities or two strong ones; develop-\ning a function-specific regulatory framework and a risk-based supervisory framework; establishment of a\nsuper-regulator to supervise and coordinate the activities of multiple regulators; speedy implementation of\nlegal reforms to hasten debt recovery; reducing CRR to the international standards; and phasing out SLR.\n\nThe Verma Committee, which had been the most controversial of committees, recommended the need for\ngreater use of information technology (IT) even in the weak public sector banks; restructuring of weak banks\nbut not merging them with strong banks; market-driven mergers ; sale of foreign branches; closure of subsidi-\naries of weak public sector banks, and voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) for at least 25 per cent of the staff.\n\nThe banking sector reforms aimed at improving the policy framework, financial health, and institutional\ninfrastructure. Improvement in the policy framework has been undertaken by reducing the reserve require\nments, changing the administered structure of lending rates, enlarging the scope of priority sector lending\nand linking the lending rates with the size of advances. Efforts have been made to improve the financial\nhealth of the banking sector by prescribing prudential norms. Improvement in the institutional framework\nhas been sought through recapitalization, infusing competition, and strengthening of supervisory system.\n\nThe chief merit of the reform process is that the reform measures were undertaken and implemented\ngradually and cautiously. The first phase of the banking reforms is complete and the second generation\nreforms are under way. The second generation reforms are those that did not form part of the first gen-\neration reforms but needed to be prioritized in the agenda for the next decade. Many of the important\nrecommendations of Narasimham Committee II have been accepted and are under implementation. The\nsecond generation banking reforms concentrate on strengthening the foundation of the banking system\nby structure, technological upgradation, and human resource development.\n\nThe second phase of reforms aims to further strengthen the banking sector and to move towards\ninternational best practices in areas relating to banking policy, institutional, supervisory, and legislation.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Technology in Banking\n\nPrivate sector banks brought the state-of-the-art technology into the banking system. With increasing\ncompetition, public sector banks also adopted the new technology. The Central Vigilance Commission\nissued a directive on the need to computerize 70 per cent of the banking business by public sector banks\nbefore January 1, 2001. Basic computerization by public sector banks was started in 1993. The foreign\nbanks and private sector banks have successfully transited from physical cash to anytime and anywhere\nmoney. \u2018Click banking\u2019 has replaced \u2018queue banking\u2019.\n\nBoth the RBI and public sector banks have realized the importance of technology to survive and thrive.\nTechnology has made the banking business truly international and efficient. Technology will act not only\nas the facilitator but a catalyst to reach out and meet expectations of demanding customers. More than\n95 per cent of the branches have been fully computerized and 79.4 per cent of these branches have core-\nbanking solutions (CBS), which is automation of banks across multiple-delivery channels. It helps banks\nachieve a centralized processing mechanism and, in turn, provide an any time any where services to their\ncustomers. The CBS enables the customers of banks to undertake their transactions from any branch of\na bank instead of being attached to a particular branch, thereby resulting in better delivery of various\ncustomer services by the banks.\n\nBanks have introduced innovative products such as e-banking and e-payments. Electronic banking\n(e-banking) is banking with the use of electronic tools and facilities and through electronic delivery chan-\nnels. Most banks offer electronic banking through automatic teller machines, telephone transactions, and\nthe Internet. Electronic banking enables banks to provide efficient services at lower costs and expand their\ngeographical reach. Internet banking is the predominant mode of e-banking. It has made banking per-\nsonalized and customized. It enables providing general purpose information to customers through banks\u2019\nwebsites, electronic information transfer through passwords, and fully electronic transactional system,\nwhich allows bi-directional transactional capabilities and requires a high degree of security and control.\n\nBanks have already rolled out mobile banking services. Internet and mobile banking have brought\nabout a revolution in banking services.\n\nThe growth in banking technology and automation of banking processes has enabled extension of\nreach and low costs transactions. Automated teller machines (ATMs) have emerged as an alternative\nbanking channel which facilitates low cost transactions vis-a-vis traditional branches. The increased use\nof ATMs by foreign banks and private sector banks has helped these banks to compete with public sector\nbanks. Technology has enabled both foreign banks and private sector banks to expand their reach and pro-\nvide improved customer service. The high cost of ATM cards and machines and poor telecommunication\ninfrastructure inhibit the rapid growth of the ATMs.\n\nNetworking of branches and automating systems will help in increasing fee-based income. For\ninstance, Corporation Bank migrated its cash management product\u2014Collection and Payments Service\n(CAPS)\u2014to the Internet, making it accessible to corporate customers on their desk tops. Cash manage-\nment covers collections and disbursements of operating flows and specialized cash flow streams such\nas equity issue collections, dividends, interest and principal repayments, and excise and sales tax paid.\nCustomers are now demanding value-added services and hence, banks have to speed up IT implementation.\n\nLeading private, public and foreign bamks are offering a variety of instant any time-any where bank-\ning feature such as viewing of transation details, bill payment services, linking of bank accounts to other\nfinancial services such as demat and equity trading accounts and loan and credit accounts.\n\nTechnology can substantially bring down the menace of non-performing assets plaguing the banking\nsystem. Currently, software packages are available for improving the credit management about banks.\nThese packages allow bankers to track details for each borrower such as principal and interest payable,\nbusiness cycle of clients and end-use of funds.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Payment and Settlement System\n\nA payments system comprises of a set of rules, institutions, and technology for transfer of funds from one\nentity to another. It constitutes the core of a well-functioning financial system as the failure of a payment\n\nsystem may result in a systemic risk thereby triggering bank runs. It also plays an important role in the\nimplementation of monetary policy as it provides the means through which monetary policy signals are\ntransmitted. A well-functioning payment system is a prerequisite for proper conduct of monetary policy,\nefficient delivery of financial services, and minimizing transaction costs.\n\nThe Payment and Settlement System Act, 2007 came into effect on August 12, 2008. It has designated\nthe Reserve Bank of India as the authority to regulate and supervise the payment systems in the country,\nincluding those operated by non-banks such as the CCIL, card companies, other payment system providers\nand all prospective organizations for payments. Under the Act, the RBI has the powers to authorise an entity\nto operate a payment system, lay down operational and technical standards for the various payment systems,\ncall for information and returns/documents from the service providers and imposing fines on failure to do\nso or on providing false information. The RBI is also empowered to issue directions and guidelines to the\nsystem providers, prescribe the duties to be performed by them and audit and inspect their systems/premises\n\nThe RBI has initiated payment and settlement reforms, focusing on commercially important centres\nwhich account for 65 per cent of the banking business in terms of values. The RBI has emphasized devel-\noping an institutional framework to oversee payment system information technology applications and\ninstitution of satellite-based and terrestrial-based communications infrastructure.\n\nThere are two kinds of payment system in operation-retail and large value payment systems.\n\n@ Retail Payment System It comprises of paper-based payment system, and electronic payment\nsystems like the electronic clearing services (ECS), NEFT and card payment system.\n\nAs cheques play an important role in the retail payment system, clearing houses have been computer-\nized to increase efficiency in the cheque clearing system. Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR)\ntechnology for large clearing houses and Magnetic Media Based Clearing System (MMBCS) technology\nin smaller clearing houses whose low volumes make the use of MICR technology unviable have been\nintroduced. The RBI implemented Cheque Truncation System (CTS) in February 2008 in the National\nCapital Region. In this system, the physical movement of cheques to all payee bank branches has been\ntruncated or shorterned. The choice of the point of truncation, whether at the collecting branch or at its\nservice branch, is left to the individual banks who are the members of the New Delhi Bankers\u2019 Clearing\nHouse to decide. Clearing takes place based on the validation of cheque images.\n\nElectronic payment systems are becoming more popular. Electronic payments (e-payments) is effect-\ning payments through electronic means such as electronic clearing service (ECS)\u2014both debit and credit,\nnational electronic funds transfer system (NEFT), and card based payment credit and debit). To encour-\nage the use of electronic mode of payments, the Reserve Bank waived the processing charges for all elec-\ntronic payment systems operated by it till March 2009. All large value payments of @1 crore and above,\nmigrated to the electronic mode successfully and the threshold limit was brought down to 710 lakh with\neffect from August 1, 2008.\n\nECS (credit) is used for direct credit such as salary and pension payments, and refund of initial public\noffering (IPOs). and the ECS (debit) for direct debit such as collection of bills, insurance premia and equated\nmonthly installment payments of loans. The NEFT, launched by the RBI in November 2005, enables transfer of\nfunds within and across cities and between branches of a bank and across banks. While the transfer of funds is\nelectronically, it is not actually instant-it takes a day for transfer of funds. Generally, banks do not charge cus-\ntomers who avail of this facility. Private sector banks and foreign banks are the most active users of this product.\n\nWith the rapid growth in the usage of mobile phones and their wider geographical coverage, banks\nhave been exploring the use of mobile banking as an alternative channel of delivery of banking services.\nThe service is presently available on GSM handsets only and users conduct their transactions using their\nm-PIN. According to the RBI, the long-term goal of the mobile payment framework in India would be to\nenable fund transfer from an account in one bank to any other account in any bank on a real time basis\nirrespective of the mobile network the customer has subscribed to.\n\nThe use of Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) for cash withdrawal and balance enquiry is steadily\nincreasing. The National Financial Switch (NFS) network, which started its operations on August 27,\n2004 and is operated by Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology (IDRBT),\nHyderabad, enables inter-operability of the ATM cards issued by any bank across the entire network. All\ncash withdrawals from all ATMs would be free with effect from April 1, 2009.\n\n(ii) Large Value Payment Systems They consist of the real time gross settlement system (RTGS), government\nsecurities clearing and foreign exchange clearing. The RTGS was operationalized in March 2004. The RBI has\nmandated the use of electronic mode of payment between entities regulated by it. Banks, primary dealers, the\nRBI and the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation are members of the RTGS system The RTGS\nprovides for continuous (i.e., in real time) processing and settlement of funds transfers. It settles inter-bank\n\n\u2018transactions and time-critical transactions on behalf of customers and also facilitates settlement of all retail\npaper-based and electronic clearings taking place in Mumbai. Under RTGS, money is actually transferred\ninstantly (with a marginal time lag) to the beneficiary account. The RTGS transaction can be undertaken during\nbanking hours on working days. Both the bank and the beneficiary bank branch should be enabled for RTGS\ntransaction. To avail of this facility, a customer is required to transfer at least 21 lakh. The reach and utilization\nof the RTGS for funds transfer is consistently increasing. The RTGS system has been integrated with the RBI's\ninternal accounting system (IAS) has enabled straight through processing (STP). The integration of RTGS-IAS\nand the securities settlement system has made automatic intraday liquidity available.\n\nThe Clearing Corporation Of India Limited (CCIL) clears and settles inter-bank trades in Government\nsecurities, secondary market outright sales and repo transactions in government securities, OTC trades reported\non the NDS platform, trades which are contracted on the online anonymous, trading platform NDS-\u2014OM, col-\nlateralized borrowing and lending obligations (CBLOs), and foreign exchange. These trades are settled on a\nDvP III basis, i.e., the funds leg as well as the securities leg is settled on a net basis. The CCIL also provides\nguaranteed settlement facility for all dollar-rupee, inter-bank cash, Spot and Forward transactions by becoming\nthe central counterparty to every trade accepted for settlement, through the process of novation. The rupee legs\nof the transactions are settled through the members\u2019 current accounts with the Reserve Bank and the dollar leg\nthrough the CCILs account with the Settlement Bank at New York. The CCIL also provides continuous linked\nsettlement services for banks in India by availing third party services of a settlement bank.\n\nThe RBI implemented the Centralized Funds Management System (CFMS), as an intermediate ser-\nvice facility, which provides backoffice support and funds transfer. The CFMS enables the funds and\ntreasury managers of commercial banks to obtain the consolidated accountwise, centrewise position of\ntheir balances with all the 17 deposit accounts departments (DAD) of the RBI. It also enables transfer of\nfunds from one RBI office to another.\n\nIn order to bring down transaction costs, the Indian Banks Association (IBA) has proposed to set up a\nnew entity-National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), which will be jointly owned by banks. It will\nbe a section 25 company, which will not distribute its profits as dividend, but will plough it back for the\nimprovement and expanding the reach of the retail payment systems. It will carry out all sorts of financial\nsettlements apart from RTGS settlement which will continue to be under the purview of the RBI. The set-\nting up of this organization would bring about uniformity and standardization in retail payments, expand\nits reach and bring innovative products to augment customer convenience.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Diversification in Bank Operations\n\nIn the post-liberalization era, public sector banks have diversified to non-traditional activities such as\nmutual funds, merchant banking, venture capital funding, and other para-banking activities such as leas-\ning, hire purchase, and factoring. Earlier banks could undertake these activities only through their sub-\nsidiaries. Now banks can undertake these activities either through subsidiaries or in-house or both. The\nneed for earning profits, maximizing economies of scale, an enlarging customer base, and becoming a\none-stop financial services shop led banks to diversify in these new areas.\n\nMost of the banks undertake merchant banking activities through their subsidiaries. The first merchant\nbanking subsidiary set up in 1987 by the State Bank of India was known as SBI capital market. Merchant\nbankers offer a range of services relating to issue management, loan syndication, project counselling,\nworking capital financing, foreign currency loans, and portfolio management. Public sector subsidiaries\ndominate this area of financial services.\n\nBanks have also set up subsidiaries for acting as primary dealers for government securities. SBI Gilts,\n\nPNB Gilts, Gilts Securities Trading Corporation are some of the active primary dealers in government\nsecurities market.\n\nSubsidiaries, such as SBI Factors and Canbank Factors, are leaders in factoring industry. Banks,\nthrough their subsidiaries also provide services such as securitization of loans, stock broking, and finan-\ncial guarantee for infrastructure projects. Banks have plunged into the area of venture capital trading\nwherein they have contributed towards equity of venture capital funds floated by the Technology Develop-\nment and Investment Corporation of India (TDICI).\n\nBanks are now into retail banking, which encompasses deposit-and asset-linked products as well as\nother financial services offered to individuals for personal consumption. Banks are offering retail products\nsuch as housing loans for purchases of durables, auto loans, credit loans, educational loans, and credit\ncards. Retail banking is the new buzzword for all banks. Retail loan growth has been strong in India,\ngrowing at 37 per cent CAGR over the last three years. The components of retail loans comprise of hous-\ning loans, consumer durables, credit card receivables, auto loans, and other personal loans. The housing\nloan component constitutes more than 54 per cent of the total retail loan portfolio of banks.\n\n\nBanks have been permitted to enter into the insurance business through a Government of India noti-\nfication, which was issued on August 3, 2000. The RBI issued detailed guidelines on August 9, 2000.\nThe SBI has set up a life insurance subsidiary on risk participation basis with a 74 per cent equity. Many\ndomestic and foreign banks have been given \u2018in-principle\u2019 approval to act as corporate agents of insurance\ncompanies for distribution of insurance products on fee basis and to contribute to equity of insurance joint\nventures on risk participation basis.\n\nThe SBI and co-promoters such as the Bank of Baroda, HDFC Bank, ICICI, IDBI, and LIC have set up\na clearing corporation known as Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL) in April 2001. CCIL has\nbeen set up for clearing and settlement of government securities and foreign exchange transactions. The\nSBI (chief promoter) and other co-promoters have contributed 51 per cent of the equity of the corporation\nwhile the balance 49 per cent has been contributed by other banks, financial institutions, primary dealers,\nand mutual funds. CCIL also acts as an intermediary for the RBI in the fixed income and forex markets.\nAny two banks undertaking a forex transaction have to route the trade through CCIL which guarantees the\ntransaction. Thus banks are saved the trouble of sending instructions to correspondent branches across the\nworld to take their transactions further.\n\nBanks are now into loan syndications and consortium financing. Syndication is an arrangement where a\ngroup of banks, which may not have any other business relationship with the borrower, participate for a single\nloan. Corporates are now interested in raising funds for long-term financing for capital investment through\nloan syndication. Loan syndication has helped corporates to bring down their financial costs but has increased\ncompetition amongst banks. In a loan syndication, a group of banks comprising 10 to 30 banks participate\nto provide funds wherein one of the banks is the lead manager. This lead bank is decided by the corporate,\ndepending on confidence on the lead manager, underwriting skills. Lead banks charge fees ranging from 0.25\nper cent to 2 per cent. This loan arrangement may have a tenure of around 10 years and offer many options\nto corporates like draw-down after around two years, linking of loans to project milestones being achieved\nand no commitment charges to be paid to the banks. These options help corporates to save atleast 30 to 40\nbasis points while raising money through a loan syndication, against a bond issuance as the corporates have\nto prepare one set of documentation. A loan syndication also helps corporates get a better pricing. Banks can\noffload these loans to other players in the market. Foreign banks such as StanChart, HSBC, ABN Amro, and\nDeutsche Bank, private banks like UTI Bank, ICICI Bank, and HDFC Bank and public sector banks like\nIDBI and SBI are prominent players in this market. Consortium lending is similar to loan syndication. In a\nconsortium arrangement, the corporate gives a presentation to the banks for raising funds which leads to a\ncontinuous interaction between the consortium and the company. In this arrangement, the member banks offer\na range of services from loan and letter of credit, to working capital and guarantees to the company.\n\nThe RBI has allowed individuals to remit upto $2,00,000 a year. Foreign and private, sector banks\nhave already launched foreign deposits and international mutual fund products. They are offering high net\nworth individuals an array of products such as equity brokerage where investors can buy and sell equities\nfrom any major global exchange, premium deposit which pays principal and interest in one or two curren-\ncies at a prearranged exchange rate upon maturity, dollar-denominated Indian corporate bonds which are\nlisted overseas and investment in US Treasury Bond.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Consolidation in Banking\n\nIn India, both small and big, strong and weak, rural and urban, public and private banks coexist. The\ndistribution of banks in terms of profitability is skewed. Some banks earn high returns but are operating\ninefficiently and some banks are competing fiercely for a small segment of the market. Private sector\nbanks have already put in place the latest technology while some public sector banks are still struggling to\nmaintain their capital adequacy and other requirements. Hence, there is a need to restructure the banking\nindustry. Moreover, reforms have ushered in new changes and new competition which has forced banks to\nimprove their competitiveness. Restructuring and consolidation is one of the major routes through which\nthe Indian banking system could bring in competitiveness.\n\nGlobally, bank mergers have increased for improving the structure and efficiency of the banking indus-\ntry. A well-planned merger can be a boon as it reduces the cost of operation, expands the business profile,\nenhances growth, increases the capital base, which, in turn, increases the risk ability of the bank. This phe-\nnomenon of bank mergers is a relatively recent one in India. Mergers have gained importance on account\nof globalization, increasing competition, technological changes, and redefinition of takeovers. The Nar-\nasimham Committee on Reforms in Banking Sector (1998) recommended formation of three to four large\nbanks with an international presence, eight to ten banks with a national presence, local banks with a regional\npresence, and presence of rural banks. The committee suggested mergers among strong banks, both in the\npublic and private sectors and even with financial institutions and nonbanking finance companies (NBFCs).\n\nIn the early 1990s, New Bank of India merged with Punjab National Bank. It was a merger of a weak\nbank with a strong bank. In 1998, 20th Century Finance merged with Centurion Bank. In 1999, there were\ntwo mergers\u2014Bareilly Corporation Bank merged with Bank of Baroda and Sikkim Bank merged with the\nUnion Bank of India. In February 2000, Times Bank merged with HDFC Bank and in March 2001, Bank\nof Madura merged with ICICI Bank.\n\nICICI Limited merged with ICICI Bank on March 31, 2000, and converted itself into a universal bank.\nThe Benares State Bank Limited (BSBL) was merged with Bank of Baroda (BOB) on June 20, 2002, and\nall the branches of BSBL have started functioning as branches of BOB from July 19, 2002. The Global\nTrust Bank was merged with Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC) with effect from August 14, 2004 under\nthe powers vested with the RBI under the Banking Regulations Act, 1949 through a scheme sanctioned\nby the Government of India.\n\nPunjab National Bank took over New Bank of India in 1993 and acquired Nedungadi Bank in 2005.\nDuring 2005-06, the Ganesh Bank of Kurundwad Ltd was amalgamated with the Federal Bank Ltd as its\nnetworth had turned negative. There was a voluntary amalgamation between Bank of Punjab Ltd and the\nCenturion Bank Ltd. The Centurion Bank subsequently changed its name to Centurion Bank of Punjab\nLtd and then it was merged with HDFC Bank on May 23, 2008. On September 2, 2006, the United West-\nern Bank Ltd (UWB) was placed under moratorium by the Central Government and later amalgamated\nwith Industrial Development Bank Ltd on October 3, 2006. The Sangli Bank and The Bank of Rajasthan\nwere merged with ICICI Bank on April 19, 2007 and May 2010. In all, there have been 22 deals involving\nmergers and acquisitions in the post reforms era. Since nationalization, there have been a total of 41 merg-\ners and amalgamations. Of these, there have been 3 cases of consolidation between public sector banks,\n24 cases of M and As of private banks with public sector banks and 14 cases of M and As of private bank\nwith private bank. Of the 41 M and As, 24 have took place after the onset of reforms.\n\nConsolidation is required among old private sector banks and cooperative banks.\n\nPSU are saddled with unwieldy branch network. Moreover, weaker banks are faced with paucity of\nresources to adopt technology. Mergers and consolidations should be encouraged to exploit synergies,\ncost cutting and acquiring new markets. Merger of two regional banks is desirable. Moreover, the banks\nshould close unviable branches and reduce staff strength.\n\nAt present, Section 44 A of the Banking Regulation Act allows a private bank to acquire another pri-\nvate bank (like the merger of Bank of Madura with ICICI Bank). However, the provisions of the Banking\nRegulation Act does not clearly spell out mergers and acquisitions among the public sector banks without\nthe intervention of the RBI. Like, for instance, Section 45 of the Banking Regulation Act gives the RBI\npowers to apply to the government to place banks under a moratorium and prepare a scheme for amal-\ngamation (like in case of Oriental Bank of Commerce acquiring GTB). The provisions of the Banking\nRegulation Act need to be changed as the present trend is moving from a regime of a large number of\nsmall banks to consolidation\u2014a small number of large banks. The merger of the SBI and its associates\nwas completed in April, 2017. The finance ministry is actively considering more consolidation in the\nbanking sector where the need for S\u20146 banks of global size is felt.\n\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Equity Capital Raised by Public Sector Banks\n\nPublic sector banks were allowed to raise capital from the capital market to strengthen their capital ade-\nquacy ratios and reduce the holdings of the government/RBI. The Banking Companies (Acquisition and\nTransfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970/1980 and the State Bank of India Act, 1955 were amended to allow\nbanks to raise capital not exceeding 49 per cent of their equity.\n\nBanks normally issue shares by way of: i) Public Issues: Initial Public Offer and Further Public Offer\nii) Private Placement: Preferential Issue and Qualified Institutional Placement iii) Rights Issue and iv)\nBonus Issues.\n\nThe State Bank of India was the first public sector bank to tap the equity market in December 1993. In\nOctober 1996, it once again tapped the capital market through a GDR issue of 81,270 crore. With these\ntwo issues, the holding of the RBI came down to 59.7 per cent in State Bank of India. Over the years\n1993 to 2008, 16 PSBs raised capital through 37 public issues to the tune of $34,679 crore. The market\nresponded favourably to public sector banks\u2019 ventures to raise capital. Since 1995-96, private sector\nbanks have raised capital through 34 equity issues to the tune of \u20ac23,330 crore Some public and private\nsector banks have also raised funds by way of ADRs/GDRs issues in the international capital market.\nBanks also raised capital through discounted subordinated debt which is classified as Tier II.\n\nBoth the public and private sector banks raised 30,151 crore through private placements. As public\nsector banks accessed the capital market to raise funds, the equity held by the Government got diluted and\n\n\nthe share of the public holding increased. The government holding was more than 90 per cent in two pub-\nlic sector banks only, while in three public sector banks, the government holding was close to 51 per cent.\n\nThe number of banks listed and traded on the NSE are 31\u201412 PSBs and 19 private sector banks.\nThe government has also injected funds for strengthening the capital base of nationalized banks in\nthree phases. The first phase covering the period 1984-85 to 1992-93 when the government recapital-\nized public sector banks without any preset norms. The second phase was initiated during the period\n1993-1995, the beginning of the financial sector reforms wherein the public sector banks were given a\nhigher priority to improve their financial health. The government injected %10,987 crore in public sec\ntor banks during this phase. In the third phase beginning 1996, the government decided to recapitalize\nthe banks on a case to case basis with a condition to return the amount recapitalized to the government.\nrecapitalization continued up to 1998-99. The total amount injected by the Government for strengthen-\ning the capital base of nationalized banks amounted to %22,092 crore.\n\nThe nationalized banks have been enabled to raise capital through \u2018bonus\u2019 and \u2018rights\u2019 issue and\nalso to increase or decrease the authorized capital with approval from the Central Government and the\nReserve Bank without being limited by the ceiling of 3000 crore. As per the broad estimates from the\nReserve Bank, public sector banks would require a common equity of %1.4\u20141.5 trillion in addition to\n%2.65-2.75 trillion as non-equity capital to meet the full Basel III norms by 2018. Banks, therefore, need\nto design appropriate strategies for meeting these capital norms.\n\nIn the Union Budget, the Centre had allocated a total of 225,000 crore for the capitalisation of public\nsector banks in the financial year 2016-17, in line with the infusion plans announced under the umbrella\nscheme \u201cIndradhanush\u201d introduced in 2015.The plan proposes infusions adding up to 225,000 crore in\n2015-16 as well as in 2016-17, followed by 710,000 crore each in 2017-18 and 2018-19. The funds will\nhelp the banks in increasing their lending, raising additional funds and clean up balance sheets.\n",

A loss of public confidence in a bank can lead to a run on\nthe bank causing systemic failure, thereby, destabilizing the financial system.\n\nBanking is the business of money where high risks are involved.

                        "extracted-text": "Steps in Risk Management Process\n\nRisk Analysis It implies a backroom exercise of looking at the entire gamut of risks. Risk analysis is\ndefining the risk, which, in turn requires understanding the nature of risks to which the bank is exposed\nto and then try to quantify their impact on the bank. Thus, risk analysis includes risk identification and\nrisk measurement.\n\nRisk Identification This is in effect an attempt at listing out the risks to which the bank is exposed.\nIdentifying risks attached to the assets, liabilities and the process of the bank requires a clear understanding\nof the operations, organization structure, form of the organization, process flow, geographical concentration\nof risk, etc.\n\nSince a bank operates in a specific economic environment, it is also necessary to understand the\nexternal factors like economy, regulatory environment, investor behavior and competition. A bank cannot\nmanage its risks if it does not know what they are. A sound information system is a pre-requisite for risk\nmanagement.\n\nThe banking system faces different types of risks such as credit risk, market risk, technological risk,\nliquidity risk, and contingent risk.\n\n* Credit risk: This arises due to default in payment or delayed payment. In other words, it is the risk of\nnot getting back the money that is lent. Credit risks include counterparty default risk-the possibility\nthat the other party in an agreement will default and concentration risk\u2014probability that any single\nexposure or group of exposures may have the potential to produce losses large enough to threaten a\nbank\u2019s health or ability to maintain its core operations.\n\nInterest rate risk (IRR): This arises from adverse movements in interest rates which bring about\nchanges in a bank\u2019s portfolio value both in trading book (i.e., assets that are regularly traded and are\nliquid in nature) and in banking book (i.e., assets that are usually held till maturity and rarely traded).\nChanges in market interest rates might adversely affect a bank's financial condition. The immediate\nimpact of changes in interest rates is on bank\u2019s earnings through changes in its Net Interest Income\n(NID, known as \u2018earnings perspective\u2019. A long-term impact of changes in interest rates is on bank's\nMarket Value of Equity (MVE) or Net worth through changes in the economic value of its assets,\nliabilities and off-balance sheet positions, known as \u2018economic value\u2019 perspective. Economic value\nof the bank is the present value of future cash flows. The economic value is arrived at by discounting\nthe future cash flows by using an appropriate discount rate. Thus, economic value is affected both\nby changes in future cash flows and discount rate\n\n\u2018The deregulation of interest rates and the flexibility given to banks in pricing most of the assets and\nliabilities have exposed the banking system to Interest Rate Risk.\n\nIRR can arise on account of (i) differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash\nflows fluctuations in interest rate levels that have differing impacts on bank assets and liabilities known as\nthe repricing risk, (ii) changes in portfolio values caused by unanticipated shifts in the slope and shape of\nyield curve known as the yield curve risk, (iii) imperfect correlation between interest rates across different\ninterest rate markets for similar maturities known as the basis risk, and (iv) risks arising from interest rate\noptions embedded in a bank asset, liabilities and off-balance-sheet positions known as the options risk.\n\n* Market risk: This risk arises due to fluctuations in market prices of equity due to general market-related\nfactors. A bank generally invests funds in securities including equity market. The changes in the value\nof a bank\u2019s investment portfolio as a result of securities market behavior is called market risk.\n\n* Foreign exchange risk: This risk arises from adverse movements in currency exchange rates. Moreover,\nbanks may suffer losses due to interest rate risk, which arises from the maturity mismatching of for-\neign currency. Banks undertake operations in foreign exchange like accepting deposits, making loans\nand advances, quoting prices for foreign exchange transactions and sometimes undertaking trading\npositions. The increased capital flows across the globe coupled with volatility has made the banks\nbalance sheets vulnerable to exchange rate movements. Mismatched currency position also exposes\nit to country risk and settlement risk. Change in exchange rate has an impact on the bank\u2019s foreign\nexchange open positions and consequently its capital requirements. A depreciation in the rupee leads\nto a loss on oversold positions and a gain on the overbought positions.\nOperational risk: This risk emanates from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, system\nand procedures and controls or from external events. Operations comprise of the day-to-day activi-\nties of the bank in terms of processes and procedures in accordance with its strategy, channel and\nculture. Disruptions in operational flow due to failure of internal system results in financial losses.\nOperational risk events include internal and external frauds, workplace safety, system failures, etc.\nOperational risks also include: (i) Legal risk-bank\u2019s failure to enact appropriate policies, procedures,\nor controls to ensure it conforms to laws, regulations, contractual arrangements, and other legally\nbinding agreements and requirements; (ii) Documentation risk-risk arising out of improper or insuf-\nficient documentation which gives rise to ambiguity regarding the characteristics of the financial\ncontract; (iii) Technological risk: Technological changes\u2014especially in the fields of computers and\ncommunication\u2014give rise to technological risk. The banks should properly assess technological\nrisk and adopt suitable strategies and measures to manage this risk.\n\n+ Liquidity risk: This risk arises from a bank\u2019s inability to meet its obligations when they become due,\nand refers to situations in which a a tradeable financial instrument or an asset may not be realized\nin cash Liquidity risk may be classified into: (i) Term Liquidity Risk which arises due to an unex-\npected delays in repayments of the capital in lending transactions; (ii) Withdrawal/Call Risk, a primary\nliquidity risk, which arises on account of excess withdrawal of deposits than expected thus creat-\ning constraints for bank to meet its payment obligations-deposit run-offs in a bank-specific event;\n(iii) Structural Liquidity Risk which arises when the necessary funding transactions cannot be carried\n\n\nout (or can be carried only on less favorable terms); (iv) Contingent liquidity risk which is the risk asso-\nciated with finding additional funds or replacing maturing liabilities under potential, future stressed\nmarket conditions; and (v) Market liquidity risk which arises when positions cannot be sold within a\ndesired time period or can be sold only at a discount (market impact). This is especially the case with\nsecurities/derivatives in illiquid markets. Sharp and unanticipated market movements or defaults could\ncause demand for additional collateral calls from exchanges/settlement platforms in connection with\nforeign exchange and securities transactions, as liquidity risk emanates from maturity mismatch of\nassets and liabilities, the gap in mismatch may be narrowed by raising funds from the money market.\nOf all the financial risks, liquidity risk is more important and it has to be kept within acceptable limits,\notherwise banks dependence on the money market would increase.\n\nBanks with large off-balance sheet exposures or major deposit chunk from corporates or higher\ngrowth in assets have relatively high level of liquidity risk. Recent liquidity crisis has revealed that\nliquidity problems have the potential to affect bank balance sheets and bank capital adequacy.\nStrategic Risk: This risk arises on account of poor implementation of business decisions a failure to\nadapt to changes in the economic environment which has an adverse effects on capital and earnings.\nContingent Risk: This is also referred to as off-balance sheet risk as it is associated with off balance\nsheet activities of banks such as lines of credit, and forward contracts. Off-balance sheet products that\ncan give rise to unexpected demands for liquidity at banks include committed lending facilities to\ncustomers, committed backstop facilities, and committed back-up lines to special purpose vehicles.\n\nRisk Measurement After the identified risks are documented, they have to be quantified in terms of\nthe financial impact they are likely to have on the bank, if they strike. Banks utilize traditional tools\nsuch as ratio analysis and cash flow projections to quantify liquidity. Banks have gradually started using\nquantitative techniques and models to manage risk.\n\nStatistical models are used to measure and manage the financial risks to which banks are exposed. These\nmodels provide a framework for identifying, analysing, measuring, communicating and managing these risks.\nSome popular statistical models used by banks are: Gap analysis model: which calculates the repricing gap\nbetween the interest revenue earned on the bank's assets and the interest paid on its liabilities over a particular\nperiod of time. Interest rate risk in the Fixed Income portfolio of Bank\u2019s investments is managed through\nDuration analysis.; Value at Risk: which measures market risk inherent in trading portfolios. It is the maxi-\nmum expected loss that a bank can suffer over a target horizon, given a certain confidence interval; Banks\nalso carry out Duration Gap analysis to estimate the impact of change in interest rates on economic value of\nBank's assets and liabilities and thus arrive at changes in Market Value of Equity (MVE). Duration Gap model\nrecognizes the changes in the value of assets and liabilities by a given change in the market interest rate. The\nchange in value of equity (including reserves) with 1 per cent parallel shift in interest rates for both assets and\nliabilities needs to be estimated. Credit Risk Assessment (CRA) Models to assess the counterparty Risk, by\ntaking into account the various risks categorized broadly into financial, business, industrial and management\nRisks, each of which is scored separately. Banks have also set up exposure limits to achieve a well-diversified\nportfolio across dimensions such as companies, group companies, industries, collateral type, and geography.\nFor avoidance of concentration of credit risks, internal guidelines on prudential exposure norms in respect of\nindividual companies, group companies, banks, individual borrowers, non-corporate entities, sensitive sectors\nsuch as capital market, real estate, sensitive commodities, etc. have been put in place by banks.\n\nRisk Control Banks have put processes and controls in place in regard to various aspects of Credit\nRisk Management such as appraisal, pricing, credit approval authority, documentation, reporting and\nmonitoring, review and renewal of credit facilities, managing of problem loans, credit monitoring, etc.\nBanks have laid down trading and investment policies with defined market risk management parameters\nfor each asset class and have got these policies approved by their boards.\n\nTo control and mitigate operational risks, banks have issued detailed procedural guidelines for pro-\ncessing various banking transactions and necessary instructions to all offices regarding delegation of\nfinancial powers, which detail sanctioning powers of various levels of officials for different types of finan-\ncial transactions. Banks have started training programmes for their staff to create an awareness of the\ndifferent types of risks. Banks have put in place a system of prompt submission of reports on frauds and\na comprehensive system of preventive vigilance. Banks have also set up an Inspection & Management\nAudit Department to periodically conduct risk based audits and evaluate adequacy and effectiveness of\nthe control systems and the functioning of various control procedures. It also conducts review of the\nsystems established to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, codes of conduct and\nthe implementation of policies and procedures. Some banks have obtained insurance cover for potential\noperational risks. Banks have started building a comprehensive database of losses due to Operational\nRisks to graduate to Advanced Measurement Approaches for Operational Risk Management.\n\nRisk Monitoring _ Risk monitoring is evaluating the performance of bank\u2019s risk management strategies\nin achieving overall objectives. For effective monitoring, risk measures should be reported regularly\nand clearly compare current exposures to policy limits. Further past risk estimates should be compared\nwith actual outcomes to identify any shortcomings in risk measurement techniques. Regular monitoring\nactivities can help in quickly detecting and correcting deficiencies in the policies, processes and\nprocedures for managing risk, which, in turn, reduce the potential frequency and/or severity of a loss. The\nrisk management strategy also has to change in accordance with the changed risk climate. This will be\npossible only if'a concrete monitoring system is in place right from the beginning.\n",

The guidelines required banks to put in place loan policies approved by their board of\ndirectors, covering the methodologies for measurement, monitoring, and control of credit risk. The guide-\nlines also required banks to evaluate their portfolios on an on-going basis, rather than at a time close to the\nbalance sheet date and also to measure the current and potential credit exposures in case of off-balance sheet\nexposures, on a daily basis. Banks were also asked to fix a definite time frame for moving over to the value at\nrisk (VaR) and duration-a measure of the per cent change in the economic value of a position that will occur\ngiven a small change in the level of interest rates-approaches for the measurement of interest rate risk.

Asset liability management is a process\nof planning, organizing, and controlling asset and liability volume maturities, rates and yields so as to match\nthe structure of liabilities with structure of assets. The objective of ALM is to avoid mismatch of assets and lia~\nbilities and to enable banks to measure and monitor risk, and provide suitable strategies for their management.\n\nInformation systems and organization structure play a key role in asset liability management. Banks\nneed information regarding the behavior of asset and liability products in different branches. It is easier\nto collect reliable information in respect of foreign exchange, investment portfolio and money market\noperations as these functions are centralized.\n\nThe RBI advised banks in February 1999 to put in place an ALM system and set up internal asset lia-\nbility management committees at the top management level to oversee its implementation To effectively\nmanage asset-liability mismatches, the Board should have overall responsibility for management of risks\nand should decide the risk management policy of the bank and set limits for liquidity, interest rate, foreign\nexchange and equity price risks.

Each bank will have to decide on the role of its ALCO, its responsibility\nas also the decisions to be taken by it. The functions of ALCO are: (i) Product pricing for both deposits\nand advances and desired maturity profile of the incremental assets and liabilities; (ii) monitoring the\nrisk levels of the bank; (iii) review the results of and progress in implementation of the decisions made in\nthe previous meetings; (iv) articulate the current interest rate view of the bank and base its decisions for\nfuture business stragtegy on this view; (v) decide on source and mix of liabilities or sale of assets and a\nfunding mix between fixed vs floating rate funds, wholesale vs retail deposits, money market vs capital\nmarket funding, domestic vs. foreign currency funding, etc.\n\nThe ALCO would be supported by an ALM desk consisting of operating staff which would be respon-\nsible for analyzing, monitoring and reporting the risk profiles to. The staff would also prepare forecasts\n(simulations) showing the effects of various possible changes in market conditions related to the balance\nsheet and recommend the action needed to adhere to bank\u2019s internal limits.\n\nThe ALCO would be headed by the top management, the CEO/CMD or ED The Chiefs of Invest-\nment, Credit, Funds Management/Treasury (forex and domestic), International banking and Economic\n\n\nResearch can be members of the Committee. In addition. the Head of the Information Technology Divi-\nsion should also be an invitee for building up of MIS and related computerization.\n\nBanks should also constitute a professional managerial and Supervisory Committee consisting of three to\nfour directors which will oversee the implementation of the system and review its functioning periodically.\n",

The importance of\nliquidity rises above individual institutions, as liquidity shortfall in one institution can have repercussions\non the entire system. Bank management should measure not only the liquidity positions of banks on an\nongoing basis but also examine how liquidity requirements are likely to evolve under crisis scenarios.\nExperience shows that assets commonly considered as liquid like Government securities and other money\nmarket instruments could also become illiquid when the market and players are unidirectional. Therefore\nliquidity has to be tracked through maturity or cash flow mismatches. For measuring and managing net\nfunding requirements, the use of a maturity ladder and calculation of cumulative surplus or deficit of\nfunds at selected maturity dates is adopted as a standard tool.\n\nThe Maturity Profile could be used for measuring the future cash flows of banks in different time\nbuckets. The time buckets given the Statutory Reserve cycle of 14 days may be distributed as under:\n\n. Next day\n\n2-7 days\n\n. 8-14 days\n\n. 15-28 days\n\n. 29 days and upto 3 months\n\n.

Over 5 years\n\nSeweravawne\n\nWithin each time bucket there could be mismatches depending on cash inflows and outflows. While\nthe mismatches upto one year would be relevant since these provide early warning signals of impending\nliquidity problems, the main focus should be on the short-term mismatches viz., 1-14 days and 15-28\ndays. Banks, however, are expected to monitor their cumulative mismatches (running total) across all\ntime buckets by establishing internal prudential limits with the approval of the Board/Management Com-\nmittee. The mismatch during 1-14 days and 15-28 days should not in any case exced 20 per cent of the\ncash outflows in each time bucket. The net cumulative negative mismatches during the next day, 2-7 days,\n8-14 days and 15-28 days buckets should not exceed 5 per cent, 10 per cent, 15 per cent and 20 per cent\nof the cumulative cash outflows in the respective time buckets. If a bank in view of its asset\u2014liability\nprofile needs higher tolerance level, it could operate with higher limit sanctioned by its Board/Manage-\nment Committee giving reasons on the need for such higher limit. A copy of the note approved by Board!\nManagement Committee may be forwarded to the Department of Banking Supervision, RBI. The discre-\ntion to allow a higher tolerance level is intended for a temporary period, till the system stabilizes and the\nbank is able to restructure its asset-liability pattern.\n\nThe Statement of Structural Liquidity may be prepared by a placing all cash inflows and outflows in\nthe maturity ladder according to the expected timing of cash flows. A maturing liability will be a cash\noutflow while a maturing asset will be a cash inflow. In case the net cumulative negative mismatches\nduring the Day 1, 2-7 days, 8-14 days and 15-28 days buckets exceed the prudential limit of 5, 10, 15,\nand 20 per cent of the cumulative cash outflows in the respective time buckets the bank may show by\nway of a foot note as to how it proposes to finance the gap to bring the mismatch within the prescribed\nlimits. The gap can be financed from market borrowings (call/term), Bills Rediscounting, Repos and\ndeployment of foreign currency resources after conversion into rupees (unswapped foreign currency\nfunds), etc.\n\nAn Illustrative Statement of Structural Liquidity\nResidual Maturity\n\nOver\n1 Year\nand\n\nUpto\n3 Years\n\nOver\n\n3 Years\nand\nUpto\n\n5 Years\n\nOver\n5 Years\n\nTotal\n\nOver Over\n29 days 3Months 6 Months\n27 14 15-28 and Upto and Upto and Upto\nDay 1 Days Days Days 3Months 6 Months 1 Year\nOUTFLOWS\n\n1.

The Board approved \u2018stress testing policy\u201d should detail (a) the frequency and procedure for iden-\ntifying the principal risk factors which affect the bank's portfolio and should be stressed; (b) the\nmethodology for constructing appropriate and plausible single factor and multi factor stress tests;\n(\u00a9) the procedure for setting the stress tolerance limits; (d) the process for monitoring the stress loss\nlimits; (e) the remedial actions required to be taken at the relevant stages; (f) the authorities desig-\n\n>\n\nnated to activate the remedial actions; (g) the need for identification of the responsibilities assigned\nto various levels/functional units; and (h) the need for specification of reporting lines.\n\nThe senior management should be actively involved in identifying the principal risk factors;\ndesigning appropriate single factor/multi factor stress tests; setting the stress tolerance limits;\nreviewing the stress test results and monitoring the stress loss limits; activating the appropriate\nremedial actions; periodically communicating the stress test results and the actions taken, if\nany, to the Board; reviewing the need to modify the stress testing framework with reference to\ncertain elements like the risk factors, stress scenarios, levels of stress to be applied, the under-\nlying assumptions, stress tolerance levels, remedial actions etc.; designing an appropriate MIS\nto support the stress tests to be conducted; and ensuring an appropriate and effective internal\ncontrol mechanism to validate the stress tests and their findings;\n\n. Board and senior management should regularly review the results of scenario analyses and stress\n\ntests, including the major assumptions that underpin them. Stress test results may be used for\nsetting risk limits; allocating capital for various risks; managing risk exposures; and putting\nin place appropriate contingency plans for meeting the situations that may arise under adverse\ncircumstances.\n\nStress testing framework should be calibrated according to the complexity of each bank\u2019s busi-\nness activities. The number of risk factors to be stressed would depend on the complexity of\nthe portfolio and the risks the bank is exposed to. Banks should be able to justify their choice\nof stress tests and the choice of risk factors that are stressed. Banks which have foreign opera-\ntions, or/and are active in derivatives markets, or/and are operating an active trading portfolio\nshould use a combination of scenario analysis and sensitivity tests. Other banks may confine\nthemselves to sensitivity tests run relatively more frequently to assess the impact of the rel-\nevant principal risk factors on their financial condition.\n\n. Banks are free to choose the various assumptions underlying the stress tests and the basis for\n\ntheir assumptions. However, these should be well documented and available for verification by\nthe supervisor/auditors. The assumptions underlying the stress tests should be reviewed peri-\nodically for assessing their validity. Banks should undertake fresh stress tests when there are\nsignificant modifications in the underlying assumptions. Such periodic reviews are necessary\nto ensure the integrity, accuracy, and reasonableness of the stress testing framework.\n\nBanks should use appropriate, accurate and complete data when performing stress tests. The\nIT resources should be commensurate with the complexity of the techniques and the cover-\nage of the stress tests. Banks should have adequate MIS in place to support the stress testing\nframework. The systems should be able to support the conduct of stress tests on different risks\nat relevant levels (portfolios, regions, business units) and also aggregate the results for the\nbank as a whole.\n\nAs the environment in which banks are operating is quite dynamic, there are changes in macroeco-\nnomic environment, banks\u2019 instruments, trading strategies and regulatory policies. The risk measure-\nment methodologies and stress testing techniques in banks should, therefore, evolve to accommodate\nthese changes. The stress testing framework should, therefore, be reviewed periodically to determine\nits efficacy and to consider the need for modifying any of the elements. The framework should be\nsubjected to at least annual reviews which should cover, among others, the following aspects:\n\na. Adequacy of the documentation for various elements of the stress testing framework;\n\nb. Integration of the stress testing framework in the day-to-day risk management processes;\nc. Scope of coverage of the framework and the levels of stress applied;\n\nd. Integrity of MIS and data feeding into the stress tests; and\n\ne.

                        "extracted-text": "The Basel Capital Accord\n\nThe Bank for International Settlements (BIS) is an international organization which fosters international\nmonetary and financial cooperation and serves as a bank for central banks.\n\nThe Basel Committee, established by the Central Bank Governors of the group countries at the end of\n1974, meets regularly four times a year. It has about 30 technical working groups and task forces which\nalso meet regularly.\n\nIndia is a member of the group of 20 (G-20) countries that advises the Financial Stability Forum\n(FSF). The Core Principles Liaison Group set up the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)\nto promote and monitor principles of banking supervision and the working groups on capital, which\ndiscusses proposals for revising the capital adequacy framework. India is also an early subscriber to the\nSpecial Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS) and one of the first countries to accept the financial sector\nassessment programme of the IMF and the World Bank.\n\nDifferent central banks in their own respective countries governed the banks by the rules set by them.\nInternational banks had to adhere to different regulations in different countries. To provide a level playing\nfield for banks, the group of 15 most industrialized countries agreed on some common rules which came to\nbe known as the Basel Accord. The central banks of more than 100 countries adopted it over a period of time.\n\nThe Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) prepared a framework through a consultative\nprocess to secure international convergence of supervisory regulations governing the capital adequacy of\ninternational banks. This framework was finalized in 1988 and is known as the Basel Accord or Basel I.\nThe objectives of Basel I were twofold: (i) serve to strengthen the soundness and stability of the interna-\ntional banking system, and (ii) to diminish an existing source of competitive inequality among interna-\ntional banks. The three main components of the Basel I framework were constituents of capital, the risk\nweighting system, and the target ratio. The central focus of this framework was credit risk and especially,\ncountry transfer risk. Basel I prescribed two tiers of capital for the banks: Tier I capital which can absorb\nlosses without a bank being required to cease trading and Tier II capital which can absorb losses in the\nevent of a winding-up.\n\n* Tier I or Core Capital (the most permanent and readily available support against unexpected losses)\nincluded:\n\n\u00ab Paid-up capital, statutory reserves, share premium.\n\n* Capital reserve (representing surplus on sale of assets and held in a separate account only to\nbe included) and other disclosed free reserves (if any) minus equity investments in subsidiar-\nies, intangible assets, losses in the current period, and those brought forward from previous\nperiods.\n\n+ Tier II Capital included:\n\n* Undisclosed reserves and fully paid-up cumulative perpetual preference shares.\n\n+ Revaluation reserves arising out of revaluation of assets that are undervalued in the bank\u2019s books\n(like bank premises and marketable securities).\n\n* General provisions and loss reserves, not attributable to the actual diminution in value or identifi-\nable potential loss in any specific asset and available to meet unexpected losses.\n\n* Hybrid debt capital instruments that combine characteristics of equity and debt.\n\n* Subordinated debt that is fully paid up, unsecured, subordinated to the claims of other creditors,\nfree of restrictive clauses, and not redeemable at the initiative of the holder or without the consent\nof the supervisory authority of banks. If subordinated debt carries a fixed maturity, it should be\nsubject to progressive discount and have an initial maturity of not less than five years.\n\nAt least 50 per cent of a bank's capital base was to consist of core elements and supplementary capital was\nallowed not to be more than 100 per cent of the core capital.\nThe Basel Accord (1988) suggested the following principles of capital adequacy:\n\n+ Arisk weighted assets ratio method to be adopted by banks in which capital was related to different\ncategories of asset or off-balance-sheet exposure, weighted according to broad categories of relative\nriskiness. There were only five weights recommended for on balance-sheet items, i.e., 0, 10, 20,\n50, and 100 per cent. Government bonds of the countries that were members of the Organization\nfor Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) (which includes all members of the Basel\nCommittee) were assigned a zero risk weight, all short-term inter-bank loans and all long term inter-\nbank loans to banks headquartered in OECD countries a 20 per cent risk weight, home mortgages a\n50 per cent risk weight, and most other loans a 100 per cent risk weight.\n\n+ A bank must hold equity capital at least 8 per cent of its assets when multiplied by appropriate risk\nweights.\n\n+ When capital falls below this minimum requirement, shareholders may be permitted to retain con-\ntrol provided they agree to recapitalize the bank.\n\n* When this is not done, the regulatory authority may, at its discretion, sell or liquidate the bank.\nBasel I could introduce discipline among banks through risk weighted capital adequacy norms.\nThese norms (1988) helped to arrest the erosion of the banks\u2019 capital ratios. However, they were not\nfound to be adequate due to their perceived rigidities. Moreover, the financial markets, financial\nintermediaries, business of banking, risk management practices, and supervisory approaches under\nwent significant changes. The problems in South-east Asian economies, recessionary trends in the\nJapanese economy, the financial sector problems encountered in Latin American economies, and\nin some European economies emphasized that capital adequacy norms were not adequate to hedge\nagainst failures.\n\nThe Basel I capital adequacy norms were criticized as several deficiencies surfaced. These deficiencies\nwere:\n\n1. It recommended a \u2018one size-fits-all\u2019 approach that did not adequately differentiate between\nassets that have different risk levels. This standard encouraged capital arbitrage through secu-\nritization and off-balance sheet exposures.\n\n2. It assumed that the aggregate risk of a bank was equal to the sum of its individual risks. It\nfailed to take into consideration diversification of a bank\u2019s credit risk portfolio in the computa-\ntion of capital ratios. Diversification through the pooling of risks could significantly reduce the\noverall portfolio risk of a bank.\n\n3. These baseline capital adequacy norms were found to be inadequate as they almost entirely\naddressed credit risk Basel I did not explicitly address all the risks faced by banks such as\nliquidity risk, and operational risks.\n\n4. Many large banks in advanced countries developed advanced risk measurement approaches\nto estimate the amount of capital required to support risks. Thus, the Basel I framework was\nfound to be redundant in its approach.\n\n\nIn response to the same, the BCBS brought out their Consultative Paper on New Capital Adequacy Frame-\nwork in June 1999 and a second revision in January 2001 after an informed public debate. The new rules\nhave been effective from 2005.\n\nThe BCBS announced the establishment of an Accord Implementation Group.\n\nThe primary objectives of the new accord are (i) the promotion of safety and soundness of the finan-\ncial system; (ii) the enhancement of competitive equality; (iii) the constitution of a more comprehensive\napproach to addressing risks.\n\nThe New Basel Capital Accord is based on three mutually reinforcing pillars that allow banks and\nsupervisors to evaluate properly the various risks that the banks face. The New Basel Capital Accord\nfocuses on the following points:\n\n* Minimum capital requirements, which seek to refine the measurement framework set out in the 1988 accord.\n* Supervisory review of an institution\u2019s capital adequacy and internal assessment process.\n* Market discipline through effective disclosure to encourage safe and sound banking practices.\n\nPillar 1: Capital Adequacy The new framework maintains both the current definition of capital and\nthe minimum requirement of 8 per cent of capital to risk-weighted assets. The revised accord will be\nextended on a consolidation basis to holding companies of banking groups. The accord stresses upon\nthe improvement in the measurement of risks. Under Pillar 1, commercial banks are required to compute\nindividual capital adequacy for three categories of risks: credit risk, market risk, and operational risk.\n\nThe new accord has elaborated the credit risk measurement methods and proposed a range of\napproaches to credit risk. The Basel II has recommended two approaches\u2014the standardized approach,\nand the advanced internal risk based (AIRB) approach for estimating capital for credit risk. The stand-\nardized approach expands the scale of risk weights and uses external credit ratings to categorize credits.\nThis approach can be employed by less complex banks. Banks with more advanced risks management\ncapabilities can employ an IRB approach. This approach allows banks to use its internal estimates of\nthe borrower's creditworthiness to assess credit risk in the portfolio subject to strict methodological and\ndisclosure standards. The risk components include measures of the probability of default (PD)\u2014the prob-\nability that counterparty will default within one year, loss given default (LGD)\u2014the amount of the loss\nexpressed as a percentage of the amount outstanding at the time when the counterparty defaults, the\nexposure at default (EAD)\u2014the credit amount outstanding at the time of default, and effective maturity\n(M). In some cases, banks may be required to use a supervisory value as opposed to an internal estimate\nfor one or more of the risk components.\n\nOne of the most noteworthy features of Basel II is assigning capital charge for operational risk. The\nBCBS has defined operational risk \u2018as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal pro-\ncesses, people and systems or from external events\u2019. This definition includes legal risk, but excludes\nstrategic and reputational risk.\n\nThree approaches namely, basic indicator (BI), standardized (SA), and advanced measurement\n(AMA) approaches have been recommended for estimating capital for operational risk. Basic indicator\napproach, which is the simplest method of quantifying operational risks, is based on annual revenue\nof the bank. In this approach, a risk weight of 15 per cent is applied to a single indicator, specifically\nthe average gross income (i.e., the sum of net interest income and net non-interest income) over the\nprevious three years. Standardized approach is based on annual revenue of each of the broad business\nlines of the bank and includes not only a risk weight of 15 per cent, but specific risk weights defined\nfor each business line. In the Standardized Approach, banks\u2019 activities are divided into eight business\nlines: corporate finance, trading & sales, retail banking, commercial banking, payment & settlement,\nagency services, asset management, and retail brokerage Within each business line, gross income is\na broad indicator that serves as a proxy for the scale of business operations and thus the likely scale\nof operational risk exposure within each of these business lines. The capital charge for each business\nline is calculated by multiplying gross income by a factor (denoted beta) assigned to that business line.\nBeta serves as a proxy for the industry-wide relationship between the operational risk loss experience\nfor a given business line and the aggregate level of gross income for that business line. It should be\nnoted that in the Standardized Approach gross income is measured for each business line, not the\nwhole institution, i.e., in corporate finance, the indicator is the gross income generated in the corporate\nfinance business line.\n\nThe values of the betas are detailed below.\n\nBusiness Lines Beta Factors Corporate finance 18 per cent, Trading and sales 18 per cent, Retail\nbanking 12 per cent, Commercial banking 15 per cent, Payment and settlement 18 per cent, Agency\nservices 15 per cent, Asset management 12 per cent, and Retail brokerage 12 per cent.\n\nAdvanced measurement approach is based on the internally developed risk measurement framework\nof the bank adhering to the standards prescribed and include methods such as internal measurement\napproach (IMA), loss distribution approach (LDA), scenario based, and scorecard. Advanced measure-\nment approach calls for significant investment as compared to the other two approaches.\n\nPillar II: Supervisory Review This process emphasises the need for banks to develop sound\ninternal processes to assess the adequacy of capital based on a thorough evaluation of its risks and set\ncommensurate targets for capital. The internal processes would then be subjected to supervisory review\nand intervention. The supervisors would be responsible for evaluating the way the banks are measuring\nrisks and the robustness of the systems and processes.\n\nThe four basic and complementary principles on which the Pillar 2 rests are: (a) a bank should have\na process for assessing its overall capital adequacy in relation to its risk profile as well as a strategy\nfor maintaining its capital levels; (b) supervisors should review and evaluate a bank's internal capital\nadequacy assessment and strategy as well as its compliance with regulatory capital ratios; (c) supervi-\nsors expect banks to operate above the minimum regulatory capital ratios and should have the ability to\nrequire banks to hold capital in excess of the minimum; and (d) supervisors should seek to intervene at\nan early stage to prevent capital from dipping below prudential levels. Implementation of Pillar 2 requires\nthat a comprehensive assessment of risks be carried out by both the banks (internally) and the supervisor\n(externally).\n\nPillar Il: Market Discipline It can be bolstered through enhanced disclosure by banks. The new\nframework sets out disclosure requirements in several areas, including the way in which banks calculate\ntheir capital adequacy and their risk assessment methods. The transparency and disclosure standards will\nallow market participants to assess key pieces of information on the scope of application, capital, risk\nexposures, risk assessment processes, and hence the capital adequacy of the bank.\n\nBasel II is more risk sensitive and aligns banks\u2019 capital requirements more closely with the underly-\ning risks in the balance sheet. It helps banks formulate not only a better risk management strategy but\nalso business strategy and capital efficiency (lower regulatory capital) and allocation. Moreover, banks\nwould be required to adopt superior technology and information systems for efficient data collection, and\ndetailed technical analysis.\n",

Initially, the RBI\ndirected the banks to maintain a minimum capital of 8 per cent on the risk-weighted assets. Banks with\nbranches abroad were required to comply with minimum capital to risk weighted assets requirement of\n8 per cent by end-March 1994, while other banks were required to comply by end-March 1996. The Com-\nmittee on Banking Sector Reforms (1998) suggested further tightening of the capital adequacy norm.\nSubsequently the capital to risk-weighted asset ratio (CRAR) norm was revised upward to 9 per cent to\nbe attained by March 2000. Moreover, with effect from the year ended-March 2006, banks in India are\nrequired to maintain capital charge for market risk also on their \u2018available for sale\u2019 portfolio, and \u2018held\nfor trading\u2019 categories.\n\nThe RBI set up a Steering Committee comprising senior officials from 14 banks (public, private\nand foreign) and representatives of the Reserve Bank and the Indian Banks\u2019 Association (IBA). On the\nbasis of the recommendations of the Steering Committee, The RBI issued detailed draft guidelines for\nimplementation of the new accord in February 2005. The draft guidelines were revised and released on\nMarch 20, 2007 for comments/feedback and were then finalized on April 27, 2007 for implementation.\nThe trial run on select banks on Basel II norms was carried out in April 2006 and all banks adopted\nthe norms by 2007.\n\nThe Reserve Bank gave more time to banks to put in place appropriate systems so as to ensure full\ncompliance with Basel II. Foreign banks operating in India and Indian banks having presence outside\nIndia migrated to the standardized approach for credit risk and the basic indicator approach for opera-\ntional risk under Basel II with effect from March 31, 2008. All other scheduled commercial banks are to\nmigrate to these approaches under Basel II in alignment with them but in any case not later than March\n31, 2009.\n\nThe commercial banks, which account for about 78 per cent of the total assets of the banking sec-\ntor, were required to maintain capital for both credit and market risks as per Basel II framework; while\n\nthe cooperative banks were required to maintain capital for credit risk as per Basel I framework and the\nregional rural banks undergoing restructuring were not subject to Basel norms.\n",

In the case of a mar-\nket related off-balance sheet item like (a) interest rate contracts\u2014including single currency interest rate\nswaps, basis swaps, forward rate agreements, and interest rate futures; (b) foreign exchange contracts,\nincluding contracts involving gold,\u2014includes cross currency swaps (including cross currency interest\nrate swaps), forward foreign exchange contracts, currency futures, currency options; and (c) any other\nmarket related contracts specifically allowed by the Reserve Bank which give rise to credit risk., whether\nheld in the banking book or trading book, the credit equivalent amount is to be determined by the current\nexposure method.\n\nFor on-balance sheet securitization exposures, banks are required to calculate the risk weighted amount\nexposure by multiplying the principal amount (after deduction of specific provisions) of exposures by the\napplicable risk weight as prescribed in the guidelines. For the rated off-balance sheet securitization expo-\nsures, banks are required to calculate the credit equivalent amount by multiplying the principal amount of\nthe exposure (after deduction of specific provisions) with a 100 per cent credit conversion factor, unless\notherwise specified. If the off-balance sheet exposure is not rated, it must be deducted from capital, except\nan unrated eligible liquidity facility.\n\nMarket risk is defined as the risk of losses in on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet positions arising\nfrom movements in market prices. The market risk positions subject to capital charge requirement are:\n\n1. The risks pertaining to interest rate related instruments and equities in the trading book; and\n2. Foreign exchange risk (including open position in precious metals) throughout the bank (both\nbanking and trading books).\n\nTrading book for the purpose of capital adequacy will include:\n\n1. Securities included under the Held for Trading category\n2. Securities included under the Available for Sale category(iii) Open gold position limits\n3. Open foreign exchange position limits\n\n4. Trading positions in derivatives, and\n\n5. Derivatives entered into for hedging trading book exposures.\n\nThe minimum capital requirement for market risks is expressed in terms of two separately calculated\ncharges: (i) \u2018specific risk\u2019 charge for each security which is designed to protect against an adverse move-\nment in the price of an individual security; and (ii) \u2018general market risk\u2019 charge towards interest rate risk\nin the portfolio, where long and short positions (which is not allowed in India except in derivatives) in\ndifferent securities or instruments can be offset. The capital charge for equities would apply on their cur-\nrent market value in bank\u2019s trading book. The instruments covered include equity shares, whether voting\nor non-voting, convertible securities that behave like equities, for example: units of mutual funds, and\ncommitments to buy or sell equity. Capital charge for specific risk as well as general market risk has been\nstipulated at nine per cent and is to be computed on the banks\u2019 gross equity positions. Banks have been\ndirected to adopt standardized duration method to arrive at the capital charge.\n\nBanks are required to compute their capital requirements for operational risk using the basic indica-\ntor approach where in, banks must hold capital for operational risk equal to the average over the previous\n\nthree years of 15 per cent of positive annual gross income. If negative gross income distorts a bank\u2019s Pillar\n1 capital charge for operational risk, the RBI could consider appropriate supervisory action under Pillar 2.\n",

Each business transaction carries a specific risk and a portion of capital has to\nbe earmarked for this risk. This portion acts as a \u2018secret reserve\u2019 to cushion any possible future loss.\nHigher capital adequacy will drive banks towards greater efficiency and this could force banks to bring\ndown operating costs. Capital adequacy enables banks to expand their balance sheet and strengthen their\nfundamentals, which, in turn, help the banks to mobilize capital at reasonable cost. Hence, quality and\nrisk weightage of assets are the new important parameters which are crucial for the growth of banks. The\nRBI stipulates a capital adequacy ratio of 9 per cent for all banks and a capital adequacy ratio below this\nstipulation indicates the inadequacy of a bank\u2019s capital, compared to its assets (largely loans advanced\nand investments) weighted against the risk they carry. In other words, the capital for these banks does not\nmatch up to the risk profile of their loan advances.\n\nAlthough Basel II was a comprehensive capital regulation framework, it failed to address certain\nissues which emerged during the financial crisis of 2007-08 (Jayadev, M).\n\n+ Basel II was pro-cyclical; in times, when banks were doing well, it did not impose additional capital\nrequirement on banks. On the other hand, in stressed times, when banks required additional capital,\n\nBasel II required banks to bring capital. The failure to bring in additional capital forced major inter-\nnational banks into a vicious cycle of deleveraging, thereby leading global financial markets and\neconomies around the world into recession.\n\nMost of the assets of the banks were trading book exposures such as securitized bonds, derivative\nproducts, and other toxic assets which could not be liquidat the times of crisis.\n\nBanks were highly levered and there was no regulation for limiting leverage.\n\nBasel II failed to address liquidity risk as part of capital regulation. which cascaded into\nsolvency risk.\n\nBasel II focused more on individual financial institutions and ignored the systemic risk arising from\nthe interconnectedness across institutions and markets, which led the crisis to spread to several\nfinancial markets.\n\nHence, Basel III tries to address the above issues by (i) increasing the level and quality of capital- stricter\ndefinition of capital and introducing capital conservation buffer; (ii) introduction of liquidity standards- new\nLiquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) are to be introduced in 2015 and\n2018, respectively; (iii) modifications in provisioning norms; and (iv) introduction of leverage ratio \u20143 per\ncent leverage ratio of Tier 1 will be tested before a mandatory leverage ratio is introduced in January 2018.\n\n",

Accordingly, capital funds will be defined\nas [(Common Equity Tier 1 capital) + (Additional Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital eligible for computing\n\nand reporting CRAR of the bank)]. It may be noted that the term \u2018Common Equity Tier 1 capital\u2019 does\nnot include capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Regulatory Adjustments/Deductions\n\nThe following paragraphs deal with the regulatory adjustments/deductions which will be applied to regu-\nlatory capital both at solo and consolidated level.\n\n1. Goodwill and all Other Intangible Assets\n\n(i) Goodwill and all other intangible assets should be deducted from Common Equity Tier 1\ncapital including any goodwill included in the valuation of significant investments in the\ncapital of banking, financial and insurance entities which are outside the scope of regulatory\nconsolidation. In terms of AS 23 \u2014 Accounting for investments in associates, goodwill/capi-\ntal reserve arising on the acquisition of an associate by an investor should be included in the\ncarrying amount of investment in the associate but should be disclosed separately. Therefore,\nif the acquisition of equity interest in any associate involves payment which can be attribut-\nable to goodwill, this should be deducted from the Common Equity Tier 1 of the bank.\n\n(ii) The full amount of the intangible assets is to be deducted net of any associated deferred tax\nliabilities which would be extinguished if the intangible assets become impaired or derecog-\nnized under the relevant accounting standards. For this purpose, the definition of intangible\nassets would be in accordance with the Indian accounting standards. Operating losses in the\ncurrent period and those brought forward from previous periods should also be deducted\nfrom Common Equity Tier 1 capital.\n\n(iii) Application of these rules at consolidated level would mean deduction of any goodwill and\nother intangible assets from the consolidated Common Equity which is attributed to the Bal-\nance Sheets of subsidiaries, in addition to deduction of goodwill and other intangible assets\nwhich pertain to the solo bank.\n\n2. Deferred Tax Assets (DTAs)\n\n(i) Deferred tax assets (DTAs) associated with accumulated losses and other such assets should\nbe deducted in full from Common Equity Tier (CET)! capital.\n\n(ii) DTAs which relate to timing differences (other than those related to accumulated losses) may,\ninstead of full deduction from CET1 capital, be recognized in the CET1 capital up to 10% of\na bank\u2019s CET! capital, at the discretion of banks [after the application of all regulatory adjust-\nments)\n\n(iii) Further, the limited recognition of DTAs as at (ii) above along with limited recognition of\nsignificant investments in the common shares of unconsolidated financial (i.e. banking, finan-\ncial and insurance) entities. (iii) taken together must not exceed 15% of the CET! capital,\ncalculated after all regulatory adjustments . However, banks shall ensure that the CET capital\narrived at after application of 15% limit should in no case result in recognising any item more\nthan the 10% limit applicable individually.\n\n(iv) The amount of DTAs which are to be deducted from CET1 capital may be netted with associ-\nated deferred tax liabilities (DTLs) provided that:\n\n* both the DTAs and DTLs relate to taxes levied by the same taxation authority and offsetting\nis permitted by the relevant taxation authority;\n\n+ the DTLs permitted to be netted against DTAs must exclude amounts that have been netted\nagainst the deduction of goodwill, intangibles and defined benefit pension assets; and\n\n+ the DTLs must be allocated on a pro rata basis between DTAs subject to deduction from\nCETI capital as at (i) and (ii) above.\n\n(v) The amount of DTAs which is not deducted from CET! capital (in terms of para (ii) above)\nwill be risk weighted at 250% as in the case of significant investments in common shares not\ndeducted from bank\u2019s CET1 capital .\n\n3. Cash Flow Hedge Reserve\n\n(i) The amount of the cash flow hedge reserve which relates to the hedging of items that are\nnot fair valued on the balance sheet (including projected cash flows) should be derecognized\nin the calculation of Common Equity Tier 1. This means that positive amounts should be\ndeducted and negative amounts should be added back. This treatment specifically identifies\nthe element of the cash flow hedge reserve that is to be derecognized for prudential purposes.\nIt removes the element that gives rise to artificial volatility in Common Equity, as in this case\nthe reserve only reflects one half of the picture (the fair value of the derivative, but not the\nchanges in fair value of the hedged future cash flow).\n\n(ii) Application of these rules at consolidated level would mean derecognition of cash flow hedge\nreserve from the consolidated Common Equity which is attributed to the subsidiaries, in addi-\ntion to derecognition of cash flow hedge reserve pertaining to the solo bank.\n\n4, Shortfall of the Stock of Provisions to Expected Losses\nThe deduction from capital in respect of a shortfall of the stock of provisions to expected losses\nunder the Internal Ratings Based (IRB) approach should be made in the calculation of Com-\nmon Equity Tier 1. The full amount is to be deducted and should not be reduced by any tax\neffects that could be expected to occur if provisions were to rise to the level of expected losses.\n\n5. Gain-on-Sale Related to Securitization Transactions\n\n(i) As per Basel III rule text, banks are required to derecognize in the calculation of Common\nEquity Tier 1 capital, any increase in equity capital resulting from a securitization transaction,\nsuch as that associated with expected future margin income (FMI) resulting in a gain-on-sale.\nHowever, as per existing guidelines on securitization of standard assets issued by RBI, banks\nare not permitted to recognize the gain-on-sale in the P&L account including cash profits.\nTherefore, there is no need for any deduction on account of gain-on-sale on securitization.\nBanks are allowed to amortize the profit including cash profit over the period of the securities\nissued by the SPV. However, if a bank is following an accounting practice which in substance\nresults in recognition of realized or unrealized gains at the inception of the securitization\ntransactions, the treatment stipulated as per Basel III rule text as indicated in the beginning of\nthe paragraph would be applicable.\n\n(ii) Application of these rules at consolidated level would mean deduction of gain-on-sale from\nthe consolidated Common Equity which is recognized by the subsidiaries in their P&L and/or\nequity, in addition to deduction of any gain-on-sale recognized by the bank at the solo level.\n\n6. Cumulative Gains and Losses due to Changes in Own Credit Risk on Fair Valued Financial\nLiabilities\n\n(i) Banks are required to derecognize in the calculation of Common Equity Tier 1 capital, all\nunrealized gains and losses which have resulted from changes in the fair value of liabilities\nthat are due to changes in the bank\u2019s own credit risk. In addition, with regard to derivative\n\nGi)\n\nliabilities, derecognize all accounting valuation adjustments arising from the bank\u2019s own\ncredit risk. The offsetting between valuation adjustments arising from the bank\u2019s own credit\nrisk and those arising from its counterparties\u2019 credit risk is not allowed. If a bank values its\nderivatives and securities financing transactions (SFTs) liabilities taking into account its\nown creditworthiness in the form of debit valuation adjustments (DVAs), then the bank is\nrequired to deduct all DVAs from its Common Equity Tier 1 capital, irrespective of whether\nthe DVAs arises due to changes in its own credit risk or other market factors. Thus, such\ndeduction also includes the deduction of initial DVA at inception of a new trade. In other\nwords, though a bank will have to recognize a loss reflecting the credit risk of the counter-\nparty (i.e., credit valuation adjustments-CVA), the bank will not be allowed to recognize\nthe corresponding gain due to its own credit risk.\n\nApplication of these rules at consolidated level would mean derecognition of unrealized gains\nand losses which have resulted from changes in the fair value of liabilities that are due to\nchanges in the subsidiaries\u2019 credit risk, in the calculation of consolidated Common Equity\nTier 1 capital, in addition to derecognition of any such unrealized gains and losses attributed\nto the bank at the solo level.\n\n7. Defined Benefit Pension Fund Assets and Liabilities\n(i) Defined benefit pension fund liabilities, as included on the balance sheet, must be fully\n\nrecognized in the calculation of Common Equity Tier 1 capital (.e., Common Equity Tier 1\ncapital cannot be increased through derecognizing these liabilities). For each defined benefit\npension fund that is an asset on the balance sheet, the asset should be deducted in the cal-\nculation of Common Equity Tier 1 net of any associated deferred tax liability which would\nbe extinguished if the asset should become impaired or derecognized under the relevant\naccounting standards.\n\n(ii) Application of these rules at consolidated level would mean deduction of defined benefit\n\npension fund assets and recognition of defined benefit pension fund liabilities pertaining to\nsubsidiaries in the consolidated Common Equity Tier 1, in addition to those pertaining to\nthe solo bank.\n\n(iii) From April 1, 2013, banks should deduct the entire amount of unamortized expenditure from.\n\ncommon equity Tier I capital for the purpose of capital adequacy ratios.\n\n8. Investments in Own Shares (Treasury Stock)\n\n@\n\n(ii)\n\nInvestment in a bank\u2019s own shares is tantamount to repayment of capital and therefore, it is\nnecessary to knock-off such investment from the bank\u2019s capital with a view to improving the\nbank's quality of capital. This deduction would remove the double counting of equity capital\nwhich arises from direct holdings, indirect holdings via index funds and potential future hold-\nings as a result of contractual obligations to purchase own shares.\n\nBanks should not repay their equity capital without specific approval of Reserve Bank of\nIndia. Repayment of equity capital can take place by way of share buy-back, investments\nin own shares (treasury stock) or payment of dividends out of reserves, none of which are\npermissible. However, banks may end up having indirect investments in their own stock if\nthey invest in/take exposure to mutual funds or index funds/securities which have long posi-\ntion in bank\u2019s share. In such cases, banks should look through holdings of index securities\nto deduct exposures to own shares from their Common Equity Tier 1 capital. Following the\nsame approach outlined above, banks must deduct investments in their own Additional Tier\n1 capital in the calculation of their Additional Tier 1 capital and investments in their own\nTier 2 capital in the calculation of their Tier 2 capital. In this regard, the following rules may\nbe observed:\n\n(a) If the amount of investments made by the mutual funds/index funds/venture capital\nfunds/private equity funds/investment companies in the capital instruments of the invest-\ning bank is known; the indirect investment would be equal to bank\u2019s investments in such\nentities multiplied by the per cent of investments of these entities in the investing bank\u2019s\nrespective capital instruments.\n\n(b) If the amount of investments made by the mutual funds/index funds/venture capital\nfunds/private equity funds/investment companies in the capital instruments of the invest-\ning bank is not known but, as per the investment policies/mandate of these entities such\ninvestments are permissible; the indirect investment would be equal to bank\u2019s invest-\n\n\nments in these entities multiplied by 10 per cent18 of investments of such entities in the\ninvesting bank\u2019s capital instruments. Banks must note that this method does not follow\ncorresponding deduction approach i.e., all deductions will be made from the Common\nEquity Tier 1 capital even though, the investments of such entities are in the Additional\nTier 1/Tier 2 capital of the investing banks.\n\n(iii) Application of these rules at consolidated level would mean deduction of subsidiaries\u2019\ninvestments in their own shares (direct or indirect) in addition to bank\u2019s direct or indirect\ninvestments in its own shares while computing consolidated Common Equity Tier 1.\n\n9. Investments in the Capital of Banking, Financial and Insurance Entities\n9.1 Limits on a Bank\u2019s Investments in the Capital of Banking, Financial and Insurance\nEntities\n(i) A bank\u2019s investment in the capital instruments issued by banking, financial and insurance\nentities is subject to the following limits:\n\n(a) A bank's investments in the capital instruments issued by banking, financial and\ninsurance entities should not exceed 10 per cent of its capital funds, but after all\ndeductions mentioned in (8)above\n\n(b) Banks should not acquire any fresh stake in a bank\u2019s equity shares, if by such acquisition,\nthe investing bank's holding exceeds 5 per cent of the investee bank\u2019s equity capital.\n\n(c) Under the provisions of Section 19(2) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, a bank-\ning company cannot hold shares in any company whether as pledge or mortgagee or\nabsolute owner of an amount exceeding 30 per cent of the paid-up share capital of that\ncompany or 30 per cent of its own paid-up share capital and reserves, whichever is less.\n\n(d) Equity investment by a bank in a subsidiary company, financial services company,\nfinancial institution, stock and other exchanges should not exceed 10 per cent of the\nbank's paid-up share capital and reserves.\n\n(ec) Equity investment by a bank in companies engaged in non-financial services\nactivities would be subject to a limit of 10 per cent of the investee company\u2019s\npaid up share capital or 10 per cent of the bank\u2019s paid up share capital and\nreserves, whichever is less.\n\n(f) Equity investments in any non-financial services company held by (a) a bank; (b)\nentities which are bank\u2019s subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures or entities directly\nor indirectly controlled by the bank; and (c) mutual funds managed by AMCs con-\ntrolled by the bank should in the aggregate not exceed 20 per cent of the investee\ncompany\u2019s paid up share capital.\n\n(g) A bank\u2019s equity investments in subsidiaries and other entities that are engaged in\nfinancial services activities together with equity investments in entities engaged in\nnon-financial services activities should not exceed 20 per cent of the bank\u2019s paid-\nup share capital and reserves. The cap of 20 per cent would not apply for invest-\nments classified under \u2018Held for Trading\u2019 category and which are not held beyond\n90 days.\n\n(ii) An indicative list of institutions which may be deemed to be financial institutions other\nthan banks and insurance companies for capital adequacy purposes is as under:\n\n= Asset Management Companies of Mutual Funds/Venture Capital Funds/Private Equity\nFunds ete;\n\n+ Non-Banking Finance Companies;\n\n* Housing Finance Companies;\n\n= Primary Dealers;\n\n+ Merchant Banking Companies; and\n\n+ Entities engaged in activities which are ancillary to the business of banking under the\nBR. Act, 1949.\n\n(iii) Investments made by a banking subsidiary/ associate in the equity or non- equity regu-\nlatory capital instruments issued by its parent bank should be deducted from such sub-\nsidiary\u2019s regulatory capital following corresponding deduction approach, in its capital\nadequacy assessment on a solo basis. The regulatory treatment of investment by the non-\nbanking financial subsidiaries/associates in the parent bank\u2019s regulatory capital would,\nhowever, be governed by the applicable regulatory capital norms of the respective regula-\ntors of such subsidiaries/associates.\n\n9.2 Treatment of a Bank\u2019s Investments in the Capital Instruments Issued by Banking,\nFinancial and Insurance Entities within Limits\nThe investment of banks in the regulatory capital instruments of other financial entities con-\ntributes to the inter-connectedness amongst the financial institutions. In addition, these invest-\nments also amount to double counting of capital in the financial system. Therefore, these\ninvestments have been subjected to stringent treatment in terms of deduction from respective\ntiers of regulatory capital. A schematic representation of treatment of banks\u2019 investments in\ncapital instruments of financial entities is shown below. Accordingly, all investments in the\ncapital instruments issued by banking, financial and insurance entities within the limits men-\ntioned in Paragraph 9.1 will be subject to the following rules.\n\nIn the entities where the bank does not own more than 10% of | In the entities where\nthe common share capital of individual entity. the bank owns more\nthan 10% of the com-\nmon share capital of\nindividual entity.\nAggregate of invest- EQUITY NON-COMMON\nments in capital Compare aggregated equity invest- EQUITY\ninstruments ofall ments with 10% of bank\u2019s Common All such investment\nsuch entities and Equity. will be deducted\ncompare with 10% of following corre-\nbank\u2019s own Common sponding deduction\nEquity. approach.\nInvestments less than | Investments more | Investments less | More than 10% will\n10% will be than 10% will be | than 10% will be | be deducted from\nrisk weighted accord- | deducted follow- | risk weighted at | Common Equity.\ning to banking book | ing correspond- | 250%.\nand trading book ing deduction\nrules. approach.\n\n(A) Reciprocal Cross-holdings in the Capital of Banking, Financial and Insurance Entities\nReciprocal cross holdings of capital might result in artificially inflating the capital position of\nbanks. Such holdings of capital will be fully deducted. Banks must apply a \u2018corresponding\ndeduction approach\u2019 to such investments in the capital of other banks, other financial institu-\ntions and insurance entities. This means the deduction should be applied to the same compo-\nnent of capital (Common Equity, Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital) for which the capital\nwould qualify if it was issued by the bank itself. For this purpose, a holding will be treated as\nreciprocal cross holding if the investee entity has also invested in the any class of bank\u2019s capital\ninstruments which need not necessarily be the same as the bank\u2019s holdings.\n\n(B) Investments in the Capital of Banking, Financial and Insurance Entities which are\noutside the Scope of Regulatory Consolidation and where the Bank does not Own\nmore than 10 per cent of the Issued Common Share Capital of the Entity\n\n(i) The regulatory adjustment described in this section applies to investments in the capital\nof banking, financial and insurance entities that are outside the scope of regulatory con-\nsolidation and where the bank does not own more than 10 per cent of the issued common\nshare capital of the entity. In addition:\n\n(a) Investments include direct, indirect and synthetic holdings of capital instruments. For\nexample, banks should look through holdings of index securities to determine their\nunderlying holdings of capital.\n\n(b) Holdings in both the banking book and trading book are to be included. Capital\nincludes common stock (paid-up equity capital) and all other types of cash and syn-\nthetic capital instruments (e.g. subordinated debt).\n\n(c) Underwriting positions held for five working days or less can be excluded. Underwrit-\ning positions held for longer than five working days must be included.\n\n(@) If the capital instrument of the entity in which the bank has invested does not meet the cri-\nteria for Common Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1, or Tier 2 capital of the bank, the capital\nis to be considered common shares for the purposes of this regulatory adjustment.\n\n(c) With the prior approval of RBI a bank can temporarily exclude certain investments\nwhere these have been made in the context of resolving or providing financial assis-\ntance to reorganize a distressed institution.\n\n(ii) If the total of all holdings listed in paragraph (i) above, in aggregate exceed 10 per cent\nof the bank's Common Equity (after applying all other regulatory adjustments in full listed\nprior to this one), then the amount above 10 per cent is required to be deducted, applying a\ncorresponding deduction approach. This means the deduction should be applied to the same\ncomponent of capital for which the capital would qualify if it was issued by the bank itself.\nAccordingly, the amount to be deducted from common equity should be calculated as the\ntotal of all holdings which in aggregate exceed 10 per cent of the bank\u2019s common equity (as\nper above) multiplied by the common equity holdings as a percentage of the total capital hold-\nings. This would result in a Common Equity deduction which corresponds to the proportion\nof total capital holdings held in Common Equity. Similarly, the amount to be deducted from\nAdditional Tier 1 capital should be calculated as the total of all holdings which in aggregate\nexceed 10 per cent of the bank\u2019s Common Equity (as per above) multiplied by the Addi-\ntional Tier 1 capital holdings as a percentage of the total capital holdings. The amount to be\ndeducted from Tier 2 capital should be calculated as the total of all holdings which in aggre-\ngate exceed 10 per cent of the bank\u2019s Common Equity (as per above) multiplied by the Tier 2\ncapital holdings as a percentage of the total capital holdings.\n\n(iii) If, under the corresponding deduction approach, a bank is required to make a deduction\nfrom a particular tier of capital and it does not have enough of that tier of capital to satisfy\nthat deduction, the shortfall will be deducted from the next higher tier of capital (e.g., ifa\nbank does not have enough Additional Tier 1 capital to satisfy the deduction, the shortfall\nwill be deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 capital).\n\n(iv) Investments below the threshold of 10 per cent of bank\u2019s Common Equity, which are not\ndeducted, will be risk weighted. Thus, instruments in the trading book will be treated as\nper the market risk rules and instruments in the banking book should be treated as per the\nstandardized approach or internal ratings-based approach (as applicable). For the applica-\ntion of risk weighting the amount of the holdings which are required to be risk weighted\nwould be allocated on a pro rata basis between the Banking and Trading Book. However,\nin certain cases, such investments in both scheduled and non-scheduled commercial banks\nwill be fully deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 capital of investing bank.\n\n(v) For the purpose of risk weighting of investments in as indicated in para (iv) above, invest-\nments in securities having comparatively higher risk weights will be considered for risk\nweighting to the extent required to be risk weighted, both in banking and trading books.\nIn other words, investments with comparatively poor ratings (i.e., higher risk weights)\nshould be considered for the purpose of application of risk weighting first and the resid-\nual investments should be considered for deduction.\n\n(\u00a9) Significant Investments in the Capital of Banking, Financial and Insurance Entities\nwhich are outside the Scope of Regulatory Consolidation\n\n(i) The regulatory adjustment described in this section applies to investments in the capital\nof banking, financial and insurance entities that are outside the scope of regulatory con-\nsolidation where the bank owns more than 10 per cent of the issued common share capital\nof the issuing entity or where the entity is an affiliate of the bank. In addition:\n\nInvestments include direct, indirect and synthetic holdings of capital instruments. For\nexample, banks should look through holdings of index securities to determine their\nunderlying holdings of capital.\n\nHoldings in both the banking book and trading book are to be included. Capital includes\ncommon stock and all other types of cash and synthetic capital instruments (e.g., sub-\nordinated debt).\n\nUnderwriting positions held for five working days or less can be excluded. Underwriting\npositions held for longer than five working days must be included.\n\nIfthe capital instrument of the entity in which the bank has invested does not meet the cri-\nteria for Common Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1, or Tier 2 capital of the bank, the capi-\ntal is to be considered common shares for the purposes of this regulatory adjustment26.\nWith the prior approval of RBI a bank can temporarily exclude certain investments\nwhere these have been made in the context of resolving or providing financial assis-\ntance to reorganize a distressed institution.\n\n(ii) Investments other than Common Shares\nAll investments included in para (i) above which are not common shares must be fully\ndeducted following a corresponding deduction approach. This means the deduction\nshould be applied to the same tier of capital for which the capital would qualify if it was\nissued by the bank itself. If the bank is required to make a deduction from a particular tier\nof capital and it does not have enough of that tier of capital to satisfy that deduction, the\nshortfall will be deducted from the next higher tier of capital (e.g., ifa bank does not have\nenough Additional Tier 1 capital to satisfy the deduction, the shortfall will be deducted\nfrom Common Equity Tier 1 capital).\n\n(iii) Investments which are Common Shares\nAll investments included in para (i) above which are common shares and which exceed 10\nper cent of the bank\u2019s Common Equity (after the application of all regulatory adjustments)\nwill be deducted while calculating Common Equity Tier 1 capital. The amount that is not\ndeducted (upto 10 per cent if bank\u2019s common equity invested in the equity capital of such\nentities) in the calculation of Common Equity Tier 1 will be risk weighted at 250 per cent\n-However, in certain cases, such investments in both scheduled and non-scheduled com-\nmercial banks will be fully deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 capital of investing bank.\n\n9.3 With regard to computation of indirect holdings through mutual funds or index funds, of\ncapital of banking, financial and insurance entities which are outside the scope of regulatory\nconsolidation, the following rules may be observed:\n\n(i) If the amount of investments made by the mutual funds/index funds/venture capital\nfunds/private equity funds/investment companies in the capital instruments of the finan-\ncial entities is known; the indirect investment of the bank in such entities would be equal\nto bank\u2019s investments in these entities multiplied by the per cent of investments of such\nentities in the financial entities\u2019 capital instruments.\n\n(ii) If the amount of investments made by the mutual funds/index funds/venture capital\nfunds/private equity funds/investment companies in the capital instruments of the invest-\ning bank is not known but, as per the investment policies/mandate of these entities such\ninvestments are permissible; the indirect investment would be equal to bank\u2019s invest-\nments in these entities multiplied by maximum permissible limit which these entities are\nauthorized to invest in the financial entities\u2019 capital instruments.\n\n(iii) If neither the amount of investments made by the mutual funds/index funds/venture\ncapital funds/private equity funds in the capital instruments of financial entities nor the\nmaximum amount which these entities can invest in financial entities are known but, as\nper the investment policies/mandate of these entities such investments are permissible;\nthe entire investment of the bank in these entities would be treated as indirect investment\nin financial entities. Banks must note that this method does not follow corresponding\ndeduction approach i.e., all deductions will be made from the Common Equity Tier 1\ncapital even though, the investments of such entities are in the Additional Tier 1/Tier 2\ncapital of the investing banks.\n\nTransitional Arrangements _ In order to ensure smooth migration to Basel III without aggravating any\nnear term stress, appropriate transitional arrangements have been made. The transitional arrangements\nfor capital ratios begin as on April 1, 2013. Capital ratios and deductions from Common Equity will be\nfully phased-in and implemented as on March 31, 2019. The phase-in arrangements for banks operating\nin India are indicated in Table 13.1.\n",

In case, it is not found feasible to compute\nCRAR on such notional basis, the risk weight of 350 or 625 per cent, as per the risk percep-\ntion of the investing bank, should be applied uniformly to the investing bank\u2019s entire expo-\n\nsure.\n\n6.2 The claims on foreign banks will be risk weighted as under as per the ratings assigned by\n\ninternational rating agencies.\n\nitch ratings\n\nRisk weight (%) 20\n\nBBB BBtoB BelowB Unrated\nBaa BatoB BelowB Unrated\n50 100 150 50\n\nThe exposures of the Indian branches of foreign banks, guaranteed/counter-guaranteed by the overseas\nHead offices or the bank\u2019s branch in another country would amount to a claim on the parent foreign bank\nand would also attract the risk weights as per Table 13.5 above.\n\n6.3 However, the claims on a bank which are denominated in \u2018domestic 36\u2019 foreign currency met\nout of the resources in the same currency raised in that jurisdiction will be risk weighted at 20\nper cent provided the bank complies with the minimum CRAR prescribed by the concerned\nbank regulator (s).\n\n6.4 However, in case a Host Supervisor requires a more conservative treatment for such claims\nin the books of the foreign branches of the Indian banks, they should adopt the requirements\nprescribed by the Host supervisor for computing capital adequacy.\n\n7.

As part of the supervisory review\nprocess, the Reserve Bank would also consider whether the credit quality of unrated corpo-\nrate claims held by individual banks should warrant a standard risk weight higher than 100\nper cent.\n\n8.3 With a view to reflecting a higher element of inherent risk which may be latent in entities\nwhose obligations have been subjected to re-structuring/re-scheduling either by banks on\ntheir own or along with other bankers/creditors, the unrated standard/performing claims on\nthese entities should be assigned a higher risk weight until satisfactory performance under\n\nthe revised payment schedule has been established for one year from the date when the first\npayment of interest/principal falls due under the revised schedule. The applicable risk weights\nwill be 125 per cent.\n\n8.4 The claims on non-resident corporates will be risk weighted as under as per the ratings\nassigned by international rating agencies.\n\nTABLE 13.

Claims included in the Regulatory Retail Portfolios\n9.1 Claims (including both fund-based and non-fund based) that meet all the four criteria listed\nbelow in paragraph 5.9.3 may be considered as retail claims for regulatory capital pur-\nposes and included in a regulatory retail portfolio. Claims included in this portfolio shall be\nassigned a risk-weight of 75 per cent, except as provided in paragraph 5.12 below for non-\nperforming assets.\n9.2 The following claims, both fund based and non-fund based, shall be excluded from the regu-\nlatory retail portfolio:\n(a) Exposures by way of investments in securities (such as bonds and equities), whether\nlisted or not;\n(b) Mortgage Loans to the extent that they qualify for treatment as claims secured by resi-\ndential property or claims secured by commercial real estate;\n(c) Loans and Advances to bank\u2019s own staff which are fully covered by superannuation ben-\nefits and/or mortgage of flat/ house;\n(d) Consumer Credit, including Personal Loans and credit card receivables;\n(c) Capital Market Exposures;\n(0) Venture Capital Funds\n\n10. Claims secured by Residential Property\n\n10.1 Lending to individuals meant for acquiring residential property which are fully secured by\nmortgages on the residential property that is or will be occupied by the borrower, or that\nis rented, shall be risk weighted as indicated as per Table 13.7(A) below, based on Board\napproved valuation policy. LTV ratio should be computed as a percentage with total out-\nstanding in the account (viz. \u2018principal + accrued interest + other charges pertaining to the\nloan\u2019 without any netting) in the numerator and the realisable value of the residential prop-\nerty mortgaged to the bank in the denominator.\n\nTABLE 13.7(A) Claims Secured by Residential Property \u2014 Risk Weights\nCategory of Loan LTV Ratio (%) Risk Weight (%)\n(a) Individual Housing Loans\n(i) Up to 220 lakh 90 50\n(ii) Above 220 lakh and up to 275 lakh 80 50\n(iil) Above 875 lakh 75 75\n(b) Commercial Real Estate \u2014 Residential Hous- NA 75\ning (CRE-RH)\n(c) Commercial Real Estate (CRE) NA 100\n\n10.2 Alll other claims secured by residential property would attract the higher of the risk weight\napplicable to the counterparty or to the purpose for which the bank has extended finance.\n\n10.3 Restructured housing loans should be risk weighted with an additional risk weight of 25 per\ncent to the risk weights prescribed above.\n\n10.4 Loans/exposures to intermediaries for on-lending will not be eligible for inclusion under\nclaims secured by residential property but will be treated as claims on corporates or claims\nincluded in the regulatory retail portfolio as the case may be.\n\n10.5 Investments in mortgage backed securities (MBS) backed by exposures as at paragraph\n\n10.6 Above will be governed by the guidelines pertaining to securitization exposures.\n\n11. Non-Performing Assets (NPAs)\n\n11.1 The unsecured portion of NPA (other than a qualifying residential mortgage loan, net of\nspecific provisions (including partial write-offs), will be risk-weighted as follows:\n\n(i) 150 per cent risk weight when specific provisions are less than 20 per cent of the out-\nstanding amount of the NPA;\n(ii) 100 per cent risk weight when specific provisions are at least 20 per cent of the outstand-\ning amount of the NPA;\n(iii) 50 per cent risk weight when specific provisions are at least 50 per cent of the outstand-\ning amount of the NPA\n\n11.2 For the purpose of computing the level of specific provisions in NPAs for deciding the risk-\nweighting, all funded NPA exposures of a single counterparty (without netting the value of\nthe eligible collateral) should be reckoned in the denominator.\n\n11.3 For the purpose of defining the secured portion of the NPA, eligible collateral will be the\nsame as recognized for credit risk mitigation purposes. Hence, other forms of collateral like\nland, buildings, plant, machinery, current assets, etc. will not be reckoned while computing\nthe secured portion of NPAs for capital adequacy purposes.\n\n11.4 In addition to the above, where a NPA is fully secured by the following forms of collateral\nthat are not recognized for credit risk mitigation purposes, either independently or along\nwith other eligible collateral a 100 per cent risk weight may apply, net of specific provisions,\nwhen provisions reach 15 per cent of the outstanding amount:\n\n(i) Land and building which are valued by an expert valuer and where the valuation is not\nmore than three years old, and\n\n(ii) Plant and machinery in good working condition at a value not higher than the depreci-\nated value as reflected in the audited balance sheet of the borrower, which is not older\nthan eighteen months.\n\n11.5 The above collaterals (mentioned in paragraph 1 1.4) will be recognized only where the bank is\nhaving clear title to realize the sale proceeds thereof and can appropriate the same towards the\namounts due to the bank. The bank\u2019s title to the collateral should be well documented. These\nforms of collaterals are not recognized anywhere else under the standardized approach.\n\n11.6 Claims secured by residential property, as defined in paragraph 5.10.1, which are NPA will\nbe risk weighted at 100 per cent net of specific provisions. If the specific provisions in such\nloans are at least 20 per cent but less than 50 per cent of the outstanding amount, the risk\nweight applicable to the loan net of specific provisions will be 75 per cent. If the specific\nprovisions are 50 per cent or more the applicable risk weight will be 50 per cent.\n\n12. Specified Categories\n\n12.1 Fund based and non-fund based claims on Venture Capital Funds, which are considered as\nhigh risk exposures, will attract a higher risk weight of 150 per cent.\n\n12.2 Reserve Bank may, in due course, decide to apply a 150 per cent or higher risk weight\nreflecting the higher risks associated with any other claim that may be identified as a high\nrisk exposure.\n\n12.3 Consumer credit, including personal loans and credit card receivables but excluding educa-\ntional loans, will attract a higher risk weight of 125 per cent or higher, if warranted by the\nexternal rating (or, the lack of it) of the counterparty. As gold and gold jewellery are eligible\nfinancial collateral, the counterparty exposure in respect of personal loans secured by gold\nand gold jewellery will be worked out under the comprehensive approach .The \u2018exposure\nvalue after risk mitigation\u2019 shall attract the risk weight of 125 per cent.\n\n12.4 Advances classified as \u2018Capital market exposures\u2019 will attract a 125 per cent risk weight or\nrisk weight warranted by external rating (or lack of it) of the counterparty, whichever is higher.\nThese risk weights will also be applicable to all banking book exposures, which are exempted\nfrom capital market exposure ceilings for direct investments/total capital market exposures.\n\n13.\n\n14.\n\n12.5\n\nThe exposure to capital instruments issued by NBFCs which are not deducted and are\nrequired to be risk weighted would be risk weighted at 125 per cent or as per the external\nratings, whichever is higher. The exposure to equity instruments issued by NBFCs which are\nnot deducted and are required to be risk weighted at 250 per cent. The claims (other than\nin the form of capital instruments of investee companies) on rated as well as unrated \u201cNon-\ndeposit Taking Systemically Important Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFC-ND-SI),\nother than AFCs, NBFC-IFCs and NBFC-IDF, regardless of the amount of claim, shall be\nuniformly risk weighted at 100 per cent (for risk weighting claims on AFCs, NBFC-IFC and\nNBFC-IDF.\n\n12.6 All investments in the paid-up equity of non-financial entities (other than subsidiaries)\n\n12.7\n\n12.8\n\nwhich exceed 10 per cent of the issued common share capital of the issuing entity or where\nthe entity is an unconsolidated affiliate as defined in paragraph 4.4.9.2(C)(i) will receive\na risk weight of 1111 per cent. Equity investments equal to or below 10 per cent paid-up\nequity of such investee companies shall be assigned a 125 per cent risk weight or the risk\nweight as warranted by rating or lack of it, whichever higher.\n\nThe exposure to capital instruments issued by financial entities (other than banks and NBFCs)\nwhich are not deducted and are required to be risk weighted would be risk weighted at 125\nper cent or as per the external ratings whichever is higher. The exposure to equity instru-\nments issued by financial entities (other than banks and NBFCs) which are not deducted and\nare required to be risk weighted would be risk weighted at 250 per cent.\n\nBank's investments in the non-equity capital eligible instruments of other banks should be\nrisk weighted.\n\nOther Assets\n\n13.1\n\n13.2\n\n13.3\n\n13.4\n\nLoans and advances to bank\u2019s own staff which are fully covered by superannuation benefits\nand/or mortgage of flat/ house will attract a 20 per cent risk weight. Since flat/house is not\nan eligible collateral and since banks normally recover the dues by adjusting the superannu-\nation benefits only at the time of cessation from service, the concessional risk weight shall\nbe applied without any adjustment of the outstanding amount. In case a bank is holding\neligible collateral in respect of amounts due from a staff member, the outstanding amount in\nrespect of that staff member may be adjusted to the extent permissible.\n\nOther loans and advances to bank\u2019s own staff will be eligible for inclusion under regulatory\nretail portfolio and will therefore attract a 75 per cent risk weight.\n\nThe deposits kept by banks with the CCPs will attract risk weights appropriate to the nature of\nthe CCPs. In the case of Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL), the risk weight will\nbe 20 per cent and for other CCPs, it will be according to the ratings assigned to these entities.\nAll other assets will attract a uniform risk weight of 100 per cent.\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Items\n\n14.1\n\n14.2\n\nGeneral\n\n(i) The total risk weighted off-balance sheet credit exposure is calculated as the sum of the\nrisk-weighted amount of the market related and non-market related off-balance sheet\nitems. The risk-weighted amount of an off-balance sheet item that gives rise to credit\nexposure is generally calculated by means of a two-step process:\n\n(a) The notional amount of the transaction is converted into a credit equivalent amount,\nby multiplying the amount by the specified credit conversion factor or by applying\nthe current exposure method; and\n\n(b) The resulting credit equivalent amount is multiplied by the risk weight applicable to\nthe counterparty or to the purpose for which the bank has extended finance or the\ntype of asset, whichever is higher.\n\n(ii) Where the off-balance sheet item is secured by eligible collateral or guarantee, the credit\nrisk mitigation guidelines may be applied.\n\nNon-market-related Off Balance Sheet Items\n(i) The credit equivalent amount in relation to a non-market related off-balance sheet item like,\ndirect credit substitutes, trade and performance related contingent items and commitments\nwith certain drawdown, other commitments, etc. will be determined by multiplying the con-\ntracted amount of that particular transaction by the relevant credit conversion factor (CCF).\n\n(ii) Where the non-market related off-balance sheet item is an undrawn or partially\nundrawn fund-based facility 46, the amount of undrawn commitment to be included in\ncalculating the off-balance sheet non-market related credit exposures is the maximum\nunused portion of the commitment that could be drawn during the remaining period to\nmaturity. Any drawn portion of a commitment forms a part of bank\u2019s on-balance sheet\ncredit exposure,\n\n(iii) In the case of irrevocable commitments to provide off-balance sheet facilities, the origi-\nnal maturity will be measured from the commencement of the commitment until the time\nthe associated facility expires. For example an irrevocable commitment with an original\nmaturity of 12 months, to issue a 6 month documentary letter of credit, is deemed to have\nan original maturity of 18 months. Irrevocable commitments to provide off-balance sheet\nfacilities should be assigned the lower of the two applicable credit conversion factors.\nFor example, an irrevocable commitment with an original maturity of 15 months (50 per\ncent - CCF) to issue a six month documentary letter of credit (20 per cent - CCF) would\nattract the lower of the CCF i.e., the CCF to the documentary letter of credit viz. 20 per\ncent.\n\n(iv) The credit conversion factors for non-market related off-balance sheet transactions are\nas under:\n\nTABLE 1 Credit Conversio:\nCredit Conversion\nSI. No. Instruments Factor (Per Cent)\n1. Direct credit substitutes e.g. general guarantees of indebtedness (including standby L/ 100\n\nCs serving as financial guarantees for loans and securities, credit enhancements, liquid-\nity facilities for securitization transactions), and acceptances (including endorsements\nwith the character of acceptance).\n\n(.e., the risk of loss depends on the credit worthiness of the counterparty or the party\nagainst whom a potential claim is acquired)\n\n2. Certain transaction-related contingent items (e.g., performance bonds, bid bonds, war- 50\nranties, indemnities and standby letters of credit related to particular transaction).\n3. Short-term self-liquidating trade letters of credit arising from the movement of goods 20\n\n(eg., documentary credits collateralized by the underlying shipment) for both issuing\nbank and confirming bank.\n\n4. Sale and repurchase agreement and asset sales with recourse, where the credit risk 100\nremains with the bank.\n(These items are to be risk weighted according to the type of asset and not according\nto the type of counterparty with whom the transaction has been entered into.)\n\n5. Forward asset purchases, forward deposits and partly paid shares and securities, which 100\nrepresent commitments with certain drawdown.\n(These items are to be risk weighted according to the type of asset and not according to\nthe type of counterparty with whom the transaction has been entered into.)\n\n6. Lending of banks\u2019 securities or posting of securities as collateral by banks, including 100\ninstances where these arise out of repo style transactions (i.\u00a2., repurchase/reverse\nrepurchase and securities lending/securities borrowing transactions)\n\n7. Note issuance facilities and revolving/non-revolving underwriting facilities. 50\n8. Commitments with certain drawdown 100\n9. Other commitments (e.g., formal standby facilities and credit lines) with an original 20\nmaturity of\na) up to one year 50\nb) over one year 0\nSimilar commitments that are unconditionally cancellable at any time by the bank without\nprior notice or that effectively provide for automatic cancellation due to deterioration in a\nborrower's credit worthiness\n10. Take-out Finance in the books of taking-over institution\n10} Unconditional take-out finance 100\n\n(ii) Conditional take-out finance 50\n\n(v) In regard to non-market related off-balance sheet items, the following transactions with\nnon-bank counterparties will be treated as claims on banks:\n\n+ Guarantees issued by banks against the counter guarantees of other banks.\n\n+ Rediscounting of documentary bills discounted by other banks and bills discounted\nby banks which have been accepted by another bank will be treated as a funded claim\non a bank.\n\nIn all the above cases banks should be fully satisfied that the risk exposure is in fact on\n\nthe other bank. If they are satisfied that the exposure is on the other bank they may assign\n\nthese exposures the risk weight applicable to banks.\n\n(vi) Issue of Irrevocable Payment Commitment by banks to various Stock Exchanges on\nbehalf of Mutual Funds and Fills is a financial guarantee with a Credit Conversion Fac-\ntor (CCF) of 100. However, capital will have to be maintained only on exposure which\nis reckoned as CME, i.e., 50 per cent of the amount, because the rest of the exposure is\ndeemed to have been covered by cash/securities which are admissible risk mitigants as\nper capital adequacy framework. Thus, capital is to be maintained on the amount taken\nfor CME and the risk weight would be 125 per cent thereon.\n\n(vii) For classification of banks guarantees viz. direct credit substitutes and transaction-related\ncontingent items etc. the following principles should be kept in view for the application\nof CCFs:\n\n(a) Financial guarantees are direct credit substitutes wherein a bank irrevocably under-\ntakes to guarantee the repayment of a contractual financial obligation. Financial guar-\nantees essentially carry the same credit risk as a direct extension of credit i.e., the risk\nof loss is directly linked to the creditworthiness of the counterparty against whom a\npotential claim is acquired. An indicative list of financial guarantees, attracting a CCF\n\u2018of 100 per cent is as under:\n\nGuarantees for credit facilities;\nGuarantees in lieu of repayment of financial securities;\nGuarantees in lieu of margin requirements of exchanges;\nGuarantees for mobilization advance, advance money before the commencement\nof a project and for money to be received in various stages of project implemen-\ntation;\nGuarantees towards revenue dues, taxes, duties, levies etc. in favour of Tax/\nCustoms/Port/Excise Authorities and for disputed liabilities for litigation pend-\ning at courts;\n\n* Credit Enhancements;\n\n+ Liquidity facilities for securitization transactions;\n\n+ Acceptances (including endorsements with the character of acceptance);\n\n+ Deferred payment guarantees.\n\n(b) Performance guarantees are essentially transaction-related contingencies that involve\nan irrevocable undertaking to pay a third party in the event the counterparty fails to\nfulfil or perform a contractual non-financial obligation. In such transactions, the risk of\nloss depends on the event which need not necessarily be related to the creditworthiness\nof the counterparty involved. An indicative list of performance guarantees, attracting\na CCF of 50 per cent is as under:\n\n+ Bid bonds;\n+ Performance bonds and export performance guarantees;\n+ Guarantees in lieu of security deposits/earnest money deposits (EMD) for partici-\npating in tenders;\n+ Retention money guarantees;\n+ Warranties, indemnities and standby letters of credit related to particular transaction.\n14.3 Treatment of Total Counterparty Credit Risk\n14.3.1 The total capital charge for counterparty credit risk will cover the default risk as well\nas credit migration risk of the counterparty reflected in mark-to-market losses on the\nexpected counterparty risk (such losses being known as credit value adjustments, CVA).\nCounterparty risk may arise in the context of OTC derivatives and Securities Financing\nTransactions. Such instruments generally exhibit the following abstract characteristics:\n+ The transactions generate a current exposure or market value.\n\nThe transactions have an associated random future market value based on mar-\nket variables.\n\nThe transactions generate an exchange of payments or an exchange of a finan-\ncial instrument against payment.\n\nCollateral may be used to mitigate risk exposure and is inherent in the nature of\nsome transactions.\n\nShort-term financing may be a primary objective in that the transactions mostly\nconsist of an exchange of one asset for another (cash or securities) for a rela-\ntively short period of time, usually for the business purpose of financing. The\ntwo sides of the transactions are not the result of separate decisions but form an\nindivisible whole to accomplish a defined objective.\n\nNetting may be used to mitigate the risk.\n\nPositions are frequently valued (most commonly on a daily basis), according to\nmarket variables.\n\n+ Remargining may be employed.\n\nThe \u2018capital charge for default risk\u2019 will be calculated using Current Exposure\nMethod as explained in paragraph 14.3.5 The \u2018capital charge for CVA risk\u2019 will be\ncalculated as explained in paragraph 14.3.6. The Current Exposure method is appli-\ncable only to OTC derivatives.\n\n14.3.2 Exemption from capital requirements for counterparty risk is permitted for foreign\nexchange (except gold) contracts which have an original maturity of 14 calendar\ndays or less.\n\n14.3.3 Definitions and general terminology\n\nCounterparty Credit Risk (CCR) is the risk that the counterparty to a transac-\ntion could default before the final settlement of the transaction\u2019s cash flows. An\neconomic loss would occur if the transactions or portfolio of transactions with\nthe counterparty has a positive economic value at the time of default. Unlike a\nfirm\u2019s exposure to credit risk through a loan, where the exposure to credit risk is\nunilateral and only the lending bank faces the risk of loss, CCR creates a bilateral\nrisk of loss: the market value of the transaction can be positive or negative to either\ncounterparty to the transaction. The market value is uncertain and can vary over\ntime with the movement of underlying market factors.\n\nSecurities Financing Transactions (SFTs) are transactions such as repurchase\nagreements, reverse repurchase agreements, security lending and borrowing, col-\nlateralized borrowing and lending (CBLO) and margin lending transactions, where\nthe value of the transactions depends on market valuations and the transactions are\noften subject to margin agreements.\n\nHedging Set is a group of risk positions from the transactions within a single netting\nset for which only their balance is relevant for determining the exposure amount or\nEAD under the CCR standardized method.\n\nCurrent Exposure is the larger of zero, or the market value of a transaction or port-\nfolio of transactions within a netting set with a counterparty that would be lost upon\nthe default of the counterparty, assuming no recovery on the value of those transac-\ntions in bankruptcy. Current exposure is often also called Replacement Cost.\n\nCredit Valuation Adjustment is an adjustment to the mid-market valuation of the\nportfolio of trades with a counterparty. This adjustment reflects the market value of\nthe credit risk due to any failure to perform on contractual agreements with a coun-\nterparty. This adjustment may reflect the market value of the credit risk of the coun-\nterparty or the market value of the credit risk of both the bank and the counterparty.\n\nOne-Sided Credit Valuation Adjustment is a credit valuation adjustment that\nreflects the market value of the credit risk of the counterparty to the firm, but does\nnot reflect the market value of the credit risk of the bank to the counterparty.\n\n14.3.4 Treatment of Exposure to Central Counterparties\n\nPresently, treatment of exposures to Central Counterparties for the purpose of capital\n\nadequacy is as under:\n\n(i) The exposures on account of derivatives trading and securities financing transac-\ntions (\u00a2.g., Collateralized Borrowing and Lending Obligations - CBLOs, Repos)\nto Central Counter Parties (CCPs) including those attached to stock exchanges for\nsettlement of exchange traded derivatives, will be assigned zero exposure value for\ncounterparty credit risk, as it is presumed that the CCPs\u2019 exposures to their counter-\nparties are fully collateralized on a daily basis, thereby providing protection for the\nCCP\u2019s credit risk exposures.\n\n(ii) A CCF of 100 per cent will be applied to the banks securities posted as collaterals\nwith CCPs and the resultant off-balance sheet exposure will be assigned risk weights\nappropriate to the nature of the CCPs. In the case of Clearing Corporation of India\nLimited (CCIL), the risk weight will be 20 per cent and for other CCPs, it will be\naccording to the ratings assigned to these entities.\n\n(iii) The deposits kept by banks with the CCPs will attract risk weights appropriate to the\nnature of the CCPs. In the case of Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL),\nthe risk weight will be 20 per cent and for other CCPs, it will be according to the\nratings assigned to these entities.\n\nWhen entering into bilateral OTC derivative transactions, banks are required to hold\n\ncapital to protect against the risk that the counterparty defaults and for credit valuation\n\nadjustment (CVA) risk. The CVA charge is introduced as part of the Basel III framework\nas explained in paragraphs 14.3.5 and 14.3.6 below.\n\n14.3.5 Default Risk Capital Charge for CCR\nThe exposure amount for the purpose of computing for default risk capital charge for\ncounterparty credit risk will be calculated using the Current Exposure Method (CEM)\ndescribed as under:\n\n(i) The credit equivalent amount of a market related off-balance sheet transaction cal-\nculated using the current exposure method is the sum of current credit exposure and\npotential future credit exposure of these contracts. For this purpose, credit equiva-\nlent amount will be adjusted for legally valid eligible financial collaterals in accord-\nance with Credit Risk Mitigation Techniques Collateralized Transactions and the\nprovisions held by the bank for CVA losses.\n\n(ii) The CVA loss will be calculated as a prudent valuation adjustment as per prudent\nvaluation guidance without taking into account any offsetting debit valuation adjust-\nments (DVA) which have been deducted from capital. The CVA loss deducted from\nexposures to determine outstanding EAD is the CVA loss gross of all DVA which\nhave been separately deducted from capital. To the extent DVA has not been sepa-\nrately deducted from a bank\u2019s capital, the CVA loss used to determine outstanding\nEAD will be net of such DVA. Risk Weighted Assets for a given OTC derivative\ncounterparty may be calculated as the applicable risk weight under the Standard-\nized or IRB approach multiplied by the outstanding EAD of the counterparty. This\nreduction of EAD by CVA losses does not apply to the determination of the CVA\nrisk capital charge as per formula given in Paragraph14.3.6 (ii).\n\n(iii) While computing the credit exposure banks may exclude \u2018sold options\u2019, provided\nthe entire premium/fee or any other form of income is received/realized.\n\n(iv) Current credit exposure is defined as the sum of the positive mark-to-market value\nof these contracts. The Current Exposure Method requires periodical calculation of\nthe current credit exposure by marking these contracts to market, thus capturing the\ncurrent credit exposure.\n\n(v) Potential future credit exposure is determined by multiplying the notional principal\namount of each of these contracts irrespective of whether the contract has a zero,\npositive or negative mark-to-market value by the relevant add-on factor indicated\nbelow according to the nature and residual maturity of the instrument.\n\n(vi) For contracts with multiple exchanges of principal, the add-on factors are to be\n\nmultiplied by the number of remaining payments in the contract.\n\nTABLE 13. Credit Conversion Factors for Market-Related Off-Balance Sheet Items\n\nCredit Conversion Factors (%)\nInterest Rate Contracts Exchange Rate Contracts and Gold\n\u2018One year or less 0.50 2.00\nOver one year to five years 1.00 10.00\nOver five years 3.00 15.00\n\n(vii) For contracts that are structured to settle outstanding exposure following speci-\nfied payment dates and where the terms are reset such that the market value of the\ncontract is zero on these specified dates, the residual maturity would be set equal\nto the time until the next reset date. However, in the case of interest rate contracts\nwhich have residual maturities of more than one year and meet the above criteria,\nthe CCF or add-on factor is subject to a floor of 1.0 per cent.\n\n(viii) No potential future credit exposure would be calculated for single currency float-\ning/floating interest rate swaps; the credit exposure on these contracts would be\nevaluated solely on the basis of their mark-to-market value.\n\n(ix) Potential future exposures should be based on \u2018effective\u2019 rather than \u2018apparent\nnotional amounts\u2019. In the event that the \u2018stated notional amount\u2019 is leveraged or\nenhanced by the structure of the transaction, banks must use the \u2018effective notional\namount\u2019 when determining potential future exposure. For example, a stated notional\namount of USD 1 million with payments based on an internal rate of two times the\nBPLR/Base Rate would have an effective notional amount of USD 2 million.\n\n14.3.6 Capitalization of mark-to-market counterparty risk losses (CVA capital charge)\n(i) In addition to the default risk capital requirement for counterparty credit risk,\nbanks are also required to compute an additional capital charge to cover the risk of\nmark-to-market losses on the expected counterparty risk (such losses being known\nas credit value adjustments, CVA) to OTC derivatives. The CVA capital charge will\nbe calculated in the manner indicated below in para (ii). Banks are not required to\ninclude in this capital charge (a) transactions with a central counterparty (CCP);\nand (b) securities financing transactions (ii) Banks should use the following for-\nmula to calculate a portfolio capital charge for CVA risk for their counterparties:\n\nK= 233i Dasma ean = MB) WM aa} +0.75 0?

The bank must map indices to one of the seven weights\nW, based on the average spread of index \u2018ind\u2019.\n\nM.is the effective maturity of the transactions with counterparty \u2018i\u2019, M, is the notional weighted aver-\nage maturity of all the contracts with counterparty \u2018i\u2019.\n\nM,\u2018\u201c** is the maturity of the hedge instrument with notional B, (the quantities M,\u201c* B, are to be\nsummed it these are several positions).\n\nMis the maturity of the index hedge \u2018ind\u2019. In case of more than one index hedge position, it is the\nnotional weighted average maturity.\n\n\nFor any counterparty that is also a constituent of an index on which a CDS is used for hedging counter-\nparty credit risk, the notional amount attributable to that single name\n\n+ The weights are given in the Table below, which are based on the external rating of the counterparty:\n\nWeights (W)\nRating W,\nAAA 0.7%\nAA 0.7%\nA 0.8%\nBBB 1.0%\nBB 2.0%\nB and unrated 3.0%\nccc 10.0%\n\n+ In cases where the unrated counterparty is a scheduled commercial bank, banks may use the follow-\ning Table to arrive at the implied ratings of the counterparty-bank and consequently, the W,\n\nApplicable Risk weight of the\nCounterparty-bank according to\n\nTable 13.4 of paragraph 5.6 Implied Ratings w,\n20 AAAIAA 0.7%\n50 A 0.8%\n\n100 BBB 1%\n\n150 BB 2%\n\n625 ccc 10%\n\n* Banks will have to continuously monitor the capital adequacy position of their counterparty banks\nso that the effect of any change in the implied ratings is adequately reflected in CVA capital charge\ncalculations.\n\n15.1 Risk Weighted Securitization Exposures:\n\n(i) Banks shall calculate the risk weighted amount of an on-balance sheet securitization\nexposure by multiplying the principal amount (after deduction of specific provisions) of\nthe exposures by the applicable risk weight.\n\n(ii) The risk-weighted asset amount of a securitization exposure is computed by multiply-\ning the amount of the exposure by the appropriate risk weight determined in accordance\nwith issue specific rating assigned to those exposures by the chosen external credit rating\nagencies as indicated in the following tables:\n\nor unrated\nRisk weight for banks other 20 30 50 100 350 1111\nthan originators (%)\nRisk weight for originator (%) 20 30 50 100 4111\n\n(iii) The risk-weighted asset amount of a securitization exposure in respect of MBS backed\nby commercial real estate exposure, as defined above, is computed by multiplying the\namount of the exposure by the appropriate risk weight determined in accordance with\nissue specific rating assigned to those exposures by the chosen external credit rating\nagencies as indicated in the following tables.\n\n(iv) Banks are not permitted to invest in unrated securities issued by an SPV as a part of the\nsecuritization transaction. However, securitization exposures assumed by banks which\nmay become unrated or may be deemed to be unrated, would be treated for capital ade-\nquacy purposes.\n\nCommercial Real Estate Securi jon Exposures \u2014 Risk Wi\n\nMapping to Long-term Ratings\n\nDomestic Rating Agencies AAA AA A BBB BB B and below or\nunrated\n\nRisk weight for banks other 100 100 100 150 400 1111\n\nthan originators (%)\n\nRisk weight for originator (%) 100 100 100 150 4111\n\n(v) There should be transfer of a significant credit risk associated with the securitized expo-\nsures to the third parties for recognition of risk transfer. In view of this, the total exposure\nof banks to the loans securitized in the following forms should not exceed 20 per cent of\nthe total securitized instruments issued:\n\n+ Investments in equity/subordinate/senior tranches of securities issued by the SPV\nincluding through underwriting commitments\n\n+ Credit enhancements including cash and other forms of collaterals including over-col-\nlateralization, but excluding the credit enhancing interest only strip\n\n+ Liquidity support.\n\nIfa bank exceeds the above limit, the excess amount would be risk weighted at 1111 per\n\ncent. Credit exposure on account of interest rate swaps/ currency swaps entered into with\n\nthe SPV will be excluded from the limit of 20 per cent as this would not be within the\n\ncontrol of the bank.\n\n(vi) If an originating bank fails to meet the requirement laid down, it will have to maintain\ncapital for the securitized assets/ assets sold as if these were not securitized/ sold. This\ncapital would be in addition to the capital which the bank is required to maintain on its\nother existing exposures to the securitization transaction.\n\n(vii) The investing banks will assign a risk weight of 1111 per cent to the exposures relating\nto securitization/ or assignment if the requirements are not met. The higher risk weight\nof 1111 per cent is applicable with effect from October 01, 2012.\n\nji) Under the transactions involving transfer of assets through direct assignment of cash\nflows and the underlying securities, the capital adequacy treatment for direct purchase\nof corporate loans will be as per the rules applicable to corporate loans directly origi-\nnated by the banks. Similarly, the capital adequacy treatment for direct purchase of retail\nloans, will be as per the rules applicable to retail portfolios directly originated by banks\nexcept in cases where the individual accounts have been classified as NPA, in which\ncase usual capital adequacy norms as applicable to retail NPAs will apply. No benefit\nin terms of reduced risk weights will be available to purchased retail loans portfolios\nbased on rating because this is not envisaged under the Basel II Standardized Approach\nfor credit risk.\n\n15.2 Off-Balance Sheet Securitization Exposures:\n\n(i) Banks shall calculate the risk weighted amount of a rated off-balance sheet securitization\nexposure by multiplying the credit equivalent amount of the exposure by the applicable\nrisk weight. The credit equivalent amount should be arrived at by multiplying the prin-\ncipal amount of the exposure (after deduction of specific provisions) with a 100 per cent\nCCF, unless otherwise specified.\n\n(ii) If the off-balance sheet exposure is not rated, it must be deducted from capital, except an\n\nunrated eligible liquidity facility.\n15.3 Recognition of Credit Risk Mitigants (CRMs):\n\n(i) The treatment below applies to a bank that has obtained a credit risk mitigant on a secu-\nritization exposure. Credit risk mitigant include guarantees and eligible collateral as spec-\nified in these guidelines. Collateral in this context refers to that used to hedge the credit\nrisk of a securitization exposure rather than for hedging the credit risk of the underlying\nexposures of the securitization transaction.\n\n(ii) When a bank other than the originator provides credit protection to a securitization expo-\nsure, it must calculate a capital requirement on the covered exposure as if it were an inves-\ntor in that securitization. If a bank provides protection to an unrated credit enhancement,\n\nit must treat the credit protection provided as if it were directly holding the unrated credit\nenhancement.\n\n15.4 Re-Securitization Exposures/Synthetic Securitizations/Securitization with Revolving\nStructures (with or without early amortization features)\n\nAt present, banks in India including their overseas branches, are not permitted to assume\nexposures relating to re-securitization/Synthetic Securitizations/ Securitizations with Revolv-\ning Structures (with or without early amortization features). Some of these exposures may\nbe in the nature of re-securitization. For such exposures, the risk weights would be assigned\nas under:\n\nTABLE 13.11 Re-securitization Exposures \u2014 Risk Weight Mapping to Long-Term Ratings\n\nB and Below or\nDomestic Rating Agencies AAA AA A BBB BB Unrated\nRisk weight for banks other 40 60 100 200 650 1111\nthan originators (%)\nRisk weight for originator (%) 40 60 100 200 1111\n\nTABLE 13.11(A) Commercial Real Estate Re-Securitization Exposures \u2014 Risk Weight\n\nMapping to Long-Term Ratings\n\nDomestic Rating Agencies AAA AA A BBB BB and Below or\nUnrated\n\nRisk weight for banks other than 200 200 200 400 1111\n\noriginators (%)\n\nRisk weight for originator (%) 200 200 200 400 4111\n\n16. External Credit Assessments\n\n16.1 Eligible Credit Rating Agencies\n16.1.1 In accordance with the principles laid down in the Revised Framework, the Reserve\nBank of India has decided that banks may use the ratings of the following domes-\ntic credit rating agencies (arranged in alphabetical order) for the purposes of risk\nweighting their claims for capital adequacy purposes:\n\n(a) Brickwork Ratings India Pvt. Limited (Brickwork);\n\n(b) Credit Analysis and Research Limited;\n\n(c) CRISIL Limited;\n\n(d) ICRA Limited;\n\n(ec) India Ratings and Research Private Limited (India Ratings); and\n(f) SME Rating Agency of India Ltd. (SMERA)\n\n16.1.2. The Reserve Bank of India has decided that banks may use the ratings of the fol-\nlowing international credit rating agencies (arranged in alphabetical order) for\nthe purposes of risk weighting their claims for capital adequacy purposes where\nspecified:\n\na. Fitch;\n\nb. Moody\u2019s; and\nc. Standard & Poor's\n\n16.2 Long Term Ratings\n16.2.1 On the basis of the above factors as well as the data made available by the rating\nagencies, the ratings issued by the chosen domestic credit rating agencies have been\nmapped to the appropriate risk weights applicable as per the Standardized approach\nunder the Revised Framework. The rating-risk weight mapping furnished in the\nTable 13.12 below shall be adopted by all banks in India:\n16.2.2 Where \u2018+\u2019 or \u2018~\u201d notation is attached to the rating, the corresponding main rating\ncategory risk weight should be used. For example, A + or A \u2014 would be considered\nto be in the A rating category and assigned 50 per cent risk weight.\n",

This in turn would require a well-defined internal assessment process within\nbanks through which they assure the RBI that adequate capital is indeed held towards the various risks to\nwhich they are exposed. The process of assurance could also involve an active dialogue between the bank\nand the RBI so that, when warranted, appropriate intervention could be made to either reduce the risk\nexposure of the bank or augment/restore its capital. Thus, Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process\n(ICAAP) is an important component of the SRP. The main aspects to be addressed under the SRP, and\ntherefore, under the ICAAP, would include:\n\n(a) The risks that are not fully captured by the minimum capital ratio prescribed under Pillar 1;\n(b) The risks that are not at all taken into account by the Pillar 1; and\n(c) The factors external to the bank.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Guidelines for the SREP of the RBI and the ICAAP of Banks\nBackground\nThe Basel capital adequacy framework rests on the following three mutually-reinforcing pillars:\n\nPillar 1: Minimum Capital Requirements\u2014which prescribes a risk-sensitive calculation of capi-\ntal requirements that, for the first time, explicitly includes operational risk in addition to\nmarket and credit risk.\n\nPillar 2: Supervisory Review Process (SRP)\u2014which envisages the establishment of suitable risk\nmanagement systems in banks and their review by the supervisory authority.\n\nPillar 3: Market Discipline\u2014which seeks to achieve increased transparency through expanded\ndisclosure requirements for banks.\n\nThe Basel Committee also lays down the following four key principles in regard to the SRP envisaged\nunder Pillar 2:\n\nPrinciple 1: Banks should have a process for assessing their overall capital adequacy in relation\nto their risk profile and a strategy for maintaining their capital levels.\n\nPrinciple 2: Supervisors should review and evaluate banks\u2019 internal capital adequacy assess-\nments and strategies, as well as their ability to monitor and ensure their compliance\nwith the regulatory capital ratios. Supervisors should take appropriate supervisory\naction if they are not satisfied with the result of this process.\n\nPrinciple 3: Supervisors should expect banks to operate above the minimum regulatory capital ratios\nand should have the ability to require banks to hold capital in excess of the minimum.\n\nPrinciple 4: Supervisors should seek to intervene at an early stage to prevent capital from falling\nbelow the minimum levels required to support the risk characteristics of a particular\nbank and should require rapid remedial action if capital is not maintained or restored.\n\nIt would be seen that the principles 1 and 3 relate to the supervisory expectations from banks while\nthe principles 2 and 4 deal with the role of the supervisors under Pillar 2. Pillar 2 (Supervisory Review\nProcess-SRP) requires banks to implement an internal process, called the Internal Capital Adequacy\nAssessment Process (ICAAP), for assessing their capital adequacy in relation to their risk profiles as\nwell as a strategy for maintaining their capital levels. Pillar 2 also requires the supervisory authorities to\nsubject all banks to an evaluation process, hereafter called Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process\n(SREP), and to initiate such supervisory measures on that basis, as might be considered necessary. An\nanalysis of the foregoing principles indicates that the following broad responsibilities have been cast on\nbanks and the supervisors:\n\nBanks\u2019 Responsibilities:\n\n(a) Banks should have in place a process for assessing their overall capital adequacy in relation to\ntheir risk profile and a strategy for maintaining their capital levels (Principle 1)\n(b) Banks should operate above the minimum regulatory capital ratios (Principle 3)\nSupervisors\u2019 Responsibilities:\n(a) Supervisors should review and evaluate a bank\u2019s ICAAP. (Principle 2)\n(b) Supervisors should take appropriate action if they are not satisfied with the results of this\nprocess. (Principle 2)\n\n(c) Supervisors should review and evaluate a bank\u2019s compliance with the regulatory capital\nratios. (Principle 2)\n\n(d) Supervisors should have the ability to require banks to hold capital in excess of the minimum.\n(Principle 3)\n\n(e) Supervisors should seek to intervene at an early stage to prevent capital from falling below\nthe minimum levels. (Principle 4)\n\n(f) Supervisors should require rapid remedial action if capital is not maintained or restored.\n(Principle 4)\n\nThus, the ICAAP and SREP are the two important components of Pillar 2 and could be broadly\ndefined as follows:\nThe ICAAP comprises a bank\u2019s procedures and measures designed to ensure the following:\n\n(a) An appropriate identification and measurement of risks;\n(b) An appropriate level of internal capital in relation to the bank\u2019s risk profile; and\n(c) Application and further development of suitable risk management systems in the bank.\n\nThe SREP consists of a review and evaluation process adopted by the supervisor, which covers all the\nprocesses and measures defined in the principles listed above. Essentially, these include the review and\nevaluation of the bank\u2019s ICAAP, conducting an independent assessment of the bank\u2019s risk profile, and if\nnecessary, taking appropriate prudential measures and other supervisory actions.\n\nThese guidelines seek to provide broad guidance to banks by outlining the manner in which the SREP\nwould be carried out by the RBI, the expected scope and design of their ICAAP, and the expectations of\nthe RBI from banks in regard to implementation of the ICAAP.\n\nThe SREP of banks would, thus, be conducted by the RBI periodically, generally, along with the RBI's\nAnnual Financial Inspection (AFI) of banks and in the light of the data in the off-site returns received\nfrom banks in the RBI, in conjunction with the ICAAP document, which is required to be submitted every\nyear by banks to the RBI (refer to paragraph 12.3.3.7 below). Through the SREP, the RBI would evaluate\nthe adequacy and efficacy of the ICAAP of banks and the capital requirements derived by them there-\nfrom. While in the course of evaluation, there would be no attempt to reconcile the difference between\nthe regulatory minimum CRAR and the outcome of the ICAAP of a bank (as the risks covered under the\ntwo processes are different), banks would be expected to demonstrate to the RBI that the ICAAP adopted\nby them is fully responsive to their size, level of complexity, scope and scale of operations and the result\nant risk profile/exposures, and adequately captures their capital requirements. Such an evaluation of the\neffectiveness of the ICAAP would help the RBI in understanding the capital management processes and\nstrategies adopted by banks. If considered necessary, the SREP could also involve a dialogue between the\nbank's top management and the RBI from time to time. In addition to the periodic reviews, independent\nexternal experts may also be commissioned by the RBI, if deemed necessary, to perform ad hoc reviews\nand comment on specific aspects of the ICAAP process of a bank; the nature and extent of such a review\nshall be determined by the RBI.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "The Structural Aspects of the ICAAP\n\nThe broad parameters of the ICAAP that banks are required to comply with in designing and implement-\ning their ICAAP are:\n\n(i) Every bank to have an ICAP\n\n(ii) ICAAP to encompass firm-wide risk profile:\n\nGeneral firm-wide risk management principles:\n\nSenior management should understand the importance of taking an integrated, firm-wide perspective\nof a bank\u2019s risk exposure, in order to support its ability to identify and react to emerging and growing\nrisks in a timely and effective manner. The purpose of this guidance is the need to enhance firm-wide\noversight, risk management and controls around banks\u2019 capital markets activities, including securitiza-\ntion, off-balance sheet exposures, structured credit and complex trading activities.\n\nA sound risk management system should have the following key features:\n\n+ Active board and senior management oversight;\n+ Appropriate policies, procedures and limits;\n\n* Comprehensive and timely identification, measurement, mitigation, controlling, monitoring and\nreporting of risks;\n\n+ Appropriate management information systems (MIS) at the business and firm-wide level; and\n\n+ Comprehensive internal controls.\n\nPart C: Market Discipline\nGuidelines for Market Discipline\n\nGeneral\n\nThe purpose of Market discipline is to complement the minimum capital requirements (detailed under\nPillar 1) and the supervisory review process (detailed under Pillar 2). The aim is to encourage market\ndiscipline by developing a set of disclosure requirements which will allow market participants to assess\nkey pieces of information on the scope of application, capital, risk exposures, risk assessment processes\nand hence, the capital adequacy of the institution.\n\nIn principle, banks\u2019 disclosures should be consistent with how senior management and the Board of\nDirectors assess and manage the risks of the bank. Under Pillar 1, banks use specified approaches/meth-\nodologies for measuring the various risks they face and the resulting capital requirements. It is believed\nthat providing disclosures that are based on a common framework is an effective means of informing the\nmarket about a bank\u2019s exposure to those risks and provides a consistent and comprehensive disclosure\nframework that enhances comparability.\n\nPart D: Capital Conservation Buffer Framework\n\nObjective\n\nThe capital conservation buffer (CCB) is designed to ensure that banks build up capital buffers during\nnormal times (i.e., outside periods of stress) which can be drawn down as losses are incurred during a\nstressed period. The requirement is based on simple capital conservation rules designed to avoid breaches\nof minimum capital requirements.\n\nOutside the period of stress, banks should hold buffers of capital above the regulatory minimum.\nWhen buffers have been drawn down, one way banks should look to rebuild them is through reducing\ndiscretionary distributions of earnings. This could include reducing dividend payments, share buy-\nbacks and staff bonus payments. Banks may also choose to raise new capital from the market as an\nalternative to conserving internally generated capital. However, if a bank decides to make payments in\nexcess of the constraints imposed as explained above, the bank, with the prior approval of RBI, would\nhave to use the option of raising capital from the market equal to the amount above the constraint which\nit wishes to distribute.\n\nIn the absence of raising capital from the market, the share of earnings retained by banks for the\npurpose of rebuilding their capital buffers should increase the nearer their actual capital levels are to\nthe minimum capital requirement. It will not be appropriate for banks which have depleted their capital\nbuffers to use future predictions of recovery as justification for maintaining generous distributions to\nshareholders, other capital providers and employees. It is also not acceptable for banks which have\ndepleted their capital buffers to try and use the distribution of capital as a way to signal their financial\nstrength. Not only is this irresponsible from the perspective of an individual bank, putting sharehold-\ners\u2019 interests above depositors, it may also encourage other banks to follow suit. As a consequence,\nbanks in aggregate can end up increasing distributions at the exact point in time when they should be\nconserving earnings.\n\nThe capital conservation buffer can be drawn down only when a bank faces a systemic or idiosyncratic\nstress. A bank should not choose in normal times to operate in the buffer range simply to compete with\nother banks and win market share. This aspect would be specifically looked into by Reserve Bank of India\nduring the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process. If, at any time, a bank is found to have allowed\nits capital conservation buffer to fall in normal times, particularly by increasing its risk weighted assets\nwithout a commensurate increase in the Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio (although adhering to the restric-\ntions on distributions), this would be viewed seriously. In addition, such a bank will be required to bring\nthe buffer to the desired level within a time limit prescribed by Reserve Bank of India. The banks which\ndraw down their capital conservation buffer during a stressed period should also have a definite plan to\nreplenish the buffer as part of its Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process and strive to bring the\n\nbuffer to the desired level within a time limit agreed to with Reserve Bank of India during the Supervisory\nReview and Evaluation Process.\n\nThe framework of capital conservation buffer will strengthen the ability of banks to withstand\nadverse economic environment conditions, will help increase banking sector resilience both going\ninto a downturn, and provide the mechanism for rebuilding capital during the early stages of eco-\nnomic recovery. Thus, by retaining a greater proportion of earnings during a downturn, banks will\nbe able to help ensure that capital remains available to support the ongoing business operations/\nlending activities during the period of stress. Therefore, this framework is expected to help reduce\npro-cyclicality.\n\nThe Framework\n\nBanks are required to maintain a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 per cent, comprised of Common\nEquity Tier 1 capital, above the regulatory minimum capital requirement of 9 per cent. Banks should not\ndistribute capital (i.e., pay dividends or bonuses in any form) in case capital level falls within this range.\nHowever, they will be able to conduct business as normal when their capital levels fall into the conserva-\ntion range as they experience losses. Therefore, the constraints imposed are related to the distributions\nonly and are not related to the operations of banks. The distribution constraints imposed on banks when\ntheir capital levels fall into the range increase as the banks\u2019 capital levels approach the minimum require-\nments. The Table 13.18 below shows the minimum capital conservation ratios a bank must meet at various\nlevels of the Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratios.\n\nTABLE 1 um capital conservation standards for dual bank\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Ratio after including Minimum Capital Conservation Ratios\nthe current periods retained earnings (expressed as a percentage of earnings)\n\n5.5% \u2014 6.125% 100%\n>6.125% \u2014 6.75% 80%\n6.75% \u2014 7.375% 60%\n\n>7.375% \u2014 8.0% 40%\n\n>8.0% 0%\n\nFor example, a bank with a Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio in the range of 6.125 per cent to 6.75 per\ncent is required to conserve 80 per cent of its earnings in the subsequent financial year (i,e., payout no\nmore than 20 per cent in terms of dividends, share buybacks and discretionary bonus payments is allowed).\n\nThe following represents other key aspects of the capital conservation buffer requirements:\n\n(i) Elements subject to the restriction on distributions: Dividends and share buybacks, dis-\ncretionary payments on other Tier 1 capital instruments and discretionary bonus payments\nto staff would constitute items considered to be distributions. Payments which do not result\nin depletion of Common Equity Tier 1 capital, (for example include certain scrip dividends)\nare not considered distributions.\n\n(ii) Definition of earnings: Earnings are defined as distributable profits before the deduction\nof elements subject to the restriction on distributions mentioned at (i) above. Earnings are\ncalculated after the tax which would have been reported had none of the distributable items\nbeen paid. As such, any tax impact of making such distributions are reversed out. If a bank\ndoes not have positive earnings and has a Common Equity Tier I ratio less than 8 per cent, it\nshould not make positive net distributions.\n\n(iii) Solo or consolidated application: Capital conservation buffer is applicable both at the solo\nlevel (global position) as well as at the consolidated level, i.e., restrictions would be imposed\non distributions at the level of both the solo bank and the consolidated group. In all cases\nwhere the bank is the parent of the group, it would mean that distributions by the bank can\nbe made only in accordance with the lower of its Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio at solo level\nor consolidated level. For example, if a bank\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1 ratio at solo level is 6.8\nper cent and that at consolidated level is 7.4 per cent. It will be subject to a capital conserva-\ntion requirement of 60 per cent consistent with the Common Equity Tier 1 range of >6.75 per\ncent - 7.375 per cent as per Table 13.18 above. Suppose, a bank\u2019s Common Equity Tier 1 ratio\nat solo level is 6.6 per cent and that at consolidated level is 6 per cent. It will be subject to a\ncapital conservation requirement of 100 per cent consistent with the Common Equity Tier 1\n\nrange of >5.5 per cent - 6.125 per cent as per Table 13.18 on minimum capital conservation\nstandards for individual bank.\n\nPart E: Leverage Ratio Framework\nRationale and Objective\n\nOne of the underlying features of the crisis was the build-up of excessive on- and off-balance sheet\nleverage in the banking system. In many cases, banks built up excessive leverage while still show-\ning strong risk based capital ratios. During the most severe part of the crisis, the banking sector was\nforced by the market to reduce its leverage in a manner that amplified downward pressure on asset\nprices, further exacerbating the positive feedback loop between losses, declines in bank capital, and\ncontraction in credit availability. Therefore, under Basel III, a simple, transparent, non-risk based\nleverage ratio has been introduced. The leverage ratio is calibrated to act as a credible supplementary\nmeasure to the risk based capital requirements. The leverage ratio is intended to achieve the follow-\ning objectives:\n\n(a) constrain the build-up of leverage in the banking sector, helping avoid destabilizing\ndeleveraging processes which can damage the broader financial system and the economy;\nand\n\n(b) reinforce the risk based requirements with a simple, non-risk based \u2018backstop\u2019 measure.\n\nDefinition and Calculation of the Leverage Ratio\n\nThe provisions relating to leverage ratio contained in the Basel III document are intended to serve as the\nbasis for testing the leverage ratio during the parallel run period. The Basel Committee will test a mini-\nmum Tier | leverage ratio of 3 per cent during the parallel run period from January 1, 2013 to January 1,\n2017.\n\nDuring the period of parallel run, banks should strive to maintain their existing level of leverage ratio\nbut, in no case the leverage ratio should fall below 4.5 per cent. A bank whose leverage ratio is below 4.5\nper cent may endeavor to bring it above 4.5 per cent as early as possible. Final leverage ratio requirement\nwould be prescribed by RBI after the parallel run taking into account the prescriptions given by the Basel\nCommittee.\n\nThe leverage ratio shall be maintained on a quarterly basis. The basis of calculation at the end of each\nquarter is \u2018the average of the month-end leverage ratio over the quarter based on the definitions of capital\n(the capital measure) and total exposure (the exposure measure).\n\nCapital Measure\n\n(a) The capital measure for the leverage ratio should be based on the new definition of Tier 1\ncapital .\n\n(b) Items that are deducted completely from capital do not contribute to leverage, and should\ntherefore also be deducted from the measure of exposure. That is, the capital and exposure\nshould be measured consistently and should avoid double counting. This means that deduc-\ntions from Tier | capital should also be made from the exposure measure.\n\n(c) Where a financial entity is included in the accounting consolidation but not in the regulatory\nconsolidation, the investments in the capital of these entities are required to be deducted to\nthe extent that that they exceed 10 per cent of the bank\u2019s common equity. To ensure that the\ncapital and exposure are measured consistently for the purposes of the leverage ratio, the\nassets of such entities included in the accounting consolidation should be excluded from the\nexposure measure in proportion to the capital that is excluded .\n\n(d) For example, assume that total assets consolidated by the bank in respect of the subsidiaries\nwhich are included in the accounting consolidation but not in the regulatory consolidation\n(e.g., insurance companies) are 71200 crore. Further assume that the total equity investment\nofa bank in such subsidiaries is 15 per cent of the bank\u2019s common equity. In this case, invest-\nment equal to 10 per cent of the bank\u2019s equity will be risk weighted at 250 per cent and the\nremaining 5 per cent will be deducted from common equity. Of the consolidated assets of\n\n%11200 crore, %400 crore {1200*(5 per cent/15 per cent)} will be excluded from the exposure\nmeasure.\n\nExposure Measure\n\nGeneral Measurement Principles\n\nThe exposure measure for the leverage ratio should generally follow the accounting measure of exposure.\nIn order to measure the exposure consistently with financial accounts, the following should be applied\nby banks:\n\n(a) on-balance sheet, non-derivative exposures will be net of specific provisions and valuation\nadjustments (e.g., prudent valuation adjustments for AFS and HFT positions, credit valuation\nadjustments);\n\n(b) physical or financial collateral, guarantees or credit risk mitigation purchased is not allowed\nto reduce on-balance sheet exposures; and\n\n(c) netting of loans and deposits is not allowed.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "On-Balance Sheet Items\n\nBanks should include all items of assets reported in their accounting balance sheet for the purposes of cal-\nculation of the leverage ratio, In addition, the exposure measure should include the following treatments\nfor Securities Financing Transactions (e.g. repo and reverse repo agreements, CBLO) and derivatives:\n\n@\n\nii)\n\n(iii)\n\nRepurchase agreements and securities finance\n\nSecurities Financing Transactions (SFTs) are a form of secured funding and therefore, an impor-\ntant source of balance sheet leverage that should be included in the leverage ratio. Therefore, banks\nshould calculate SFT for the purposes of the leverage ratio by applying:\n\n(a) The accounting measure of exposure; and\n\n(b) Without netting various long and short positions with the same counterparty.\nDerivatives\nDerivatives create two types of exposure: an \u2018on-balance sheet\u2019 present value reflecting the fair value\nof the contract (often zero at outset but subsequently positive or negative depending on the perfor-\nmance of the contract), and a notional economic exposure representing the underlying economic\ninterest of the contract. Banks should calculate exposure in respect of derivatives, including where\na bank sells protection using a credit derivative, for the purposes of the leverage ratio by applying:\n\n(a) the accounting measure of exposure (positive MTM value) plus an add-on for potential future\nexposure calculated according to the Current Exposure Method; and\n\n(b) without netting the MTM values and PFEs in respect of various long and short positions with\nthe same counterparty.\n\nOther Off-Balance Sheet Items\n\nBanks should calculate the off balance sheet items for the purposes of the leverage ratio by applying a\nuniform 100 per cent credit conversion factor (CCF).

In general, Basel III will increase the capital requirements on Indian banks.\nThe current capital adequacy levels for the Indian banking system are comfortable.\n\nIt is imperative for banks to meet the Basel-III regulatory norms by March 2019. According to\nthe norms laid down by RBI, Indian banks have to maintain a minimum common equity ratio of\n8% and total capital ratio of 11.5% by 2019. As of March 2017, public sector banks maintained an\naverage common equity ratio of 8.5%. Four public sector banks (PSBs) are however struggling and\nare under the prompt corrective action plan of the RBI. According to RBI estimates, public sec-\ntor banks would require %1 lakh crore while the entire banking sector would require an additional\ncapital requirement of %5 lakh crore to meet the norms by 2019. Banks may not be able to raise\nthe required capital, which would curtail their ability to lend.

Adding the capital\ncharges for specific risk as well as general market risk would give the total capital charge for the trading\nbook of interest rate related instruments and equities.

In India, the minimum CRAR is 9 per cent.\n\nHence, the capital charge could be converted to risk weighted assets by multiplying the capital charge\nby (100 + 9), Thus risk weighted assets for market risk is 208.22*(100 + 9) = %2313.55 crore and for\noperational risk is 15*(100/9) = 2166.67 crore.\n\nComputing Capital\n\nEligible Tier I Capital\n\nPaid-up share capital 2200 crore\nStatutory reserves 2200 crore\nDisclosed free reserves 2100 crore\nCapital reserves 2200 crore\nPerpetual debt bonds 225 crore\n\nGross Tier I Capital 2725 crore\n\nDeductions:\n\nIntangible Assets:\n\nLosses and deferred tax assets\n\nGoodwill\n\nInvestments above 30 per cent in paid-up capital of financial\nentities\n\nNet Tier I Capital\n\nEligible Tier II Capital\n\nGeneral provisions and loss reserves\n\nUpper Tier II Capital:\n\nUnsecured redeemable long-term non-convertible bonds\nLower Tier II Capital:\n\nUnsecured redeemable short-term non convertible bonds\nGross Tier II Capital\n\nDeductions:\n\nInvestments above 30 per cent in paid-up capital of financial\nentities\n\nNet Tier II Capital\n\nTotal Eligible Capital (Net Tier I + Tier II Capital)\n\nComputing the Capital Ratio\n\n1 Total Capital\n\n2 Risk weighted assets for Credit Risk\n\n3 Risk weighted assets for Market Risk\n\n4 Risk weighted assets for Operational Risk\n5 Total Risk weighted assets (2+3+4)\n\n6 CRAR [(1+5)*100] 13.23%\n\n220 crore\n\n%5 crore\n\n25 crore\n%675 crore\n\n%50 crore\n\n2100 crore\n\n2200 crore\n3350 crore\n\n225 crore\n2325 crore\n21,000 crore\n\n21,000 crore\n%5,080.00 crore\n82,313.55 crore\n2166.67 crore\n7,560.22 crore\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Regional Rural Banks\n\nA new category of scheduled banks came into existence in 1975 when 6 regional rural banks (RRBs)\ncame into existence under the Regional Rural Banks Ordinance, 1975. This ordinance was promulgated\nby the Government of India on September 26, 1975. The ordinance was subsequently replaced by the\nRegional Rural Banks Act, 1976.\n\nAlthough cooperative and commercial banks achieved a high reach and disbursement of credit, there\nexisted a vast gap in the area of rural credit. In order to fill up this gap, a new set up of banks, namely,\nRRBs was established. RRBs were set up as institutions which combine the local feel and familiarity with\nrural problems, which the cooperatives possess and the degree of business organization, ability to mobi-\nlize deposits, access to central money markets, and modernized outlook which commercial banks have.\nThe major objective of setting up RRBs was to develop the rural economy by providing for the purpose of\ndevelopment of agriculture, trade, commerce, industry, and other productive activities in the rural areas,\ncredit and other facilities, particularly to the small and marginal farmers, agricultural labourers, artisans,\nand small entrepreneurs.\n\nThe authorized capital of each RRB is 21 crore and the issued capital is 25 lakh. Of the issued capital,\n50 per cent is authorized by the Government of India, 15 per cent by the concerned state government and\nthe balance, namely, 35 per cent by the sponsor bank. Each RRB is sponsored by a public sector bank,\nwhich provides assistance in the form of subscription to its share capital, managerial and financial assis-\ntance, and help in the recruitment and training of personnel.\n\n\nEvery RRB is authorized to carry on and transact the business of banking as defined in Section (Sb)\nand Section 6(1) of the Banking Regulation Act. The RBI can grant assistance to RRBs by way of loans\nand advances from the National Agricultural Credit (Stabilization) Fund under Sections 46A and 46B.\nRRBs are required to maintain a cash reserve ratio of three per cent. They are not liable to pay income tax\nas they are deemed to be cooperative societies.\n\nThe number of RRBs rose from six in 1975 to 196 in 1987. These 196 RRBs operated in 585 dis-\ntricts with a network of 14,520 branches excluding satellite branches and extension counters. RRBs\nbranch network forms nearly 37 per cent of the total rural branch network and 15 per cent of the total\nsemi-urban branch network of all scheduled commercial banks. The massive expansion of their branch\nnetwork enabled them to expand banking activities in the unbanked areas and mobilize rural savings.\nAlthough RRBs are spread over all the states, they have a major presence in north-eastern (34 per cent\nof branches), eastern (30 per cent) in and central (32 per cent) regions. In these states, the banking\nsystem mainly exists in the form of RRBs. Due to a higher presence in these areas, their share in total\nnumber of deposit accounts is significantly higher (18 per cent to 29 per cent) in these states vis-a vis\nonly 12 per cent at all India level. RRBs have provided financial services to the SHG-Bank Linkage\nProgramme for giving an impetus to micro-finance and are also functioning as self-help promoting\ninstitutions (SHPIs) with grant assistance from NABARD on account of non-availability of good\nNGOs in these states. Likewise, seven sponsor banks viz, Bank of Baroda, Bank of India, Central Bank\nof India, Punjab National Bank, State Bank of India, United Bank of India, and UCO Bank account\nfor more than three-fifths of the RRBs. RRBs are at par with scheduled commercial banks with respect\nto priority sector lending, investment avenues, credit discipline, and transparency. RRBs have carved\nout a niche for themselves in terms of geographical coverage, clientele outreach, business volume, and\ncontributions for development of the rural economy. But these RRBs are characterized by low pro-\nductivity, high transaction costs, negative margins, low recovery rates and high non-performing assets\n(NPAs). A viability-based review of RRBs shows that the loss-incurring RRBs are concentrated in\nfour states, namely, Bihar, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan and in five sponsor banks, namely,\nCBI, UCO Bank, SBI, BOI, and BOB. Their common characteristics included low productivity, high\ntransaction costs, lower CD ratio, negative margins, low recovery rates, and high NPAs. The Union\nBudget 2004-05 made the sponsor banks \u2018squarely accountable\u2019 for the performance of RRBs under\ntheir control. According to the Reserve Bank, the problems faced by Regional Rural Banks include lack\nof dynamism/ motivation of the chief executive officer, inadequate interest taken by sponsor banks,\nsub-optimal size and restrictions on expenditure for business promotion due to accumulated losses.\nBoth sponsor banks and rural banks compete with each other to grab a larger business share in the\nrural market. Hence, there is a need to empower RRBs to compete and survive in the emerging banking\nenvironment. They need full functional autonomy to make them financially stronger and increase their\nprofitability.\n\nAs RRBs are important financial institutions in the rural credit structure, several measures were initi-\nated towards strengthening them and making them vibrant channels of credit delivery. Some of the initia-\ntives undertaken are:\n\n1. A process of state-wise amalgamation of RRBs sponsored by the same sponsor bank was initi-\nated in 2005 to take advantages of the economies of scale and reduce their operational costs.\nAfter the amalgamation, RRBs would have a three-tier structure consisting of a head office,\ncontrolling offices and branches. The middle tier has been envisaged with a view to step up the\nrural lending, for which the centre has set steep targets for all credit agencies. The controlling\noffice in the middle tier will control 50 or more branches and have the power to sanction and\nsupervise credit flow. This office will also have decision-making powers with regard to general\nadministration, human resource development and monitoring. As a result of the amalgamation\nprocess, the number of RRBs in the country declined from 196 to 56 at the end of June 2016\nwith a network of 20,904 branches covering 644 notified districts in 27 states and the UT of\nPuducherry. To sum up, there have been two broad phases in the amalgamation of RRBs. In\nthe first phase (September 2005\u2014March 2010), RRBs of the same sponsor banks within a State\nwere amalgamated bringing down their number to 82 from 196. In the second and ongoing\nphase, starting from October 2012, geographically closest RRBs within a State under different\nsponsor banks would be amalgamated to have just one RRB in medium-sized States and two/\nthree RRBs in large States.\n\n2. NABARD has permitted the RRBs to relocate their loss-making branches to good busi-\nness locations/centers keeping in view the objective of building up sustainable rural finan-\ncial institutions. Further, loss-incurring RRBs have been allowed to convert into satellite/\n\n10.\n\n12.\n\n13.\n\nmobile offices provided such conversion would not impair the performance of service area\nobligations.\n\n|. RRBs have been given greater autonomy to enlarge their business activities. They have also been\n\nallowed to open currency chests, conduct State government business as sub-agents of sponsor\nbanks, take up corporate agency business without risk participation for distribution of all types of\ninsurance products and open NRO/FCNR accounts, subject to certain conditions.\n\n. The branch licensing policy has been liberalized and the norms for opening new branches in\n\nhitherto uncovered districts have been relaxed.\n\n. All RRBs are required to disclose their Capital to Risk Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) in their bal-\n\nance sheets and a road-map for achieving the desired CRAR norms would be drawn up by the RBI.\n\n. RRBs are being equipped in terms of technology-computerization and introducing core banking\n\nsolutions-to provide efficient customer service to their clientele.\n\n. The report of committee under the chairmanship of Dr Y.S.P. Thorat, then Chairman, NABARD\n\nto examine and lay down parameters for staffing norms in RRBs and suggest norms and proce-\ndures for new recruitments is under consideration of Government.\n\n. RRBs with negative net-worth are in the process of being re-capitalized, A sum total of 82,188\n\ncrore was infused as additional capital support to 187 out of 196 RRBs through six phases\nof recapitalization of the loss-making RRBs till January 2000. Out of 187 RRBs, 158 RRBs\nwere fully recapitalized and 29 RRBs partially. The government did not recapitalize any RRBs\nduring 2000-01. The recapitalization of 27 RRBs with negative networth, in a phased manner,\nwas announced in the Union Budget of 2007-08. The amount required for recapitalization of\n%1,795.97 crore was contributed in the ratio of 50:35:15 by the government of India (Gol) sponsor\nbanks and State Governments.\n\nWith a view to bringing the CRAR of RRBs to at least 9 per cent, the Dr. K. C. Chakrabarty\nCommittee recommended recapitalisation support to the extent of %.2,200 crore to 40 RRBs in\n21 States. The recapitalisation process started in 2010-11. The share of Central Government in\nrespect of some RRBs could not be released in the absence of the release of the share of State\nGovernments. Therefore, the scheme of recapitalisation was extended upto 31st March, 2014. A\ntotal amount of 71086. 70 crore, as on 31st March, 2014, was released to 39 RRBs including the\nCentral Madhya Pradesh Gramin Bank.\n\nThe Union Cabinet gave its approval for extension for the next three years, that is upto 2016-\n17 of the scheme of recapitalisation of weak Regional Rural Banks (RRBs). These banks are\nunable to maintain their minimum Capital to Risk weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) of 9 per cent.\nThis recapitalisation will help them improve this ratio.\n\nThe CRAR of 56 RRBs as on 31 March, 2015 ranged from 20.29 per cent (Chhattisgarh Rajya\nGramin Bank) to4.82 per cent (Nagaland Rural Bank). Four RRBs viz. Nagaland Rural Bank,\nOdisha Gramya Bank, Manipur Rural\n\nBank and Ellaquai Dehati Bank had CRAR less than 9 per cent. Recapitalisation assistance\nhad been released to these RRBs.\n\nA strong capital structure and minimum required level of CRAR will ensure financial stability\nof RRBs which will enable them to play a greater role in financial inclusion and meeting the credit\nrequirements of rural areas.\n\nRRBs have been allowed to enhance their resource base issue, issue credit/debit cards, set up\nATMs and handle pension and other government business as subagents.\n\nThe government in the Union Budget 2007-08 notified that RRBs will cover 49 uncovered dis-\ntricts and take up aggressive branch expansion. Of the proposed 678 branches, 268 branches vis-\na-vis 554 licenses issued by RBI, were opened as at end-March 2008.\n\n. The Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securitization of\n\nInterest (SARFAESI) Act was extended for loans advanced by RRBs.\n\nPerformance-linked cash incentives for the chairpersons of RRBs were introduced by the Gol in\n2009. The modified performance evaluation matrix (PEM) for computation of incentives of the\nchairpersons of RRBs, similar to revised PEM developed for whole time directors of PSBs was\napproved by Gol in consultation with NABARD. The revised PEM has come into effect from\nfinancial year 2015-16.\n\nRRB (Amendment) Act, 2015, was notified by Gol on 12 May 2015.The amendment has\nenhanced the authorised capital of RRBs to %2,000 crore and has enabled RRBs to raise capital\nfrom sources other than existing stakeholders. The other sources may include accessing the capi-\ntal market or private placement.\n\n14. NABARD provides both long-term and short-term refinance support to RRBs. NABARD extends\nlong-term (LT) refinance support for asset creation and capital formation, which are critical for\nagricultural growth and rural development through SCBs, RRBs and cooperative banks. Refi-\nnance is available for agriculture and allied activities, as well as off-farm activities with repay-\nment periods ranging from18 months to 15 years.\n\nRRBs are focusing their attention on the attainment of sustainable viability, improved customer ser-\nvices, new and innovative loan products and diversified business portfolio. The RRBs are now being\nmerged with their sponsor banks. The reduction in number of RRBs will increase their size, thus enabling\nthem to take advantage of economies of scale and also, enabling sponsor banks to manage their affairs\nefficiently. It is expected that because of their unique position, they will play a very useful role in financial\ninclusion.\n\nThe following Regional Rural Banks have been included in the second schedule of the Reserve Bank\nof India Act:\n\n1.

                        "extracted-text": "Conclusion\n\nIn the last few years, the health of banking system has improved in profitability, productivity, asset\nquality and capital adequacy. Amid stiff competition from private sector banks and the turbulent\neconomic environment, the SCBs\u2019 annual profit after tax (PAT) expanded by 48.0 per cent in 2016-\n17 as against a decline of 61.6 per cent in 2015-16, mainly due to higher increase in other operating\nincome (OO!)through trading in securities and lower rise in risk provisions while non-performing\nassets increased. The Indian banking sector withstood the repercussions of the global finanical cri-\nsis and emerged as sound and efficient sector.\n\nThe New Basel Accord has been implemented since April 2009. Banks will require a large amount of\nfunds and personnel expertise to manage risk. Banks will be required to put in place systems for internal\ncontrols and risk management. Scheduled Commercial Banks (excluding RRBs) shall converge with IFRS\nconverged Indian accounting standards (Ind AS) with effect from accounting periods beginning April 1,\n2018. In order to prepare the banks for changes under the Ind AS, RBI mandated them to submit proforma\nInd AS financial statements from the half year ended September 30, 2016.\n\nInternet banking is gaining ground. Internet allows services to be provided from anywhere in the world\nbut it carries high risks for banks. This will require continuous vigilance on the part of banks and coordi-\nnation of regulation at the international level.\n\nAs the prime borrowers are increasingly borrowing abroad, banks need to diversify into less risky\nretail banking, explore a huge segment of business that is pining for bank funds, abandon traditional\nreliance on collateral and develop the skills to assess business potential, while making lending deci-\nsions. Banks have started taking interest in building the fee income stream with the advent of capital\nadequacy norms for banks. Fee income represents the income earned on services provided by the bank\nlike demand drafts, telegraphic transfers, brokerage or commission earned on forex transactions, distri-\nbution of third party products like mutual funds, insurance, and financial advisory services. Fee income\nis a relatively easier way to increase revenues as the business does not involve any fund based expo-\nsure like a loan or cash advance. The trading income on investments was high for the banks under the\nsoft interest rate regime. With interest rate hardening now, profits from treasury operations have gone\ndown for most banks. Banks will have to book depreciation in their portfolio\u2014depreciation would be\nadjusted against profits on treasury income. The greater the share of treasury income, the higher is the\ndegree of volatility in bank\u2019s profits. Hence, a very high dependence on treasury earnings is not a sign\nof strength in earnings growth. Banks should focus on their core business, increase their fee-based\nincome and cut down their costs.\n\nPublic sector banks need to focus on systems, reskilling people, and growing their loan portfolios.\n\nThe function of banking is no longer acceptance of deposits for lending. Banking today refers to\nintermediation and managing risks. Banks will have to focus not only on capital adequacy but also on\ncapital efficiency\u2014how quickly capital flows to its efficient use. To sum up, banks need to develop sound\ncorporate governance practices to face the challenges of the changing future scenario.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "COOPERATIVE BANKING\n\nCooperative banks came into existence with the enactment of the Cooperative Credit Societies Act of\n1904 which provided for the formation of cooperative credit societies. Subsequently, in 1912, a new act\nwas passed which provided for the establishment of cooperative central banks. Cooperative credit institu-\ntions play a pivotal role in the financial system of the economy in terms of their reach, volume of opera-\ntions, and the purpose they serve.\n\nCooperative banks fill in the gaps of banking needs of small and medium income groups not adequately\nmet through by the public and private sector banks. The cooperative banking system supplements the\nefforts of the commercial banks in mobilizing savings and meeting the credit needs of the local population.\n\n\u2018A cooperative bank is member promoted and has to be registered with the state-based Registrar of\nCooperative Societies. It functions with the rule of \u2018one member one vote\u2019 and on \u2018no-profit, no loss basis\u2019.\n\nThe cooperative credit sector in India comprises rural cooperative credit institutions and urban coop-\nerative banks. The rural cooperative credit institutions comprise of institutions such as state cooperative\nbanks, district central cooperative banks, and primary agricultural credit societies, which specialise in\nshort-term credit, and institutions such as state cooperative agriculture and rural development banks and\nprimary cooperative agriculture and rural development banks, which specialise in long-term credit.\n\nUrban cooperative banks (UCBs) are mostly engaged in retail banking. They are not permitted to\ndeal in foreign exchange directly because of the high risks involved in forex business. Only three UCBs,\nnamely, the Saraswat Cooperative Bank Limited, the Bombay Mercantile Cooperative Bank Limited, and\nthe Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank Limited, have been authorized by the Reserve Bank to deal in\nforeign exchange. Their exposure to non-fund business like issuance of bank guarantees and letters of\ncredit is also limited, Their exposure to corporate (wholesale) banking is also limited due to factors such\nas small size of their balance sheet and inadequate expertise.\n\nUCBs expanded by leaps and bounds in the 1970s and in the 1990s. Both these decades were periods\nof high economic growth which led to a great demand for funds inadequately met by public sector banks.\nIn 1993, the Narasimham Committee recommended the liberalization of norms for cooperative banks\nOrganizational Structure of Cooperative Credit Institutions which led to a surge in the number of coop-\nerative banks. There are a large number of UCBs in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh,\nand Tamil Nadu. UCBs are included in the second schedule of the RBI Act, 1934, if their net demand and\ntime liabilities (NDTL) are at least 7100 crore and their overall functioning in terms of socket parameters\nis satisfactory.\n\nCooperative banks came under the purview of the Banking Regulations Act only in 1966. UCBs are\nsupervised by the RBI, while rural cooperative credit societies are supervised by the NABARD. State\n\nregistrars of cooperative societies also regulate certain functions of both urban and rural cooperative\nbanks/societies. Multi-State UCBs are regulated by the union government as well and are registered under\nthe Multi-State Cooperative Societies Act. The RBI is the regulatory and supervisory authority of UCBs\nfor their banking operations while managerial aspects come under the purview of the state governments\nunder their respective cooperative societies act. UCBs area of operation mostly confines to a single dis-\ntrict or the adjoining districts. Only UCBs with %50 crore net owned funds or above can extend their area\nof operation to the entire country.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Urban Cooperative Banks\n\nUCBs mobilize savings from the middle and low income urban groups and purvey credit to the weaker\nsections. They cater to the needs of small borrowers in the non-agricultural sector. The UCBs are varied\nand heterogeneous is terms of geographical spread, size, strength, levels of professionalism and perfor-\nmance and customer segments UCBs rely mostly on deposits as source of funds. The members bring in\nthe share capital which cannot be withdrawn before the minimum lock-in period. UCBs are not permitted\nto issue shares at a premium. UCBs were brought under the purview of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949\nin 1966. (As applicable to cooperative societies (AACS)). UCBs are registered as societies under the co-\noperative Societies Act of the respective state governments, and UCBs that have a multistate presence are\nregistered under the Multi-state Cooperative Societies Act administered by the Government of India. The\nsize of cooperative banks is comparatively smaller than that of commercial banks. Moreover, the coop-\nerative structure in India gets a preferential treatment and regulations are relatively soft for this sector.\nThe UCBs are regulated by three authorities: the central government (in case of banks havingmulti-state\npresence), state governments and the RBI. This multi-authority regulation has resulted in overlapping\njurisdiction and difficulties in regulating these banks.\n\nUCBs are categorized as scheduled and non-scheduled. There are Mahila (women) UCBs, Sched-\nuled Caste/Tribe UCBs and salary earners UCBs. Around 80 per cent of the UCBs are concentrated in\nfive states, namely, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka which account\nfor 72 per cent of total number of UCBs. There were 1574 UCBs with 7,670 branches as at end-March\n2016 and they provided credit to around 7 million borrowers aggregating 97,918 crore.\n\nThe RBI grants licenses to cooperative banks based on certain entry point norms. Initially, the entry\nnorms for cooperative banks was very liberal. The RBI revised these norms in August 2000 prescribing\nfour categories based on population criterion. According to the new norms, UCBs should have:\n\n+ a minimum share capital of %4 crore and membership of at least 3,000, if the population is over 10\nlakh;\n\n+ a minimum share capital of 22 crore and membership of at least 2,000 if the population is between\nfive to 10 lakh;\n\n* a minimum share capital of Zone crore and membership of at least 1,500 for population of one to\nfive lakh; and\n\n* aminimum share capital of 225 lakh and membership of at least 500 for population of less than one\nlakh. The number of licensed UCBs increased from 1,849 to 1,937 between end March 2000 and\nend March 2001.\n\nNew UCBs will have to achieve the prescribed share capital and membership before license is issued to\nthem.\n\nOn October 30, 2003, the Government of India issued a notification enhancing the minimum demand\nand time liabilities of a cooperative bank to be included in second schedule of the RBI. As per this notifi-\ncation, the minimum demand and time liabilities that a cooperative bank should have to qualify for inclu-\nsion in second schedule has been enhanced to 250 crore from %100 crore.\n\nThere is a two-tier regulatory structure for UCBs. Banks falling under the following categories are\nclassified as Tier I banks: (i) unit banks, i.e., banks having a single branch/head office and banks with\ndeposits below %100 crore, whose branches are located in a single district; (ii) banks with deposits\nbelow 2100 crore having branches in more than one district, provided the branches are in contiguous\ndistricts, and deposits and advances of branches in one district separately constitute at least 95 per\ncent of the total deposits and advances, respectively, of the bank; (iii) banks with deposits below 7100\ncrore, whose branches were originally in a single district but subsequently, became multi-district due\nto reorganization of the district. The deposit base of 7100 crore would be determined on the basis of\naverage of fortnightly net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) in the financial year concerned and that\nof advances on the basis of fortnightly average in the financial year concerned. Rest of the UCBs are\ncategorized as Tier II banks.\n\nThe number of Tier II UCBs was 447 at end-March 2015. The number of UCBs which held larger\nsizes of deposits and advances increased. There were 52 scheduled UCBs at end-March 2016. The\nnumber of scheduled multi-state UCBs was 3 land that of non-scheduled single-state UCBs was 1,502\nby end-March 2016.\n",

Prudential inter-bank (gross) exposure limit: The total amount of deposits placed by an UCB\nwith other banks (inter-bank) for all purposes including call money/ notice money, and deposits,\nifany, placed for availing clearing facility, CSGL facility, currency chest facility, remittance facil-\nity and non-fund based facilities like bank guarantee (BG), letter of credit (LC), etc., shall not\nexceed 20 per cent of its total deposit liabilities as on March 31 of the previous year. The balances\nheld in deposit accounts with commercial banks and in permitted scheduled UCBs and invest-\nments in certificate of Deposits issued by commercial banks, being inter bank exposures, will be\nincluded in this 20 per cent limit.\n\n2. Prudential inter-bank counter party limit: Within the prudential inter-bank (gross) exposure\nlimit, deposits with any single bank should not exceed 5 per cent of the depositing bank's total\ndeposit liabilities as on March 31, of the previous year.\n\n3. Exemptions from the prudential limit: Non-scheduled UCBs in Tier I have been exempted\nfrom maintaining SLR in Government and other approved securities up to 15 per cent of\ntheir NDTL provided the amount is held in interest bearing deposits with the Public Sector\nBanks and IDBI bank Ltd. These deposits are exempted from the prudential limit on inter-bank\nexposure limits.\n\nAs per the provisions of Section 24 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS), deposits\nplaced by UCBs with the higher financing agencies in the cooperative sector, viz., DCCBs/StCBs\nwould be reckoned as SLR assets to the extent they are not encumbered.\n\nHowever, when a UCB avails of a loan from a DCCB/StCB with which it is maintaining depos-\nits, for the purpose of computation of SLR, the amount of loan availed from the DCCB/StCB,\nwould be deducted from the deposits, irrespective of whether lien has been marked on such\ndeposits or not.\n\n4. The amount of deposits placed by a non-scheduled UCB with any scheduled UCB should not\nexceed 5 per cent of the depositing bank\u2019s total deposit liabilities as on March 31 of previous year.\nThe total inter-UCB deposits accepted by a scheduled UCB should not exceed 10 per cent of its\ntotal deposit liabilities as on March 31st of the previous financial year as hither to.\n\n5. Keeping in view the above prudential limits, UCBs may formulate a policy taking into account\ntheir funds position, liquidity and other needs for placement of deposits with other banks, the cost\nof funds, expected rate of return and interest margin on such deposits, the counter party risk, etc.\nand place it before their Board of Director. The Board should review the position at least at half\nyearly interval.\n\nExisting Mahila Banks which conform to the entry point norms for general category banks, can enrol\nmale members up to a limit of 25 per cent of their total regular membership, subject to compliance by the\nbanks with their respective bye-laws.\n\nPriority Sector Lending Priority sector lending target for UCBs was brought at par with the target\napplicable to commercial banks, ie, 40 per cent of the adjusted bank credit (ABC) (total loans and\nadvances plus investments made by UCBs in non-SLR bonds) or credit equivalent amount of off balance\nsheet exposure (OBE), whichever is higher, as on March 31 of the previous year.\n\nBut there are no penal provisions for non-attainment of targets to priority sector and weaker sections.\nHowever, there are indirect incentives such as branch expansion, expansion of areas of operation, and\nattainment of scheduled status, which are dependent on the attainment of priority sector/weaker section\ntargets by banks.\n\nLending to the Stock Market The RBI put a stop on lending by the UCBs directly or indirectly\nagainst security of stocks. UCBs were also advised to unwind existing lending to stockbrokers or direct\ninvestment in shares on the contracted dates.\n\nIt was proposed to allow UCBs to grant loans to individuals against security of shares, subject to the\nfollowing parameters.\n\n+ Loans against shares/debentures may be granted to individuals to meet contingencies and personal\nneeds or for subscribing to rights or new issues of shares/debentures or for purchase in the second-\nary market. Loans against primary/collateral security of shares/debentures will be limited upto\n% five lakh, if the security is in physical form and upto @10 lakh, if the security is in demat form.\nAggregate of all such loans should be within the overall ceiling of 20 per cent of the owned funds of\nthe bank, and margin of 40 per cent should be maintained in all cases of such loans.\nIt is essential that before accepting shares as security, UCBs should put in place a risk management\nsystem. UCBs should also have audit committee of their boards of directors and all the approved\nloan proposals should be placed before the audit committee at least once in two months. Details of\nloans sanctioned should be reported to the board in the subsequent board meeting. The management\nand audit committee should ensure that all loans against shares are made only to those individuals\nwho are not in any way connected with any stock-broking activity or stock-broking entity.\n* UCBs which have outstanding loans to individuals can renew them upto permissible amounts\nbeyond the contracted date on merits, subject to the above conditions.\n+ UCBs should ensure that there is no direct investment by them in either primary or secondary mar-\nket under any circumstances.\n\nDeployment of Funds UCBs can grant loans to individuals against security of shares within the overall\nlimit of 20 per cent of owned funds of the bank, subject to certain restrictions.\n\nAdvances UCBs cannot extend unsecured credit beyond %50,000 per borrower. As a prudential measure\naimed at better risk management and avoidance of concentration of credit risk, UCBs were advised (a)\nto fix the prudential exposure limits at 15 per cent and 40 per cent of the capital funds in case of single\nborrower and group of borrowers respectively. UCBs cannot extend fund based/nonfund based facilities\nto builders/contractors for acquisition of land even as a part of a housing project. Further, wherever land\nis accepted as collateral, valuation of such land should be at the current market price only.\n\nInterest on Deposits UCBs are allowed to offer higher interest rates on savings and current accounts\nby 1.0 per cent and 0.5 per cent, respectively, vis-a-vis the commercial banks. Higher interest rates have\nbeen allowed to facilitate deposit mobilization by UCBs.\n\nRefinance Facilities The RBI extends refinance at the bank rate to UCBs against the advances granted\nby them to the tiny/cottage industries. Since 2000-01, NABARD has designated scheduled UCBs as\neligible institutions for drawing refinance in respect of loans issued for rural non-farm sector, including\nrural housing and for other agricultural activities.\n\nLong-term Deposits UCBs are permitted to raise term deposits for a minimum period of not less than\nfive years, which will be eligible to be treated as Tier II capital.\n\nShare Linkage Norms Borrowings from UCBs are linked to shareholdings of the borrowing members.\nAt present, the shareholding requirement is 2.5 per cent for secured borrowings and 5 per cent for unsecured\nborrowings. The extant share linking norm may be applicable for member's shareholdings upto the limit of\n5 per cent of the total paid up share capital of the bank Where a member is already holding 5 per cent of the\ntotal paid up share capital of an UCB, it would not be necessary for him to subscribe to any additional share\ncapital on account of the application of the extant share linking norms. In other words, a borrowing member\nmay be required to hold shares for an amount that may be computed as per the extant share linking norms or\nfor an amount that is 5% of the total paid up share capital of the bank, whichever is lower.\n",

The RBI revised the criteria for\nidentification of weak UCBs in April 2002. A UCB is categorized as weak for the following reasons:\n\n+ The financial position is unsatisfactory, beyond specific threshold limits in terms of capital ade-\nquacy, i.e., CRAR below 75 per cent of the statutory minimum.\n\n+ Its non-performing assets (NPA) are above 10 per cent but below 15 per cent of outstanding loans\nand advances.\n\n+ Ithas incurred net losses for two out of last three consecutive years.\n\nWeak banks are required to draw up a time bound package for revival and the implementation of this\npackage would be monitored by the RBI and the registrar of cooperative societies.\n\nIf a UCB exhibits one of the above three symptoms, it is identified as weak. If the condition of the\nUCB deteriorates even further in terms of either NPA or profitability along with capital adequacy, then\nUCB would classified as sick. Sick UCBs would then be put under moratorium or liquidation. The RBI\nhas laid down guidelines for merger/amalgamation of UCBs of the following types, subject to the post-\nmerger entity meeting the prescribed prudential norms:\n\n* Net worth of the acquiree bank is positive and the acquirer bank assures to protect entire deposits of\nall the depositors of the acquired bank.\n\n+ When the net worth of the acquiree bank is negative, the acquirer bank on its own assures to protect\ndeposits of all the depositors of the acquired bank.\n\n+ When the net worth of the acquiree bank is negative and the acquirer bank assures to protect the\ndeposits of all the depositors with financial support from the state government extended upfront as\npart of the process of merger.\n\n\u2018The RBI has also laid down norms for financial restructuring of the liabilities of the weak UCB as an\nadditional option for resolution of problem banks provided they conform to the following norms:\n\n1, The interest of small depositors has to be protected in full. Accordingly, no conversion into equity will\nbe permitted in the case of small depositors, ie., depositor having deposit upto Rupees one lakh.\n\n2. A portion of the deposit of individual depositors above Rupees one lakh may be converted into\nequity. Likewise, a portion of the deposits of the institutional depositors may be converted into\nInnovative Perpetual Debt Instrument (IPDI), which is eligible for inclusion as Tier I capital.\n\n3. The conversion of deposits into equities and IPDI would be subject to consent of the depositors!\ntheir forum.\n\n4, Post-restructuring, no shares (equities) will be redeemed until the bank achieves a CRAR of\n9 per cent.\n\n5. The proportion of deposits converted into equity/IPDI should be such that the net worth of the\nbank after reconstruction turns positive.\n\n6. The bank will have to maintain CRR/SLR on the restructured liabilities.\n\n7. Post-restructuring, the management of the bank should be in the hands of a Board of Adminis-\ntrators consisting of representatives of individual depositors as well as professional bankers to\nensure proper implementation of the reconstruction scheme including recovery of NPAs.\n\nUCBs are graded into four categories on the basis of their financial performance. Grade I and II UCBs\nare relatively stronger banks and Grade III and IV are weak or sick banks.\n\nUCBs fulfilling the following criteria would henceforth be termed as Financially Sound and Well-\nManaged (FSWM):\n\n(a) CRAR of not less than 10 per cent;\n\n(b) Gross NPA of less than 7% and Net NPAs of not more than 3%\n\n(c) Net profit for at least three out of the preceding four years subject to it not having incurred a net\nloss in the immediate preceding year.\n\n(@) No default in the maintenance of CRR/SLR during the preceding financial year;\n\n(c) Sound internal control system with at least two professional directors on the Board;\n\n(f) Core Banking Solution (CBS) fully implemented; and\n\n(g) Regulatory comfort.\n",

The UCB to be merged\nshould be registered either in a State, which has signed MOU with the RBI or under the Multi-State Coop-\nerative Societies Act, 2002, where RCS concerned assures to order merger in public interest as provided\nunder the respective State Cooperative Societies Act or where CRCS prepares a scheme of amalgamation\nunder Section 18 of the Multi-State Cooperative Societies Act, 2002.

The deposit coverage ratio shall not be less than 65 per cent. Higher deposit coverage ratio may\nbe insisted upon depending upon the RBI assessment. The difference between the \u2018net outside liabilities\u2019 and\n\u2018net readily realisable assets\u2019, hereafter called the \u2018uncovered gap\u2019 would be met through contribution to be\nmade by the transferee bank, claim on DICGC and sacrifice to be made by the large depositors.\n\nWell managed and financially sound UCBs are allowed to open new branches/extension counters includ-\ning off-site ATMs in the States that have signed MoUs with the Reserve Bank for supervisory and regulatory\nco-ordination and those registered under the Multi-State Co-operative Societies Act, 2002. They are also\npermitted to open NRE account subject to compliance with eligibility norms laid down by the RBI.\n\nUCBs have created a separate niche for themselves. They have played a significant role in creating\nbanking habits among the lower and middle income groups and in semi-urban credit delivery through\ntheir extensive networks. In the post liberalization era, many of the strong UCBs were involved in capital\nmarket scams: the 2001 Ketan Parekh scam and Home Trade Finance scam of 2002. Many of the deposi-\ntors in Gujarat and provident funds in Maharashtra lost crores of rupees.\n\nMoreover, the financial health of some UCBs has deteriorated due to high level of non-performing\nassets while some others are facing financial problems such as low capital base, lack of professionalism\nin conduct and management, poor recoveries, lack of funds for fresh deployment, mounting overdues,\ninadequate internal controls, and non-adherence to norms and regulations and low levels of diversification\nin business operations. Besides, there is increasing political clout on UCBs which acts as a constraint on\ntheir functioning. There is an absence of effective and coordinated regulation and supervision as they are\nunder the regulatory control of multiple authorities. This is a major impediment to the strengthening and\nrevitalization of this sector.\n\nDesen! Cenmnenticon Danke\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Rural Cooperative Banks\n\nRural cooperative banks play an important role in the rural credit delivery system as they account for\naround 30 per cent of rural deposits and 44 per cent of the outstanding loans and advances of the bank-\ning system for agriculture and rural development. About 55 per cent of the short-term production loans\nfor the agriculture sector come from cooperative credit institutions. Credit cooperatives form almost\n70 per cent of the rural credit outlets. These rural cooperative banks receive refinance facility from\nNABARD.\n\nShort-term Structure of Rural Cooperative Banks State Cooperative Banks (StCBs) are the apex\ninstitutions coordinating and regulating the working of Central Cooperative Banks (CCBs). They form\nthe upper tier of short-term credit structure dispensing mainly short-and medium-term credit. As at end\nMarch 2015, there were 32 StCBs of which, 17 were scheduled StCBs included in the second schedule\nunder section 42 of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934.\n\nDistrict Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs)\u2014the middle tier in the short-term structure of rural\ncooperative banks\u2014channelise funds from the state cooperative banks to primary agricultural credit soci-\neties. Deposits constitute the major component of sources of funds followed by borrowings. There were\n370 DCCBs on March 31, 2015.\n\nPrimary agricultural credit societies (PACSs) deal directly with the individual farmers, provide\nshortand medium-term credit, supply agricultural inputs and also arrange for marketing of produce of\nits members through a cooperative marketing society. PACSs are the grassroots level arms of the short-\nterm cooperative credit structure. As on end March 2015, there were 93,042 PACSs with membership of\nmore than 13 crore of which, borrowing members at 4.81 crore constituted around 37 per cent. PACS is\npossibly one of the largest rural financial systems in the world. They are excluded from the scope of the\nBanking Regulation Act, 1949. Most of the PACSs are dependent on the finance provided by CCBs.\n\nThe financial health of a large number of PACSs has deteriorated. This is due to a large proportion\nof non-performing assets to total loans outstanding and erosion of funds and deposits. To improve the\nfinancial health of PACSs, NABARD provides financial support for computerization, human resource\ndevelopment, and so on. Short-term cooperatives dominate the rural co-operative credit structure. Its\nshare is above 93 per cent of the total astets of the rural co-operative credit institutions.\n\nNABARD is developing PACS as Multi Service Centres (MSCs) for:\n\n+ Establishment of agro service centres, rural retail outlets, agrimarketing infrastructure, rural ware-\nhouses, and procurement of agricultural produce;\n\n* Collection and marketing of milk and poultry activities;\n\n* Custom hiring of farm machinery or implements, transport vehicles for agricultural produce; and\n\n* Strengthening forward and backward linkages through onlending to PACS members.\n\nTo enable PACS deliver more efficient financial and non-financial services in a viable manner to their\nmembers, PACS Development Cells (PDCs) have been created in DCCBs and StCBs.\n\nLong-term Structure of Rural Cooperative Banks The long-term credit structure has only about\n2,500 retail outlets as compared to over 1,00,000 retail outlets of the short-term credit structure. The long-\nterm structure has a membership of about 16 million out of which 82 per cent are borrowing members.\nThis structure provides medium and long-term loans for mechanization, animal husbandry, redeeming\nfarmers\u2019 lands, improving farmers\u2019 lands, crop loans, gold loans, rural industries, and housing.\n\nState Cooperative Agriculture and Rural Development Banks (SCARDBs) form the upper tier of\nlongterm cooperative credit structure dispensing investment credit. There were 19 SCARDBs on March\n31, 2015. SCARDBs provide long-term credit and are predominantly dependent on borrowings for their\nfinancial resources. With a view to strengthening their resource base, SCARDBs were permitted to mobi-\nlize fixed deposits for term of not less than twelve months, They can raise long-term deposits subject to\ncertain conditions.\n\nThe primary cooperative agriculture and rural development banks (PCARDBs) are the lower tier of\nlong-term credit cooperatives. The PCARDBs also provide long-term credit and are heavily dependent on\nborrowings. There were around 702 PCARDBs as on March 31, 2015.\n\nThe long-term credit cooperative banks were earlier known as land development banks. Their structure\nis much smaller in size and their business volume is also low as compared to the short-term structure. The\nlong-term structure has lost its position as the dominant source of long-term credit on account of various\nfactors such as limited range of long-term products and services offered, competition from short-term credit\ncooperative structure and commercial banks, infrequent interaction among members, and scattered lending.\n\nMore than 80 per cent of their resources are from borrowings and the remaining 20 per cent is in the\nform of contribution from members, government and deposits. Members of the cooperative banks are\nrequired to contribute 5 to 10 per cent of the loan applied as share capital at the time of availing loans.\nbecause of infrequent borrower contacts, the share capital does not increase which compels them to\nresort to higher borrowings. The borrowings are in the form of debentures floated with state government\nguarantee and these debentures are subscribed by the NABARD to the extent of 90-95 per cent and the\nremaining portion is subscribed by the Government of India (GOI) and the state government. SCARDBs\nborrow to meet the needs of the PCARDBs.\n\nRegulation and Supervision The RBI is the regulatory authority for StCBs and CCBs. Among the\nrural cooperative banks, only these two banks are covered under the scope of the Banking Regulation Act,\n1949. The supervision of these two banks has been entrusted to NABARD. NABARD has constituted a\nboard of supervision for rural cooperative banks.\n\nA revival package for short-term credit cooperative structure was communicated to the state govern-\nments by the Government of India in January 2006. The Revival Package focuses on:\n\n+ Introducing legal and institutional reforms which will enable the cooperatives to function as autono-\nmous member centric and member-governed institutions. These reforms will enable wider access to\nfinancial resources and investment opportunities, remove geographical restrictions in operations as\nwell as provide administrative autonomy to cooperatives at all levels.\n\nSuitable amendments in the Banking Regulation Act and certain provisions in the NABARD Act.\n\n+ Providing resources for covering the accumulated losses.\n\nProviding for taking cooperatives to a minimum level of CRAR of 7 per cent.\n\nMeeting the costs of computerization and human resource development at all the levels of the short-\nterm credit structure.\n\nThe sharing of the accumulated losses between GOI, state governments and the credit cooperative\nstructure is based on the concept of origin of losses rather than any arbitrary proportions.\n\nNABARD has been designated the implementing agency for implementing the revival package in all the\nstates.\n\nA revival package of 213,596 crore for the Short Term Cooperative Credit Structure for wiping out\naccumulated losses, covering invoked but unpaid guarantees given by State Governments, increasing the\ncapital adequacy ratio to a minimum level of seven per cent and technical assistance including cost of\naudit, training, computerization was approved by the government wherein the Centre, State Governments\nand the Cooperative Credit Structure (CCS) would share the funding on a 68:28:4 ratio.\n\nBased on the recommendation of Vaidyanathan Committee (VC-I), Government implemented a\nrevival package for Short Term Cooperative Credit Structure (STCCS) encompassing legal and institu-\ntional reforms, measures to improve the quality of management and financial assistance as necessary for\ntheir democratic, self-reliant and efficient functioning. Under the revival package, Government of India\nreleased 29,245 crore. The said package was closed on 30th June, 2011.\n\nThe share of long term investment credit in agriculture is going down as compared to short term crop\nloan. This is severely hampering the asset creation in agriculture and allied activities. In order to give\na boost to long term investment credit in agriculture, the Government set up \u201cLong Term Rural Credit\nFund\u201d in NABARD for the purpose of providing refinance support to Cooperative Banks and Regional\nRural Banks with an initial corpus of 75,000 crore.\n\nThe Short Term Cooperative Rural Credit (STCRC) \u2014 Refinance Fund was announced in Union Budget\n2008-09 with initial corpus of 75,000 crore. In order to ensure increased and uninterrupted credit flow to\nfarmers and to avoid high cost market borrowings by NABARD, the Government allocated an amount of\n%50,000 crore for STCRC Fund during 2014-15.\n\nThe number of unlicensed StCBs reduced from 17 to zero and the number of unlicensed DCCBs came\ndown sharply from 296 to 23 by June 2013.\n\nRecognizing the need to revamp ailing Cooperative Banks so that they are able to cater to the needs of\nfarmers at their doorstep, the Government in 2014 announced implementation of the Scheme for Revival\nof 23 Unlicensed District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs) in four States viz. 16 in Uttar Pradesh, 3 in\nJammu & Kashmir, 3 in Maharashtra and 1 in West Bengal. The total capital infusion required for revival\nof these 23 DCCBs was assessed to the tune of 2375.42 crore, out of which the commitment from Cen-\ntral Government was for 7673.29 crore, for State Governments, 71464.59 crore and for National Bank for\nAgriculture & Rural Development (NABARD) it was 2237.54 crore. The entire share of Central Govern-\nment under the Scheme was released to NABARD for onward transmission to Cooperative Banks accord-\ning to the terms and conditions prescribed in the Memorandum of Understanding governing the Scheme.\n\nSignificant progress has been made with respect to issuing licences to unlicensed DCCBs. With the\nimplementation of the revival scheme announced by the central government in November 2014, the num-\nber of unlicensed DCCBs came down sharply from 23 to just 3 at the end of September 2016.\n",

Asset quality in terms of NPA as a percentage of loans outstanding improved for all categories\n\nof rural cooperative banks, except PCARDBs, for which it remained at the previous year\u2019s level. The\nrecovery performance of CCBs, PACS, and PCARDBs improved, while that of state cooperative banks\nStCBs and SCARDBs worsened. Asset quality and recovery performance of the long term rural credit\ninstitutions, especially SCARDBs,has improved. Both the scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) and\nrural banks will need to focus on semi-urban and rural areas for future growth.\n\nCooperative banks are an important segment in the Indian banking structure. Effective and coordinated\nregulation can strengthen and revitalise this sector.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "NON-BANKING FINANCIAL COMPANIES\n\nNon-banking financial companies (NBFCs) constitute an important segment of the financial system.\nNBFCs are financial intermediaries engaged primarily in the business of accepting deposits and deliv-\nering credit. They play an important role in channelizing the scarce financial resources to capital for-\nmation. NBFCs supplement the role of the banking sector in meeting the increasing financial needs\nof the corporate sector, delivering credit to the unorganized sector and to small local borrowers. But\nthey differ from banks in many ways. An NBFC can accept deposit but not demand deposits and hence,\nthey cannot raise low cost funds through savings or current accounts. Moreover, it is not a part of the\npayment and settlement system, cannot issue cheques drawn on itself and cannot borrow from the RBI.\nNBFCs have a more flexible structure than banks. As compared to banks, they can take quick decisions,\nassume greater risks, and tailor-make their services and charges according to the needs of the clients.\nTheir flexible structure helps in broadening the market by providing the saver and investor a bundle of\nservices on a competitive basis.\n\nA non-banking financial company has been defined vide clause (b) of Section 45\u20141 of Chapter IIIB of\nthe Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, as (i) a financial institution, which is a company; (ii) a non-banking\ninstitution, which is a company and which has as its principal business the receiving of deposits under\nany scheme or arrangement or in any other manner or lending in any manner; (iii) such other non-banking\ninstitutions or class of such institutions, as the bank may with the previous approval of the central govern-\nment and by notification in the official gazette, specify.\n\nNBFC has been defined under Clause (xi) of Paragraph 2(1) of Non-Banking Financial Com-\npanies Acceptance of Public Deposits (Reserve Bank) Directions, 1998, as: \u2018non-banking finan-\ncial company\u2019 means only the non-banking institution which is a loan company or an investment\ncompany or a hire purchase finance company or an equipment leasing company or a mutual benefit\nfinance company.\n\nA Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) is a company registered under the Companies Act,\n1956 engaged in the business of loans and advances, acquisition of shares/stocks/bonds/debentures/\nsecurities issued by Government or local authority or other marketable securities of a like nature,\nleasing, hire-purchase, insurance business, chit business but does not include any institution whose\nprincipal business is that of agriculture activity, industrial activity, purchase or sale of any goods\n(other than securities) or providing any services and sale/purchase/construction of immovable prop-\nerty. A non-banking institution which is a company and has principal business of receiving deposits\nunder any scheme or arrangement in one lump sum or in installments by way of contributions or in\nany other manner, is also a non-banking financial company (Residuary non-banking company).\n\nNBFCs provide a range of services such as hire purchase finance, equipment lease finance, loans, and\ninvestments. Due to the rapid growth of NBFCs and a wide variety of services provided by them, there\nhas been a gradual blurring of distinction between banks and NBFCs except that commercial banks have\nthe exclusive privilege in the issuance of cheques.\n\nHowever, NBFC cannot accept demand deposits, do not form part of the payment and settlement sys-\ntem and cannot issue cheques drawn on itself. Moreover, deposit insurance facility of Deposit Insurance\nand Credit Guarantee Corporation is not available to depositors of NBFCs, unlike in case of banks.\n\nNBFCs have raised large amount of resources through deposits from public, shareholders, directors, and\nother companies and borrowings by issue of non-convertible debentures. In the year 1998, a new concept of\npublic deposits meaning deposits received from public, including shareholders in the case of public limited\ncompanies and unsecured debentures/bonds other than those issued to companies, banks, and financial insti-\ntutions, was introduced for the purpose of focused supervision of NBFCs accepting such deposits.\n\nThe public funds are unlike public deposits, wholly the public funds do include public deposits, inter-\ncorporate deposits, bank finance and all other fundsthat were received either directly or indirectly from\nexternal sources such as funds raised by the issue of Commercial Papers, debentures, etc. The \u2018deposits\u2019\nare defined under the RBI Act, 1934 as acceptance of money excluding those money raised by way of\n\ncapital share, money received from banks and other financial institutions, money receivedas security\ndeposit, earnest money and advance against goods or services and subscription to chits. All other source\nof money received as loan or in any collectiveform of amount is treated as deposits.\n\nAll Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) are not entitled to accept public deposits. It also\napplies to CICs/CICs-ND-SI which cannot accept public deposits. Only those NBFCs to which the Bank\nhad given a specific authorization and have an investment grade rating are allowed to accept or hold public\ndeposits to a limit of 1.5 times of its Net Owned Funds. Those AFCs that do not get an investment grade\nrating by 31 March2016 will not be allowed to renew existing or accept fresh deposits thereafter. In the\nintervening period, i.c., till 31 March 2016, the unrated AFCs or those with a sub-investment grade rating\ncan only renew their existing deposits on maturity and they cannot accept fresh deposits, till they obtain\nan investment grade rating.\n\nHowever, as a matter of public policy, the Reserve Bank of India has decided that only the banks\nshould be allowed to accept public deposits and as such has since 1997 not issued any Certificate of Reg-\nistration (CoR) to new NBFCs for acceptance of public deposits.\n\nBanks that also includes the state and rural co-operative banks can accept deposits and funds. Non-\nbanking finance companies, which have been issued Certificate of Registration by RBI with a specific\nlicence to accept deposits, are entitled to accept public deposit. In other words, not all NBFCs registered\nwith the Reserve Bank are entitled to accept deposits but only those that hold a deposit accepting Cer-\ntificate of Registration can accept deposits. They can, however, accept deposits, only for a certain extent\nwhich is permissible. The Housing Finance Companies, which are again specifically authorized to collect\ndeposits and companies authorized by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs under the Companies Acceptance\nof Deposits Rules framed by the Central Government under the Companies Act, can also accept deposits\nalso up to a certain limit. The Cooperative Credit Societies can accept deposits from their members but\nnot from the general public. The Reserve Bank has regulated the method of accepting deposits only for f\nbanks, cooperative banks and NBFCs.\n\nPresently, the maximum rate of interest an NBFC can offer on deposits is 12.5 per cent. The interest\nmay be paid or compounded at rests not shorter than monthly rests. The NBFCs are allowed to accept\u2019\nrenew public deposits for a minimum period of 12 months and maximum period of 60 months. They can-\nnot accept deposits repayable on demand, cannot offer gifts/incentives or any other additional benefit to\nthe depositorsand should have minimum investment grade credit rating. The deposits with NBFCs are not\ninsured and the repayment of deposits by NBFCs is not guaranteed by the RBI.\n\nExemptions from Provisions of Chapter III B of the RBI Act, 1934:\n\nThe following institutions have been exempted from provisions of Chapter III B of the RBI Act, 1934\nwhich relates to obtaining certificate of registration, provisions relating to net owned funds and mainte-\nnance of percentage of assets and reserve funds:\n\ni.

NBFCs whose asset\nsize is of 500 croreor more as per the last audited balance sheet are considered as systemically important\nNBFCs.

As per\nthese guidelines, the business of an account aggregator will be entirely driven by information\ntechnology (IT). The account aggregator will not support any transaction in financial assets by\nits customers. The account aggregator will not undertake any business other than the business of\naccount aggregation. However, the deployment of investible surplus by the aggregator in instru-\nments which isnot for trading will be permitted. Pricing of services will be as per the board-\napproved policy of the account aggregator.\n\nThe account aggregator will ensure that the provision of services to a customer, who has\nmade a specific application for availing such services, will be backed by appropriate agreements/\n\nauthorizations between the aggregator, customer and financial service provider. The information\nwill be shared by the account aggregator only with the customer to whom it relates or any other\nperson authorized by the customer. The account aggregator will be bound by the terms and condi-\ntions of the licence (such as customer protection, grievance redressal, data security, audit control,\ncorporate governance and risk management framework). The account aggregator will have a\nCitizen Charter that explicitly guarantees the protection of the rights of customers.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Other Categories of NBFCs\n\nResiduary Non-banking Companies: RNBCs are a class of NBFCs that cannot be classified as\nequipmentleasing, hire purchase, loan, investment, nidhi, or chit fund companies, but which tap public\nsavingsby operating various deposit schemes, akin to recurring deposit schemes of banks. The deposit\nacceptanceactivities of these companies are governed by the provisions of Residuary Non-Banking\n\u2018Companies(Reserve Bank) Directions, 1987. Residuary Non-banking Companies (RNBCs) are required\nto be mandatorilyregistered with Reserve Bank of India RNBCs had a strong presence in the rural\nareas. Theymobilized a large amount of deposits from the rural population. They generally lent funds\nto groupcompanies, subsidiaries and associates which led to concentration of risk, thereby resulting in\nloanlosses and lack of public confidence. To safeguard the interest of depositors, the RBI directed RNBCsto\ninvest not less than 80 per cent of aggregate deposit liabilities as per the investment pattern prescribedby\nit and to entrust these securities to all public sector banks to be withdrawn only for payment of deposits.\n\nSubject to compliance with the investment pattern, they can invest 20 per cent of aggregate li: iesor\nten times its net owned fund, whichever is lower, in a manner decided by its board of directors.\n\nThe RNBCs are the only class of NBFCs for which the floor rate of interest for deposits is specified\nby the RBI while there is no upper limit prescribed for them. The floor interest rate prescribed is 3.5 per\ncent per annum (to be compounded annually) on daily deposit schemes and 5 per cent per annum (to be\ncompounded annually) on other deposit schemes of higher duration or term deposits. The RBI hasalso\nprescribed prudential norms for RNBCs. Compliance with prudential norms is mandatory and aprerequi-\nsite for acceptance of deposits. The RBI monitors and inspects these RNBCs from time to time.\n\nThere were three RNBCs registered with the RBI. The regulator converted one of the three com-\npanies with miniscule deposit into a non-deposit taking NBFC. The two large RNBCs such as Peerless\nGeneral Finance and Investment Company and Sahara Finance Limited haveagreed to migrate to another\nbusiness model and have wound up their operations.\n\nMutual Benefit Financial Companies: Mutual benefit financial companies (Nidhis) are NBFCs\nnotified under Section 620 A of the Companies Act, 1956, and primarily regulated by the department\nof company affairs (DCA) under the directions/guidelines issued by them under Section 637A of the\nCompanies Act, 1956. The Sabanayagam Committee on Nidhis defines Nidhi as a company formed\nwith the exclusive object of cultivating the habit of thrift, savings and functioning for the mutual benefit\nof members by receiving deposits only from individuals enrolled as members and by lending only to\nindividuals, also enrolled as members, and which functions as per notification and guidelines prescribed\nby the Department of Company Affairs (DCA). These companies are exempt from the core provisions\nof the RBI Act and NBFC directions relating tothe acceptance of public deposits. However, the Reserve\nBank is empowered to issue directions in mattersrelating to deposit acceptance activities and directions\nrelating to ceiling on interest rate.\n\nThey are also required to maintain register of deposits, furnish receipt to depositors, and submit returns\nto the RBI. In order to facilitate healthy functioning of Nidhi companies and restore the confidence of\nthe investing public, the Government of India constituted in March 2000, an expert committee under\nthe chairmanship of Shri P. Sabanayagam to suggest an appropriate policy framework for the overall\nimprovement of these companies. The committee submitted its report to the government on 28 September\n2000 which includedrecommendations such as entry point barriers, minimum capital funds, liquid assets\nrequirements, restrictions on dividend, ceiling on interest rates on deposit and loans, regulations of vari-\nous managerial aspects, disclosure norms, prudential norms, adequate supervisory framework, role of\nauditors, and other measures for protection of depositors\u2019 interest.\n\nMiscellaneous Non-banking Companies: Miscellaneous Non-banking Companies (MNBCs) are\ncompanies engaged in the chit fund business. The term \u2018deposit\u2019 as defined under Section 451(bb) of the\nReserve Bank of India Act, 1934, does not include subscription to chit funds. The chit fund companies\nare exempted from all the core provisions of Chapter IIIB of the RBI Act. The RBI regulates only the\ndeposits accepted by these companies, but it does not regulate their chit fund business. Chit fund company\nmeans a company managing, conducting or supervising, as foremen, agent or in any other capacity, chits\n\nas defined in Section 2 of the Chit Funds Act, 1982. Section 2(b) of the Chit Fund Act, 1982 defines a\nchit as a transaction whether called chit, chit fund, chitty, kuri or by any other name by or under which a\nperson enters into an agreement with a specified number of persons that every one of them shall subscribe\na certain sum of money (or a certain quantity of grain instead) by way of periodical instalments over a\ndefinite period and that each such subscriber shall, in his turn, as determinedbylot or by auction or by\ntender or in such other manner as may be specified in the chit agreement, be entitled to the prize amount.\n\nA transaction is not a chit within the meaning of this clause, if in such transaction some alone, but\nnot all, of the subscribers get the prize amount without any liability to pay future subscriptions; or all the\nsubscribers get the chit amount by turns with a liability to pay future subscriptions. Thechit fund business\nis administered by the respective state governments through the officesof registrars of chits. Chit fund\ncompanies, as per the Miscellaneous Non-banking Companies (Reserve Bank) Directions, can accept\ndeposits up to 25 per cent and 15 per cent of the net owned fund (NOF) from public and shareholders,\nrespectively, for a period of 6 months to 36 months, but cannot accept deposits repayable on demand/\nnotice.\n\nChit funds activity involves contributions by members in instalments by way of subscription to the\nchit and by rotation each member of the chit receives the chit amount. The subscriptions are specifically\nexcluded from the definition of deposits and cannot be termed as deposits. While chit funds may collect\nsubscriptions as above, they are prohibited by RBI from accepting deposits with effect from August 2009.\nChit fund companies are regulated under the Chit Fund Act, 1982, which is a central act, and is imple-\nmented by the State governments. In case any chit fund is accepting public deposits, RBI can prosecute\nsuch chit funds.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Regulation of NBFCs\n\nIn the 1960s, the RBI made an attempt to regulate NBFCs by issuing directions relating to the maximum\namount of deposits, the period of deposits, and rate of interest they could offer on the deposits accepted.\nNorms were laid down regarding maintenance of certain percentage of liquid assets, creation of reserve\nfunds, and transfer there to every year a certain percentage of profit, and so on. These directions and\nnorms were revised and amended from time to time. In 1977, the RBI issued two separate sets of guide-\nlines, namely, (i) NBFC Acceptance of Deposits Directions, 1977, for NBFCs and (ii) MNBD Directions,\n1977, for MNBCs. These directions were related to deposit-taking activities of NBFCs. The reserve bank\nmade an attempt to regulate the asset side of NBFCs in 1994 in pursuance of the Shah Committee recom-\nmendations. However, it was not empowered to regulate the asset side of NBFCs.\n\nNBFCs became prominent in the first half of the 1990s. The growth in aggregate deposits of NBFCs\noutpaced that of banks. However, bank finance to NBFCs dried up in 1995 after the RBI cautioned banks\nagainst such lending. Therefore, NBFCs had to depend on fixed deposits often at ratesup to 26 per cent.\nTo service high-cost deposits, NBFCs invested in bought-out deals, shares, real estate and corporate\nfinancing, the areas in wl they had little experience. The slackness in the capital and real estate mar-\nkets and general industrial activities resulted in sharp deterioration in NBFC\u2019s quality of assets. Crores of\nrupees of small investors disappeared overnight as NBFCs like CRB Capital Markets, JVG Finance, and\nPrudential Capital Markets failed in 1997. This shook the investor confidence which resulted in a rush\nof withdrawals of public deposits. This is the only sector which had a number of committees trying to\nregulate its working. The first was the Shah Committee in 1992. It was followed by the Shere Commit-\ntee, Khanna Committee and various committees of the RBI. In 1997, the RBI Act was amended and the\nReserve Bank was given comprehensive powers to regulate NBFCs. The amended act made it mandatory\nfor every NBFC to obtain a certificate of registration and have minimum net owned funds. Ceilings were\nprescribed for acceptance of deposits, capital adequacy, credit rating and net-owned funds. Net owned\nfund (NOF) of NBFCs is the aggregate of paid-up capital and free reserves, netted by (i) the amount of\naccumulated balance of loss; and (ii) the deferred revenue expenditure and other intangible assets, if any,\nand further reduced by investments in shares and loans and advances to (a) subsidiaries; (b) companies in\nthe same group and (c) other NBFCs, in excess of 10 per cent of owned fund. Norms relating to capital\nadequacy, credit rating exposure, asset classification and so on were laid down. The Reserve Bank also\ndeveloped a comprehensive system to supervise NBFCs accepting/holding public deposits. Directions\nwere also issued to the statutory auditors to report noncompliance with the RBI Act and regulations to\nthe RBI, board of directors and shareholders of the NBFCs. The task force constituted by Government\nof India under the Chairmanship of Shri C. M. Vasudev submitted its report on 28 October 1998, after\nreviewing the existing regulatory framework for NBFCs.\n\nThe Government of India framed the Financial Companies Regulation Bill, 2000; to implement\nthe recommendations requiring statutory changes, as also consolidatedthe law, relating to NBFCs and\n\n\nunincorporated bodies with a view to ensuring depositor protection. According to this bill, all the NBFCs\nwill be known as financial companies instead of NBFCs.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India has issued detailed directions on prudential norms, vide Non-Banking\nFinancial (Deposit Accepting or Holding) Companies Prudential Norms (Reserve Bank) Directions,\n2007, Non-Systemically Important Non-Banking Financial (non-deposit accepting or holding) Com-\npanies Prudential Norms (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2015 and Systemically Important Non-Banking\nFinancial (non-deposit accepting or holding) Companies Prudential Norms (Reserve Bank) Directions,\n2015. Applicable regulations vary based on the deposit acceptance or systemic importance of the NBFC.\nThe directions inter alia, prescribe guidelines on income recognition, asset classification and provision-\ning requirements applicable to NBFCs, exposure norms, disclosures in the balance sheet, requirement\nof capital adequacy, restrictions on investments in land and building and unquoted shares, loan to value\n(LTV) ratio for NBFCs predominantly engaged in business of lending against gold jewellery, besides oth-\ners. Deposit accepting NBFCs have also to comply with the statutory liquidity requirements,\n\nCapital Requirements: (1) Every applicable NBFC shall maintain a minimum capital ratio consisting\nof Tier I and Tier II capital which shall not be less than 15 per cent of its aggregate risk weighted assets\non-balance sheet and of risk adjusted value of off-balance sheet items. (2) The Tier I capital in respect of\napplicable NBFCs (other than NBFC-MFI and IDFNBFC), at any point of time, shall not be less than 8.5\nper centby 31 March 2016 and10 per centby 31 March 2017. (3) Applicable NBFCs primarily engaged in\nlending against gold jewellery (such loans comprising 50 per cent or more of their financial assets) shall\nmaintain a minimum Tier | capital of 12 per cent.\nThe regulation on non-deposit accepting NBFCs with asset size of less than 7500 crore is as follows:\n\ni. They shall not be subjected to any regulation either prudential or conduct of business regulations\nnamely, Fair Practices Code (FPC), KYC, etc., if they have not accessed any public funds and do\nnot have a customer interface.\n\nii, Those having customer interface will be subjected only to conduct of business regulations includ-\ning FPC, KYC, etc., if they are not accessing public funds.\n\niii. Those accepting public funds will be subjected to limited prudential regulations but not conduct\nof business regulations if they have no customer interface.\n\niv. Where both public funds are accepted and customer interface exist, such companies will be sub-\njected both to limited prudential regulations and conduct of business regulations.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Growth of NBFCs\n\nNBFCs in India have existed since long. They came into limelight in the second half of the 1980s and in\nthe first half of the 1990s. NBFCs flourished during the stock market boom of the early 1990s. In the ini-\ntial years of liberalization, they not only became prominent in a wide range of activities but they outpaced\nbanks in deposit rising owing to their customized services. They have backed many small entrepreneurs.\nThey have also lent small-ticket personal loans of size of \u20ac25,000 to customers and thereby fuelled the\nconsumption boom. Total assets/liabilities of NBFCs grew at an average annual rate of 36.7 per cent\nduring the 1990s (1991-98) as compared to 20.9 per cent during the 1980s (1981-91). The growing\nimportance of this segment and the surfacing of some scams compelled the RBI to increase this regula-\ntory attention.\n\nAlmost all corporate houses have set up their own NBFCS. Big banks also floated NBFCs to tap\ncertain segments on which restrictions were imposed by the regulator. Banks through the NBFCs could\ngenerously lend funds to promoters to raise theirholdings through a creeping acquisition. \u2018Citi Financial\u2019\nis one of the oldest foreign bank-owned NBFC and a pioneer in this segment. There has been an increase\nin the number of NBFCs, especially those floated by foreign banks as there are strictures on branch licens-\ning. The Reserve Bank tightened these NBFC norms in November 2006 to reduce the regulatory arbitrage\nbetween different financial sector players. According to the guidelines, non-deposit taking NBFCs which\nhave assets of over 100 crore will be subject to exposure and capital adequacy norms. Banks will not\nbe able to lend indiscriminately to them. Nor will they be allowed to hold more than 10 per cent equity\nstake in deposit-taking NBFCs. Moreover, the foreign banks with NBFC subsidiaries will be required to\ninclude the activities of their NBFC arms in their reporting to the Reserve Bank.\n\n\u2018Two sets of players such as small and large NBFCshave emerged in the market. The small NBFCs rely\nmore on deposit taking while large NBFCs focus on asset financing and rely less on deposit-taking. The\nlarge NBFCs, especially M & M Finance, DBS Cholamandalam Finance and Shriram Transport Finance\nhave specialized skills in credit intermediation and have a collective asset base of around 17,000 crore.\n\nThese NBFCs are the leaders in financing used and new commercial vehicles, tractors and automobiles.\nNBFCs such as Citibank and GE have built large consumer-focused asset portfolios by offering personal\nloans, insurance and various other services thereby directly competing with banks. Banks, too, are enter-\ning into high-yield and high-risk financing nichesegments of NBFCs. Banks have an edge over NBFCs\nas they have access to low-cost deposits while NBFCs have to rely more on high cost public deposits,\nbank and market borrowings to fund their balance sheets. Borrowings account for almost 65 per cent of\ntotal NBFC liabilities, of which, non-convertible debentures is a major component followed by bank bor-\nrowings. The NBFCs now borrow from mutual funds by placing debentures with them. Borrowing from\nmutual funds is simple as there are little or no margins. NBFCS get the debentures rated by a credit rating\nagency and a good rating helps them raise funds.\n\nThe NBFC sector continued to raise funds mainly through debentures, borrowings from banks and\ncommercial papers. The Reserve Bank also eased the norms for external commercial borrowings (ECBs)\nfor NBFCs that lend to the infrastructure sector, to raise ECBs with a minimum maturity of five years. In\naddition, the Reserve Bank also allowed NBFCs to raise funds through rupee denominated bonds over-\nseas. Public deposits garnered by NBFCs-D have been showing a rising trend since 2010.\n\nConsolidation has taken place within the NBFC sector resulting in a reduction in the number of both\nNBFCs-D and NBFCs-ND-SI. Their assets continued to register substantial growth. The accelerated\ngrowth in credit deployment by NBFCs was due to their ability to contain risks and tap demand in niche\nmarkets. The profitability of NBFCs was significantly higher as compared to commercial banks and their\nNPAs have grown but have remained low compared to the banks.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "CONCLUSION\n\nNBFCs in India have become prominent in a wide range of activities like hire purchase finance, equip-\nment lease finance, loans and investments. NBFCs have greater reach and flexibility in tapping resources.\n\nIn desperate times, NBFCs could survive owing to their aggressive character and customized services.\nNBFCs are doing more fee-based business than fund-based. They are focusing now on retail sector,\nhousing finance, personal loans and marketing of insurance. Many of the NBFCs have ventured into the\ndomain of mutual funds and insurance. NBFCs undertake both life and general insurance business as joint\nventure participants in insurance companies. The strong NBFCs have successfully emerged as \u2018financial\ninstitutions\u2019 in a short span of time and are in the process of converting themselves into \u2018financial super-\nmarket\u2019, a one-stop financial shop. The NBFCs are taking initiatives to establish a self-regulatory organi-\nzation (SRO). At present, NBFCs are represented by the Association of Leasing and Financial Services\n(ALPS), Federation of Indian Hire Purchase Association (FIHPA), and Equipment Leasing Association\nof India (ELA). The RBI wants these three industry bodies to come together under one roof. The RBI has\nemphasized the formation of SRO particularly for the benefit of smaller NBFCs.\n\nThe NBFC sector assumes a critical role in financial inclusion as it caters to a wide range of financial\nactivities particularly in areas where commercial banks have limited penetration. NBFCs are expected to\nplay a crucial role in fostering inclusive growth, especially in sectors like MSMEs.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe quality of assets held by banks and financial institutions is a critical indicator of\nthe health of the financial system. A high quality of assets reflects the level of bank\u2019s\ncredit risk and efficiency in allocation of resources to productive sectors. The quality of\nassets has been deteriorating in case of both banks and financial institutions which has\nbecome an area of grave concern. While credit growth is one of the drivers of economic\ngrowth, NPAs are value destroyers of the economy. Non-performing assets alone do\nnot reflect the bad quality of assets of the banking system. Banks and financial institu-\ntions restructure some default loans by extending the repayment period or reducing the\ninterest rate. Hence a new broad category in the form of stressed assets consisting of\nNPAs, restructured loans and written -off assets has come into existence. According to\nan RBI report, the stressed assets ratio (ratio of stressed assets to gross advances) stood\nat 12.2 per cent at the end of June 2016, of which 8.6 per cent of loans are gross non-\nperforming assets (GNPAs) and an additional 3.6 per cent are restructured loans. The\ntotal stressed asset stock in India as on March 2017 excluding state financial corpora-\ntions, mutual funds, and the insurance sector is around %8,00,000 crore and this works\nout to 9.6 per cent of the GDP. Due to banks being saddled with high non-performing\nassets and low demand for credit from the corporate sector, the credit growth in finan-\ncial year 2016-17 of 5.08 per cent is the lowest since 1953-54. The large amount of\nNPAs predominantly originate from the industrial sector. But retail loans, infrastructure\nloans and agriculture loans account for bulk of the addition to NPAs.\n\nThe Narasimham Committee report notes, \u2018No other single indicator reflects the quality\nof assets and their impact on banks\u2019 viability, than the NPA figure in relation to advances\u2019.\nNon-performing assets (NPAs) are loans given by a bank or a financial institution wherein\nthe borrower defaults or delays interest or principal payments. According to the RBI norms,\nany interest or loan repayment delayed beyond 90 days has to be identified as a non perform-\ning asset. Non-performing assets are categorized into sub-standard, doubtful and loss assets\nfor which provisions have to be made in the lender's books. Under the prudential norms laid\ndown by the RBI, income should not be recognized on NPAs on an accrual basis but should\nbe booked only when it is actually received in respect of such accounts. Any NPA would\nmigrate from sub-standard to doubtful category after 12 months. It would get classified as\na loss asset if it is irrecoverable or marginally collectible. With effect from March 31, 2016\nan asset would be classified as doubtful if it remained in the sub-standard category for 12\nmonths. The banks should make full provision for loss assets, 100 per cent of the unsecured\nportion of the doubtful asset and 20 per cent to 100 per cent of the secured portion depending\nupon the period for which the asset has remained doubtful. If the asset has remained doubtful\nfor one year, the provisioning requirement is 25 per cent; if doubtful up to three years, the\nprovisioning requirement is 40 per cent and for more than three years, it is 100 per cent with\neffect from March 31, 2005 (refer Annexure 14.1).\n\nThe Gross NPAs of the scheduled commercial banks has increased in absolute terms\n\u2018on account of hardening of interest rates and higher housing loans at floating interest rate\ncharges. The NPAs of the new private sector banks and foreign banks have increased due to\ntheir higher exposures in real estate and housing sectors. The share of priority sector, espe-\ncially agriculture sector\u2019s share in total NPAs has increased.\n\n\nAlthough the NPA ratio in the priority sector was consistently higher than the NPA ratio in the non-\npriority sector, deterioration in asset quality during 2016-17 was primarily on account of the non-priority\nsector. There has been a steady deterioration on in asset quality of industry and infrastructure which\naccount for about half and one third of the total credit and total industrial credit respectively\n",

The Sick\nIndustries Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985 was enacted to provide a framework for the reha-\nbilitation and revival of sick industrial companies through the board for industrial and financial recon-\nstruction so as to enable inter alia release of public funds that are locked up in such companies. This act\nwas not only unable to provide a speedy and efficient mechanism for rehabilitation and revival of the sick\ncompanies, but also provided companies with a \u2018safe haven\u2019 for defaulting.\n\nNow banks and financial institutions saddled with bad loans have multiple options like direct settle-\nment across the table, legal recourse in the form of approaching the high court or debt recovery tribu-\nnals, enforcement of the new securitization law (where securities pledged with them could be attached\nand subsequently sold), and lastly selling it to asset reconstruction companies (ARCs).\n\nAmong the various channels of recovery available to banks for dealing with bad loans, the amount\nrecovered as percentage of amount involved was the highest under the SARFAESI Act, followed by\nLok Adalats during 2012-13. NPAs recovered through this Act accounted for about 80 per cent of\nthe total amount of NPAs.\n\nHowever, there was a deceleration in the recovery of NPAs during 2015-16 on account of a reduc-\ntion in recovery through the SARFAESI channel by 52 per cent, while recovery through Lok Adalats\nand DRTs increased.\n",

After the enactment of\nthe Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interests Act\n(SARFAESI Act), borrowers could become first applicants before the DRTs.

The\ncorporate debt should be outside the purview of the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction\n(BIFR), DRT, or other legal proceedings. The objective of the scheme is to enable corporates affected\nby certain internal/external factors to restructure their debt through an orderly and coordinated debtor\u2014\ncreditor agreement and inter-creditor agreement which results in preserving their viability and minimizing\nlosses to creditors/other stakeholders. This scheme enables speedy disposal of restructuring proposals of\nlarge corporate borrowers engaged in any type of activity and availing finance from more than one bank/\nFl/under multiple banking/syndication/consortium system of lending. CDR is a non-statutory mechanism\nwhich is a voluntary system based on Debtor-Creditor Agreement (DCA) and Inter-Creditor Agreement\n(ICA). The Inter-Creditor Agreement would be a legally binding agreement amongst the creditors, with\nnecessary enforcement and penal clauses, wherein the creditors would commit themselves to abide by the\nvarious elements of CDR system.\n\nThe eligibility criteria has been broadened to include recovery suit-filed cases by the creditors against\nthe company provided the proposal to restructure is supported by 75 per cent of the lenders by value\nand 60 per cent of creditors (by number); large erstwhile BIFR cases to be decided by CDR Core Group\non a case-to-case basis provided that the lending institutions complete all the formalities in seeking the\napproval from BIFR before implementing the package; cases involving frauds or diversion of funds with-\nout malafide intent may be admitted for restructuring with the approval of the Core Group only.\n\nReference to Corporate Debt Restructuring System could be triggered by (i) any or more of the credi-\ntor who have minimum 20 per cent share in either working capital or term finance, or (ii) by the concerned\ncorporate, if supported by a bank or financial institution having stake as in (i) above.\n\nCDR has a three-tier structure consisting of the CDR Standing Forum and its core Group (the policy-\nmaking body), CDR Empowered Group (the functional group deciding on the restructuring of cases referred\nto CDR mechanism) and the CDR Cell (the secretariat to the CDR system). The CDR Standing Forum\nis the representative general body of all financial institutions and banks participating in CDR system. Its\nfunction is to lay down policies and guidelines, and monitor the progress of corporate debt restructuring.\nIt also provides an official platform for both the creditors and borrowers (by consultation) to amicably and\ncollectively evolves policies and guidelines for working out debt restructuring plans in the interests of all\nconcerned. The CDR Core Group, which is carved out of the CDR Standing Forum, lays down the policies\nand guidelines to be followed by the CDR Empowered Group and CDR Cell for debt restructuring. It also\nprescribes the PERT chart for processing of cases referred to the CDR system and decides on the modalities\nfor enforcement of the time frame. The CDR Empowered Group looks into each case of debt restructuring,\nexamines the viability and rehabilitation potential of the Company and approves the restructuring pack-\nage within a specified time frame of 90 days, or at best within 180 days of reference to the Empowered\nGroup. The CDR Empowered Group takes into consideration parameters such as return on capital employed\n(ROCE), debt service coverage ratio (DSCR), gap between the internal Rate of Return (IRR) and the Cost\nof Fund (CoF), and the extent of sacrifice to decide on the acceptable viability benchmark levels applied on\na case-by-case basis. The decisions of the CDR Empowered Group shall be final. If restructuring of debt\nis found to be viable and feasible and approved by the Empowered Group, the company would be put on\nthe restructuring mode. If restructuring is not found viable, the creditors would then be free to take neces-\nsary steps for immediate recovery of dues and/or liquidation or winding up of the company, collectively or\nindividually. The CDR Standing Forum and the CDR Empowered Group are assisted by a CDR Cell in all\ntheir functions. The lead institution/major stakeholder to the corporate works out a preliminary restructur-\ning plan in consultation with other stakeholders and submits it to the CDR Cell within one month. The\nCDR Cell will prepare the restructuring plan in terms of the general policies and guidelines approved by\nthe CDR Standing Forum and place for consideration of the Empowered Group within 30 days for decision.\n\u2018The Empowered Group can approve or suggest modifications but ensure that a final decision is taken within\na total period of 90 days. However, for sufficient reasons the period can be extended up to a maximum of\n180 days from the date of reference to the CDR Cell.\n\nThe guidelines allow accounts to be categorized as standard, sub-standard or doubtful for restructur-\ning and independent consultants to help in preparing the restructuring plan. The main features of the\nguidelines are the introduction of two types of restructuring under the CDR System. Accounts which are\nclassified as \u2018standard\u2019 and \u2018sub-standard\u2019 would be restructured under the first category (Category I)\nwhereas accounts classified as \u2018doubtful\u2019 would be restructured under the second category (Category II).\n\nThe Category 1 CDR system is applicable only to accounts classified as \u2018standard\u2019 and \u2018sub-standard.\u2019\nIf the account has been classified as \u2018standard\u2019/\u2018substandard\u2019 in the books of at least 90 per cent of credi-\ntors (by value), the same would be treated as standard/substandard, only for the purpose of judging the\naccount as eligible for CDR, in the books of the remaining 10 per cent of creditors. There would be no\nrequirement of the account/company being sick, NPA or being in default for a specified period before\nreference to the CDR system. However, potentially viable cases of NPAs will get priority. This approach\nprovides the necessary flexibility and facilitates timely intervention for debt restructuring.\n\nOne of the most important elements of Debtor-Creditor Agreement is \u2018stand still\u2019 agreement binding\nfor 90 days, or 180 days by both sides. Under this clause, both the debtor and creditor(s) shall agree to\na legally binding \u2018stand-still\u2019 whereby both the parties commit themselves not to take recourse to any\nother legal action during the \u2018stand-still\u2019 period. This would be necessary for enabling the CDR System\nto undertake the necessary debt restructuring exercise without any outside intervention, judicial or other-\nwise. However, the stand-still clause will be applicable only to any civil action either by the borrower or\nany lender against the other party and will not cover any criminal action.\n\nAdditional finance, if any, is to be provided by all creditors of a \u2018standard\u2019 or \u2018substandard account\u2019\nirrespective of whether they are working capital or term creditors, on a pro-rata basis. In case for any\ninternal reason, any creditor (outside the minimum 75 per cent and 60 per cent) does not wish to commit\n\nadditional financing, that creditor will have an option in accordance with the provisions. Such creditor\ncan either (a) arrange for its share of additional finance to be provided by a new or existing creditor, or\n(b) agree to the deferment of the first year\u2019s interest due to it after the CDR package becomes effective.\nThe providers of additional finance, whether existing creditors or new creditors, shall have a preferential\nclaim, to be worked out under the restructuring package, over the providers of existing finance with\nrespect to the cash flows out of recoveries, in respect of the additional exposure.\n\nThe lenders who wish to exit from the package would have the option to sell their existing share\nto either the existing lenders or fresh lenders, at an appropriate price, which would be decided mutu-\nally between the exiting lender and the taking over lender The new lenders shall rank on par with the\nexisting lenders for repayment and servicing of the dues since they have taken over the existing dues\nto the exiting lender In order to bring more flexibility in the exit option, One Time Settlement can\nalso be considered, wherever necessary, as a part of the restructuring package. If an account with any\ncreditor is subjected to One Time Settlement (OTS) by a borrower before its reference to the CDR\nmechanism, any fulfilled commitments under such OTS may not be reversed under the restructured\npackage. Further payment commitments of the borrower arising out of such OTS may be factored into\nthe restructuring package.\n\nThere have been instances where the projects have been found to be viable by the creditors but the\naccounts could not be taken up for restructuring under the CDR system as they fell under \u2018doubtful\u2019 cat-\negory. Hence, a second category of CDR is introduced for cases where the accounts have been classified as\n\u2018doubtful\u2019 in the books of creditors, and ifa minimum of 75 per cent of creditors (by value) and 60 per cent\ncreditors (by number) satisfy themselves of the viability of the account and consent for such restructuring.\nIt will not be binding on the creditors to take up additional financing worked out under the debt restructur-\ning package and the decision to lend or not to lend will depend on each creditor bank/FI separately. In other\nwords, under the proposed second category of the CDR mechanism, the existing loans will only be restruc-\ntured and it would be up to the promoter to firm up additional financing arrangement with new or existing\ncreditors individually. The other conditions are similar to conditions applicable to category I.\n\nCDR is a popular mechanism among lenders as it avoids delays in multiple lender arrangements and\nincreases transparency in the process. A recent review of the operation of the scheme by the RBI revealed\nthat nearly one-third of the units assisted under the scheme improved their financial position. Banks\nand financial institutions have restructured more than %1,00,000 debts through financial restructuring,\nbusiness restructuring and operational restructuring. Financial restructuring includes extension of loan\nmaturity, reduction of interest rates, write-off principal or debt to equity/convertible bond swap. Busi-\nness restructuring comprises of sale of assets or business units, spin-off business division or mergers and\namalgamations. Operational restructuring includes changes in company management, asset sales, special\naudits and divestiture and/or liquidation of non-viable and non-core assets.\n\nBanks have also successfully used the threat of invoking the SARFAESI Act to recast troubled\ncompanies via the CDR mechanism and relieve the stress in their asset books. Under this arrangement,\na company\u2019s debt is recast if 75 per cent of the lenders (in terms of value) agree to do so. The lenders\nnormally compromise on the interest rates and stretch the maturity profile of debt while borrowers too\nsacrifice in terms of converting part of their debt into equity, offering high collaterals and pumping in\nfresh money.\n\nThe RBI issued guidelines on the CDR mechanism for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) on 9\nSeptember 2005. A small-scale industry is defined as one with investment in plant and machinery not\nexceeding % one crore, while medium enterprises are those with an investment not exceeding 210 crore.\nAccording to the RBI norms:\n\n* The CDR package would be available to all corporate and non-corporate SMEs irrespective of their\nlevel of dues with banks and even if they have banking facilities from only one bank.\n\n* The repayment schedule should not exceed 10 years and banks should consider a proposal only if\nthey are of the view that the unit could be viable in seven years.\n\n+ Accounts involving willful default, fraud and malfeasance would not be eligible for restructuring under\nthese guidelines. Banks will also refrain from restructuring loans of companies categorized as loss accounts.\n\n+ If the borrowers outstanding is fully covered by tangible security, the rescheduling of instalments of\nprincipal amount would not result in down-grading the account to substandard category. However,\ntangible security is not required when the outstanding is %5 lakh.\n\n+ If the bank writes off or makes provision on the interest component in terms of present value, the\nrestructured account need not be downgraded to sub-standard category.\n\n* The provision made towards interest sacrifice should be created by debit to profit and loss account\nand held in a distinct account. For this purpose, the future interest due as per the bank\u2019s current\n\nprime lending rate should be discounted to the present value at a rate appropriate to the risk category\nof the borrower (i.e., current PLR plus the appropriate term premium and credit risk premium for\nthe borrower category) and compared with the present value of the dues expected to be received\nunder the restructuring package, discounted on the same basis.\n\n* The sacrifice made by banks on such SME accounts would have to be recomputed on each balance sheet\ndate till satisfactory completion of all repayment obligations and full repayment of the outstanding.\n\n+ Banks should also provide for the shortfall in provision or reverse the amount of excess provision\nheld in the distinct account.\n\nThe success of CDR depends on successful turnaround of the company, which requires a disciplined\napproach and board oversight function. Even though it has been a popular recourse amongst the lender\ncommunity, lenders have faced difficulties in its successful implementation due to lack of adequate exper-\ntise, time and resources to run the distressed company. Also, a significantly discounted price expected by\npotential buyers, given the \u2018fire sale\u2019, unsustainable levels of debt and lack of reliable information to make\na value assessment have made it difficult for lenders to find new promoters\n",

As per the RBI guidelines on detection\nof willful defaults, a willful default occurs when a borrower defaults in meeting its obligations to the\nlender when it has a capacity to honour the obligations or when funds have been utilized for purposes\nother than those for which finance was granted.\n\nThe RBI publishes a list of borrowers with outstanding aggregating %1 crore and above and against\nwhom suits have been filed by banks and financial institutions for recovery of their funds as on\nMarch 31 every year. The banks have to submit a list of willful defaulters to the SEBI also so as to pre-\nvent their access to capital markets. The RBI has also advised public sector banks to examine all cases of\nwillful default of 2 one crore and above and file criminal suits in such cases. A willful defaulter does not\nget any new loans from Fls. Also, promoters are not allowed to raise resources for floating new ventures\nfor five years from the date of the Reserve Bank publishing their names in the list of willful defaulters.\n\nBanks and financial institutions are required to form a committee of higher functionaries headed by\nthe executive director for classification of borrowal accounts as willful defaulters, and create a redressal\nmechanism in the form of a committee headed by the chairman and the managing director to be carried\nout through two distinct processes, namely, (i) identification of default as \u2018willful\u2019 based on the prescribed\nnorms through a committee approach, and (ii) suitably advising the borrower about the proposal to classify\nhim as willful defaulter, along with the reasons thereof.

                        "extracted-text": "SARFAESI Act\n\nThe government enacted the Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of\nSecurity Interest SARFAESI Act, 2002 for enforcement of security interest for realization of dues without\nthe intervention of courts or tribunals. This act is a step towards bringing down the level of risk in the\nsystem and encouraging banks to lend.\n\nThe act deals with the following aspects: (i) securitization, (ii) asset reconstruction, and (iii) security\nenforcement. These three concepts have been interwoven to deal effectively with the problem of NPAs.\nSecuritization is conversion of a financial or non-financial asset into securities. These assets may be\nhealthy or unhealthy (non-performing). Asset reconstruction is a financial tool for corporate debt restruc-\nturing and financial rehabilitation through rebundling, takeovers or sale. Enforcement of security interest\nconfers the right on lenders to foreclose a non-performing loan.\n\nThe act has defined certain key terms relating to the above three concepts. Section 2 (1) (2d) defines a\n\u2018secured creditor\u2019 as a bank or a financial institution and including a debenture trustee appointed by the said\nbank/financial institution and an ARC/SC, in whose favour security interest is created for due payment by a\nborrower of any financial assistance. The term \u2018security interest\u2019 is defined as covering any right, title, inter-\nest of any kind upon property created in favour of the secured creditor. The definition of \u2018financial asset\u201d\nincludes claims to debt or receivables, secured or unsecured, any debt or receivable secured by mortgage,\ncharge, hypothecation of movable property or any beneficial interest in property. The term \u2018securitization\u2019\n\nis defined as acquisition of financial assets by any securitization company or reconstruction company from\nany organization whether by raising of funds by such securitization company or reconstruction company\nfrom qualified institutions buyers by issue of security receipts representing undivided interest in such finan-\ncial assets or otherwise. \u2018Obligor\u2019 is defined as a person liable to the originator to pay a financial asset or\ndischarge any obligation is respect of the financial asset. Originator is the owner of the financial asset which\nis to be acquired by an SC/ARC and security receipt or security issued by an SC/ARC to a qualified institu-\ntional buyer pursuant to a scheme evidencing acquisition by the holder of an undivided right, title or interest\nin the financial asset. \u2018Securitization company\u2019 is a company formed and registered under the Companies\nAct, 1956 for the purpose of securitization/asset reconstruction respectively.\n\nThe act permits a secured creditor whose debt has become an NPA to issue a notice to the borrower\nrequiring the borrower in writing to discharge his dues within 60 days. In case the borrower fails to dis-\ncharge his liability within 60 days of issue of the notice, the act permits the secured creditors to enforce\ntheir security interest provided that in case of financial asset held by more than one financial creditor or\njoint financing of the financial asset by secured creditors, not less than 75 per cent of the secured credi-\ntors agree. The secured creditor is entitled to take one or more of the following measures as mentioned in\nSection 13 (4) of the ordinance:\n\n* Take over possession of the secured assets of the borrower including right to transfer by way of\nlease, assignment or sale.\n\n* Take over the management of the secured assets of the borrower including the right to transfer by\nway of lease, assignment or sale.\n\n+ Appoint any person as a manager (such person could be the ARC if they do not accept any pecuniary lia-\nbility) to manage the secured assets the possession of which has been taken over by the secured creditor.\n\n+ Require at any time by notice in writing to any person who has acquired any of the secured assets\nfrom the borrower and from whom any money is due or may became due to the borrower, to pay the\nsecured creditor, so much of the money as is sufficient to pay the secured debt.\n\nThe secured creditors are required to get valuation of the assets taken over under Section 13 (4) of the\nact. They can then sell off the assets through any of the following routes:\n\n+ By obtaining quotations from persons dealing in such assets or otherwise interested in buying the assets.\n+ By inviting tenders from the public.\n\n+ By holding public auctions.\n\n+ By private treaty.\n\n\u2018The bargaining power of lenders has improved after the enactment of SARFAESI Act.\n\nThe act does not apply to unsecured loans, loans below %1,00,000 nor to loans where the remaining\nprincipal due is less than 20 per cent of the amount advanced.\n\nThe Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest\n(SARFAESI) Act has given banks and FIs a much needed tool to recover bad debt. Along with this\ncame the corporate debt restructuring (CDR) package, where both lenders and borrowers sit across\nthe table and recast stressed debt for the benefit of both the parties. This is the classic carrot and stick\napproach\u2014if borrowers are not willing to come to the discussion table, the SARFAESI sword hangs\nover their heads.\n\nThe act also introduces another global trend to the Indian credit market; the establishment of ARC\nto recover distressed assets. The banks can now clean up their books by selling assets to ARCs at a dis-\ncounted price or taking over the assets of a defaulter and selling them to recover their dues without resort-\ning to long-winded legal procedures. The first ARC ARCIL acquired 8.3 per cent of gross non-performing\nbonds during 2005-06. ARCIL took over %20,000 crore of sticky assets from the Indian financial system\nby March 2006. Banks can also generate funds locked in the existing assets through securitization, i.e.,\nissuing bonds against the security of assets. Moreover, the act no longer allows any reference to be made\nto the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR)\u2014a traditional haven for promoters of\nsick companies. However, the act suffers from certain ambiguities such as the problem of stamp duty and\nlarger powers granted to creditors.\n\n\u2018The SARFAESI Act later got into legal wrangles before the supreme court on the issue of Mardia Chem-\nicals. Mardia Chemicals challenged the provisions of the act in the supreme court. The supreme court, in its\njudgement dated April 8, 2004, upheld the constitutional validity of the act and its provisions except a sub-\nsection (2) of Section 17 under Section 17 of the ordinance, the borrower has no right of appeal when notice\nis issued u/s.13(2) upto the stage when measures have been taken u/s.13(4). The supreme court declared\nSection 17 (2) as unconstitutional and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India.\n\nThe Apex Court struck down Section 17 (2) of the said act which requires pre-deposit of 75 per cent\nof the amount claimed by the secured creditor. However, in reality, the court transposed these powers to\nbe vested with DRTs who, in turn, could impose conditions as they deem fit and proper having regard to\nthe facts and circumstances of the case. In other words, DRTs can play a significant role in disciplining\nwillful defaulters by specifically requiring them to furnish security in the form of deposit of such sums\nas they deem proper before proceeding to stay the action initiated by the secured creditor, having regard\nto the conduct of the borrower. As such, the decision of striking down Section 17 (2) would not majorly\ndilute the legislative intent in disciplining the defaulters.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Asset Reconstruction Companies\n\nThe SARFAESI Act, 2002 paved the way for setting up asset reconstruction companies (ARCs) under\nSection 30 of the act. ARC is setup to help the banks and financial institutions to clean up their balance\nsheets. Asset reconstruction company is also known as securitization company (SC) or reconstruction\ncompany (RC) which tries and resurrects bad loans into good ones.\n\nARC is an important constituent of the financial system because of the following reasons:\n\n+ Isolates non-performing loans from the balance sheets of banking and financial institutions and\nthereby enable them to focus on their core activities.\n+ Facilitates development of market for distressed assets.\n\nAn ARC is registered under the Companies Act and regulated by the RBI as a non-banking financial\ncompany [w/s. 451 (f) (iii) of RBI Act, 1934].\n\nThe functions of an ARC are specified in RBI Notification No. DNBS 2/CGM (CSM) 2003, dated\nApril 23, 2003 and they are as follows:\n\n+ Acquisition of financial assets (as defined w/s.2 (L) of the SARFAESI Act.\n\n+ Change or take over of management/sale or lease of business of the borrower (as per the guidelines\nto be issued by the RBI in this behalf).\n\n+ Rescheduling of debts.\n\n+ Enforcement of security interest (as per Section 13 (4) of the SARFAESI Act, 2002.\n\n+ Settlement of dues payable by the borrower.\n\nThe SARFAESI Act vests the RBI with the powers to register such companies and frame regula-\ntions for their functioning, covering areas, such as, registration, owned fund, prudential norms, capital\nadequacy, aggregate value and type of assets to be acquired. Based on the recommendations of the two\n\nworking groups constituted by the RBI to address the above issues, guidelines and directions have been\nissued to securitization or reconstruction companies on April 23, 2003. Following are the main features\nof the SCs/RCs:\n\nSCs/RCs seeking registration with the RBI are required to have a minimum owned fund of\n%2 crore. This has now been raised to 15 per cent of the assets acquired or 100 crore\nwhichever is less.\n\nSuch SCs/RCs can undertake both securitization and asset reconstruction activities. While SCs/RCs\nnot registered with the RBI can carry out the business of securitization and asset reconstruction\noutside the purview of the SARFAESI Act, they would not be able to exercise the powers of enforce-\nment provided for in the SARFAESI Act.\n\nSCs/RCs registered with the RBI would confine their activities to the business of securitization and\nasset reconstruction and such other activities as permitted under the SARFAESI Act. Carrying out\nany other business would require RBI approval. Companies carrying out any other business are to\ncease to undertake such activities by June 20, 2003.\n\nSCs/RCs should not accept deposits (as defined under Section 58 A of the Companies Act, 1956). It\ncan issue bonds and debentures for meeting its funding needs.\n\nWhile change or take-over of management/sale or lease of business of the borrower is provided for\nin the SARFAESI Act, SCs/RCs cannot exercise these powers until the RBI issues necessary guide-\nlines in this regard.\n\nEvery SC/RC shall frame an asset acquisition policy with the approval of their board within 90 days\nof grant of certificate of registration (CoR) by the RBI. This should, inter alia, provide norms and\nprocedure for acquisition of financial assets, types and desirable profile of the assets, valuation of\nassets and delegation of powers.\n\nSCs/RCs may reschedule and settle the debts payable by the borrower in terms of a policy framed\nby their boards in regard thereto.\n\nSCs/RCs should formulate a plan for realization of assets, which clearly spell out the steps proposed\nto reconstruct the assets and realise the same within a specified time frame, which shall not in any\ncase exceed five years from the date of acquisition.\n\nSCs/RCs may raise funds from qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) by way of issue of security\nreceipts, as per policy framed in this regard, through one or more trusts set up for this purpose. The\nsecurity receipts, to be issued on private placement basis, can be transferred only amongst QIBs.\nSC/RCs, may, as a sponsor or for the purpose of establishing a joint venture, invest in the equity share\ncapital of another SC/RC for the purpose of asset reconstruction. Surplus funds available may be\ndeployed in government securities and deposits with scheduled commercial banks in terms of a policy\nframed in this regard by their board. Investments in land and buildings can be made only out of funds\nborrowed and/or owned funds in excess of the minimum prescribed owned fund of %two crore.\nPrudential norms covering capital adequacy, income recognition, asset classification, valuation of\ninvestments and provisioning, shall be applicable to the assets borne on the balance sheet of such\ncompanies.\n\nEvery SC/RC should classify the assets on its balance sheet into standard and non-performing\nassets, and the non-performing assets further into sub-standard assets, doubtful assets and loss\nassets. Provisioning is to be made at the rate of 10 per cent and 50 per cent (100 per cent to the\nextent the asset is not covered by the estimated value of the security) in respect of substandard assets\nand doubtful assets, respectively. Loss assets are to be written off. If loss assets are retained in the\nbooks for any reason, provisions are to be made to the full extent.\n\nAll investments made by the SCs/RCs are to be valued at the lower of cost or realisable value.\nSCs/RCs should maintain, on an ongoing basis, a capital adequacy ratio, which shall not be less than\n15 per cent of its total risk-weighted assets.\n\nSCs/RCs are, inter alia to make disclosures in the balance sheet and offer document in the form of\nfinancial details, interest rate/probable yield, redemption details including servicing arrangements,\ncredit rating, if any, description of assets backing the security receipts.\n\nAsset reconstruction companies should have owned funds of not less than 15 per cent of the assets\nacquired or 7100 crore, whichever is less. This requirement has been stipulated to enable ARCs to have a\nsound capital base and a stake in the management of the NPAs acquired. Further, the ARCs should main-\ntain on an ongoing basis, a minimum capital adequacy of 15 per cent of its risk-weighted assets. They\nhave been granted a maximum realization time frame of five years from the date of the acquisition of the\nassets. The minimum owned fund has to be maintained irrespective of whether the assets are transferred\n\nto a trust set up for the purpose of securitization or not, and until realization of assets and redemption of\n\u2018SRs issued against such assets.\n",

ARCs are also allowed to function as a manager of collateral assets taken over by the\nlenders under security enforcement rights available to them as a recovery agent for any bank/institution.\nSince the date of acquisitions of assets, ARCs are given a resolution time frame of maximum five years.\nAs per the act, to discharge its function of asset reconstruction, an ARC can undertake (i) enforcement\nof security interest; (ii) takeover or change the management of the borrower; (iii) undertake sale or lease\nof the borrowers\u2019 business; and (iv) enter into settlements and reschedule the debt. However, as per the\nSARFAESI act, for enforcement of security interest, at least 75 per cent of the secured creditors need to\nagree to exercise this right.\n\nFor speedier resolution of NPAs, financial assets due from a single debtor to various banks/FIs may\nbe considered for acquisition. Similarly, financial assets having linkages to the same collateral may be\nconsidered for acquisition to ensure relatively faster and easy realization. As per the guidelines, the valu-\nation process should be uniform for assets of same profile and a standard valuation method should be\nadopted to ensure that the valuation of the financial assets is done in a scientific and objective manner.\nValuation may be done internally and or by engaging an independent agency, depending upon the value of\nthe assets involved. The acquired assets may be sold by inviting quotations from persons dealing in such\nassets, by inviting tenders from the public, by holding public auctions or by private treaty. While there is\nno restriction on ARCs to acquire assets which are considered to be unrealisable, as per the guidelines to\nbanks, ARCs will normally not takeover such assets and will act as an agent for recovery on a fee basis\nfor these assets.\n\nThe Government has allowed 100 per cent foreign direct investment (FDI) in asset reconstruction\ncompanies (ARCs) under the automatic route. However, some conditions have been set, including the\nstipulation that the total shareholding of individual foreign institutional investors/foreign portfolio inves-\ntors must be below 10 per cent of the total paid-up capital.\n\nAlso, FIV/FPIs have been permitted to invest up to 100 per cent of each tranche in security receipts\nissued by ARCs, subject to RBI directions/guidelines.\n\nThe investment limit of a sponsor in the shareholding of an ARC will be governed by the provision of\nthe Sarfaesi law, as amended from time to time.\n\nThis is expected to boost companies which are struggling for funds, as banks refuse to give steep\ndiscounts on stressed assets and the ARCs have to make upfront payment of 15 per cent of the cost of the\nasset. This will increase the participation of ARCs in revival of stressed assets.\n",

The norms on trading of bad loans\nstipulate that the loan should be sold without recourse.\n\nA bank selling its loans to another bank receives hard cash and the loan moves out completely from\nthe seller's book. Acquirers of bad loans are those banks who have low NPAs and are confident of turn-\ning around such assets on the strengths of their own resolution skills and also finding a scope for capital\nappreciation and higher returns, While acquiring such stressed assets, the acquirer takes into account\nthe underlying value of the assets pledged as security, the potential time period for recovery, the amount\nwhich can be realized from that account and exclusive rights, if any, over the pledged security.

Moreover, increased competition has driven these institutions to focus more on credit\ngrowth. Credit growth is associated with credit risk. These institutions have to take due diligence when\ngranting credit so that there is no credit default which results in funds being locked-up in non-performing\nassets. Good credit decisions depend upon the availability of comprehensive credit information regarding\nborrowers. Hence, a need was felt for an institution which would provide credit-related information to\nlending institutions by maintaining a data base of all borrowers.\n\nIn developed financial markets there are specialized financial institutions, known as credit-bureaus,\nthat maintain records of credit histories of individuals and business entities. They are usually set up by\nlenders\u2014mostly banks and credit card companies. Whenever an individual seeks a loan from a bank\nor finance company the lender before extending the loan checks his credit profile with the bureau to\nfind out whether the borrower has defaulted with any other lender and whether he is capable of settling\nthe loan. This credit bureau also enables lenders to take quick decisions and charge a differential price\nbased on the credit profile of the borrower. If the lenders, perceived that the risk of repayment of a bor-\nrower is low, he will charge a lower interest rate, otherwise, a higher one. The lender has not merely to\njudge the creditworthiness of the borrower, but he also has to monitor the borrower's behaviour during\nthe term of the loan to assess whether there is a risk of default. This depends on the lender's ability to\ngather accurate and timely information about the borrower. There always exists some degree of infor-\nmation asymmetry between borrowers and lenders. It is the credit bureau which provides the formal\nmechanism by which lenders can pool and share information about the characteristics of potential bor-\nrowers. Also, it discourages borrowers from becoming over-debted by obtaining credit from multiple\nlenders.\n\nCredit Bureau helps mitigate certain problems which arise on account of insufficient or limited credit\ninformation. There exist \u2018adverse selection\u2019 and \u2018moral hazard\u2019 problems in the market for credit. Adverse\nselection refers to a situation where bad borrowers take higher amount and number of loans from various\nlenders even at higher interest rates. Moral hazard is a phenomenon whereby a borrower having taken a\nloan, makes a material change in income or spending that affects his ability to repay the loan. This phe-\nnomenon occurs when the borrowers knows that the lender cannot monitor borrowers\u2019 behaviour during\nthe tenure of the loan.\n\nThe State Bank of India (SBI), Housing Development Finance Corporation Limited (HDFC), Dun and\nBradstreet Information Services India Private Limited (D&B), and TransUnion International Inc (Tran-\nsUnion) signed the Shareholders\u2019 Agreement on January 30, 2001 to establish the Credit Information\nBureau (India) Limited (CIBIL). They initially held the share capital of CIBIL in the proportion of 40 :\n40 : 10 : 10 respectively. The shareholding pattern has been diversified to include:\n\nState Bank of India (10 per cent), Bank of Baroda (5 per cent), TransUnion International Inc (10 per\ncent), Dun & Bradstreet Information Services India Pvt Ltd (10 per cent), Bank of India (5 per cent),\nThe Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Ltd (5 per cent), Indian Overseas Bank (5 per cent),\nSundaram Finance Ltd (2.5 per cent), Housing Development Finance Corporation Ltd (10 per cent),\nPunjab National Bank (5 per cent), Union Bank of India (5 per cent), Citicorp Finance (India) Ltd (5 per\ncent), ICICI Bank Ltd (10 per cent), Central Bank of India (5 per cent), Standard Chartered Bank (5 per\ncent), and GE Strategic Investments India (2.5 per cent).

                        "extracted-text": "Various Measures initiated by RBI to revitalise the stressed assets\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India has taken various measures that aimed at revitalizing the stressed assets in the\neconomy. The measures taken by the Reserve Bank include CDR mechanism introduced in 2001, Joint\nLending Forum (JLF) and Corrective Action Plan (CAP) mechanism introduced in January 2014, the\nFlexible Structuring of Long Term Project Loans to Infrastructure and Core Industries (5: 25 Scheme)\nin July 2014, Strategic Debt Restructuring Scheme (SDR)in June 2015 and the scheme for Sustainable\nStructuring of Stressed Assets (S4A) in June 2016. The CDR mechanism has already been discussed and\nthe other initiatives by RBI are as below:\n\nPart A - Strategic Debt Restructuring (SDR) Scheme: It is an improved version of Corporate Debt\nRestructuring (CDR) mechanism which has empowered banks to initiate change of ownership and\nmanagement and convert debt into equity of the defaulting borrowers whose assets have turned bad, if\nnecessary.\n\n1, The Strategic Debt Restructuring (SDR) has been introduced with a view to ensuremore stake\nof promoters in reviving the stressed accounts and providing banks with enhanced capabilities\nto initiate change of ownership, wherevernecessary, in accounts which fail to achieve the agreed\ncritical conditions and viability milestones. Therefore, banks should consider using SDR only in\ncases where change in ownership is likely to improve the economic value of the loan asset and\nthe prospects of recovery of their dues. The trigger for SDR must be non-achievement of viability\nmilestones and/or non-adherence to \u2018critical conditions\u2019 linked to the option of invoking SDR, as\nstipulated in restructuring agreement, and SDR cannot be triggered for any other reason.\n\n2. Henceforth, banks should include necessary covenants in all loan agreements, including restruc-\nturing, supported by necessary approvals/authorizations (including special resolution by the\nshareholders) from the borrower company, as required under extant laws/regulations, to enable\ninvocation of SDR in applicable cases. Further, the Joint Lenders Forum (JLF) will have the\noption to initiate SDR to effect change of management of the borrower company in cases of fail-\nure of rectification or restructuring as a CAP as decided by JLF, subject to compliance with the\nstipulated conditions...\n\n3. The \u2018new promoter\u2019 (to whom the lenders divest their equity) should not be a person/entity/sub-\nsidiary/associate, etc., (domestic as well as overseas), from the existing promoter/promoter group\nand banks should exercise the necessary due diligence in this regard.\n\n4. Banks should explore the possibility of preparing a panel of management firms/individuals hav-\ning expertise in running firms/companies who could be considered for managing the companies\ntill ownership is transferred to the new promoters. Banks may consult IBA and other industry\nbodies in this regard.\n\n5. Inno case the current management should be allowed to continue without the representatives of\nbanks on the board of the company and without supervision by an entity/person appointed by the\nbanks.\n\n6. The general principle of restructuring should be that the shareholders bear the first loss rather than\nthe lenders. Accordingly, personal guarantees/commitments obtained from existing promoters\nshould also cover losses incurred by the lenders. Therefore, banks should devise an appropri-\nate mechanism as per the bank\u2019s board approved policy towards invocation/release of personal\nguarantees and this should be based on the principle of reasonable satisfaction of lenders\u2019 claims.\nThis could include pledge of the existing promoters\u2019 share in favour of the lenders if not already\ndone. In any case, personal guarantees should be released only after transfer of ownership and/or\nmanagement control to the new promoters.\n\n7. On the issue of divestment of banks\u2019 holding in favour of a \u2018new promoter\u2019, the asset classifica-\ntion benefit will be available to the lenders provided they divest a minimum of 26 per centof\nthe shares of the company (and not necessarily 51 per centabinitio as required hitherto) to\nthe new promoters within the stipulated time line of 18 months and the new promoters take\nover management control of the company. Lenders would thus have the option to exit their\n\n\nEy\n\n\u00b0\n\nremaining holdings gradually, with upside as the company turns around. Lenders should, how-\never, grant the new promoters the \u2018Right of First Refusal\u2019 for the subsequent divestment of their\nremaining stake .In other words, the new promoter should have acquired at least 26 per cent of\nthe paid-up equity capital of the borrower company and the new promoter of the company will\nalso be in \u2018control\u2019 of the borrower company, according to the definition of \u2018control\u2019 provided\nin the Companies Act, 2013. The new promoter should be the single-largest shareholder of the\nborrower company, which will allow the promoter to make sweeping changes with regard to the\nboard and operations.\n\n. JLFs are required to adhere to certain prescribed timelines during SDR process. In partial modi-\n\nfication of the extant instructions, the JLF can have flexibility in the time taken for completion\nof individual activities up to conversion of debt into equity in favour of lenders (ie., up to 210\ndays from the review of achievement of milestones/critical conditions) as per the SDR package\napproved by JLE. The benefit of \u2018stand-still\u2019 in asset classification will apply from the reference\ndate itself. However, if the targeted conversion of debt into equity shares does not take place\nwithin 210 days from the review of achievement of milestones/critical conditions, the benefit will\ncease to exist. Thereafter, the loans will be classified as per the conduct of the account as per the\nextant income recognition, asset classification and provisioning norms.\n\n. Equity shares acquired and held by banks under the scheme shall be exempt from the requirement\n\nof periodic mark-to-market (stipulated vide prudential norms for classification, valuation and\noperation of investment portfolio by banks) for an18 month period.\n\nHowever, there is a possibility of banks facing a cliff-effect of provisioning at the end of the\n18 month period on account of mark-to-market requirement (if a part of the equity shares are\nretained) and/or on account of recognizing loss on sale of equity shares to the new promoters. In\nview of this, it has been decided that banks should periodically value and provide for depreciation\nof these equity shares as per IRAC norms for investment portfolio. Banks will, however, have the\noption of distributing the depreciation on equity shares acquired under SDR, over a maximum of\nfour calendar quarters from the date of conversion of debt into equity, i.c., the provisioning held\nfor such depreciation should not be less than 25 per centof the depreciation during the first quarter,\n50 per centof the depreciation as per the current valuation during the second quarter and so on.\nFurthermore, the banks desiring to have a longer period for making provisions, say 6 quarters, can\nstart making extant provisions in anticipation of MTM requirement, from the reference date itself.\n\n. JLF should divest their holdings in the equity of the company as soon as possible. On divestment\n\nof banks\u2019 holding in favour of a \u2018new promoter\u2019, the asset classification of the account may be\nupgraded to \u2018standard\u2019. However, the quantum of provision held by the bank against the said\naccount as on the date of divestment, which shall not be less than what was held as at the \u2018refer-\nence date\u2019, shall not be reversed.\n\nIt is possible that the lenders may not be able to sell their stake to new promoters within the\n18 month period, thus revoking the \u2018stand-still\u2019 benefit, which may result in sharp deterioration in\nthe classification of their remaining loan exposures from what prevailed on the \u2018reference date\u2019.\nIn order to avoid the cliff effect of resultant provisioning, the banks should build provisions such\nthat, by the end of the 18 month period from the reference date, they hold provision of at least\n15 per cent of the residual loan. The required provision should be made in equal instalments over\nthe four quarters. This provision shall be reversed only when all the outstanding loans/facilities in\nthe account perform satisfactorily during the \u2018specified period\u2019 (as defined in the extant norms on\nrestructuring of advances) after the transfer of ownership/management control to new promoters.\n\n. The guidelines contained in points 3 and 6 will also be applicable to cases where change in own-\n\nership has been carried out Outside Strategic Debt Restructuring Scheme. In addition, point 7 will\nalso be applicable to such cases subject to the condition that lenders along with the new promoters\nshould hold at least 51 per cent of the paid up equity capital of the borrower company.\n\n. The pricing formula under strategic debt restructuring scheme has been exempted from the Secu-\n\nrities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regu-\nlations, 2009 subject to certain conditions. Further, in the case of listed companies, the acquiring\nlender on account of conversion of debt into equity under SDR hasalso been exempted from the\nobligation to make an open offer under regulation 3 and regulation 4 of the provisions of the\nSecurities and Exchange Board of India (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regu-\nlations, 2011.\n\nAccordingly, the SDR framework will also be available to an ARC, which is a member of the\nJLF undertaking SDR of a borrower company.\n\n13. At the time of divestment of their holdings to a \u2018new promoter\u2019, banks may refinance the exist-\ning debt of the company considering the changed risk profile of the company without treating the\nexercise as \u2018restructuring\u2019 subject to banks making provision for any diminution in fair value of the\nexisting debt on account of the refinance. In this regard, banks should strictly adhere to the provi-\nsioning as prescribed under SDR framework while refinancing the existing debt of the company\nunder the \u2018new promoter\u2019. If banks partially write off the existing loan which is being refinanced,\nthe abovementioned provision for diminution in fair value will be net of the amount written off.\n\n14. These revised guidelines will be applicable prospectively. However, it would be prudent if banks\nfollow these guidelines even in cases where JLF has already decided to undertake SDR.\n\nPart B - Framework to Revitalize the Distressed Assets in the Economy of Joint Lenders\u2019 Forum\nEmpowered Group (JLF - EG) Under this framework, banks are required to identify the stress in the\naccount and implement a revival plan before the account turns into NPA. To facilitate early warning signs,\nRBI created a platform called the Central Repository of Information on Large Credits (CRILC) in 2014\nwhere all lenders are mandated to provide status of all such accounts where Aggregate Exposure (AE)\nis more than 250 Million. The banks are required to furnish credit information to CRILC on all their\nborrowers having aggregate fund and non-fund based exposure of %50 million and above with unique\nidentification through Permanent Account Number (PAN).\n\nBanks are required to identify initial stress in the account, before it turns into NPA, by creating three\nsub categories under Special Mention Account (SMA) category as mentioned below:\n\nSMA - 0: Principal or interest payment not overdue for more than 30 days but account shows signs of\ninitial stress.\n\nSMA -1: Principal or interest payment overdue between 31-60 days.\nSMA - 2: Principal or interest payment overdue between 61-90 days.\n\nBankers are mandated to form a consortium of lending institutions known as Join Lending Forum\n(LF) as soon as any of the lenders has classified the account as SMA \u2014 2 and AE is more than 71000\nMillion. But, they can also form JLF even if the above two conditions are not met.\n\nCollective Action Plan (CAP) is formulated by JLF to arrive at an early and feasible solution to pre-\nserve the economic value of the underlying assets as well as the lender's loans. There are three options\navailable under CAPas follows:\n\nRectification: Commitment from the borrower to regularize the accounts without any change in terms\nand conditions of the loans. Also, the possibility of getting some other equity/strategic investors may be\nexplored.\n\nRestructuring: Will be undertaken only if it is prima facie viable. JLF can undertake restructuring\nwithout referring it to the CDR cell; however, it is required to carry out detailed Techno Economic\nViability (TEV) study to conform the viability of the restructuring package.\n\nRecovery: Ifthe above two options cannot be worked out, then the process of recovery may be resorted.\n\n15. In terms of the extant guidelines, the decisions on the Corrective Action Plan (CAP) must be\napproved by a minimum of 75 per centof creditors by value and 60 per centof creditors by number\nin the JLF. On a review, the proportion of lenders, by number, required for approving the CAP has\nbeen reduced to 50 per cent.\n\n16. In case of revitalizing distressed assets, JLF will finalize the Corrective Action Plan (CAP) and\nthe same will be placed before an Empowered Group (EG) of lenders, which will be tasked to\napprove the rectification/restructuring packages under CAPs. In partial modification to this,the\napproval of JLF-EG is mandatory only in cases of rectification with additional finance and cases\nof restructuring under a CAP.\n\n17. The composition of JLF-EG is as follows:\n\na. The top two banks in the system, in terms of advances, namely SBI and ICICI Bank, will con-\ntinue to be permanent members of JLF EG, irrespective of whether or not they are lenders in\nthe particular JLF.\n\nb. If SBI and ICICI Bank are the lenders in a JLF, the JLF-EG would consist of these two banks,\nthe three lenders (other than ICICI Bank and SBI) having largest exposures to the borrower\nand the two largest banks in terms of advances! which do not have any exposure to the bor-\nrower.\n\nc. If either of SBI or ICICI bank is a lender, the JLF-EG would consist of these two banks, the\nfour lenders (other than ICICI Bank and SBI) having largest exposures to the borrower and the\nnext largest bank in terms of advances? which does not have any exposure to the borrower.\n\nd. Ifneither SBI nor ICICI Bank are the lenders in a JLF, then the JLF-EG would consist of these\ntwo banks and the five lenders having largest exposures to the borrower.\n\ne. All the JLF-EG members would have equal voting rights irrespective of the size of exposure\nto the borrower.\n\n. In terms of the extant guidelines, the JLF is required to arrive at an agreement on the option to be\n\nadopted for Corrective Action Plan (CAP), i.e., either rectification, or restructuring or recovery,\nwithin 45 days from (i) the date of an account being reported as Special Mention Account-2(shortly\nwritten as SMA-2) wherein the principal or interest payment is overdue between 61-90 days by\none or more lenders, or (ii) receipt of request from the borrower to form a JLF, with substantiated\ngrounds, if it senses imminent stress. The JLF should sign off the detailed final CAP within the next\n30 days from the date of arriving at such an agreement. Further, the banks were advised that dis-\nsenting lenders who do not want to participate in the rectification or restructuring of the account as\nCAP, which may or may not involve additional financing, will have an option to exit their exposure\ncompletely by selling their exposure to a new or existing lender(s) within the prescribed timeline\nfor implementation of the agreed CAP. The exiting lender will not have the option to continue\nwith their existing exposure and simultaneously not agreeing for rectification or restructur-\ning as CAP. The new lender to whom the exiting lender sells its stake may not be required to com-\nmit any additional finance, if the agreed CAP involves additional finance. In such cases, if the new\nlender chooses to not to participate in additional finance, the share of additional finance pertaining\nto the exiting lender will be met by the existing lenders on a pro-rata basis.\n\nIf the dissenting lender is not able to exit by arranging a buyer within the above prescribed\ntime, it has to necessarily adhere to the agreed CAP and provide additional finance, if the CAP\nso envisages.\n\nFurther, in some cases, there are undue delays by banks in communicating their decision on\nCAP, which defeats the very purpose of this framework for initiating prompt corrective measures\nin cases of stressed accounts. Therefore, an incentive structure for banks to communicate their\ndecision on the agreed CAP in a time bound manner has been designed. Accordingly, the asset\nclassification and provisioning norms prescribed shall apply to different categories of lenders\nwhere the CAP has been agreed by majority of the members of JLF (i.e., lenders with 75 per cent\nby value of debt and 50 per cent by number).\n\n. Furthermore, additional funding provided under restructuring/rectification as part of the CAP will\n\nhave priority in repayment over repayment of existing debts. Therefore, instalments of the addi-\ntional funding which fall due for repayment will have priority over the repayment obligations of\nthe existing debt. Necessary conditions shall accordingly be incorporated in the JLF agreement.\n\nPart C - Prudential Guidelines on Restructuring of Advances\n\n20.\n\n21.\n\n22.\n\nThe accounts classified as \u2018standard assets\u2019 should be immediately re-classified as \u2018sub-standard\nassets\u2019 upon restructuring as per the extant guidelines, Further, as per extant norms, any additional\nfinance may be treated as \u2018standard asset\u2019 during the specified period under the approved restruc-\nturing package.\n\nWhile the borrowers indulging in frauds and malfeasance will continue to remain ineligible for\nrestructuring, banks may review the reasons for classification of the borrowers as wilful defaulters,\nespecially in old cases where the manner of classification of a borrower as a wilful defaulter was not\ntransparent and satisfy itself that the borrower is in a position to rectify the wilful default. The restruc-\nturing of such cases may be done with the board\u2019s approval, while for such accounts the restructuring\nunder the CDR Mechanism may be carried out with the approval of the Core Group only.\n\nWith a view to preserving the economic value of viable accounts, in cases of fraud/malfeasance\nwhere the existing promoters are replaced by new promoters and the borrower company is totally\ndelinked from such erstwhile promoters/management, banks and JLF may take a view on restruc-\nturing such accounts based on their viability, without prejudice to the continuance of criminal\naction against the erstwhile promoters/management. Further, such accounts may also be eligible\nfor asset classification benefits that are available on refinancing after change in ownership, if such\nchange in ownership is carried out under guidelines on \u2018prudential norms on change in ownership\nof borrowing entities (outside strategic debt restructuring scheme)\u2019. Each bank may formulate its\npolicy and requirements as approved by the board, on restructuring of such assets.\n\n23. Restructured accounts classified as non-performing assets, when upgraded to standard category\nwill attract a provision of 5 per cent in the first year from the date of upgradation.\n24, General Conditions\n24.1 Instructions on \u2018special regulatory treatment for asset classification\u2019 on \u2018prudential norms\n\u2018on income recognition, asset classification and provisioning pertaining to advances\u2019 stand\nwithdrawn.\n24.2 Henceforth, the following general conditions would be applicable in all cases of restructur-\ning in addition to general conditions:\n\ni. All restructuring packages will be required to be implemented in a time bound man-\nner. All restructuring packages under CDR/JLF/Consortium/MBA arrangement\nshould be implemented within 90 days from the date of approval. Other restruc-\nturing packages should be implemented within 120 days from the date of receipt\nof application by the bank.\n\nii, Promoters must bring additional funds in all cases of restructuring. Additional funds\nbrought by the promoters should be a minimum of 20 per cent of banks\u2019 sacrifice or\n2 per cent of the restructured debt, whichever is higher. The promoters\u2019 contribution\nshould invariably be brought upfront while extending the restructuring benefits to the\nborrowers. Promoter's contribution need not necessarily be brought in cash and can be\nbrought in the form of conversion of unsecured loan from the promoters into equity.\nBanks should determine a reasonable time period during which the account is likely to\nbecome viable, based on the cash flow and the Techno Economic Viability (TEV) study.\n\niv. Banks should be satisfied that the post restructuring repayment period is reasonable and\ncommensurate with the estimated cash flows and required DSCR in the account as per\ntheir own board approved policy.\n\nv. Each bank should clearly document its own due diligence done in assessing the TEV\nand the viability of the assumptions underlying the restructured repayment terms.\n\n24.3. All other instructions under \u2018prudential norms on income recognition, asset classification\nand provisioning pertaining to advances\u2019 shall remain unchanged.\n\nPart D \u2014 Flexible Structuring of Project Loans\n\n25. Guidelines contained on \u2018flexible structuring of long term project loans to infrastructure and core\nindustries\u2019 are also applicable to External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs) availed for funding\nprojects in infrastructure and core industries sectors, subject to regulations issued under the For-\neign Exchange Management Act, 1999.\n\nPart E - Sale of financial assets to securitisation company (RC)/ reconstruction company (RO)\n\n26. Reserve Price: The banks were advised that the auction process for sale of NPAs to SCs/RCs\nshould be more transparent, including disclosure of the reserve price, specifying clauses for non-\nacceptance of bids, etc. In this connection, it is clarified that banks shall disclose the reserve price\nat the time of inviting bids/expression of interest from the SCs/RCs.\n\n27. Due Diligence: Thebanks shall provide adequate time and due facilitation to SCs/RCs to conduct\ndue diligence on financial assets offered for sale. The banks shall provide not less than 2 weeks\nfor submission of bids from the time of inviting bids/expression of interest from SCs/RCs.\n\n28. Treatment of security receipts/pass through certificates post realization period:In terms of extant\ninstructions, if redemption of any of the instruments issued by SC/RC (and invested by banks)\nis limited to the actual realization of the financial assets assigned to the instruments in the con-\ncerned scheme, the bank/financial institutionshall reckon the Net Asset Value (NAV), obtained\nfrom SC/RC from time to time, for valuation of such investments. In this connection, it has been\ndecided that security receipts/pass through certificates which are not redeemed as at the end of the\nresolution period (i-e., five years or eight years as the case may be) will be treated as loss asset in\nthe books of the banks.\n",

Equity shares for which current quotations are not available or\nwhere the shares are not listed on the stock exchanges, should be valued at the lowest value arrived\nusing the following valuation methodologies:\n\nBreak-up value (without considering \u2018revaluation reserves\u2019, if any) which is to be ascertained from\nthe company\u2019s latest audited balance sheet (which should not be more than one year prior to the\ndate of valuation). In case when the latest audited balance sheet is not available, the shares are to\nbe valued at 1 per company, The independent TEV will assist in ascertaining the break-up value.\nDiscounted cash flow method where the discount factor is the actual interest rate charged to the\nborrower plus 3 per cent, subject to the floor of 14 per cent. Further, cash flows such ascash flow\navailable from the current as well as immediately prospective (not more than six months) level of\noperations occurring within 85 per cent of the useful economic life of the project only shall be\nreckoned.\n\nRedeemable cumulative optionally convertible preference shares/optionally convertible debentures:\nThe valuation should be on discounted cash flow (DCF) basis. These will be valued with a discount\nrate of a minimum mark up of 1.5 per cent over the weighted average actual interest rate charged to\nthe borrower for the various facilities. Where preference dividends are in arrears, no credit should be\ntaken for accrued dividends and the value determined as above on DCF basis should be discounted\nfurther by at least 15 per cent if arrears are for one year, 25 per cent if arrears are for two years, so\non and so forth (i.e., with 10 per cent increments).\n\nWhere the resolution plan does not involve a change in promoter or where existing promoter is allowed\nto operate and manage the company as minority owner by lenders, the principle of proportionate loss\nsharing by the promoters should be met. In such cases, the lenders shall, therefore, require the existing\npromoters to dilute their shareholdings, by way of conversion of debt into equity/sale of some portion of\npromoter\u2019s equity to lenders, at least in the same proportion as that of part B to total dues to lenders. JLF/\nConsortium/bank should also obtain the promoters\u2019 personal guarantee in all such cases, for at least the\namount of Part A.\n\nThe upside for the lenders will be primarily through equity/quasi-equity, if the borrowing entity turns\naround. The terms for exercise of option for the conversion of preference shares/debentures to equity shall\nbe clearly spelt out. The existing promoter or the new promoter, as the case may be, may have the right of\nfirst refusal in case the lenders decide to sell the share, at a price beyond some predetermined price.

While engaging professional agencies, the JLF/Con-\nsortium/bank shall ensure that the agency is reputed, truly independent/free from any conflict of\ninterest, has proven expertise and will be in a position to safeguard the interest of lenders while\npreserving the economic value of the assets. Further, from a risk management perspective, the\nlenders should avoid concentration of such assignments in any one particular professional agency.\n\nb. The resolution plan shall be agreed upon by a minimum of 75 per cent of lenders by value and 50\n\nper cent of lenders by number in the JLF/consortium/bank.\n\n.

                        "extracted-text": "Flexible Structuring of Long Term Project Loans tolnfrastructure and\nCore Industries\n\nThis scheme is generally referred to as the 5:25 flexible structuring scheme.\n\nDuring the last decade, commercial banks have become the primary source of long term debt financing\nto projects in infrastructure and core industries. Infrastructure and core industries projects are character-\nized by long gestation periods and large capital investments, The long maturities of such project loans\nconsist of the initial construction period and the economic life of the asset/underlying concession period\n(usually 25 to 30 years). In order to ensure stress free repayment of such long gestation loans, their repay-\nment tenureshould bear some correspondence to the period when cash flows are generated by the asset.\n\nBanks are unable to provide such long tenor financing owing to asset-liability mismatch issues. To\novercome the asset liability mismatch, they invariably restrict their finance to a maximum period of 12-15\nyears. After factoring in the initial construction period and repayment moratorium, the repayment of the\nbank loan is compressed to a shorter period of 10-12 years (with a resultant of higher loan instalments),\nwhich not only strains the viability of the project, but also constrains the ability of promoters to gener-\nate fresh equity out of internal generation for further investments. It might also lead to levying higher\nuser charges in the case of infrastructure projects in order to ensure that greater cash flows are generated\nto service the loans. As a result of these factors, some of the long term projects have been experiencing\nstress in servicing the project loan.\n\nWith a view to overcomethese problems, banks have requested the RBI that they may be allowed to\nfix longer amortization period for loans to projects in infrastructure and core industries sectors, say 25\nyears, based on the economic life or concession period of the project, with periodic refinancing, say every\n5 years. The banks have indicated that the following:\n\ni. This would ensure long term viability of infrastructure/core industries sector projects by smooth-\nening the cash flow stress in initial years.\n\nii, They would be able to extend finance to such projects without getting adversely impacted by\nasset-liability management (ALM) issues.\n\niii. The need for restructuring (owing to initial stressed cash flows due to 10-12 year loan tenors\nnormally fixed) would be minimized, allowing banks to once again take up financing/refinancing\nof these project loans.\n\niv. They could shed or take up exposures at different stages of the life cycle of such projects depend-\ning on bank\u2019s single/group borrower or sectoral exposure limits.\n\ny.With reduction of project risk and option of refinancing, ratings of such projects would undergo\nupward revision allowing lower capital requirement for banks andalso access to corporate bond\nmarkets to project promoters at any stage based on such refinancing, etc.\n\nThe long tenor loans to infrastructure/core industries projects, say 25 years, could be structured as fol-\nlows:\n\ni. The fundamental viability of the project would be established on the basis of all requisite financial\nand non-financial parameters, especially the acceptable level of interest coverage ratio (EBIDTA/\nInterest pay-out), indicating the capacity to service the loan and the ability to repay over the tenor\nof the loan.\n\nii, Allowing longer tenor amortization of the loan (Amortization Schedule), say 25 years (within\nthe useful life/concession period of the project) with periodic refinancing (refinancing debt facil-\nity) of balance debt, the tenor of which could be fixed at the time of each refinancing, within the\noverall amortization period.\n\niii. This would mean that the bank, while assessing the viability of the project, would be allowed to\naccept the project as a viable project where the average Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)\nand other financial and non-financial parameters are acceptable over a longer amortization period\nof say 25 years (amortization schedule), but provide funding (initial debt facility) for only, say 5\nyears with refinancing of balance debt being allowed by existing or new banks (refinancing debt\nfacility) or even through bonds.\n\niv. The refinancing (refinancing debt facility) after each of these 5 years would be of the reduced\namounts determined as per the original amortization schedule.\n\nv. The repayment at the end of each refinancing period would be structured as a bullet repayment,\nwith the intent specified upfront that it will be refinanced and such bullet repayment shall be\nallowed to be considered in Asset Liability Management (ALM) of banks. The repayment may\nbe taken up by the same lender/a set of new lenders/a combination of both/by issue of corporate\nbonds as a refinancing debt facility and such refinancing may repeat till the end of the amortiza-\ntion schedule.\n\nThus, the lenders are allowed to fix longer amortization period for loans to projects in the infrastructure\nand core industries sector, for say 25 years, based on the economic life or concession period of the project,\nwith periodic refinancing, say every 5 years.\n",

Such loans should be \u2018standard\u2019 in the books of the existing banks and should have not been\nrestructured in the past.\nii, Such loans should be substantially taken over (more than 50 per centof the outstanding loan by\nvalue) from the existing financing banks/financial institutions.\niii. The repayment period should be fixed by taking into account the life cycle of the project and cash\nflows from the project.\n\nThe RBI has allowed lenders to extend the 5 : 25 scheme to new project loans. The scheme can also be\nextended to existing project loans with an aggregate exposure of 250 crore to banks, compared to the car-\nlier mandate of 2500 crore. The RBI has increased the scheme\u2019s coverage to all sectors. It has also allowed\nsmall and mid-sized projectswhere banks have at least 2250 croreexposureto qualify for this scheme.\n\nIna bold move, the RBI empowered banks to take control of a company if it fails to meet specific mile-\nstones under the corporate debt restructuring (CDR) plan. To achieve the change in ownership, the lenders\nunder the Joint Lender's Forum (JLF) should collectively become the majority shareholder by conversion\nof their dues from the borrower into equity.\n\nIssues relating to revitalizing the stressed assets: Despite so many initiatives taken up by the\ngovernment and the RBI to revitalize the stressed assets, the non-performing assets have been increasing\nat a rate of 34 per cent per annum and it is estimated by the RBI that the stock of non-performing assets\nis around %8,00,000crore and for which no efficacious remedy is available for its proper use by defaulter\ndebtor or recovery by creditors.\n\n1. In India, the laws dealing with individual insolvency, the Presidential Towns insolvency Act, 1909\nand the Provincial Insolvency Act,1920 are almost a century old.\n\nThereafter, many laws and acts such as Contract Act, the Sick Industrial Companies (Special\nProvisions) Act, 1985 and the winding up provisions of the Companies Act, 1956 or special laws\nsuch as the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 and the Secu-\nritisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002,\nhave neither been able to aid recovery for lenders nor aid revival or restructuring of firms. As\nboth the legal and institutional machinery for dealing with debt default has failed, it has led to the\ncreation of idle stock of assets and under-utilization of productive capacity of both human and\nphysical capital and thereby, destroying the value of the firm andalso national resources. Neither\nthe lenders are willing to lend further which has created a credit crunch nor are the promoters\nwilling to adopt new measures for the revival and repayment which has impeded for the growth\nof new projects inhibiting the growth of GDP.\n\n2. According to a report of investment banking firm RBSA Advisors, only 15 per cent cases, i.e.,\n94 Cases of 768,894 crores have successfully exited from CDR since its inception. The corporate\ndebt restructuring of 44 firms with a debt of 227,015 crore failed in 2014/15. Only five firms with\na total debt of 21,399 crore managed to exit the CDR successfully. It lost charm after the with-\ndrawal of forbearance benefit by RBI from 1 April 2015.\n\n3. The success of CDR and SDR depends on successful turnaround of the company, which requires\na disciplined approach and broad oversight function. The existing management may continue in\ndisguise and finding new promoter/partner is always a challenge.\n\nMoreover, the lenders have faced difficulties in its successful implementation due to lack of\nadequate expertise, time and resources to run the distressed company. Also, the lenders find it\ndifficult to find new promoters/partners as the potential buyers expect a significant discounted\nprice on account of unsustainable levels of debt and lack of reliable information of the distressed\ncompany to make a value assessment.\n\n4. It needs due and proper appreciation as that the change of management is not very easy in the\nIndian context.\n\n5. The promoters\u2019 resistance in taking new investors/partners on board is also a hurdle. To bring\nequity and balance amongst all stake holders in such a unit is also a herculean task for the existing\nmanagement as well lenders including unsecured creditors.\n\n6. Bankers/Lenders of money, goods and service either do not have the expertise to manage diverse\ncompanies or do not have time and experience to turn around a stressed company or apprehend to\nbring success.\n\n7 The substantial cause of vested interest resulting into valuation mismatch between banks and Asset\nReconstruction Companies (ARCs) has resulted in subdued growth in distressed asset sales.\n\n8. Another issue is confusion due to the lack of a unified law/framework to deal with the problem.\nIndia currently has multiple laws to deal with insolvency as also bankruptcy, which leads the\nentire resolution process fragmented, expensive and time-consuming with very low recovery rate.\nResultantly, the winding up of a business and recovery of debt is a cumbersome process and\ntherefore attempts are being made to thwart the process.\n\n9. There is lack of adequate and credible real time data regarding assets and indebtedness of a com-\npany which further stresses the problem.\n\n10. Creditors, employees and other stakeholders have different and competing claims for which no\nefficacious remedy to deal with or specification in any regulatory law regarding how to determine\npriority of claims.\n\n11. Till date the promoters are not willing to part with the possession of the assets and creditors are\nnot willing to put the assets in its proper use for the benefit of all and courts are not able to deal\nwith confronting claims.\n\n12. Asa result, India currently ranks 136 out of 189 countries in the World Bank\u2019s index on the ease\nof resolving insolvencies/bankruptcy. The average time taken to resolve insolvency in India is 4.3\nyears compared to 0.6 years for Japan, 1 year for UK and1.5 years for USA.\n\nFor resolving alll these issues, the government has framed and implemented the Insolvency and Bank-\nruptcy Code, 2016.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Salient Features of the IBC\n\n1. IBC has brought about a paradigm shift from the existing \u2018Debtor in possession\u2019 to a \u2018Creditor in\ncontrol\u2019 regime under the guidance of an expert in the field. Under laws previous to IBC, the debt-\n\u2018ors were in possession of the assets whereas the new code presupposes the control of the creditors\ninstead of debtors and management rights are vested with the able expert like resolution profes-\nsional on commencement of the process. It allows creditors to assess the viability of a debtor as a\nbusiness decision and agree upon a plan for its revival or a speedy liquidation. The paradigm shift\nof obligation is cast on creditors to come to decision to revive or liquidate a defaulting company\nrests on creditors rather than promoters/courts.\n\nFurther, the IBC has classified creditors in two parts namely as financial creditors and\noperational creditors and recently incorporated under other categories on account of recent\n\n2\n\nEd\n\ndevelopment who can apply for insolvency on default of debt or interest payment or repayment of\nadvance made towards purchase. Default has been defined as non-payment of debt carrying time\nvalue for money when whole or any part or instalment of the amount of debt has become due and\npayable and is not repaid by the debtor or the corporate debtor, as the case may be. At present,\nthe default should be at least 100,000 (USD $1495) which may be increased up to 710,000,000\n(USD $149,500) by the Government.\n\n. The aim of IBC is to consolidate all erstwhile insolvency laws and amend multiple legislations\n\nincluding the companies act. The code would have an overriding effect on all other laws relating\nto insolvency and bankruptcy. Such consolidation will bring about a greater clarity of law and\nfacilitate the application of its provisions to different stakeholders affected by business failure or\ninability to pay debt.\n\n. In this creditor-driven insolvency resolution under the able guidance of expert resolution profes-\n\nsional, the code proposes two independent stages: Insolvency Resolution Process, during which\nthe financial creditors assess whether the debtor\u2019s business is viable to continue and the options\nfor its rescue and revival and Liquidation, if the insolvency resolution process fails or financial\ncreditors decide to wind up and distribute the assets of the defaulting debtor.\n\n. The code has created a new institutional framework, consisting of a regulator, insolvency pro-\n\nfessionals, information utilities and adjudicatory mechanisms, that will facilitate a formal and\ntime bound insolvency resolution process and liquidation. It has introduced qualified Insolvency\nProfessionals (IPs) as intermediaries to oversee the process. IBC has paved the way for setting up\nof Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board (IBB) as an independent body for the administration and\ngovernance of insolvency and bankruptcy law and information utilities (IU) as a depository of\nfinancial information which will reduce the information asymmetry between the stakeholders of\nthe insolvency process.\n\n. It has introduced a \u2018moratorium period\u2019 which provides time to stakeholders to conduct discus-\n\nsions and arrive at a resolution plan.\n\n. The code aims to resolve insolvencies in a strict timeline, i.c., ascertain the default so as to the\n\nadmission of the application within 14 days, appointment of RP within 7 days, immediate vesting\nof powers of management rests within RP as a going concern, the commencement of moratorium.\nperiod, the evaluation and viability determination must be completed within 180 days. After a\nmoratorium period of 180 days (which is extendable up to 270 days), IPs to take over the assets of\nthe company. Specification of timeline and its corresponding adherence makes IBC distinct from\nearlier laws and also enables the protection of the value of the firm as a going concern. It provides\nfor compulsory liquidation of corporate debtors if the resolution plan has not been agreed upon\nwithin 180 days of the resolution process.\n\n. Moreover, IBC has also clearly defined the \u2018order of priority\u2019 or the waterfall mechanism for dis-\n\ntribution of assets in case of liquidation. The most important change made by the IBC is to render\ngovernment dues secondarily to most other dues. Thus, all the unsecured creditors have a priority\nover the government dues which were not the case in the earlier laws including the provisions of\nthe Companies Act, 1956. IBC can be considered as a bold step worth appreciating being taken\nby the government and the law makers which considers claims of government being subordinate\nto the claims of the unsecured creditors.\n\n. Investigation powers have been given for the first time by the code. Antecedent transactions may\n\nbe investigated and in case of illegal diversion of assets, personal contribution can be ordered by\nthe court.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nA mutual fund is a financial intermediary that pools the savings of investors for collective\ninvestment in a diversified portfolio of securities. A fund is \u2018mutual\u2019 as all of its returns,\nminus its expenses, are shared by the fund\u2019s investors.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Board of India (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 defines a\nmutual fund as a \u2018a fund established in the form of trust to raise money through the sale of units\nto the public or a section of the public under one or more schemes for investing in securities,\nincluding money market instruments or gold or gold related instruments or real estate assets\u2019.\n\nAccording to the above definition, a mutual fund in India can raise resources through sale\nof units to the public. It can be set up in the form of a trust under the Indian Trust Act. The\ndefinition has been further extended by allowing mutual funds to diversify their activities in\nthe following areas:\n\n* Portfolio management services\n* Management of offshore funds\n\n+ Providing advice to offshore funds\n\n+ Management of pension or provident funds\n+ Management of venture capital funds\n\n* Management of money market funds\n\n* Management of real estate funds\n\nA mutual fund serves as a link between the investor and the securities market by mobilizing\nsavings from the investors and investing them in the securities market to generate returns.\nThus, a mutual fund is akin to portfolio management services (PMS). Although, both are\nconceptually same, they are different from each other. Portfolio management services are\noffered to high net worth individuals; taking into account their risk profile, their investments\nare managed separately. In the case of mutual funds, savings of small investors are pooled\nunder a scheme and the returns are distributed in the same proportion in which the invest-\nments are made by the investors/unit-holders.\n\nMutual funds in India are not much different from portfolio managers for select corporates\nand high net worth individuals whose collective share in MF investment is more than 80 per cent.\n\nMutual fund is a collective savings scheme. Mutual funds play an important role in mobi-\nlizing the savings of small investors and channelizing the same for productive ventures in\nthe Indian economy. Mutual fund is similar to a collective investment scheme (CIS) which\npools the savings and invests them to generate returns. While mutual fund invests in securi-\nties, CIS invests only in plantations, real estate and art funds.\n",

Globally, mutual funds have established themselves as the means of investment for\nthe retail investor.\n\nProfessional Management An average investor lacks the knowledge of capital market\noperations and does not have large resources to reap the benefits of investment. Hence,\n\nhe requires the help of an expert. It is not only expensive to hire the services of an \u2018expert\u2019 but it is\nmore difficult to identify a real expert. Mutual funds are managed by professional managers who have\nthe requisite skills and experience to analyse the performance and prospects of companies. They make\npossible an organized investment strategy, which is hardly possible for an individual investor.\n\nPortfolio Diversification An investor undertakes risk ifhe invests all his funds in a single scrip. Mutual\nfunds invest in a number of companies across various industries and sectors. This diversification reduces\nthe riskiness of the investments.\n\nReduction in Transaction Costs Compared to direct investing in the capital market, investing through\nthe funds is relatively less expensive as the benefit of economies of scale is passed on to the investors.\n\nidity Often, investors cannot sell the securities held easily, while in case of mutual funds, they can\neasily encash their investment by selling their units to the fund if it is an open-ended scheme or selling\nthem on a stock exchange if it is a close-ended scheme.\n\nConvenience Investing in mutual fund reduces paperwork, saves time and makes investment easy.\n\nFlexibility Mutual funds offer a family of schemes, and investors have the option of transferring their\nholdings from one scheme to the other.\n\nTax Benefits Mutual fund investors now enjoy income tax benefits. Dividends received from mutual\nfunds\u2019 debt schemes are tax exempt to the overall limit of %1,00,000 allowed under section 80C of the\nIncome Tax Act.\n\nTransparency Mutual funds transparently declare their portfolio every month. Thus, an investor knows\nwhere his/her money is being deployed and in case they are not happy with the portfolio they can withdraw\nat a short notice.\n\nStability to the Stock Market Mutual funds have a large amount of funds which provide them\neconomies of scale by which they can absorb any losses in the stock market and continue investing in the\nstock market. In addition, mutual funds increase liquidity in the money and capital market.\n\nEquity Research Mutual funds can afford information and data required for investments as they have\nlarge amount of funds and equity research teams available with them.\n\nProtection of Interest of Investors Being regulated by SEBI, mutual funds have to adhere to the strict\nregulation designed to protect the interest of the investors.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "HISTORY OF MUTUAL FUNDS\n\nThe history of mutual funds dates back to nineteenth century Europe, in particular, Great Britain. Robert\nFleming set up, in 1868, the first investment trust called Foreign and Colonial Investment Trust which\npromised to manage the finances of the moneyed classes of Scotland by spreading the investment over\na number of different stocks. This investment trust and other investment trusts which were subsequently\nset up in Britain and the US, resembled today\u2019s close-ended mutual funds. The first mutual fund in the\nUS, Massachusetts Investors\u2019 Trust, was setup in March 1924. This was the first open-ended mutual fund.\n\nThe stock market crash in 1929, the Great Depression, and the outbreak of the Second World War slack-\nened the pace of growth of the mutual fund industry. Innovations in products and services increased the\npopularity of mutual funds in the 1950s and 1960s. The first international stock mutual fund was introduced\nin the US in 1940. In 1976, the first tax-exempt municipal bond funds emerged and in 1979, the first money\nmarket mutual funds were created. The latest additions are the international bond fund in 1986 and arm\nfunds in 1990. This industry witnessed substantial growth in the 1980s and 1990s when there was a signifi-\ncant increase in the number of mutual funds, schemes, assets, and shareholders. In the US, the mutual fund\nindustry registered a tenfold growth in the 1980s (1980-89) only, with 25 per cent of the household sector's\ninvestment in financial assets made through them. Fund assets increased from less than USD 150 billion in\n1980 to over USD 4 trillion by the end of 1997. Since 1996, mutual fund assets have exceeded bank depos-\nits. The mutual fund industry and the banking industry virtually rival each other in size.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Growth of Mutual Funds in India\n\nThe Indian mutual fund industry has evolved over distinct stages. The growth of the mutual fund industry\nin India can be divided into four phases: Phase I (1964-87), Phase II (1987-92), Phase III (1992-97), and\nPhase IV (beyond 1997).\n\nPhase | The mutual fund concept was introduced in India with the setting up of UTI in 1963. The\nUnit Trust of India (UTI) was the first mutual fund set up under the UTI Act, 1963, a special act of the\nparliament. It became operational in 1964 with a major objective of mobilizing savings through the sale\nof units and investing them in corporate securities for maximizing yield and capital appreciation. This\nphase commenced with the launch of the Unit Scheme 1964 (US-64), the first open-ended and the most\npopular scheme. UTI\u2019s investible funds, at market value (and including the book value of fixed assets)\ngrew from %49 crore in 1965 to 7219 crore in 1970-71 to %1,126 crore in 1980-81 and further to 5,068\ncrore by June 1987. Its investor base had also grown to about two million investors. It launched innovative\nschemes during this phase. Its fund family included five income-oriented, open-ended schemes, which\nwere sold largely through its agent network built up over the years. Master share, the equity growth fund\nlaunched in 1986, proved to be a grand marketing success. Master share was the first real close-ended\nscheme floated by UTI. It launched the India Fund in 1986\u2014the first Indian offshore fund for overseas\ninvestors, which was listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE). UTI maintained its monopoly and\nexperienced a consistent growth till 1987.\n\nPhase II The second phase witnessed the entry of mutual fund companies sponsored by nationalized\nbanks and insurance companies. In 1987, SBI Mutual Fund and Canbank Mutual Fund were set up as\ntrusts under the Indian Trust Act, 1882. In 1988, UTI floated another offshore fund, namely, The India\nGrowth Fund which was listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). By 1990, the two nationalized\ninsurance giants, LIC and GIC, and nationalized banks, namely, Indian Bank, Bank of India, and Punjab\nNational Bank had started operations of wholly-owned mutual fund subsidiaries. The assured return\ntype of schemes floated by the mutual funds during this phase were perceived to be another banking\nproduct offered by the arms of sponsor banks. In October 1989, the first regulatory guidelines were\nissued by the RBI, but they were applicable only to the mutual funds sponsored by banks. Subsequently,\nthe Government of India issued comprehensive guidelines in June 1990 covering all mutual funds.\nThese guidelines emphasized compulsory registration with the SEBI and an arms length relationship be\nmaintained between the sponsor and asset management company (AMC). With the entry of public sector\nfunds, there was a tremendous growth in the size of the mutual fund industry with investible funds, at\nmarket value, increasing to %53,462 crore and the number of investors increasing to over 23 million. The\nbuoyant equity markets in 1991-92 and tax benefits under equity-linked savings schemes enhanced the\nattractiveness of equity funds.\n\nPhase III The year 1993 marked a turning point in the history of mutual funds in India. The Securities\nand Exchange Board of India (SEBI) issued the Mutual Fund Regulations in January 1993. The SEBI\nnotified regulations bringing all mutual funds except UTI under a common regulatory framework. Private\ndomestic and foreign players were allowed entry in the mutual fund industry. The Kothari group of\ncompanies, in joint venture with Pioneer, a US fund company, set up the first private mutual fund, the\nKothari Pioneer Mutual Fund, in 1993. Kothari Pioneer introduced the first open-ended fund Prima in\n1993. Several other private sector mutual funds were set up during this phase. UTI launched a new scheme,\nMaster-gain, in May 1992, which was a phenomenal success with a subscription of 4,700 crore from 63\nlakh applicants. The industry's investible funds at market value increazed to 778,655 crore and the number\nof investor accounts increased to 50 million. However, the year 1995 was the beginning of the sluggish\nphase of the mutual fund industry. During 1995 and 1996, unitholders saw an erosion in the value of their\ninvestments due to a decline in the NAVs of the equity funds. Moreover, the service quality of mutual\nfunds declined due to a rapid growth in the number of investor accounts, and the inadequacy of service\ninfrastructure. A lack of performance of the public sector funds and miserable failure of foreign funds like\nMorgan Stanley eroded the confidence of investors in fund managers. Investors perception about mutual\nfunds, gradually turned negative. Mutual funds found it increasingly difficult to raise money. The average\nannual sales declined from about 13,000 crore in 1991\u201494 to about %9,000 crore in 1995 and 1996.\n\nPhase IV During this phase, the flow of funds into the kitty of mutual funds sharply increased. This\nsignificant growth was aided by a more positive sentiment in the capital market, significant tax benefits, and\nimprovement in the quality of investor service. Investible funds, at market value, of the industry rose by June\n2000 to over %1,10,000 crore with UTI having a 68 per cent of the market share. During 1999\u2014 2000 sales\nmobilization reached a record level of 773,000 crore as against %31,420 crore in the preceding year. This\ntrend was, however, sharply reversed in 2000-01. The UTI dropped a bombshell on the investing public by\ndisclosing the NAV of US-64\u2014its flagship scheme as on December 28, 2000, just at \u00a35.81 as against the\nface value of 10 and the last sale price of 714.50. The disclosure of NAV of the country\u2019s largest mutual\nfund scheme was the biggest shock of the year to investors. Crumbling global equity markets, a sluggish\neconomy coupled with bad investment decisions made life tough for big funds across the world in 2001-02.\nThe effect of these problems was felt strongly in India also. Pioneer ITI, JP Morgan, and Newton Investment\nManagement pulled out from the Indian market. The Bank of India MF liquidated all its schemes in 2002.\n\nThe Indian mutual fund industry stagnated at around %1,00,000 crore assets during the years 2000-01\nand 2001-02. This stagnation was partly a result of stagnated equity markets and an indifferent perfor-\nmance by players. As against this, the aggregate deposits of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) as on\nMay 3, 2002, stood at \u00a511,86,468 crore. Mutual funds assets under management (AUM) form just around\n10 per cent of deposits of SCBs.\n\nThe Unit Trust of India lost out to other private sector players during this period. While there was an\nincrease in AUM by around 11 per cent during the year 2002, UTI, on the contrary, lost more than 11 per\ncent in AUM. The private sector mutual funds have benefited the most from the debacle of US-64 of UTI.\nThe AUM of this sector grew by around 60 per cent for the year ending March 2002. There was a record\ngrowth in funds mobilized through a record number of new schemes during the year 2004-05. In the last\ndecade, the mutual fund industry has shown impressive growth not just in the scale of AUM but also in\nterms of schemes and products. Buoyed by robust capital inflows and strong participation of retail inves-\ntors, the asset base of the mutual fund industry again produced record breaking numbers in 2016-17. As\nof June 30, 2017, the total AUM of the sector stood at 719,51,775 crore. The AUM of the industry saw a\nlucrative year-on-year growth of 42.3 per cent in the year ending March, 2017. However, AUM to GDP\n(@151.83 lakh crore at current prices) ratio of 12.8 per cent indicates a large untapped market potential\nand very low penetration vis-a-vis global and peer benchmarks.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "MUTUAL FUND CONCEPTS\nNet Asset Value\n\nThe net asset value of a fund is the market value of the assets minus the liabilities on the day of valuation.\nIn other words, it is the amount which the shareholders will collectively get if the fund is dissolved or liqui-\ndated. The net asset value of a unit is the net asset value of fund divided by the number of outstanding units.\n\nThus NAV = Market price of securities + Other assets \u2014 Total liabilities/units outstanding as at the\nNAV date.\n\nNAV = Net assets of the scheme/Number of units outstanding, i.e., Market value of investments +\nReceivables + Other Accrued Income + Other assets \u2014 Accrued expenses \u2014 Other payables \u2014 Other liabilities\u2019\nNo. of units outstanding as at the NAV date.\n\nA fund's NAV is affected by four sets of factors: purchase and sale of investment securities, valuation\nof all investment securities held, other assets and liabilities, and units sold or redeemed.\nThe following recurring expenses are charged directly to the scheme which affects its NAV:\n\n+ Marketing and selling expenses (including distributors\u2019 fees).\n+ Brokerage charges.\n\n+ Registration charges.\n\n+ Audit fees.\n\n* Custodian fees.\n\n+ Expenses on investors\u2019 communication.\n\n+ Insurance premium paid by the fund.\n\n* Cost of statutory advertisement.\n\nCertain expenses are not charged to the scheme and hence do not affect the NAV. They are:\n\n+ Penalties and fines for violation of law.\n+ Interest on late payment to unit holders.\n+ Legal, marketing, publication and general expenses not attributed to any schemes.\n+ Expenses on investment management and general management.\n* Depreciation on fixed assets and software development expenses.\nThe SEBI has issued guidelines on valuation of traded securities, thinly traded securities, and nontraded\nsecurities. These guidelines were issued to streamline the procedure of calculation of NAV of the schemes\nof mutual funds. The aggregate value of illiquid securities as defined in the guidelines shall not exceed\n15 per cent of the total assets of the scheme and any illiquid securities held above 15 per cent of the total\nassets shall be valued in the manner as specified in the guidelines issued by the SEBI. Where income\nreceivables on investments has accrued but has not been received for the period specified in the guidelines\nissued by the SEBI, provision shall be made by debiting to the revenue account the income so accrued in\nthe manner specified by guidelines issued by the SEBI.\n\nMutual funds are required to declare their NAVs and sale-repurchase prices of all schemes updated\ndaily on a regular basis on the AMFI website by 8.00 p.m. and declare NAVs of their close-ended schemes\non every Wednesday.\n\nExpense Ratio _ It is the ratio of expenses incurred by a mutual fund for managing a fund to net assets of the\nfund. The expense ratio represents the proportion of the fund\u2019s assets that go toward the expense of running\nthe fund. It is a measure of the costs associated with operating a fund and these costs are deducted from the\nassets and thus, lower the return to the investor. Expense ratio includes expenses such as management fees\n(salaries and bonuses paid to top management and sales personnel), administrative costs (custodian charges,\nlegal and audit fees, marketing and selling expenses, and other miscellaneous expenses), and commission\npaid to the distributor which is usually paid on a quarterly basis and is generally 0.5 per cent of the asset\nvalue. Expense ratio is different from load. Expense ratio is the cost of owning a fund while load is a cost\nof buying a fund. A load is paid directly by the investor to the fund at the time of buying, while expense\nratio is charged as a percentage of net assets and subtracted from the investor's investments every year. The\nexpense ratio is disclosed by a mutual fund house once every six months, i.e., every March and September.\nSEBI Mutual Fund regulations permit equity funds to charge a maximum of 2.5 per cent and debt funds, a\nmaximum of 2.25 per cent as expense ratio, Expense ratio is higher for actively managed funds and lower for\npassively managed funds such as index funds. On an average, index funds have an expense ratio of around\n1-1.5 per cent which is lower than that of equity funds that have an expense ratio of 1.5-2 per cent. In case\nof an index fund scheme or exchange traded fund, the total fee charged from an investor, including the\ninvestment and advisory expenses, cannot exceed 1.5% of the weekly average net assets.\n\nEntry and Exit Load Mutual funds incur certain expenses such as brokerage, marketing expenses, and\ncommunication expenses. These expenses are known as \u2018load\u2019 and are recovered by the fund when it sells\nthe units to investors or repurchases the units from withholders. In other words, load is a sales charge, or\ncommission, assessed by certain mutual funds to cover their selling costs.\n\nLoads can be of two types\u2014front-end-load and back-end-load. Front-end-load, or sale load, is a\ncharge collected at the time when an investor enters into the scheme. Back-end, or repurchase, load is a\ncharge collected when the investor gets out of the scheme. Schemes that do not charge a load are called\n\u2018no load\u2019 schemes. In other words, if the asset management company (AMC) bears the load during the\ninitial launch of the scheme, then these schemes are known as no-load schemes. However, these no-load\nschemes can have an exit load when the unitholder gets out of the scheme before a stipulated period men-\ntioned in the initial offer. This is done to prevent short-term investments and redemptions. Some funds\nmay also charge different amount of loads to investors depending upon the time period the investor has\n\nstayed with the funds. The longer the investor stays with the fund, less is the amount of exit load charged.\nThis is known as contingent deferred sales charge (CDSL). It is a back-end (exit load) fee imposed by\ncertain funds on shares redeemed with a specific period following their purchase and is usually assessed\non a sliding scale.\n\nThe SEBI has advised all mutual funds to use a uniform method for calculating sale and repurchase\nprice effective from August 5, 2002, according to which the load shall be charged as a percentage of the\nNAV. The sale and repurchase price will be calculated using the following formulae: Sale Price = Appli-\ncable NAV (1 + sale load, if any). Repurchase Price = Applicable NAV (1 ~ Exit load, if any).\n\nFor investors, entry load increases the cost of investment resulting in a lesser number of units allocated\nand lower rate of return on investment. The entry load was around 2.25 per cent in most equity schemes.\nThe SEBI has mandated that the asset management companies (AMCs) shall not charge entry as well as\nexit loads on bonus units and on units allotted on reinvestment of dividend from March 18, 2008.\n\nNo entry load shall be levied on direct applications received by the AMCs through Internet, submit-\nted to AMC or collection centres/Investor-service centres provided that the applications are not routed\nthrough any distributor/broker/agent on investment in existing schemes with effect from January 4, 2008,\nand in new schemes launched on/after the same date. There will be no provision of charging initial issue\nexpenses and amortization of the same in respect of all mutual fund close-ended schemes launched there-\nafter. The schemes shall meet the sales, marketing, and other such expenses from the entry load.\n\nIn order to empower the investors in deciding the commission paid to distributors in accordance with\nthe level of service received, to bring about more transparency in payment of commissions and to incen-\ntivise long term investment, the SEBI abolished the entry load for all mutual fund schemes on June 30,\n2009. The upfront commission to distributors will be paid by the investor directly to the distributor, based\non his assessment of various factors including the service rendered by the distributor.\n\nMoreover, of the exit load or CDSC charged to the investor, a maximum of 1% of the redemption\nproceeds shall be maintained in a separate account which can be used by the AMC to pay commissions\nto the distributor and to take care of other marketing and selling expenses. Any balance shall be credited\nto the scheme immediately which would go to increase the NAV of the investors who stay invested. The\ndistributors should disclose all the commissions (in the form of trail commission or any other mode)\npayable to them for the different competing schemes of various mutual funds from amongst which the\nscheme is being recommended to the investor. These provisions shall be applicable for:\n\n1. Investments in mutual fund schemes (including additional purchases and switch-in to a scheme\nfrom other schemes) with effect from August 1, 2009;\n\n2. Redemptions from mutual fund schemes (including switch-out from other schemes) with effect\nfrom August 1, 2009;\n\n3. New mutual fund schemes launched on and after August 1, 2009; and\n\n4, Systematic Investment Plans (SIP) registered on or after August 1, 2009.\n\nMany funds changed their exit load structure after the entry load was abolished. Many mutual funds\nhiked their exit load or increased the period of holding. The primary objective of an exit load is to dis-\ncourage investors from exiting a fund within a short span, as frequent churning (prematurely exiting)\nincreases the costs incurred by the scheme. Exit loads are also charged to cover advertising and other\nexpenses related to managing the scheme or making payment to the distributors. It is a kind of deferred\nsales charge; the longer an investor holds his units, charges become lower or even nil thus enabling to\nachieve the true objective of mutual funds\u2014\u2018capital appreciation over the long term\u2019. Liquid funds do not\nhave an exit load but liquid plus schemes may have an exit load as a new norm requires to value money\nmarket and debt securities with a maturity of over 91 days to the daily market price from August 1, 2010.\nThis would lead to volatility in returns, resulting in panic redemptions and to avoid this mutual funds may\nimpose exit loads depending on the average maturity.\n\nSEEI vide circular dated May 23, 2008 simplified the formats for Offer Document and Key Information\nMemorandum of Mutual Funds Scheme. The simplified Scheme Information Document format provides\nthat \u201cWherever quantitative discounts are involved the following shall be disclosed\u2014The Mutual Fund may\ncharge the exit load within the stipulated limit of 7% and without any discrimination to any specific group\nof unit holders. However, any change at a later stage shall not affect the existing unit holders adversely\u201d.\n\nAssets Under Management (AUM) The Mutual fund manager mobilizes funds by offering a scheme/s\nwhich is/are then deployed in various securities/assets. Market value of these assets is known as assets\nunder management. AUM of a scheme is calculated by multiplying the Net Asset Value (NAV) of a\nscheme by the number of units issued by that scheme. AUM of a mutual fund house is arrived at by adding\nthe AUMs of all schemes offered by it and the sum total of AUMs of all mutual fund houses is AUM of\nmutual fund industry. A change in market prices/NAV or redemptions leads to a change in AUM.\n",

The sponsor forms the trust and registers it with the SEBI. The fund sponsor acts as the settler\nof the trust, contributing to its initial capital and appoints a trustee to hold the assets of the trust for\nthe benefit of the unit holders, who are the beneficiaries of the trust. The trust deed deals with the\nestablishment of the trust, the authority, and responsibility of the trustees towards the unit holders and\nthe asset management company (AMC). The fund then invites investors to contribute their money in\nthe common pool, by subscribing to \u2018units\u2019 issued by various schemes established by the trust as evi-\ndence of their beneficial interest in the fund. Thus, a mutual fund is just a \u2018pass through\u2019 vehicle. Most\nof the funds in India are managed by the board of trustees, which is an independent body and acts as\nprotector of the unit holders\u2019 interests. At least, two-thirds of the trustees shall be independent trustees\n(who are not associated with an associate, subsidiary, or sponsor in any manner). For example, HDFC\nTrustee Company Limited, a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956, is the Trustee to\nHDFC Mutual Fund. HDFC Trustee Company Ltd is wholly owned subsidiary of Housing Develop-\nment Finance Corporation Limited (HDFC). Reliance Mutual Fund (RMF) has been established as a\ntrust under the Indian Trusts Act, 1882, with Reliance Capital Limited (RCL) as the Settlor/Sponsor\nand Reliance Capital Trustee Co.

The\ntrustees, on the board of trust of the fund, hold its property for the benefit of the unitholders, which are the\ninvestors. The trustees have the power of superintendence and control over the asset management company\n(AMC). They monitor the performance and compliance of regulations by the mutual fund. The AMC manages\nthe funds by making investments in various types of securities. According to new SEBI regulations, atleast two-\nthirds of the trustees, on the Board of Trustees must be independent meaning they should not be associated with\nthe sponsors. The new regulations ensure that the trustees will be able to be associated with only one mutual\nfund and also, bar trustees of one mutual fund to be on the board of trustees or AMC of another mutual fund.\n",

AMCs appoint distributors/agents who sell the mutual fund units to investors\non behalf of the mutual fund. Distributors may sell mutual fund units of more than one mutual fund. Now\nthere are a wide variety of intermediaries such as institutional agents, distribution companies, brokers,\nbanks, finance companies, secondary market brokers and post offices who are marketing mutual funds to\ntheir existing and potential clients. They make the forms available to clients, explain the schemes and pro-\nvide administrative and paperwork support to investors, making it easy and convenient for the clients to\ninvest. Investors can also directly purchase mutual fund units from asset management companies (AMCs)\nincluding the Unit Trust of India.\nInvestors of mutual funds can be broadly classified into three categories:\n\n+ Those who want product information, advice on financial planning and investment strategies.\n\n+ Those who require only a basic level of service and execution support, i.e., delivering and collecting\napplication forms and cheques, and other basic paperwork and post-sale activities.\n\n+ Those who prefer to do it all themselves, including choice of investments as well as the process!\npaperwork related to investments.\n\nTo cater to different types of investors, intermediaries offer the following two levels of services:\n\n+ Value added services: This includes product information and advice on financial planning and\ninvestment strategies. The advice encompasses analyzing an investor's financial goals depending\nupon the segment of investor, assessing his/her resources, determining his/her riskbearing capacity/\npreference and then using this information to recommend an asset allocation/ specific investment/s\nthat are in tandem with the investor's needs. Investors ay also receive information on taxation, estate\nplanning, and portfolio rebalancing to remain aware about the changes/developments in market\nconditions and adjust the portfolios from time-to-time according to their needs. In such advisory\nservices, the emphasis is on building an ongoing relationship with the investor/s.\n\nBasic services: This includes providing the basic information on schemes launched to investors,\nassisting them in filling application forms, submission of application forms alongwith cheques\nat the respective office/s, delivering redemption proceeds, and answering scheme-related queries\ninvestor/s may have. What investors receive here is convenience and access to mutual funds through\nagents and employees of brokers who visit them and facilitate the paperwork related to investment.\n\nThese services are also given through the branches and front office staff of AMCs and intermediaries.\n\nNow, mobile commerce facility is offered by mutual funds for their investors whereby they can pur-\nchase, redeem, or switch units of mutual fund schemes using their mobile phones. They can also view\ntheir account details, transaction details, and request for their account statements and check the Net Asset\nValues (NAV) of the schemes of the mutual fund.\n\nThe SEBI has facilitated transactions in mutual fund schemes through the Stock Exchange infrastructure.\nThe infrastructure that already exists for the secondary market transactions through the stock exchanges\nwith its reach to over 1,500 towns and cities, through over 200,000 stock exchange terminals can be used for\nfacilitating transactions in mutual fund schemes. Units of mutual fund schemes are permitted to be trans-\nacted through registered stock brokers of recognized stock exchanges market. This on-line trading facility\n\u2018on stock exchanges is an order routing system wherein the eventual transaction is executed by the fund\nhouse. Both the NSE and the BSE have launched mutual funds trading platform. This will lead to paperless\nmutual fund transactions leading to a reduction in paper work, high reach, and high security for investors.\n",

Unlike close-ended schemes, open-ended ones do not\nhave to be listed on the stock exchange and can also offer repurchase soon after allotment.\n\nInvestors can enter and exit the scheme any time during the life of the fund. Open-ended schemes do\nnot have a fixed corpus. The corpus of fund increases or decreases, depending on the purchase or redemp-\ntion of units by investors.\n\nThere is no fixed redemption period in open-ended schemes, which can be terminated whenever the\nneed arises, The fund offers a redemption price at which the holder can sell units to the fund and exit.\n\nBesides, an investor can enter the fund again by buying units from the fund at its offer price. Such funds\nannounce sale and repurchase prices from time-to-time. UTIs US-64 scheme is an example of such a fund.\n\nThe key feature of open-ended funds is liquidity. They increase liquidity of the investors as the units\ncan be continuously bought and sold. The investors can develop their income or saving plan due to free\nentry and exit frame of funds. Open-ended schemes usually come as a family of schemes which enable\nthe investors to switch over from one scheme to another of same family.\n\nClose-ended Schemes Close-ended schemes have a fixed corpus and a stipulated maturity period\nranging between two to five years, Investors can invest in the scheme when it is launched. The scheme\nremains open for a period not exceeding 45 days. Investors in close-ended schemes can buy units only from\nthe market, once initial subscriptions are over and thereafter the units are listed on the stock exchanges\nwhere they can be bought and sold. The fund has no interaction with investors till redemption except for\npaying dividend/bonus, In order to provide an alternate exit route to the investors, some close-ended funds\ngive an option of selling back the units to the mutual fund through periodic repurchase at NAV-related\nprices. The NAV of close-ended schemes are disclosed generally on weekly basis.

Such schemes invest predominantly in income-bearing instruments like bonds, debentures,\ngovernment securities, and commercial paper. The return as well as the risk are lower in income funds as\ncompared to growth funds.\n\nGrowth Funds The main objective of growth funds is capital appreciation over the medium- to longterm.\nThey invest most of the corpus in equity shares with significant growth potential and they offer higher\nreturn to investors in the long-term. They assume the risks associated with equity investments.\nThere is no guarantee or assurance of returns. These schemes are usually close-ended and listed on\nstock exchanges.\n\nBalanced Funds The aim of balanced scheme is to provide both capital appreciation and regular\nincome. They divide their investment between equity shares and fixed interest-bearing instruments in\nsuch a proportion that the portfolio is balanced. The portfolio of such funds usually comprises companies\nwith good profit and dividend track records. Their exposure to risk is moderate and they offer a reasonable\nrate of return. The NAVs of such funds are likely to be less volatile compared to pure equity funds. An\nexample of balanced fund is HDFC Prudence, an equity-oriented hybrid (balanced) fund, with an asset\nsize of 23,200 crore. It is the largest and the most popular scheme in the category of balanced funds.\n\nOthers The other mutual funds are load funds, exchange traded funds, price-earnings ratio fund, fund-\nof-funds, and real estate mutual funds.\n",

These funds are characterized\nas high risk high return investments as their returns are linked to the performance of the stock market.\nBut when compared to sectoral funds, they feature a lower risk. Unlike equity linked savings schemes\n(ELSS), they have no lock-in period. Examples of diversified funds are HDFC Equity, HDFC Top200,\nHSBC Equity, and Birla SunLife Frontline Equity.\n\nCategories of Diversified Equity Funds\n\n(a) Large-cap Funds These are funds that make investments mainly in the shares of big companies.\nThe investors prefer to make investments in these funds as the portfolio consists of well established\ncompanies with high trading volumes and market capitalization of more than 71000 crores. Examples\nof major large- cap funds are Franklin India Blue Chip, HDFC Top 200, Reliance Growth Fund, and\nKotak 30.\n\n(b) Mid-cap Funds These funds invest in equity shares of medium sized companies that have a market\ncapitalization between 2500 crore and 21,000 crore and a huge potential to become big. Mid cap funds\nare volatile as risk of failures especially during the down turn in business cycles can be high. Examples\nof mid-cap funds are Sundaram BNP Paribas Select Mid Cap Fund, Franklin India Prima Fund, HDFC\nCapital Builder, Kotak Indian Mid Cap Fund, and HSBC Midcap Equity Fund.\n\n(\u00a9) Small-cap Funds These funds invest in equity shares of small companies with a market capitalization\nof up to 8500 crore. Some small and upcoming companies have ability to grow faster than the large\ncaps and have the potential of providing high returns. But these companies need to be explored as the\ninformation available about them is limited compared to large caps. Examples of small-cap funds are\nDSPBR Small and Mid Cap Fund and Sundaram BNP Paribas Select Small Cap Fund.\n\nValue Funds\n\nThese funds invest in undervalued stocks-stocks with strong fundamentals but are under performing-\neither due to a difficult phase or economic downturn. For instance, during 2008, higher raw material cost\nand slack in demand resulted in underperformance of the auto sector. Consequently, blue-chip auto stocks\nlike Bajaj Auto and Hero Honda underperformed. Value stocks are acquired not only from large-cap seg-\nment but also from mid-cap and small-cap segments. Superior returns can be earned from value investing\nin the long run. Examples of value funds are ICICI Prudential Discovery, Tata Equity PE, Templeton India\nGrowth, and UTI Master Value.\n\nSpecial Funds\n\nMutual funds have launched special schemes to cater to the special needs of investors. Examples of\nspecial schemes are ICICI Child Care Plan-Gift Plan, Tata Young Citizen\u2019s Fund, and UTI Mahila Unit\nScheme. Taurus AMC has launched an open-ended diversified equity fund\u2014Taurus Ethical Fund\u2014which\ninvests in stocks that comply with Shariah norms. This fund does not invest in industries not permitted by\nShariah such as banks, liquor, and tobacco.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Tax Saving Schemes\n\nTax-saving schemes are equity-oriented schemes designed on the basis of tax policy with special tax\nincentives to investors. Mutual funds have introduced a number of tax-saving schemes. These are close-\nended schemes and investments are made for ten years, although investors can avail of encashment facili-\nties after three years, These schemes contain various options like income, growth or capital appreciation.\nExamples of tax saving schemes are equity linked saving scheme and pension scheme.\n\n(a) Equity-linked Savings Schemes _Equity-linked savings schemes are diversified schemes investing\nin shares of blue-chip companies. Returns in these schemes are linked to the returns of the stock market.\nIn order to encourage investors to invest in the equity market, the government has given tax concessions\nthrough special schemes. Investment in these schemes entitles the investor to claim an income tax\nrebate, but these schemes carry a lock-in period of three years before the end of which funds cannot be\nwithdrawn. These schemes being growth oriented, invest predominantly in equities. They fall in the high\nrisk and high return category.\n\nNew ELSS plans launched by mutual-fund houses will have to be close-ended schemes that have to\nbe wound up 10 years after allotment of units. Investors cannot plan entry into this scheme as the fund\nhouses can announce the repurchase price only a year after the allotment of units and thereafter on half-\nyearly basis. The schemes could be wound up before completion of the stipulated 10 years if 90 per cent\nor more of the units are repurchased before completion of 10 years of the plan. Further, the ELSS plans\nfor a minimum of three months. Schemes launched prior to April 1, 2005 have been exempted from this\nrequirement. Examples of ELSS are SBI Magnum Taxgain, HDFC Long term Advantage Fund, HDFC\nTax Saver, and Franklin India Taxshield.\n\n(b) Pension Schemes These are balanced schemes which aim to provide regular income to individuals\nafter their retirement. There are two pension schemes offered by Templeton and UTI which were launched\nin the \u201990s, but put together these two schemes have only %600 crore between them. Pension plans of\ninsurance companies are more popular as these plans cover risk of life also.\n\nFrom April 1, 2009 any individual will be able to start a New Pension System (NPS) account. The Pen-\nsion Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) has mandated six mutual fund houses\u2014UTI\nRetirement Solutions, SBI, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, Reliance Capital, IDFC AMC, and Kotak\nMahindra AMC\u2014to manage pension fund in the NPS. This pension plan will be managed at 0.09 paisa\nper 2100 that is cheaper than even liquid mutual funds. Moreover, investors will have a wide choice of\n\nselection of investment and tenure as long as 40 years with the benefit of portability, that is they can\nchange fund manager at no cost.\n\nIndex Funds An index fund is a mutual fund which invests in securities in the index on which it is\nbased\u2014BSE Sensex or S&P CNX Nifty. It invests only in those shares which comprise the market index\nand in exactly the same proportion as the companies/weightage in the index so that the value of such\nindex funds varies with the market index. An index fund follows a passive investment strategy as no\neffort is made by the fund manager to identify stocks for investment/disinvestment. The fund manager\nhas to merely track the index on which it is based. His portfolio will need an adjustment in case there is a\nrevision in the underlying index. In other words, the fund manager has to buy stocks which are added to\nthe index and sell stocks which are deleted from the index.\n\nInternationally, index funds are very popular. Around one-third of professionally run portfolios in\nthe US are index funds. Empirical evidence points out that active fund managers have not been able to\nperform well. Only 20 to 25 per cent of actively managed equity mutual funds out-perform benchmark\nindices in the long-term. These active fund managers park 80 per cent of their money in an index and do\nactive management on the remaining 20 per cent. Moreover, risk averse investors like provident funds and\npension funds prefer investment in passively managed funds like index funds. Tracking error can occur\nin case of index funds. Tracking error is the error between index returns and index fund returns. In other\nwords, there is a deviation of returns from an index fund as compared to the returns on the index. Tracking\nerror is the variance between the daily returns of the underlying index and the NAV of the scheme over a\ngiven period. Tracking error is a good measure to compare performance among index funds. Lower the\ntracking error, better the index fund. Tracking error of various index funds can be calculated by compar-\ning their daily returns with those of its benchmark index. Funds like Franklin India Index, Principal Index,\nand Prudential ICICI Index consider Nifty TRI as its benchmark, while funds like UTI Master Index and\nPru ICICI SPICE track the Sensex TRI.\n\nIt is a result of transaction costs for buying and selling of stocks and payment of asset management fees.\n\nBut an index fund gains over the index owing to stock lending and index arbitrage.\n\nIndex funds mirror the performance of their benchmark index. Higher tracking errors can be attrib-\nuted to factors such as higher expenses of the scheme (higher expense ratio) and large-scale fluctuations/\nredemptions in the fund\u2019s assets under management (AUM).\n",

The fund manager changes the percentage of equity and debt allocation based on the\nmarket view.\n\nFund-of-funds invests in other mutual funds and offers a return to investors. Internationally, fund-\nof-funds do not limit their exposure to other mutual funds. They are more like hedge funds and put money\nin other fund classes such as private equity funds and distressed assets funds. This enables the investors\nin FOFs to obtain diversity in risk allocation. This strategy provides the fund manager more flexibility in\nallocating the investible corpus.\n\nThe flip side is that there may be a double layer of fees charged to the end investors. Investors pay the\nexpense fees to the fund manager responsible for the FOF. In addition, they could be required to bear\nthe charges incurred by the fund manager in buying into various MF schemes. Also, it is possible that the\nfund manager may be buying the same stock through various schemes.\n\nKotak Mutual Fund has an FOF that invests in schemes of other fund houses. The other mutual funds\noffering the scheme are Standard Chartered Mutual Fund and Prudential ICICI Mutual Fund. The assets\nunder management (AUM) of FOF schemes is quite low. The factors restraining the growth of FOF are:\n\n+ Dividend distribution tax is levied on FOF and this tax rate applicable to individuals is 14 per cent.\n+ The long-term capital gains tax of 10 per cent without indexation and 20 per cent with indexation\nis applicable to FOF. In equity mutual funds, the short-term gains tax is 10 per cent and long-term\ngains tax is nil. Hence, taxes are a major deterrent to the growth of FOFs. All investments in fund-\nof-funds are treated as debt investments and are taxed like debt funds. Investment in equity funds is\n\u2018exempt from long-term capital gains while debt funds are subject to the same at 10 per cent. Investment\nin a fund-of-funds attracts a long-term tax of 10 per cent. Fund-of-funds have to be actively man-\naged by fund managers. But it is difficult as very few asset classes are available to invest in and there\nis lack of information regarding the composition of corporate and retail investment.\n\nMost fund houses choose their own schemes to invest in an FOF schemes which limits the advantage\nof diversification an investor is looking for.\n\n",

                        "extracted-text": "DEBT FUNDS\n\nMoney Market Mutual Funds/Liquid Funds They specialize in investing in short-term money market\ninstruments like treasury bills, CBLO, commercial paper, certificate of deposit, and other money market\ninstruments. They do not carry cither interest rate risk or entry or exit loads. The objective of such funds is\nhigh liquidity with low rate of return. There is lot of portfolio churning (high portfolio turnover) in liquid\nfunds as the investments are of a very short term nature ranging from daily to monthly. Corporates invest\nin these funds to park their short-term surplus funds. Examples of money market funds are Templeton\nIndia Money Market Account and UTI MMF. There are two types of schemes: Liquid schemes and Liquid\nPlus schemes. Both invest in short-term debt securities but the difference between the two schemes is that\nliquid plus schemes invest in debt securities over 91 days maturity while liquid funds invest in money\nmarket instruments of maturity below 91 days.\n\nShort-term Bond Funds These are funds that seek to provide a high degree of liquidity, along with\ngeneration of reasonable returns, by investing in a portfolio consisting of short-term debt and money\nmarket instruments. Short-term bond funds are most often primarily made up of corporate bonds. During\nperiods of low interest rates, short-term bond funds do not yield higher returns as it is cheaper for\ncompanies to raise funds from banks than to raise funds from the corporate debt market.\n\nIt is a fund positioned between a liquid and a short-term debt product. The average maturity of the\nportfolio would be longer than a typical Liquid scheme but shorter than a typical debt scheme. Cor-\nrespondingly, the risk-return magnitude would also be higher than liquid but lower than debt scheme.\nExamples of short-term bond funds are HSBC Ultra Short Term Bond Fund and Kotak Bond Short Term.\n\nLong-term Bond Funds These funds invest in long-term government dated securities and corporate\nbonds. The market price of the underlying securities\u2014government securities, bonds, debentures\u2014\ndetermines the net asset value (NAV) of these funds. These securities carry high interest rate risk There\nis an inverse relationship between the interest rates and NAV of bond funds. With a change (increase/\ndecrease) in the interest rates, the market price of bonds fluctuates (decreases/increase) leading to a\nchange (fall/rise) in the NAV of bond funds. An example of long-term bond funds is Kotak Bond.\n\nGilt Funds Mutual funds which invest exclusively in government securities, both central and state\ngovernment, are called gilt funds. Gilt funds are safe as they do not carry credit or default risk. With a\nview to creating a wider investor base for government securities, the RBI encouraged setting up of gilt\nfunds. These funds are provided liquidity support by the RBI.\n\nFloating Rate Funds Floating rate funds are non-traditional funds which invest in floating rate\ninstruments. A floating rate instrument is one where the coupon rate is reset periodically to reflect\nthe current interest rates. The coupon rate is linked to a benchmark rate which may be the overnight\ncall money rate or treasury bill rate. In India, a variety of benchmark rates such as MIBOR (Mumbai\nInterbank Offer Rate), INBMK (Routers India Gilts Benchmark), INCPBMK (Reuters India Commercial\nPaper Reference Rate), yields on 91-day and 364-day treasury bill auctions are used by market players.\nThe most popular among these is the MIBOR.\n\nFloating rate instruments serve as an effective hedge against rising interest rates. With interest rates\nbottoming out and rise in inflation, floating rate funds are gaining popularity.\n\nA higher number of companies issued floating rate bonds in 2004. The benchmark five year AAA.\ncorporate bond yield rose resulting in an increase in cost of borrowing. Hence, most of the companies\nraised funds via FRBs to save on coupon payments. FRBs allow issuers to borrow on a long-term (3 to\n5 year tenors) basis based on a one-year benchmark such as government security yield or the call money\nrate\u2014MIBOR. Moreover, demand for FRBs stemmed from mutual funds. The floating rate schemes of\nmutual funds gained popularity which led to companies increasing by issuing floating rate bonds.\n\nFloating rate bonds are attractive as they can be swapped into a fixed rate through the overnight\nindexed swap (OIS) market. The overall cost of borrowing after paying the swap cost works out to be\ncheaper than a fixed rate bond. floating rate funds and liquid funds perform better when interest rates inch\nup There are 38 floating rate fund schemes available to investors in India. This product is attractive to\ninvestors who are seeking protection from rising inflation and potential interest rate rise.\n\nTempleton Floating Rate Fund is the largest floating rate fund in the Indian mutual fund industry. The\nfund was launched in 2002 with two plans\u2014the long-term plan and the short-term plan. The asset alloca-\ntion of the fund is a maximum of 35 per cent in fixed rate instruments and a minimum of 65 per cent in\nfloating rate instruments.\n\nFixed Maturity Plans They are debt-oriented funds, which invest in fixed income securities like bonds,\ngovernment securities and money market instruments. Being close-ended income schemes, they have\na fixed maturity period ranging from 15 days to one year. There are three-months, half-year, one-year\ndurations fixed maturity plans offered by mutual fund houses. As these bonds are held-to-maturity, these\nfunds are relatively less susceptible to interest rate risk. Fixed maturity plans (FMPs) lock-in the yield till\nmaturity to curb the interest rate risk. They are popular as they provid higher returns in the shorter term.\nIn an increasing interest rate scenario, fund houses invest in bonds of shorter duration which fetch good\nyields for investors. Also, investing in FMPs during the last week of March gives rise to the tax planning\nmechanism of double indexation. Let us understand this with the help of an illustration.\n\nSuppose Mr A's income is more than 710 lakh p.a. He wants to invest on March 25, 2010 for one\nyear an amount of 25 lacs . He has two option: invest this amount in a fixed deposit which will earn\nhim an interest rate of 9 per cent per annum or to invest this amount in a fixed maturity plan which will\nyield him a return of 8.9 per cent for 375 days. Suppose the official inflation rate on March 31, 2010 is\n5 per cent. In which option should Mr A invest his money?\n\nThe interest income on fixed deposit will be fully taxable in the hands of the investor. The tax rate\napplicable to Mr A is 33 per cent. Hence, the tax liability on interest income of 745,000 (%5,00,000 x 9%)\nis 714,850/-. Thus, the net interest income after tax on fixed deposit is 230,150/-. Now, if he invests in FMP\nhe will earn a yield of $44,500 (%5,00,000 x 8.9%). As he is investing during the last week of March, he\nwill get benefit of capital gain double indexation (as the investment is across two financial years) which is\n5 per cent + 5 per cent = 10 per cent which raises the basic cost to \u00a55,50,000, thus exempting him from tax\non capital gain. Thus, the net income after tax on investment in FMP is %44,500/-.\n\nCapital Protection Schemes Investment in equity markets is risky as there is a possibility of losing\ninvestment. Risk averse investors avoid investing in stocks and prefer low-return assured schemes such\nas NSC, Post office monthly income schemes, provident fund, bank deposits, etc. In order to attract these\nrisk-averse investors to mutual funds and increase the total size of the market of mutual funds, SEBI gave\napproval to fund houses to launch Capital Protection Schemes (CPS). These schemes aim at protecting\nthe initial capital investment of the investor and do not guarantee any assured returns. Few years ago\nmutual funds used to offer assured return schemes which assured a specific (fixed) return to the investors\nirrespective of the performance of the scheme. These schemes were banned in 2004.\n\nAccording to SEBI guidelines, in case of capital protection oriented scheme, the mutual funds shall\ndisclose in the offer document, Key Information Memorandum (KIM) as well as in the advertisements\nthat the scheme offered is \u2018oriented towards protection of capital\u2019 and \u2018not with guaranteed returns\u2019. It\nshould also be indicated that the orientation towards protection of the capital originates from the portfolio\nstructure of the scheme and not from any bank guarantee, insurance cover etc. The proposed portfolio\nstructure should be rated on a quarterly basis by a credit rating and continuously monitored by the trustees\nfrom the perspective of assessing the degree of certainty for achieving the objective of capital protection.\nFurther, it should also be ensured that the debt component of the portfolio structure has the highest invest-\nment grade rating.\n\nCapital protection scheme is close-ended and rated by a credit rating agency. Under this scheme, a\nlarge proportion of the corpus is invested in highly-rated debt securities to ensure capital protection and\nsmall proportion of the corpus is invested in equities to gain from capital appreciation to provide a return\nhigher than the traditional low-return assured schemes of the government and banks.\n\nThis scheme is of advantage to both the risk-averse investors and fund managers. The investors capi-\ntal is protected and they can access the capital market without increasing their risk. Being closeended\nschemes, the fund managers can effectively manage the funds but the investors funds are blocked for a\nparticular period.\n\nFranklin Templeton Capital Protection Oriented Fund, Reliance Capital Shield Fund, and Sundaram\nBNP Paribas Savings Plus are some examples of Capital Protection Schemes.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "OTHER FUNDS\n\nP/E Ratio Fund P/E ratio fund is another mutual fund variant that is offered by Pioneer ITI Mutual\nFund. The P/E (price-carnings) ratio is the ratio of the price of the stock of a company to its earnings per\nshare (EPS). The P/E ratio of the index is the weighted average price-earnings ratio of all its constituent\nstocks.\n\nThe PE ratio fund invests in equities and debt instruments wherein the proportion of the investment\nis determined by the ongoing price-earnings multiple of the market. Broadly, around 90 per cent of the\ninvestible funds will be invested in equity if the Nifty Index P/E ratio is 12 or below. If this ratio exceeds 28,\nthe investment will be in debt/money markets. Between the two ends of 12 and 28 P/E ratio of the Nifty, the\nfund will allocate varying proportions of its investible funds to equity and debt. The objective of this scheme\nis to provide superior risk-adjusted returns through a balanced portfolio of equity and debt instruments.\n\nExchange Traded Funds Exchange traded funds (ETFs) are a hybrid of open-ended mutual funds and\nlisted individual stocks. They are index funds listed on stock exchanges and trade like individual stocks\n\u2018on the stock exchange. However, trading at the stock exchanges does not affect their portfolio. ETFs\ndo not sell their shares directly to investors for cash. The shares are offered to investors over the stock\nexchange. In case of ETFs, the AMC issues units to Authorized Participants (APs), who, in turn, act as\nmarket makers for the ETFs. The Authorized Participants provide two way quotes for the ETFs on the\nstock exchange, which enables investors to buy and sell the ETFs at any given point of time.\n\nETFs are basically passively managed funds that track a particular index such as S&P CNX Nifty.\nThey are passive index funds and due to passive fund management these funds charge lesser fees as com-\npared to other funds Since they are open-ended and listed on stock exchanges, it is possible to buy and\nsell them throughout the day and their price is determined by the demand-supply forces in the market. In\npractice, they trade in a small range around the value of the assets (NAV) held by them.\n\nETFs are the innovation of the last few years, a mix between mutual funds and investment trusts. As\nwith mutual funds, new units can be created at any time, so in theory there is no maximum size the fund\ncan reach. This also means that the issuer can keep the price linked to the price of asset, by issuing or\nredeeming shares if it gets out of line. But, as with investment trusts, they are traded continuously, so\nyou can buy and sell them much like shares. Unlike any other open-ended scheme, where the NAV of\nthe scheme is declared at the end of the day and the units can be bought and sold through the fund house\nonly, ETF units are traded on stock exchanges and can be bought and sold through these exchanges. The\nrate or price at which the ETF unit is traded on the exchange is very close to the real NAV of the scheme.\nThey can be bought or sold at the prevailing prices through any broker throughout the country. Thus, ETF\nprices will vary for each investor as the prices vary throughout the day. Moreover, as ETFs are traded on\na stock exchange, investors need to open a demat account.\n\nNow, asset classes such as indices, gold, and silver are used to create ETFs. In India, there are ETFs\n\u2018on two asset classes\u2014indices (Nifty, Sensex, and Bankex) and gold.\n\nETFs offer several distinct advantages.\n\nETFs bring the trading and real time pricing advantages of individual stocks to mutual funds. The\nability to trade intra-day at prices that are usually close to the actual intra-day NAV of the scheme\nmakes it almost real-time trading. ETFs can be bought and sold throughout the trading day, allowing\nfor intra-day trading\u2014which is rare with mutual funds.\n\nETFs are simpler to understand and hence they can attract small investors who are deterred to trade\nin index futures due to requirement of minimum contract size. Small investors can buy minimum\none unit of ETF, can place limit orders and trade intra-day. This, in turn, would increase liquidity of\nthe cash market.\n\nETFs can be used to arbitrate effectively between index futures and spot index. The presence of\nmarket makers can create or redeem units directly with the funds for exchange of defined basket of\nunderlying securities. Hence, any difference in the NAV and the price on the exchange is used as an\narbitrage opportunity by the market maker.\n\nETFs provide the benefits of diversified index funds. The investor can benefit from the flexibility of\nstocks as well as the diversification.\n\nETFs being passively managed, have a somewhat higher NAV against an index fund of the same\nportfolio. The operating expenses of ETFs are lower than even those of similar index funds as they\ndo not have to service investors who deal in shares through stock exchanges.\n\nETFs can be beneficial for financial institutions also. Financial institutions can use ETFs for utiliz-\ning idle cash, managing redemptions, modifying sector allocations, and hedging market exposure.\n\nWorking of ETFs\n\n1. An AMC appoints authorized participants (APs) who deposit all the shares that comprise the\nindex (or the gold in case of Gold ETF) with the AMC.\n\n2. The shares or gold deposited with the AMC is known as \u2018Portfolio Deposit\u2019 which is then depos-\nited with a custodian for safe-keeping. The custodian keeps record of all the shares/gold that has\nbeen deposited/ withdrawn under the ETF.\n\n3. The AMC then allots \u2018creation units\u2019 to the authorized participants. Creation units are bundled ETF\nunits which are then split into small units for selling to retail investors. Each Creation Unit com-\nprises ofa pre-defined number of ETF Units (say 100, 500, 1,000, 10,000, or any other number).\n\n4, If there is more demand, these authorized participants will increase their portfolio deposit (deposit\nmore shares/gold) with the AMC and get more creation units to satisfy the demand. Or if there\nis more redemption, then they give back these creation units to the AMC, take back their shares/\ngold, sell them in the market, and pay the investor.\n\nThe first exchange traded fund\u2014Standard and Poor's Depository Receipt (SPDR\u2014also called Spi-\nder)\u2014was launched in the US in 1993. ETFs have grown rapidly with around USD 100 billion in assets as\non December 2001. Today, about 60 per cent of trading value on the American Stock Exchange (AMEX)\nis from ETFs. ETFs were launched in Europe and Asia in 2001. Currently, more than 280 ETFs are avail-\nable in US, Europe, Singapore, Hongkong, Japan, and other countries. Among the popular ones are SPD&\n(Spiders) based on the S&P 500 Index, QQQs (cubes) based on the Nasdaq-100 Index, i SHARES based\non MSCI Indices and TRAHK (Tracks) based on the Hang Seng Index. The ETF structure has seen over\nUSD 336 billion pouring into more than 390 ETFs. It has become the fastest growing fund structure.\n\nThe first ETF to be introduced in India is Nifty Benchmark Exchange-Traded Scheme (Nifty BeES).\nIt is an open-ended ETF, launched towards the end of 2001 by Benchmark Mutual Funds. The fund is\nlisted in the capital market segment of the NSE and trades the S&P CNX Nifty Index. The Benchmark\nAsset Management Company has become the first company in Asia (excluding Japan) to introduce ETF.\nEach Nifty BeES unit is 1/10th of the S&P CNX Nifty Index value. Nifty BeES units are traded and set-\ntled in dematerialized form like any other share in the rolling settlement. It charges a management fee of\n0.35 per cent and the total expense ratio is 0.80 per cent p.a., which is the lowest in India. It has a track-\ning error of 0.12 per cent (annualized), which is again the lowest in India for any index fund. Junior\nBeES was launched by Benchmark Mutual Fund on March 6, 2003 and trades on the capital market\nsegment of the NSE. Each Junior BeES unit is 1/10th of the CNX Nifty Junior Index value. Benchmark\nMutual Fund now offers six ETF products: Banking BeES, Benchmark Derivative Fund, Benchmark\nSplit Capital Fund (A and B), Liquid Benchmark ETS, Nifty Benchmark ETS (BeES), and Nifty Junior\nBeES. The Liquid BeES fund was launched in July 2003 and tracks the Crisil Liquid Benchmark. The\nbanking BeES fund tracks the CNX Bank Index, which comprises 12 key banking stocks. Each unit is\npriced at 1/10th of the CNX Bank Index. The Benchmark Derivative fund was launched in December\n2004 and the Split Capital fund was launched in July 2005. Benchmark Asset Management handles four\nout of five ETFs currently available in the market. Benchmark AMC has also launched an exchange-\ntraded index fund\u2014Shariah BeES\u2014that invests insecurities which are constituent of S&P CNX Nifty\nShariah index in the same proportion as in the index. A Shariah compliant fund is one which does not\ninvest in companies engaged in the business of liquor, tobacco, and banking.\n\nSENSEX Prudential ICICI Exchange Traded Fund (SPICE) is the first exchange traded fund (ETF)\non SENSEX launched by Prudential ICICI Mutual Fund. One unique feature of SPICE is that it can be\nbought and sold like any other equity share on the BSE trading terminal (BOLT) through a stockbroker.\nThe price of one SPIcE unit will be equal to approximately 1/100th of SENSEX value. For example, if\nthe current SENSEX is at 17,500, one SPIcE unit will trade at around 7175. The minimum lot size is one\nunit of SPICE and a retail investor can buy one SPICE unit for 7175 and hold it in his demat account just\nlike any other security. UTI launched UTI Sunder Fund which tracks the S&P CNX Nifty.\n\nGold Exchange Traded Funds In January 2006, SEBI permitted introduction of Gold Exchange\nTraded Fund (GETF) schemes by mutual funds. Gold Exchange Traded Fund schemes are permitted\nto invest primarily in (a) Gold (b) Gold related instruments\u2014Regulation 2 (mc) stipulates that gold\nrelated instruments are such instruments having gold as underlying, as may be specified by SEBI from\ntime to time.\n\nSince physical gold and other permitted instruments linked to gold are denominated in gold tonnage, it will\nbe valued based on the market price of gold in the domestic market and will be marked to market on a daily\nbasis. The market price of gold in the domestic market on any business deal would be arrived at as under:\n\nDomestic price of gold = (London Bullion Market Association AM fixing in US S/ounce x conversion\nfactor for converting ounce into kg for 0.995 fineness x rate for US $ into INR) + custom duty for import\nof gold + sales tax/octroi and other levies applicable.\n\nNAV of units under the scheme shall be calculated as shown below:\n\nNAV = Market or Fair Value of Scheme\u2019s Investments + Current Assets \u2014 Current Liabilities and\nProvision / Number of Units outstanding under scheme on the valuation date\n\nAs there are no indices catering to the gold sector/securities linked to Gold, GETF shall be bench-\nmarked against the price of gold.\n\nGlobally, the first GETF\u2014Gold BeES was mooted by Benchmark Mutual Fund during May 2002.\n\nGETFs have been successfully launched in countries like Australia, the UK, the US, and South Africa\nand have total assets under management (AUM) of over $2.7 billion.\n\nIn India, investment in gold is a preferred avenue and asset allocation in gold is around 10 per cent.\nHence, GETFs should be aimed at gold investors who can diversify the portfolio risk and enhance their\nwealth.\n\nInvestment in GETFs is beneficial to investors in many ways.\n\n1. They not only provide ease of trade to investors, but also enable them to buy gold at near-market\nprice.\n\n2. Units can be resold anytime on the stock exchange at the trading price on the date of sale. Resale\nis not subject to tax deducted at source.\n\n3. Holding gold in demat form does not attract wealth tax and the benefit of long-term gains accrues\nat the end of one year. Thus, the tax liability on the gains arising from sale of the units is 20 per\ncent after one year.\n\n4. No storage or insurance costs have to be borne by investors.\n\n5. GETFs are a good hedge against stock market volatility and depreciation of the dollar.\n\nThus, GETFs are one of the most cost-effective ways to acquire gold. But the investors have to bear\nbrokerage charges at the time of purchase of units from the exchange, which can range from 0.10-1 per\ncent. Fund houses also charge an expense ratio of 1 per cent per annum on account of administrative and\ncustodian expenses. Moreover, investors cannot exchange GETF units for physical gold or jewellery.\n\nReal Estate Mutual Funds Real Estate Mutual Funds (REMFs) mobilize money from individuals and\ninstitutions and deploy them in real estate. The real estate industry in India is one of the fastest growing\nsectors on account of liberalised (100 per cent) FDI regime, booming economy and easy availability of\nretail loans at attractive rates from banks and financial institutions leading to a bull rally in real estate\nprices. These funds allow retail investors a chance to participate in the booming real estate market\nand diversify their investment portfolio. Besides, because of lack of transparency and hassles involved\nin direct investment in real estate, REMFs provide a sense of security to small investor and ease of\ntransactions.\n\nREMFS also benefit developers of properties as it provides a long-term alternative to bank finance or\noverseas borrowing. Moreover, participation of REMFs in property development projects can serve to\nimprove corporate governance of real estate companies.\n\nAccording to the SEBI guidelines,\n\n1. REMFs can invest directly in real estate properties within India, in mortgage-backed (housing\nlease) securities, in equity shares/bonds/debentures of listed/unlisted companies which deal in\nproperties and also undertake property development.\n\n2. The structure of REMFs will be close-ended initially.\n\n3. The units of REMFs shall be listed on the stock exchanges and NAVs of such schemes should be\ndeclared on a daily basis.\n\n4. REMFs should appoint a registered custodian who could safe-keep the titles of the real estate\nproperties held by them.\n\n5. A real estate mutual fund scheme shall not undertake lending or housing finance activities.\n\n6. The asset management company of a mutual fund having real estate mutual fund schemes shall\nappoint suitable number of qualified key personnel with relevant experience, before undertaking\ninvestment management of real estate assets of a real estate mutual fund scheme.\n\n7. SEBI-registered real estate mutual funds will be given a tax pass-through status if they invest the\nmoney raised from investors in shares of real estate companies. So will be the case for all mutual\nfunds investing in shares of realty companies.\n\nDefinition of Real Estate Asset A \u2018real estate asset\u2019 means an identifiable immovable property:\n\n1. which is located within India in such city as may be specified by the Board from time to time or in\n\na special economic zone within the meaning of clause (za) of Section 2 of the Special Economic\n\nZones Act, 2005 (28 of 2005);\n\non which construction is complete and which is usable;\n\n. which is evidenced by valid title documents;\n\n. which is legally transferable;\n\n. which is free from all encumbrances;\n\n. which is not subject matter of any litigation; but does not include\n\n.a project under construction; or\n\n. a vacant land; or\n\n. a deserted property; or\n\n. a land specified for agricultural use; or\n\n. a property which is reserved or attached by any Government or other authority or pursuant to\norders of a court of law or the acquisition of which is otherwise prohibited under any law for\nthe time being in force;\n\nAuUswD\n\neRe gE\n\nEligibility Criteria A Certificate of registration may be granted under Regulation 9 to an applicant\nproposing to launch only real estate mutual fund schemes if he has been carrying on business in real estate\nfor a period of not less than five years. An existing mutual fund may launch a real estate mutual fund scheme\nif it has an adequate number of key personnel and directors having adequate experience in real estate.\n\nPermissible Investments\n\n. Every real estate mutual fund scheme shall invest at least 35 per cent of the net assets of the\nscheme directly in real estate assets.\n\n. Subject to sub-regulation (1), every real estate mutual fund scheme shall invest:\n\na. at least 75 per cent of the net assets of the scheme in (i) real estate assets; (ii) mortgage\nbacked securities (but not directly in mortgages); (iii) equity shares or debentures of compa-\nnies engaged in dealing in real estate assets or in undertaking real estate development projects,\nwhether listed on a recognized stock exchange in India or not;\n\nb. the balance in other securities;\n\n. Unless otherwise disclosed in the offer document, no mutual fund shall, under all its real estate\nmutual fund schemes, invest more than 30 per cent of its net assets in a single city.\n\n4. No mutual fund shall, under all its real estate mutual fund schemes, invest more than 15 per cent\nof its net assets in the real estate assets of any single real estate project. A \u2018single real estate pro-\nject\u2019 means a project by a builder in a single location within a city.\n\n. No mutual fund shall, under all its real estate mutual fund schemes, invest more than 25 per cent\nof the total issued capital of any unlisted company.\n\n6. No mutual fund shall invest more than 15 per cent of the net assets of any of its real estate mutual\n\nfund schemes in the equity shares or debentures of any unlisted company.\n\n7. No real estate mutual fund scheme shall invest in any:\n\na. unlisted security of the sponsor or its associate or group company;\n\nb. listed security issued by way of preferential allotment by the sponsor or its associate or group\ncompany;\n\nc. listed security of the sponsor or its associate or group company, in excess of 25 per cent of the\nnet assets of the scheme.\n\n8. No mutual fund shall transfer real estate assets amongst its schemes.\n\n9. No mutual fund shall invest in any real estate asset which was owned by the sponsor or the asset\n\nmanagement company or any of its associates during the period of last five years or in which the\n\nsponsor or the asset management company or any of its associates hold tenancy or lease rights.\n\nN\n\nwe\n\nww\n\nValuation of Real Estates Assets and Declaration of Net Asset Value\n\n1. The real estate assets held by a real estate mutual fund scheme shall be valued at:\na. cost price on the date of acquisition; and\nb. fair price on every 19\" day from the day of its purchase in accordance with the norms specified\nin Schedule IXB.\n\n2. The asset management company, its directors, the trustees, and the real estate valuer shall ensure\nthat the valuation of assets held by a real estate mutual fund scheme are done in good faith, in\naccordance with the norms specified in Schedule IX B and that the accounts of the scheme are\nprepared in accordance with accounting principles specified in Schedule XI.\n\n3. The net asset value of every real estate mutual fund scheme shall be calculated and declared at the\nclose of each business day on the basis of the most current valuation of the real estate assets held\nby the scheme and accrued income thereon, if any.\n\nUsage of Real Estate Assets of a Real Estate Mutual Fund Scheme\n\n1. The asset management company may let out or lease out the real estate assets held by the real\nestate mutual fund scheme if the term of such lease or letting does not extend beyond the period\nof maturity of the scheme.\n\n2. Where real estate assets are let out or leased out, the asset management company shall diligently\ncollect the rents or other income in a timely manner.\n\n3. Real estate assets held by a real estate mutual fund scheme may be let out to the sponsor, asset\nmanagement company or any of their associates, at market price or otherwise on commercial\nterms provided that not more than 25 per cent of the total rental income of the scheme shall\nbe derived from assets so let out. In the US, wealthy promoters set up Real Estate Invest-\nment Trusts (REITs) in 1960 to make investments in large income producing real estates. The\nshares of many REITs are traded on New York Stock Exchange on the basis of yield. There\nare over 190 REITs registered with Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and having total\nassets exceeding USD 500 billion. These funds have given excellent risk-adjusted returns to\nthe unitholders.\n\nReal Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) REITs are classified as equity, mortgage, or hybrids. Equity\nREITs own and operate income producing real estate. Mortgage REITs lend money directly to real estate\nowners and operators or extend credit directly through the acquisition of loans or mortgage-backed\nsecurities. Hybrids own properties as well as lend to real estate owners and operators.\n\nREITs pool in investors\u2019 money and invest the fund generated in commercial and residential property.\nAn investor, therefore, becomes a \u2018unitholder\u2019 in the REIT. In contrast to directly investing by purchas-\ning property that, otherwise, is expensive to buy, an owner of one REIT unit buys a \u2018one-unit portion\u2019 of\na managed pool of property. This pool of property then generates income through renting, leasing, and\nsales, and distributes the said income directly to the REIT-holder on a regular basis in the form of divi.\ndends. REITs would provide an opportunity for small investors to access high yields as well as liquidity\nat small units of investment. Among other things, REITs invest in residential and commercial property\nsuch as shopping malls, office buildings, apartments, warehouses, and hotels. Hence, investment in REIT\nwould make the investor portfolio a diversified one and also increase the stability of income sources. The\nintroduction of REITs in India would provide a further boost to the real estate industry. This would result\nin increased rental housing generation and also raise cheaper funds for this sector.\n\nREITs are different from REMFs. Real estate mutual funds (REMFs) are permitted to invest both in\nreal estate directly as well as in securities, including mortgage-backed securities and shares of companies\nowning/developing real estate. As opposed to that, under the draft regulations, REITs are permitted to\ninvest only directly in real estate. Moreover, REMFs can take development risk and trade in securities,\nhence have a potential for higher returns, albeit with a higher risk, while REITs would generally invest in\nstabilized income-yielding assets with lower returns and commensurate risk. Thus, REMFs are like bal-\nanced mutual funds, whereas REITs are like pure debt funds.\n\nThe SEBI issued draft regulations in January 2008 for the functioning of real estate investment trusts\n(REITs) in India.\n\n1. The REIT should be in the form of a trust created under the Indian Trusts Act. Trustees should\neither be a scheduled bank, public financial institution, insurance company, or a body corporate.\n\n2. The scheme should be launched by a trust and managed by a real estate investment management\ncompany. Both the trust and real estate investment management company should be registered\nwith the SEBI.\n\n3. Only close-ended schemes should be launched by the trusts, and these schemes have to be listed\non the stock exchange mentioned in the offer document\n\nThe scheme shall only invest in real estate and the real estate shall generally be income-\n\ngenerating.\n\n\n4. An independent principal valuer should be appointed who will value all the real estate under the\nscheme after physical inspection. The valuation methodology shall follow the \u2018valuation stand-\nards on properties\u2019 published from time to time by the concerned Indian institute or the inter-\nnational valuation standards issued from time-to-time by the International Valuation Standards\nCommittee.\n\n5. REIT, under all its schemes, should not have exposure to more than 15 per cent of any single real\nestate project. It can buy uncompleted units in a building, which is unoccupied and non-income pro-\nducing ,or in the course of development but the aggregate contract value of such real estate should\nnot exceed 20 per cent of the total net asset value of the scheme at the time of acquisition.\n\n6. REIT, under all its schemes, should not have exposure to more than 25 per cent of all the real\nestate projects developed, marketed, or financed by the same group of companies. The scheme\nis prohibited from investing in vacant land or participating in property development activities.\n\n7. A scheme may borrow for financing investment or operating purposes but aggregate borrowings\nshall not at any time exceed one-fifth of the value of total gross assets of the scheme. The scheme\nmay mortgage or pledge its assets to secure such borrowings. The scheme shall disclose in its\noffer document its borrowing policy including its maximum borrowing limit and the basis for\ncalculating such limit.\n\n8. The scheme shall distribute to unit holders as dividends each year an amount not less than 90 per\ncent of its annual net income after tax.\n\nReal asset investment trusts and real estate mutual funds will widen options for investors and thereby\nhelp in the growth of mutual fund business. According to a study by McKinsey, a consultancy firm, both\nthe products could add $10\u201414 billion to the asset under management (AUM) by 2012.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "RISK AND RETURN IN MUTUAL FUNDS\n\nRisk Mutual fund investments are not free from risk. Equity-oriented mutual funds more risky\ncompared to debt mutual funds. Equity-oriented mutual fund schemes are risky as their returns are\nmarket-linked. A fall in the price of equity shares can lead to a fall in the value of equity holdings in the\nscheme which may result in a fall in the net asset value (NAV). There is wide variety of equity schemes\nsuch as diversified equity schemes, index funds, sectoral schemes and equity-linked savings schemes.\nThe proportion of risk varies from scheme to scheme. Sectoral schemes, which invest their funds into\nshares of a particular sector are considered to be more risky as compared to diversified equity schemes\nas their investment is concentrated in one sector. In case of index funds, the risk is proportionate to the\nmovement of the index and this movement is reflected in the fund. Equity-linked saving schemes give\nhigh returns with high risk (Figure 15.2).\n\nSector\n\nDiversified\n\nBalanced\n\nReturns:\n\nFigure 15.2 Risk vs. Return\n\nTax Implications for Mutual Fund Investors In the amendments made by the finance minister on\nJuly 21, 2004, units of equity oriented mutual funds are to be treated as \u2018securities\u2019. Thus, transaction in\nthese units attract Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on equity-oriented fund schemes. The transaction tax\nis payable by the seller at rate of 0.25 per cent on the sale of a unit of an equity-oriented fund to the mutual\nfund. Trading of units of debt and liquid funds do not attract STT but are liable to capital gains tax. The\nmutual fund units in case of equity-oriented fund schemes are exempt from long-term capital gains tax\nand carry a flat rate of 10 per cent short-term capital gains tax.\n\nDivided distribution tax (DDT) is paid by the mutual fund and not its investor. However, the investor\nindirectly bears the tax burden as it is deducted from the NAV. This results in lower returns to investors.\n\nThis tax is applicable only to investors in dividend options of debt-oriented mutual fund schemes. On\nFebruary 28, 2007, the DDT on liquid and money market funds for individual investors was hiked to\n25 per cent (effective rate inclusive of education cess and surcharge around 28.32 per cent), while the tax\non other debt funds remained at 12.5 per cent (effective rate inclusive of surcharge 14.2 per cent). For\ncorporates, the DDT on liquid and money market funds was hiked to 25 per cent (effective rate 28.32 per\ncent) and on other debt funds was hiked to 20 per cent (effective rate 22.66 per cent).\n",

                        "extracted-text": "How to Invest in a Scheme of Mutual Fund?\n\nThere are around 857 schemes floated by 39 mutual funds. Every month fund, houses come up with new\nschemes. It is on the investor to decide whether to invest in an existing scheme or a new fund offering of\na mutual fund.\n\nWhenever a new scheme is to be launched by a fund house, it is advertised in newspapers. The investor\nhas to fill up an application form to subscribe to a scheme. Mutual funds appoint agents and distributors\nto provide services such as distribution of application forms, providing information about the scheme\nand giving investment advice. Nowadays, banks and post offices also help in distribution of mutual funds\nscheme to investors, An investor can also approach the respective offices of the mutual funds called Inves-\ntor Service Centers (ISCs) in his particular town or city.\n\nInvestor also receives an abridged offer document or the Key Information Memorandum (KIM), which\nis provided with the application form containing information regarding main features of the scheme, risk\nfactors, initial issue expenses and recurring expenses to be charged to the scheme, entry or exit loads,\nsponsor's track record, educational qualification and work experience of key personnel including fund\nmanagers, performance of other schemes launched by the mutual fund in the past, pending litigations\nand penalties imposed. The application form for subscription to a scheme is an integral part of the offer\ndocument.\n\nInvestment in mutual fund is not free from risks. All investments in mutual fund and securities are\nsubject to market risks and the NAVs of the schemes may go up or down depending upon the factors and\nforces affecting the securities market including the fluctuations in the interest rates. Besides the NAV,\nthe investor should look at average returns and volatility of the returns given by the fund. A fund giving\nconsistent returns is better than a fund whose returns are highly volatile. Moreover, the returns given\nby the fund should be compared with benchmarks like BSE Sensex and S&P Nifty. An investor should\nalso study the past performance track record of the scheme and also compare its performance with other\nschemes having similar investment objectives. The past performance of the mutual fund is not neces-\nsarily indicative of future performance of the scheme. He should also look at the quality of the scheme\nportfolio, i.e., investment made in each security such as equity, debentures, money market instruments\nand government securities, their quantity, market value, and percentage to NAV. In case of debt-oriented\nscheme, he should also look into the rating of the debt instrument. An investor should also check whether\nthe scheme is open-ended or close-ended. If it is a close-ended scheme, he may have to pay an exit load.\nWhen choosing a fund, an investor should also look into the expense ratio- the cost he pays towards the\nservices he avails of from mutual funds. A high expense ratio lowers the rate of return of schemes and\na lower expense ratio boosts the rate of return. For debt funds and index funds, expense ratio is more\nimportant, He may also consult financial experts or read financial dailies which publish research reports\non performance of mutual funds.\n\nApart from assessing the risk profile of the scheme, an investor should also take into account his risk-\ntaking capacity, objective of investment, time period of investment, age, lifestyle, and cash flow require-\nments before making a choice of particular scheme. Asset allocation, which is a function of risk appetite\nand goals, contributes more than 90 per cent to the portfolio\u2019s returns. A young investor with an above\naverage risk appetite may go for growth oriented scheme or an investor nearing retirement may prefer\ndebt- oriented scheme or fixed maturity plans. If an investor prefers cash flow at regular intervals, he may\nlook at dividend plans as most give payouts at least once a year. Mutual funds should be looked at from\na medium-term to long-term perspective and investors need to go for a careful combination of different\nthemes and sectors. Investor should design a well-balanced portfolio and rebalance it on a regular basis.\n\nAfter subscribing to the units of a particular scheme of a mutual fund, he will receive a certificate or\nstatement of accounts within 30 days from the date of closure of the initial public offer of the scheme. An\naccount statement is a document that contains details of the investors; the units allotted or redeemed, NAV\n\n\non that particular day, and the date of transaction. In case of close-ended schemes, he will receive either a\ndemat account statement or unit certificates within six weeks of the date of closure of the initial subscrip-\ntion of the scheme. An investor must monitor his investments regularly by going through the Fund Fact\nSheet- a monthly document published by all mutual funds. This document gives all details as regards the\nAUMs of all its schemes, top holdings in all the portfolios of all the schemes, loads, minimum investment,\nperformance of the scheme since its launch, comparison of scheme\u2019s performance with the benchmark\nindex such as the S&P CNX Nifty, fund manager's outlook, portfolio composition, expense ratio, portfolio\nturnover, risk adjusted returns, equity/ debt split for schemes, YTM for debt portfolios, and other informa-\ntion which the mutual fund considers important from the investor's decision making point of view.\n\nSubsequently, investor will also receive quarterly newsletter from the fund house informing him about\nany material changes such as changes in the nature or terms of the scheme, conversion of the scheme\nfrom close-ended to open-ended and change in sponsor. Fund houses also disclose scheme portfolio on\nhalf-yearly basis to their unitholders. These disclosures help the investor to decide the timing of entry and\nexit ina particular scheme of the mutual fund. Investors are also offered switching facility which provides\ninvestors with an option to transfer the funds among different types of schemes or plans. An entry load\nis charged to an investor switching from a debt scheme to equity scheme while there is no entry load on\nswitching from an equity scheme to a debt scheme.\n\nMethodology of Investment in a Mutual Fund An investor may invest a lumpsum in a particular\nscheme/s of mutual fund. But he needs to correctly time the market and predicting whether the market is\ngoing to move up, down or sideways is difficult even for professionals. If the investment is done when the\nmarkets are at high levels, his risk increases on account of volatility of markets. There is an alternative\nmode of investment available known as Systematic Investment plans (SIPs). Instead of making one\nlumpsum investment, an investor may put in a fixed sum of money each month, over a period of time\nregardless of the mutual fund\u2019s unit price. Under this plan a fixed sum of money is invested periodically\nin equity and equity-oriented mutual fund schemes. This plan avoids the problem of market timing and\nusually gives high returns if the investor has a long-term investment horizon. Hence, through the power\nof compounding, this plan usually does well in the long run (Refer Figure 15.3).\n\nSystematic investment plan (SIP) is a popular investment strategy employed by a large mass of investors.\n\n+ As the minimum of investment is 7500 every month, this plan attracts investors of diverse income\ngroups.\n\n+ Regular commitment of investment of small amount for longer duration. Investing a small amount\nevery month or every quarter results in forced savings.\n\n1000 Invested Monthly...\n\nThe Power of Compounding\nInvestments @8%\n\nAmount Invested | EE |\n[i Compounded Value\n\n| EEE |\n\n1,200,000\n\n1,000,000\n\n800,000\n\n600,000\n400,000 3,00,000\n200,000\n\n3 Years 5 Years 10 Years 15 Years 20 Years 25 Years\n\nInvesting Even a Small Amount Regularly, Helps Create Wealth\n\nFigure 15.3 Regular Investment Benefits\n\n* Skill of timing the market is not required because an investor is investing at all levels. Through\ndisciplined, regular investments an investor has not to worry about when and how much to invest.\n\n+ Equity market moves both sides so he gets the benefit of averaging out the cost of purchase.\n\n+ Investing regularly, irrespective of market behavior, helps manage volatility. Investing a small\namount every month brings down the risk. Also, more the volatility more chances of returns.\n\nA fixed amount invested regularly buys more units when the price is low and fewer when the price is high,\nwhich can mean a lower average cost per unit over a period of time- this concept is known as Rupee Cost\nAveraging. Let us understand this with help of an illustration.\n\nFollowing is the NAV of a mutual fund scheme on the first of each month from January to June-224,\n221, 718, 716, 716 and %12 respectively. Looking to the trend, we observe that NAV of this scheme is\nvolatile. Suppose there are two investors: Mr. A and Mr. B. Both have invested %6000 in this scheme. Mr.\nA has invested %6000 on January 1, at a unit price of 224 and he has been allotted 250 units.\n\nMr. B has invested 71000 on the first of each month for six months. He has acquired 289.41 units at an\naverage cost of 220.73 each. The investment\u2019s value at the end of the period would be %6077.61 (289.41*21)\n(Box 15.4) much higher than that of Mr. A\u2019s investment value which is %5250 (250 units *21).\n\nNow, SIPs come with free life insurance cover to investors. Through this, mutual fund houses aim to\ninduce a long-term savings habit among investors. To earn higher returns, investors need to choose the\nright scheme. Investment through SIP will lose value if invested in a wrong scheme.\n\nSome mutual fund houses such as UTI Asset Management, SBI Mutual Fund, ICICI Prudential, and\nBharti AXA have started micro SIPs in their bid to reach out to the large masses who cannot afford\n2500 SIP. The SBI Mutual Fund offers a \u2018chota SIP\u2019 starting at 2100 targeting farmers and daily wage\nearners. This scheme will create an awareness of the benefits of savings and financial planning among\nlow-income groups.\n\nMutual funds also give facilities of systematic withdrawals and systematic transfer of funds to inves-\ntors. Depending on an investor's needs for monthly or quarterly income, he can then choose to withdraw\neither a fixed sum per month or quarter, or the capital appreciation in the Net Asset Value of his invest-\nment. A systematic withdrawal plan (SWP) enables an investor to take money out of a fund account\naccording to a regular schedule that he chooses. If the investor desires to transfer money from one scheme\nto another, then there is another plan available known as Systematic transfer plan (STP). An STP ena-\nbles an investor to switch or transfer a fixed amount of money at regular intervals from his fixed income\nscheme investments to designated equity and balanced schemes. In effect, this is similar to a systematic\ninvestment plan, except that in a SIP the investment flows from a bank account into the fund and here it\nflows from one scheme to another.\n\n",

These norms\nwere issued in November 2003, to check the abuse of the mutual fund vehicle by large corporate\ninvestors for tax benefits. The new norms stipulate that each mutual fund scheme should have\natleast 20 investors and no single investor should hold more than 25 per cent of the total corpus of\nthe scheme.\n\n* The PAN is now the sole identification for all market participants with appropriate affix or suffix to\nidentify the nature of investment product , irrespective of the amount of transaction, effective July\n2, 2007.\n\n+ Every mutual fund should be and sell securities on delivery basis.

Based on the recommendations of the\nAMFI, detailed guidelines have been issued by the SEBI for valuation of unlisted equity shares.\n\nA major initiative of the AMFI during the year 2001-02 was the launching of registration of AMFI\nCertified Intermediaries and providing recognition and status to the distributor agents. More than 30\ncorporate distributors and a large number of agent distributors have registered with the AMFI. The AMFI\nGuidelines and Norms for Intermediaries (AGNI) released in February 2002, gives a framework of rules\nand guidelines for the intermediaries and for the conduct of their business.\n\nAMFI maintains a liaison with different regulators such as the SEBI, the IRDA, and the RBI to prevent\nany over-regulation that may stifle the growth of the industry. AMFI has set up a working group to for-\nmulate draft guidelines for pension scheme by mutual funds for submission to IRDA. It holds meetings\nand discussions with the SEBI regarding matters relating to the mutual fund industry. Moreover, it also\nmakes representations to the government for removal of constraints and bottlenecks in the growth of the\nmutual fund industry.\n\nAMFI recently launched appropriate market indices which will enable investors to appreciate and\nmake meaningful comparison of the returns of their investments in mutual funds schemes. While in the\ncase of equity funds, a number of benchmarks like the BSE Sensex and the S&P CNX Nifty are avail-\nable, there was a lack of relevant benchmarks for debt funds. AMFI took the initiative of developing\neight new indices jointly with Crisil.com and ICICI Securities. These indices have been constructed to\nbenchmark the performance of different types of debt schemes such as liquid, income, monthly income,\n\nbalanced fund, and gilt fund schemes. These eight new market indices are the Liquid Fund Index (Liqui\nfex), the Composite Bond Fund Index (Compbex), the Balanced Fund Index (Balance EX), the MIP Index\n(MIPEX), the Short Maturity Gilt Index (Si-Bex), the Medium Maturity Gilt Index (Mi-Bex), the Long\nMaturity Gilt Index (Li-Bex), and the Composite Gilt Index.\n\nIn the case of liquid funds, the index comprises a commercial paper (CP) component with a 60 per cent\nweightage and an inter-bank call money market component with a 40 per cent weightage. The CP compo-\nnent of the index is computed using the weighted average issuance yield on new 91 days CPs issued by top\nrated manufacturing companies. In the case of bond funds, the index comprises a corporate bond com-\nponent with a 55 per cent weightage, gilts component with a 30 per cent weightage call component with\na 10 per cent weightage and commercial paper with a 5 per cent weightage. The index\u2019s 55 per cent bond\ncomponent is split based on a 40 point share of AA rated bonds, and 15 points share of AA rated bonds.\n\nMutual funds have now to disclose also the performance of appropriate market indices alongwith the\nperformance of schemes both in the offer document and in the half-yearly results. Further, the trustees are\nrequired to review the performance of the schemes on periodical basis with reference to market indices.\nThese indices will be useful to distribution companies, agents/brokers, financial consultants, and investors.\n\nAMFI conducts investor awareness programmes regularly. AMFI also conducts intermediaries certi-\nfication examination.\n\nThe Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) has in principle agreed to become a self regulatory\norganization (SRO) with limited regulatory responsibilities relating to sales practices and codes of con-\nduct. AMFI is in the process of becoming a self-regulatory organization (SRO). It has set up a committee\nto set the norms for the AMFI to become an SRO. AMFI should act as an SRO in limited areas such as\nvaluation, disclosures and also in regulating distributors of agents registered with it.\n",

It is the single largest mutual fund\nin India which came into existence with the enactment of the UTI Act in 1964.\n\nThe economic turmoil and the wars in the early 1960s depressed the financial markets, making\nit difficult for both existing and new entrepreneurs to raise fresh capital. The then Finance Minister,\nT.T. Krishnamachari, set up the idea of a Unit Trust which would mobilize savings of the community and\ninvest these savings in the capital market. His ideas took the form of the Unit Trust of India, which com-\nmenced operations from July 1964 \u2018with a view to encouraging savings and investment and participation\nin the income, profits and gains accruing to the corporation from the acquisition, holding, management\nand disposal of securities\u2019. The regulations passed by the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and the parliament\nfrom time to time regulated the functioning of UTI. Different provisions of the UTI Act laid down the\nstructure of management, scope of business, powers and functions of the trust as well as accounting, dis-\nclosures, and regulatory requirements for the trust.\n\nUTI was set up as a trust without ownership capital and with an independent board of trustees. The\nboard of trustees manages the affairs and business of UTI. The board performs its functions, keeping in\nview the interest of the unit holders under various schemes.\n\nUTI has a wide distribution network of 54 branch offices, 266 chief representatives and about 67,000\nagents. These chief representatives supervise agents. UTI manages 72 schemes and has an investor base\nof 20.02 million investors. UTI has set up 183 collection centres to serve investors. It has 57 franchisee\noffices which accept applications and distribute certificates to unit holders.\n\nUTI\u2019s mission statement is to meet the investor's diverse income and liquidity needs by creation of\nappropriate schemes; to offer best possible returns on his investment, and render him prompt and efficient\nservice, beyond normal customer expectations.\n\nUTI was the first mutual fund to launch India Fund, an offshore mutual fund in 1986. The India Fund\nwas launched as a close-ended fund but became a multi-class, open-ended fund in 1994. Thereafter, UTI\nfloated the India Growth Fund in 1988, the Columbus India Fund in 1994, and the India Access Fund in\n1996. The India Growth Fund is listed on the NYSE. The India Access Fund is an Indian Index Fund,\ntracking the NSE 50 index.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "US-64\n\nUTI launched its first scheme, Unit Scheme 1964 (US-64), with the aim of inculcating the habit of saving\namong houscholds. The initial sponsors of the scheme were the RBI, Life Insurance Corporation (LIC),\nState Bank of India (SBI), and other scheduled banks, including a few foreign banks. They contributed to\nits initial capital of @ five crore. In February 1976, RBI's contribution was taken up by the Industrial Devel-\nopment Bank of India (IDBI). These institutions were provided representation on the Board of the Trustees\nof UTI. The US-64 is the flagship scheme of UTI which commands around one-fifth of UTI's total assets.\nAround 20 million investors have invested in the scheme. This scheme ran into trouble in 1998.\n\nThe US-64 was launched as a debt fund as the equity markets were not developed in the sixties. Its\nrepurchase and sale price are administered, i.e., fixed by UTI at the beginning of its financial year (July\nfor UTI). Both the repurchase and sale price used to consistently increase by the end of the year, irrespec-\ntive of the actual returns generated and assets under management. This administered pricing was not a\nproblem in a bullish market but if the markets turned bearish, this high price was paid out of reserves.\nThus, arbitrary fixing of rates and repurchase of the units combined with high dividend payments depleted\nthe reserves and turned them negative to the tune of 21,098 crore. The government came up with a bailout\npackage in the form of Special Unit Scheme (SUS-1999). In 1999, the UTI issued to the government\nspecial units of SUS-99 worth the book value. In turn, the government issued dated securities worth\n23,300 crore to take over the scrips of public sector undertakings (PSUs) from the US-64 scheme. The\ngovernment lost 71,000 crore due to the depreciation in the value of public sector undertakings stocks\nthat were exchanged during the bailout under the SUS-99. This bailout improved the NAV of US-64 but\nhighlighted the inherent problems of UTI such as political interventions in the investment decisions of\nUTI and a total lack of accountability.\n\nUTI is governed by a special act and hence did not come under the purview of the SEBI. There was\nno regulator to ensure the soundness of UTI\u2019s investment decisions. The small investors\u2019 interest in the\nscheme was mainly due to the higher returns it generated and dividends it declared and, above all, backed\nby the government. They were never bothered about the functioning of UTI. UTI never made it a practice\nto disclose any qualitative information to the investors. In fact, UTI continued to float a series of schemes\nwith assured returns and followed liberal dividend policies. These assured return schemes with high divi-\ndend pay-out were no longer practical.\n\nIn 1993-94, the income from the US-64 scheme was %3,538 crore while the dividend outflow was\n23,128 crore. However, the dividend outflow started exceeding its income from the financial year 1994-95\nand continued till 1996-97. In 1994-95, the dividend outflow was %3,973 crore as against the income of\n%3,287 crore. This depleted the reserves of UTI which dropped from %5,842 crore in 1993-94 to 21,778\ncrore in 1996-97 and finally turned negative by %1,098 crore in 1998. With a view to building up reserves,\nUTI reduced its dividend rate from 20 per cent to 13.5 per cent in 1998-99. The 10 per cent dividend that\nUTI declared in 2001 was the least dividend, it had declared in the last two decades. The scheme\u2019s equity\ninvestment had increased to 64 per cent in the late 1990s from a mere 26 per cent in 1990. Both the pri-\nmary and secondary segments of the capital market were in a depressed state, which reduced the chances\nof generating good returns to pay high dividends.\n\nThe government appointed a high-level committee under the chairmanship of Deepak Parekh, Chair-\nman of HDFC, for restructuring UTI. The committee came up with 19 suggestions which included\nincreasing the debt component in investments of the scheme, bringing the scheme under the purview\nof the SEBI, and the most prominent being to convert the US-64 into an NAV-driven scheme within a\nperiod of three years. UTI failed to tap the opportunity of converting this scheme into NAV driven during\n1999-2000 when the capital market was bullish. The failure of UTI to implement the recommendations\nof Deepak Parekh Committee led to an eruption of another crisis in 2001.\n\nUTI freezed the repurchase and sale of US-64 units in July 2001, shattering investors\u2019 trust. On the\nNSE, the fund was trading far below the repurchase price of 813.20 and dipped to a low of 89.60 within\na week. The corporates had anticipated this well in advance and withdrew their funds before the crisis\nstruck. To help out the small investors, the government provided %300 crore support to bridge the gap\nbetween NAV and the administered repurchase price of US-64 units.\n\nThe government set up a committee under the Chairmanship of former RBI Deputy Governor,\nS. S. Tarapore, to investigate the commercial aspects and investment decisions of the fund. The Tarapore\nCommittee called for an inquiry into more than 19 investment decisions of the trust. It suggested creat-\ning three AMCs to handle growth funds, income funds, and Units Scheme-64, and introducing perfor-\nmance-linked management. According to the committee, the UTI Bank could hold 49 per cent of the\ncapital of the three AMCs and this would, over time, enable greater private participation in UTI. It further\nrecommended that only individual investors should be allowed to invest in US-64. Corporations and\ninstitutions should not be allowed to invest in US-64.\n\nThe Malegam Committee, which was formed by the board of trustees of UTI at the instance of the\ngovernment, recommended a three-tier structure in line with the SEBI regulations comprising a sponsor,\na trustee company, and an AMC, It suggested that the government should limit its stake through IDBI,\nSBI, and other government-backed financial institutions to 40 per cent and the rest 60 per cent could\nbe offered to a sponsor or strategic partner. The trustee company should be a fully-owned subsidiary of\nsponsor company and shareholding of sponsor company in the AMC should be restricted to 40 per cent\nwith the balance to be offered to public. The committee further recommended that the UTI Act should\nbe repealed and replaced by a new enactment. The government must be completely distanced from UTI.\n\nUS-64 should be NAV based before restructuring of UTI is attempted. Provisions should be made for\ncontingent liabilities, if any, arising out of the gap between the available assets of US-64 and guaranteed\nprice to individual unit-holders owning upto 3,000 units.\n\nIn view of these recommendations, UTI took a decision to skip dividend for the first time in 2001-02\n(Table 15.2) and to incorporate professionals on its board. The US-64 scheme moved to the NAV basis on\nJanuary 1st, 2002. The US-64 NAV was hovering around %6 a unit which eroded the investors\u2019 confidence\nin the scheme.\n\nIn the year 2002, problems of liquidity and redemption pressures on the schemes surfaced again.\nEarlier it was US-64, the new problems related to 17 assured monthly income plans (MIPs) of UTI\nwhich had negative reserves. For instance, MIP 97 III had negative reserves of 8260.1 crore, MIP 97IV\nhad negative reserves of 2296.8 crore, MIP 97 V had negative reserves of 2170 crore, while MIP 98 had\nnegative reserves of 7296.8 crore. UTI met the redemption of the first MIP 97, which matured in June\nby dipping into its reserves. MIP 97 alone had a shortfall of %402 crore due to the large gap between\nits assured redemption price of 710 and the March 31\", 2002, NAV of %6.39. The development reserve\nfund which guarantees its assured return schemes was pegged at about &1,800 crore and the gap in its\nassured return schemes was in excess of %3,000 crore. Seeing the financial strain of UTI, the govern-\nment provided it a partial guarantee for %1,000 crore. On the basis of this guarantee, UTI borrowed\n%1,500 crore from the State Bank of India (SBI) to meet its payment obligation on two monthly income\nplans.\n\nThe finance minister, Jaswant Singh, announced another bailout package for UTI. This package\namounted to 714,561 crore and led to UTI bifurcating into UTI-I and UTI-II. On February 1*, 2003, the\nUnit Trust of India, the largest mutual fund was bifurcated into two\u2014Specified Undertaking of the UTI\n(UTI-I) and UTI Mutual Fund (UTI-II). UTI-I took over all the assured return schemes, including US-64,\nwhile all the other schemes were taken up by UTI MF. The UTI Mutual Fund came under the full regulatory\nambit of the SEBI. The government handed over one part, comprising the 43 net asset value based schemes\n(UTI-II) to a company floated by LIC, SBI, Punjab National Bank, and the Bank of Baroda. UTI-II started\noperations from February 1\", 2003. UTI-II has become a SEBI-compliant mutual fund with a three-tier\nstructure, comprising a board of trustees, sponsors, and an asset management company with a paid-up\ncapital of 710 crore. The four players have invested 22.5 crore each. The government will continue to run\nthe %31,000 crore worth UTI-I, comprising the flagship scheme US-64 and other assured return schemes.\nThe government has appointed one administrator and four advisors for the ailing UTI-I.\n\nThe government repealed the UTI Act through an ordinance. The government issued 10-year, tax-\nfree bonds to banks and financial institutions to raise 710,000 crore to meet the shortfall in the NAV and\ndeclared the repurchase price of US-64. Those bonds carried a coupon rate of 7 to 7.5 per annum and\ncould be redeemed in the last three years before maturity. Dividend reinvestment option under the income\nplan of US-64 was discontinued. Investors had the option either to encash their holdings at the declared,\npredetermined price or to convert the existing units with assured repurchase price into NAV-based prices\nor to invest in the tax-free bonds. The government assured a repurchase price of {12 per unit in respect of\nholding upto 5,000 units and 10 per unit in respect of holding above 5,000 units.

The Unit Trust of India announced a fresh package on 28th January 2003, for US-64 investors.\nThis package gave an option to US-64 unit-holders to convert their units to 5-year, tax-free tradeable\nbonds that would effectively offer higher returns than other bonds of a similar tenure. Investors eligible\nto convert units to tax-free, tradeable bonds included those holding upto 5,000 units, these holding above\n5,000 units (both classes have different assured returns from the government), and also those who bought\nthe units from the secondary market. Units purchased between November 11, 2002 and January 22, 2003,\ncontinued to be traded and repurchased at the net asset value based price and were not offered these bonds.\nThis package had not prompted investors to stay back even after the centre-sponsored guaranteed returns\npackage expires on May 31, 2003.\n\nUTI met the shortfall of its assured return schemes by taking loans from banks, offering the Develop-\nment Reserve Fund as collateral and on the basis of the guarantee by the Government of India.

                        "extracted-text": "GROWTH AND PERFORMANCE OF MUTUAL\nFUNDS IN INDIA\n\nThe Indian mutual fund industry has grown tremendously in the last decade. There are 41 mutual funds\nwith average assets under management of around 219 lakh crore as on June 30, 2017. Assets under man-\nagement (AUM) crossed %1,00,000 crore during the year 1999-2000 recording a growth rate of 65 per\ncent. Besides, vast majority of equity schemes out-performed the market. However, in the subsequent\nyear, i.e., 2000-01, AUM sharply declined by about 20 per cent to 290,587 crore due to extreme volatility\nin the market and depressed equity market conditions. The mutual fund industry witnessed such a sharp\ndecline for the first time in the last two decades. There was a turnaround in the year 2001-02. The AUM\ngrew by 1 per cent to %1,00,594 crore. During the year 2001-02 while there was an increase in AUM by\naround 11 per cent, UTI lost more than 11 per cent in AUM. It is evident that UTI is losing out to other\nprivate sector players. The AUM of private sector mutual funds rose by around 60 per cent during the year\n2001-02. Assets under management grew by 22 per cent in 2003-04 and amounted to %1,49,554 crore\nin 2004-05.\n\nThe year 2003 was a high growth consolidation phase for mutual funds. The process was initiated by\nFranklin Templeton and HDFC mutual, which acquired Pioneer ITI and Zurich Mutual respectively.\n\nThe mutual fund industry was involved in a series of scams in the year 2003-04. These included run-\nning certain schemes such as portfolio management with a single investor, dividend stripping, declaring\ndividends in growth schemes, trading beyond regular hours at artificial NAVs to please corporate clients\nand transferring provident fund money into equities.\n\nUTI MF completed one full year of existence on February 2004. In the year 2003-04, UTI Mutual\nFund garnered over 23,000 crore in terms of assets. With 780,000 crore worth of AUM, it is now the fourth\nlargest fund house in the country once again, despite the restructuring. UTI Mutual Fund was acquired by\none of its sponsors, the State Bank of India.\n\nThe mutual fund industry is slowly catching the fancy of retail investors in India and the evidence is\nthe growing IPO collections, rising equity markets and an increasing perception of mutual funds as a safe\nand convenient route to investing in the capital markets. Franklin India Flexi Cap fund collected a record\n21,950 crore in its IPO that closed on February 9, 2005. This is the largest collection ever by an open-\nended fund. JM Mutual Fund launched an equity and derivative fund to generate market neutral returns\nwith the help of derivatives. This is the first time that such a fund is being launched in India. It is based on\nthe concept of buying in the equity cash market and selling in the equity futures market and earning the\ncost of carry. The fact that a new and complicated concept has received an overwhelming response from\ninvestors shows the coming of age of the MF industry.\n\nForeign banks like HSBC, ABN Amro, and Deutsche have started their AMCs in India. Several\nglobal fund houses such as Already, and Aegon have shown interest in entering the Indian MF indus-\ntry. This industry has been seeing consolidation as a number of global funds like Zurich, Alliance\nCapital, and Sun F&C have exited the country. Some funds have sold out because they could not\n\n\ncompete in a fiercely competitive industry. Pioneer ITI, earlier Kothari Pioneer Mutual Fund, was\nsold out to Templeton India when it was arguably India\u2019s best fund house in terms of both performance\nand assets management. Zurich India when it was sold was amongst the best performing funds. It\nwas sold by its Swiss parent as a part of its global restructuring strategy. Birla Sunlife Mutual Fund\nacquired Alliance Capital. Zurich\u2019s mutual fund business was acquired by HDFC mutual fund, UTI\nMutual Fund bought IL & FS Mutual Fund and Principal India Mutual Fund took-over PNB\u2019s mutual\nfund and Sun F&C\u2019s operations.\n\nIn the year 2007-08, the largest number of new schemes-612 in all, were launched which was a\nrecord. The amount mobilized by the new schemes at over 1 ,60,733 crore was also a new record. The\ngross amount garnered was as high as %44.64 lakh crore\u2014up by 130 per cent over the previous year.\nBut the net accretion was only %1,53,801 crore. The net inflows and the AUM increased by 63 per\ncent and 55 per cent, respectively. The industry witnessed for the first time since 2000, a net outflow\nof funds for the year 2008-09 on account of the global financial turmoil. However, there was a sharp\nincrease in the assets under management during 2012-13 with an improvement in the global financial\nmarkets scenario.\n\nInvestors preferred mutual funds as mutual funds offer tax benefits in the form of exemption on tax on\nboth dividends and long-term capital gains. The assets under management rose sharply to %19 lakh crore\nin June, 2017 from %80,000 crore in March 2003. This significant rise was on account of the buoyant\nstock markets which enabled mutual funds to distribute higher dividends and raise NAVs. HDFC Asset\nManagement Company Ltd. is the leader in the mutual fund industry going by the assets under its man-\nagement as on June 30, 2017.\n\nMutual funds offered improved quality of service with AMFI making it mandatory for MF agents to\nundergo and pass its training programme for enabling them to explain the schemes to the customers prop-\nerly. They introduced innovative and customer friendly products\u2014Birla Mutual\u2019s cheque writing facility\nfor the customer upto 75 per cent of the clear balance or %2 lakh, whichever is lower and IL&FS offer of\nimproved liquidity by offering redemption facility on a T+0 (on the same trading day of application) basis\nwhile some other funds offered T+1 facility (on the next trading day of application).\n\nAs on March 31, 2017 while individuals subscribed 96.9 per cent of the total folios, their share in the\ntotal net assets was 45.7 per cent. On the other hand, corporates had a miniscule share of 1.2 per cent in\nthe total number of folios, but their share in the total assets was a sizeable 48.6 per cent.\n\nHowever, the private sector mutual funds manage 85 per cent of the net assets whereas public sector\nmutual funds manage only 15 per cent of the total net assets.\n\nThe mutual fund industry has been remarkably resilient over the last decade inspite of varying eco-\nnomic conditions, capital market scams, and increasing competition. A steep fall in stock prices on\naccount of the global economic crisis and investor panic exerted redemption pressure on mutual funds\nduring 2008-09. The net resources mobilized by private sector mutual funds and UTI turned negative. The\nstock market revival and availability of easy liquidity enabled mutual funds to garner larger resources.\nAs on March 31, 2017, there were 2,281 mutual fund schemes of which 1,675 were income/debt oriented\nschemes, 484 were growth/equity oriented schemes, and 30 were balanced schemes. In addition, there\nwere 63 ETFs, of which 12 were gold ETFs and 51 were non-gold ETFs. There were also 29 schemes\noperating as fund of funds which invested in overseas securities. In terms of the investment objectives,\nas on March 31, 2017, there were 829 open-ended schemes, 1,388 close-ended schemes and 64 interval\nschemes, but this number is a miniscule fraction of the 13,000 odd schemes offered by the mutual funds\nin the US. Moreover, in the US, there is more money in mutual funds than in bank deposits. In the US,\nindividuals have 47 per cent of their household financial assets in mutual funds. The mutual fund in Bra-\nzil is over $600 bn and China over $300bn. AUM as a percentage of GDP in the US is 79 per cent, 39\nper cent in Brazil, while in India only 8 per cent. Mutual funds in India have tapped only 2 per cent of\nthe urban population and rural penetration is negligible. In urban areas, the mutual fund activity is more\nconcentrated in the eight metros.\n\nDebt funds are emerging as the most preferred investment option. Debt funds can have edge over\nbanks as banks cannot offer attractive rates on deposits due to statutory reserves and priority sector\nlending. Debt funds are characterized as low-risk and high liquidity investments. Mutual funds world-\nwide have mobilized savings more through income funds than equity funds. This is so because mutual\nfunds are able to offer diverse products based on the investors\u2019 risk return appetite. For example, there\nare liquid funds, government securities funds, and AAA rated bond funds. The government securities\nfunds have no credit risk but interest rate risk. The liquid funds which are invested in the overnight call\nmarket carry a very low risk element compared to bond funds with both credit and interest rate risk. It\n\n\nis expected that returns from debt funds will increase in the future in view of the RBI's medium-term\nobjective of reducing the cash reserve ratio (CRR) to 3 per cent.\n\nIn terms of AUM, the income/debt oriented schemes had the largest share of 61.2 per cent,\nfollowed by growth/equity oriented schemes with a share of 31.0 per cent. Debt schemes under\nincome/debt oriented schemes registered inflows of %1,20,633 crore, followed by liquid/money\nmarket schemes at 795,826 crore and Non-ELSS schemes under growth/equity oriented schemes\nat 760,270 crore.\n\nThe business of mutual funds is profitable in India, with operating profits at 32 basis points (bps) as a\npercentage of average AUM. In the US market it is 18 bps and in UK it is 12bps. In developed markets,\nthere are too many products for retail investors, fierce competition and thus, reduced fees. Moreover,\nthe developed markets being highly efficient, the fund managers cannot deliver returns above market\nreturns. Hence, they adopt a passive management strategy by offering low cost exchange traded funds.\nThe Indian fund managers are active fund managers whereby each mutual fund manager builds up his\nown portfolio and have been in a position to beat the index, thereby delivering returns in excess of\nmarket returns. This industry has grown 47 per cent annually since 2003. As far as investments in the\nIndian securities market are concerned, with record breaking addition of more than 7.7 million folios,\nthe mutual fund sector in India continued to grow significantly during 2016-17 with net fund mobiliza-\ntion to the tune of 3.43 trillion during the year and AUM touching a record level of 217.55 trillion as on\nMarch 31, 2017. Net investments by FPIs were 7484 billion (US$ 7.18 billion) during the same period\nwith net investments of 7557 billion (US$8.75 billion) in equities and net sales of 773 billion (US$1.15\nbillion) in bonds. As of March 31, 2017, the total AUM of the sector stood at 217,54,619 crore. The\nAUM of the industry saw a remarkable year-on-year growth of 42.3 per cent in the year ending March,\n2017. However, AUM to GDP (%151.83 lakh crore at current prices) ratio of 11.6 per cent indicates a\nlarge untapped market potential and very low penetration vis-a-vis global and peer benchmarks. Thus the\nIndian mutual fund industry has a huge potential. There is an immense potential for growth and the main\ndrivers of this growth will be the retail segment, expected to grow at 36-42 per cent annually on account\nof rising incomes and increasing demand for wealth management services, and innovative technological\ninitiatives.\n\nMutual funds are expanding to various parts of the country with a large number of collection centres\nand franchise offices.\n",

Mutual fund companies have to create and market\ninnovative products and frame distinct marketing strategies. Product innovation will be one of the key\ndeterminants to success. The mutual fund industry has to bring many innovative concepts such as high\nyield bond funds, principal protected funds, long short funds, arbitrate funds, dynamic funds, and pre-\ncious metal funds. The penetration of mutual funds can be increased through investor education, pro-\nviding investor-oriented value added services, and innovative distribution channels. Mutual funds have\nfailed during the bearish market conditions. To sell successfully during the bear market, there is a need to\neducate investors about risk-adjusted return and total portfolio return to enable them to take an informed\ndecision. Mutual funds need to develop a wide distribution network to increase its reach and tap invest-\nments from all corners and segments. Increased use of internet and development of alternative channels\nsuch as financial advisors can play a vital role in increasing the penetration of mutual funds. Mutual funds\nin order to increase their reach need to pump larger capital. They need to become more transparent and\ninvestor friendly.\n\nThe retail participation in mutual funds is still low on account of incorrect positioning of MF\nproducts, industry\u2019s focus on wholesale market, investor's preference for guaranteed return products\nand industry\u2019s inability to make in roads into smaller towns. There is a need to improve retail par-\nticipation. Selling mutual funds requires competence in identifying and matching investors\u2019 needs.\nMoreover, they need to educate investors that mutual funds help to build capital, not to be become\nrich overnight. Mutual funds are dominant shareholders in portfolio companies. They can influ-\nence corporate governance by questioning the actions of company management, exercising voting\nrights, and using the proxy route to influence decisions by voting against the management. In India,\nmutual funds play a passive role in their portfolio companies and seldom exercise their voting rights.\nMutual funds in India need to play a bigger role in corporate governance of public listed companies\nto restore faith and protect the interests of investors. Mutual funds have come a long way, but a lot\nmore can be done.\n\n\nCASE STUDY 1\n\nAjit is 30, newly married and a successful actor in the Indian film industry.\nRight from his struggling days, Ajit always saved a part of his income\nand invested in safe instruments like fixed deposits. However, during the\ninternet boom in the late 90's and early 2000, he successfully invested in\nequities and mutual funds. Ajit thought that he was always well-diversified\nbut when the internet stock bubble burst in 2002, Ajit lost a majority of\nhis stock portfolio. A major mistake he made was that even though he was\ndiversified, he invested only in tech-stocks. Ajit has always had a penchant\nfor technology from his young age and thus he usually ended up buying\ntech stocks and funds. Currently, Ajit suffers from the snake-bite effect and\nthus he is not willing to participate in the equity market at all. Ajit, now\nmisses the high returns that his portfolio had earned during the internet\nboom days. He has come to you to seek your suggestions to help his port-\nfolio generate higher returns.\n\nQI. What do you think is Ajit\u2019s ability and willingness to take risk?\n\nQ2. Will you recommend a stock only portfolio to Ajit or a mutual\nfunds only portfolio for Ajit?\n\nQ3. What kind of mutual funds will you recommend to Ajit?\n\nQ4. Explain to Ajit how his new mutual fund portfolio achieves\ndiversification. Why is this diversification important?\n\nQS. Recommend a portfolio mix for Ajit.

                        "extracted-text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nLife is full of risks. Being a social animal and risk averse, man always tries to reduce risk.\nAn age-old method of sharing of risk through economic cooperation led to the development\nof the concept of \u2018insurance\u2019.\n\nInsurance may be described as a social device to reduce or eliminate risk of loss to life\nand property. Insurance is a collective bearing of risk. Insurance spreads the risks and losses\nof few people among a large number of people as people prefer small fixed liability instead\nof big uncertain and changing liability. Insurance is a scheme of economic cooperation\nby which members of the community share the unavoidable risks. The risks which can be\ninsured against include fire, the perils of sea, death, accidents, and burglary. The members\nof the community subscribe to a common pool or fund which is collected by the insurer to\nindemnify the losses arising out of risks. Insurance cannot prevent the occurrence of risk\nbut it provides for the losses of risk. It is a scheme which covers large risks by paying small\namount of capital. Insurance is also a means of savings and investment.\n\nInsurance involves four aspects\n\n+ An asset\n\n+ The risk insured against\n\n+ The principle of pooling\n\n+ The contract\nWhen person having similar assets exposed to similar risks contribute into a common pool\nof funds, it is known as pooling.\n\nInsurance and mutual funds are fundamentally different in their objectives. The objective\nof insurance is to cover the eventuality of death and therefore, is more long-term in its out-\nlook while, mutual funds are purely investment gain vehicles.\n\nInsurance can be defined as a legal contract between two parties whereby one party called\nthe insurer undertakes to pay a fixed amount of money on the happening of a particular event,\nwhich may be certain or uncertain. The other party called the insured pays in exchange a fixed\nsum known as premium. The insurer and the insured are also known as assurer, or underwriter,\nand assured, respectively. The document which embodies the contract is called the policy.\n\nAn insurance policy is a special type of contract. It is synallagmatic and aleatory in char-\nacter. A synallagmatic contract is one by which each of the contracting parties binds himself\nto the other. It is aleatory because the insurer\u2019s obligation to pay a loss (claims) is distant\nand often uncertain, while the insured must pay a fixed premium during the policy period.\nThus while the sacrifice (premium) is certain and immediate, the benefits (claims) are distant\nand contingent for the insured. This makes it a unique financial product, requiring a broader\nunderstanding of pure and speculative risks to which an individual or enterprise is exposed,\nin order to take an informed buying decision.\n\nThe insurance companies are distinct financial institutions (intermediaries) in the finan-\ncial system.\n\n1. Insurers collect insurance premiums by issuing insurance policies which are debt instru-\nments (claims) and invest these premiums in financial assets and markets to generate cash\nflows to pay future claims. Thus, insurers are liability-driven financial intermediaries.\n\n2. Unlike other intermediaries, insurers have to hold risk capital or solvency capital to\nensure their obligations to the insured. Insurers demonstrate their financial strength\n\nto the insured by holding risk capital which provides a cushion against unexpected losses. Another\nunique feature of the industry is the distinct principles such as uberrimae fidei, indemnity, subro-\ngation, causa proxima and insurable interest of which underwriters (insurers) are more aware of\nthan the insured.\n\n. Also, insurance pricing differs from the pricing of other products. In case of other products, the\nproducer knows the costs of production and the profit he wants to earn. Insurance is a different\nactivity from most other kinds of business activities. Insurers are in the business of risk. It is very\ndifficult to price risk. In case of insurance, the actual cost of risk coverage can be known only at\nthe expiry of the contract or when the event occurs whereas the premium rate is determined at the\nbeginning of the contract. The determination of premium rate involves a lot of statistics, use of\nprobability theories and study of demographic trends and market trends.\n\n. Marketing of insurance products is a challenging task. Insurance is sold, never bought. The seller\n(agent) should possess expert knowledge of the insurance products, have the skill in making peo-\nple listen carefully and strive to establish a long-term relationship with the clients to get repeat\nbusiness. Only those who are open to new ideas, able to plan their activity well and willing to face\nchallenges can succeed in marketing insurance products.\n",

Financial Services play a supportive role in the basic activity of production. Insurance\nfrees industries from the worries of unforeseen losses and uncertainties. Insurance helps the process of\nthe country\u2019s growth in various ways:\n\n1. Insurance covers many economic risks. It protects entrepreneurs against the risk of damage to or\nloss of the goods and other assets, which they employ in manufacturing, marketing, transport, and\nother related activities. This protection offers a kind of stability to business.\n\n2. With the cover of insurance on their assets, businessmen and industrialists are able to take bold\ndecisions in enlarging their field of activity, and take financial risks which they cannot otherwise\ntake. Hence, insurance plays a promotional role in nation-building and also increasing the number\nof jobs for the people.\n\n3. Again, there is life insurance, which plays the most useful role in the lives of individuals. Life\ninsurance offers economic safety at reasonable cost to millions of families in the country. In a\nway, this helps the government also as it lightens the government's burden of providing social\nwelfare to affected families.\n\n4. Insurance companies collect premium from policyholders and invest this money in government\nbonds, corporate securities and other approved channels of investment. In this way, insurance\ncompanies are helpful in providing capital for new ventures or expansion of old units. Moreover,\nthese funds are also used for financing the infrastructure projects with long gestation period. Also,\nthis lending of funds for infrastructure and other development favourably influences the decision-\nmaking process in the government.\n\nThus insurance aids in the growth of modern economy. By promoting safety against personal losses\nnot only improves the individual\u2019s quality of life but also provides smoothness in the working of the affairs\nof business and industry.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Principles of Insurance\n\nAn insurance contract is based on some basic principles of insurance.\n\n+ Principle of \u2018uberrima fides\u2019 or principle of utmost good faith.\n\n* Principle of indemnity.\n\n+ Doctrine of subrogation.\n\n+ Principle of causa proxima.\n\n+ Principle of insurable interest.\n\n* Principle of utmost good faith: It means \u2018maximum truth\u2019. All material information regarding the\nsubject matter of insurance should be disclosed by both the parties\u2014the insurer and the insured.\nThis duty of full disclosure rests more heavily on the insured than the insurer. The insurer has a\nright to avoid the contract if the insured fails to make the full disclosure. In case of misrepresenta-\ntion\u2014innocent or fraudulent, the contract becomes voidable if the representation is substantially\nfalse and it is concerned with facts which are material to the risk. The contract becomes voidable on\nthe grounds of non-disclosure when a fact is known to one party and it is not known to the other and\nmoreover, is such that may influence the underwriter\u2019s decision if disclosed.\n\nPrinciple of indemnity: This means that if the insured suffers a loss against which the policy has\nbeen made, he shall be fully indemnified only to the extent of loss. In other words, the insured is not\nentitled to make a profit on his loss. For instance, marine insurance policy is a contract of indemnity\nwhich protects against physical and other losses to movable property and associated interests, as\nwell as against liabilities arising during the course of a sea voyage.\n\nDoctrine of subrogation: This means the insurer has the right to stand in the place of the insured\nafter settlement of claims in so far as the insured\u2019s right of recovery from an alternative source is\ninvolved. The right may be exercised by the insurer before the settlement of the claim. In other\nwords, the insurer is entitled to recover from a negligent third party any loss payments made to the\ninsured. The purposes of subrogation are to hold the negligent person responsible for the loss and\nprevent the insured from collecting twice for the same loss. Subrogation prevents the insured from\ncollecting twice for the loss\u2014once from the insurance company and then again from the third party.\nSubrogation arises only in case of contracts of indemnity\n\nPrinciple of causa proxima: The cause of loss must be direct and an insured one in order to claim\nfor compensation.\n\nPrinciple of insurable interest: The assured must have insurable interest in the life or property\ninsured. Insurable interest is that interest which considerably alters the position of the assured in the\nevent of loss taking place and if the event does not take place, he remains in the same old position. One\nwho has to lose as a result of loss may be said to have insurable interest in the life or property insured.\nIf this principle is absent, the insurance contract degenerates into a wagering contract. It is taken as\ngiven that an individual has insurable interest in his/her own life or property. Cases where no proof of\ninsurable interest is required are that of a husband's interest in his wife's life and wife's interest in her\nhusband\u2019 life. In cases of business and family relationships, proof of insurable interest is required.\n\n",

                        "extracted-text": "ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF INSURANCE\n\nThe concept of insurance is believed to have emerged almost 4,500 years ago in the ancient land of Baby-\nlonia where traders used to bear risk of the caravan by giving loans, which were later repaid with interest\nwhen the goods arrived safely. In order to protect against the risk of loss of goods in transit, piracy and\nnatural calamities like storms and so on, medieval guilds (trade associations) formed a common pool of\nfunds, which was used as support in times of sickness and death and sometimes even offered as ransom\nfor members held captive by pirates. The first insurance contract was entered into by European maritime\nnations in 1347 to accept marine insurance as a practice.\n\nThe concept of insurance as we know today took shape in 1688 at a place called Lloyd's Coffee House\nin London where risk bearers used to meet to transact business. This coffee house became so popular that\nLloyd\u2019s became the one of the first modern insurance companies by the end of the eighteenth century.\n\nMarine insurance companies came into existence by the end of the eighteenth century. These com-\npanies were empowered to write fire and life insurance as well as marine. The Great Fire of London in\n1966 caused huge loss of property and life. With a view to providing fire insurance facilities, Dr Nicholas\nBarbon set up in 1967 the first fire insurance company known as the Fire Office.\n\nThe oldest life insurance company in existence today is the Society for the Equitable Assurance of\nLives and Survivorship, known as \u2018Old Equitable\u2019. It was established in England in 1756.\n\nThe \u2018law of large numbers\u2019 discovered by Jakob Bernoulls around 1700 forms the basis of modern insur-\nance. Insurers consider their clients as large groups to predict future risk and loss. The larger the group, the\ncloser the average loss will approach a definite value. This law helps the insurer to predict total annual loss\nfor the group which is then distributed among all the insured and recovered in the form of premium.\n\nThe mortality tables were constructed in the seventeenth century. The first mortality table was con-\nstructed by an astronomer Edmund Haley in 1693. This table provided a link between the life insurance\npremium and average lifespans based on statistical laws of mortality and compound interest. In 1756,\nJoseph Dodson reworked the table, linking insurance premium rate to age.\n\nThe infamous New York Fire and the great Chicago Fire in 1835 and 1871, respectively, created an\nawareness and need for insurance. The concept of reinsurance emerged to deal specifically for such situ-\nations. Industrialization and urbanization popularized the concept of insurance and growth in insurance\nled to the development of new insurance products.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "History of Insurance in India\n\nThe early history of insurance in India can be traced back to the Vedas. The Sanskrit term \u2018Yogakshema\u2019\n(meaning well being), the name of Life Insurance Corporation of India\u2019s corporate headquarters, is found\nin the Rig Veda. Some form of \u2018community insurance\u2019 was practised by the Aryans around 1000 BC. The\njoint family system prevalent in India was an important form of social cooperation.\n\nLife insurance in its modern form came to India from England in 1818. The Oriental Life Insurance\n\u2018Company was the first insurance company to be set up in India to help the widows of the European com-\nmunity. The insurance companies, which came into existence between 1818 and 1869, treated Indian lives\nas subnormal and charged an extra premium of 15 to 20 per cent. The first Indian insurance company,\nthe Bombay Mutual Life Assurance Society, came into existence in 1870 to cover Indian lives at normal\nrates. Moreover, in 1870, the British Government enacted for the first time the Insurance Act, 1870. Other\ncompanies, such as the Oriental Government Security Life Assurance Company, the Bharat Insurance\n\u2018Company, and the Empire of India Life Insurance Company Limited, were set up between 1870 and 1900.\n\nThe Swadeshi movement of 1905-07, the non-cooperation movement of 1919, and Civil Disobedi-\nence Movement of 1929 led to an increase in number of insurance companies. In 1912, the first legisla-\ntion regulating insurance, the Life Insurance Companies Act, 1912, was promulgated. The growth of life\ninsurance was witnessed during the first two decades of the twentieth century not only in terms of number\nof companies but also in terms of number of policies and sum assured. The Indian Insurance Year Book\nwas published for the first time in 1914.\n\nThe Insurance Act, 1938, the first comprehensive legislation governing both life and non-life branches\nof insurance was enacted to provide strict state control over the insurance business. This amended insur-\nance act looked into investments, expenditure, and management of these companies. An office of the\nController of Insurance came into existence. The Controller of Insurance had wide ranging powers, which\nincluded directing, cautioning, advising, prohibiting, inspecting, investigating, searching, seizing, pros-\necuting, penalizing, authorizing, registering, amalgamating, and liquidating insurance companies.\n\nBy the mid-1950s, there were 154 Indian insurers, 16 foreign insurers, and 75 provident societies\ncarrying on life insurance business in India. Insurance business flourished and so did scams, irregulari-\nties, and dubious investment practices by scores of companies. As a result, the government decided to\nnationalize the life assurance business in India. The Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) was set\nup in 1956 to take over 245 life companies. The nationalization of life insurance was followed by general\ninsurance in 1972. The General Insurance Corporation of India and its subsidiaries were set up in 1973.\nMost of the powers of the Controller of Insurance were taken away and vested in state-owned LIC and\nGIC for operational convenience. These nationalized companies enjoyed monopoly for decades. They\ndid a commendable job in extending the distribution network and successfully handled a large volume of\nbusiness. But with only 20 per cent of the population insured there was a vast potential untapped. Besides,\nas a sequel to the reform process and to tap the insurance sector as a source of longterm funds, the govern-\nment decided to introduce reforms in the insurance sector.\n\nThe government set up, in 1993, a committee under the chairmanship of R. N. Malhotra, the former insur-\nance secretary and the RBI governor to evaluate the Indian insurance industry and recommend its future\ndirection. This committee submitted its report in 1994 and suggested the re-opening up of the insurance\nsector to private players. This sector was finally thrown open to the private sector in 2000. The Insurance\nRegulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) was set up in 2000 as an autonomous insurance regulator.\nThe government has entrusted the IRDA with the responsibility for carrying out the reforms in this sector.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "OPENING OF THE INSURANCE SECTOR\n\nThe insurance industry till August 2000 had only two nationalized players: Life Insurance Corpora-\ntion (LIC) and General Insurance Corporation (GIC) and its four subsidiaries. These two players had a\nmonopolistic control over the market. These nationalized insurance companies did a commendable job\nin terms of high growth in volume of business and reach. However, they were not consumer-oriented,\nunwilling to adopt modern practices and technology to upgrade technical skills, and inefficient in opera-\ntions, The growth in volume was mainly driven by income tax considerations and hence a major portion\nof the vast rural area was untapped.\n\nMoreover, with a population of more than one billion and savings rate of around 24 per cent, India\nhas a vast market which is untapped. The foreign insurance companies\u2019 external influence and pressure to\nopen up the Indian insurance sector was high.\n\nIn 1993, the committee under the chairmanship of R. N. Malhotra, set up to evaluate the Indian Insur-\nance industry and recommend its future direction, submitted its report in 1994 and its major recommen-\ndations revolved around the structure and regulation of insurance industry. The main recommendations\nwere as follows:\n\n+ The government should bring down its stake in the insurance companies to 50 per cent.\n+ Private companies with a minimum paid-up capital of 2100 crore should be allowed to enter the\n\nindustry.\n\nNo single company should be allowed to transact business in both the life and general insurance\nbusiness. The number of entrants should be controlled.\n\nForeign companies may be allowed to enter the industry in collaboration with domestic companies.\nThe committee did not favour foreign companies operating in India through branches.\n\nPostal Life Insurance should be allowed to operate in the rural markets.\n\nThe mandatory investments of LIC Life Fund in government securities need to be reduced from\n15 per cent to 50 per cent.\n\nThe GIC and its subsidiaries should not hold more than 5 per cent in any company.\n\nThe promoters\u2019 holding in a private insurance company should not exceed 40 per cent of the total.\nHowever, if the promoters wish to start with a higher holding, they should be permitted to do so pro-\nvided their holding is brought down to 40 per cent within a specified period of time through public\noffering. No person other than the promoters should be allowed to hold more than one per cent of\nthe equity. Promoters should, at no time, hold less than 26 per cent of the paid-up capital.\nRegulatory and prudential norms as well as conditions for ensuring level-playing field among insur-\ners should be finalized early so that intending entrants into the insurance business would be aware\nof the stipulations they would have to comply with. These conditions should aim to ensure that life\ninsurers do not neglect the small man or the rural business and that the general insurers have bal-\nanced portfolios.\n\nThough nationalized insurance companies are in a position to face competition, it is essential that\nthey quickly upgrade their technology, reorganize themselves on more efficient lines, and are\nenabled to operate as board-run enterprises.\n\nAs an interim measure, the office of Controller of Insurance should be restored its full functions\nunder the Insurance Act and it should be set up as a separate office as a matter of high priority.\nLegislation and government notifications through which LIC and GIC were exempted from several\nprovisions of the Insurance Act should be withdrawn.\n\nA strong and effective insurance regulatory authority in the form of a statutory autonomous board\non the lines of the SEBI should be set up.\n\nThe state-level cooperatives should be allowed to set up cooperative societies for transacting life\ninsurance business in the state. There will not be more than one society for each state which will be\nsubject to the regulations of the Insurance Regulatory Authority.\n\nGIC should cease to be the holding company for its subsidiaries and the exclusive function of GIC\nshould remain that of reinsurer.\n\nWhen GIC ceases to be holding company of the four subsidiary companies, then the government\nshould acquire GIC\u2019s stake, which is %40 crore in every company. This share, then should be raised\nto 100 crore for every company, the government holding 50 per cent and the rest being held by the\npublic at large.\n\nRecognising the global trend of competitive, market-driven insurance industry and the recommenda-\ntions of the Malhotra Committee, the insurance industry was opened up in August 2000. There are at pre-\nsent 24 life insurance and 31 general insurance companies operating in India with more players expected\nto come in. The IRDA, constituted in April 2000 under the IRDA Act, 1999, is vested with the power to\nregulate and develop the insurance and reinsurance business (Figure 16.1).\n\nMost of the foreign insurers have preferred to form joint ventures with Indian companies. Banks,\nfinancial institutions, and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) are permitted to enter the insurance\nsector. The RBI has issued guidelines regulating the degree of participation of banks, financial institu-\ntions and non-banking finance companies in the insurance business depending on balance sheet strength.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India has given NBFCs blanket permission to take up insurance agency business\non a fee basis and without risk participation, without the approval of the central bank. However, the risks\ninvolved in insurance agency cannot be transferred to the business of the NBFC and they need to obtain\npermission from the IRDA.\n\nThe Insurance (Amendment) Act, 2002, has allowed cooperative societies to carry on insurance business\nwith a view to enhancing coverage in rural areas. This act deals in four broad areas, namely, broker regula-\ntion, corporate agent regulations, Section 64VB that deals in payments to be made through credit card and\nthe Internet, and Section 49 that deals with the distribution of acturial surpluses between the shareholder and\nthe policyholder. Corporates acting as corporate agents will have to surrender their licence to be brokers,\nas there is a conflict of interest between two parties. Banks will co ntinue to be corporate agents and non-\nbrokers. The designated person, acting on behalf of the corporate agent (like a bank) after leaving their jobs\ncan be an agent without having to take further exams mandated by the regulator. The amended insurance act\nwould form the future legal base for making the regulation on intermediaries.\n\nInsurance\nIntermediaries\n\nReinsurance\nBrokers\n\nInsurance Premium\n\nInsured Direct Cossion | neinsurer Retrocession .| Retrocessionaire\n(Policy Holden + ana Lnsurance_| Transters Part Retrocedes a Share to _| (Other Reinsurers)\nof the Assumed More Retrocessionait\nFully Liable to Insured Risk pee ee roeesssonenes\n\u2019 | |\nLife Non-Life [Domestic Foreign\n' rl UC-GIC > Munich Re\nt ~ Suriss Re\n~ Employers Re\n~ Zurich Re\n~ London Re\nRegulatory Authority ~ Others\nIRDA\n\nFigure 16.1 The Insurance Industry\n\nThe Indian insurance industry is governed by the Insurance Act, 1978, the General Insurance Busi-\nness (Nationalization) Act, 1972, Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956, and Insurance Regulatory and\nDevelopment Authority Act, 1999,\n",

The promoters\u2019\nlong-term commitment to stay in the market, their ability to bring in new techniques in insurance\nunderwriting and administration are some of the parameters, which are assessed in the first phase.\nSubsequent to this preliminary assessment, the IRDA conducts an in-depth assessment of the busi-\nness plans submitted by the promoter.\n\nThe IRDA is the sole authority for awarding licenses. There is no restriction in the number of\nlicenses it can issue, but licenses for life and non-life business are to be issued separately. Licenses\nare issued only on a national basis. The new players should commence business within 15 to\n18 months of getting the license. A new applicant has to pay a registration fee of \u20ac50,000. At the\ntime of renewal of registration every year, a fee of 0.20 per cent of one per cent of the gross premium\nor %50,000 whichever is higher, is levied on the insurers carrying out insurance business in India.\n\u2018The IRDA has prescribed a \u2018file and use\u2019 procedure, according to which every insurer is required to\nfile the product and pricing details along with copies of standard terms, conditions, and literature. In\ncase of tariff products, the Tariff Advisory Committee is required to file product and pricing details\nwith the IRDA, like any other insurance company.\n\nAll insurance intermediaries, such as agents and corporate agents, have to undergo compulsory\ntraining prior to their obtaining a license. The IRDA also specified the minimum educational quali-\nfications for these intermediaries. It conducts examinations and then issues licenses to these agents.\nIt believes that well trained and informed intermediaries can service the consumers better. The\nIRDA insured or renewed 1,18,154 agents licenses by the end of March 2001. The licensing of\nInsurance Agents Regulations have specified the qualifications for an insurance agent: hundred\nhours prelicensing training, followed by an examination. In addition, for new agents 25 hours train-\ning to keep knowledge updated has also been prescribed at the time of renewal of license.\n\nThe Insurance Association and Life Insurance and General Insurance Councils have been revived\nand they are responsible for setting the norms for market conduct, ethical behaviour of the insurers,\nand breach of regulations. Continuous training has been stipulated to enhance the efficiency of the\nintermediaries. New players have set up call centres which are functioning on a 24/7 basis.\n\n* The IRDA has recognized the Actuarial Society of India and Insurance Institute of India as nodal\norganizations responsible for actuarial and insurance education. IRDA has drafted separate bills of\nthe Actuarial Society of India and the Institute of Surveyors and Loss Assessors in order to grant\nthem statutory status.\n\n* The IRDA has also entered into an MoU with the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, to\nfurther its objective of insurance research and education. It has set up a risk management resource\ncentre in Bangalore.\n\n* The IRDA has come out with the Insurance Advertisement and Disclosure Regulations to ensure\nthat the insurance companies adhere to fair trade practices and transparent disclosure norms while\naddressing the policy holders or the prospects.\n",

In order to deliver value\nto the customer, insurers have set up internal grievance redressal cells to reduce and address consumer griev-\nance. Public sector players like LIC and GIC have set up their own internal grievance redressal machinery\u2014\nnominating grievance redressal officers and adoption of customer relationship management (CRM) culture in\nits operations. The Government has prescribed a citizens\u2019 charter for all public offices to address some of the\ncomplaints. LIC has set up review committees consisting of retired judges to review the judgments delivered\nby courts. The private sector companies have provided a toll free helpline number to the customers.\n\nA policy holder can take recourse to the judicial frame to address his grievance. The Consumer Protection\nAct, 1986 was enacted to provide a simpler and quicker access to redressal of consumer grievances. The Act\nfor the first time defined \u2018consumer\u2019 and provided machinery whereby consumers can file their complaints\nagainst erring suppliers which will be entertained by Consumer Forums with special powers. This Act provid-\ners three-tier Courts\u2014District, State and National- for adjudication of consumer disputes. The district forum\nis the lowest level court situated in the district headquarters. It can hear cases involving amounts of 220 lakh.\nAbove the district forum are state-level consumer courts known as state commission situated in the capital of\nthe state. They can hear cases involving an amount more than rupees twenty lakhs and up to rupees one crore.\nIthas also jurisdiction to hear appeal against the orders of District Forum of that particular state. The national\ncommission is on the top hierarchy of consumer courts and is situated in Delhi. It can hear cases involving\namounts above rupees one crore and also hear appeals against the order of state commission.\n\nThere is a three-tier system of civil courts in India. At the lowest level are the district courts presided\nover by a district judge administering justice at a district level. These courts are under administrative and\njudicial control of the high court of the state to which the district concerned belongs. High courts are the\nprincipal civil courts of original jurisdiction in the state or a union territory. At the apex of the hierarchy\nof the judicial system in India is the Supreme Court of India.\n\nThe judicial process is a costly and time-consuming mechanism for redressal of disputes. To provide\nthe insured a speedy and inexpensive grievance redressal system, the Government of India promulgated\n\n\nRedressal of Public Grievances (RPG) Rules 1988 (under the Insurance Act 1938) to setup an institu-\ntion of ombudsman. The office of Insurance Ombudsman is a step in building up the confidence of the\npolicy holders in insurers. The Insurance Council is the administrative body of this institution and it has\nappointed 17 ombudsmen across the country since 1999. The objective of Insurance Ombudsman is to\nprovide a forum for resolving disputes and complaints from the aggrieved insured public or their legal\nheirs against insurance companies operating in general insurance business and life insurance business in\npublic and private sector. The insurance ombudsman is empowered to receive and consider written com-\nplaints in respect of insurance contracts on personal lines where the insured amount is less than 30 lakh.\nInsurance on \u2018personal lines\u2019 means a policy taken or given in an individual capacity, e.g., life insurance,\npersonal accident insurance, insurance of property of the individual such as motor vehicle, household\narticles, mediclaim insurance, etc.\nThe complaints can relate to:\n\n. Grievance against insurer\nPartial or total repudiation of claims by the insurer\n\n. Dispute in regard to premium paid or payable in terms of the policy\n\n}. Dispute on the legal construction of the policy in so far as such dispute relate to claims.\n. Delay in settlement of claims.\n\n. Non-issue of any insurance document to customers after receipt of premium.\n\nDAUSwnNe\n\nit is essential that:\n\nFor a complaint to be admissible,\n\n1. Before approaching the ombudsman, the complainant should have made a representation to the\ninsurer who had either rejected the complaint or the complainant had not received any reply\nwithin one month or the complainant is not satisfied with the reply given by the insurer.\n\n2. The complaint is made within one year after the insurer had rejected the complaint or sent his\nfinal reply on the complainant\u2019s representation.\n\n3. The subject matter of complaint should not be pending or considered by any Court or Consumer\nForum or Arbitrator.\n\n4. Compensation/relief claimed should not exceed %30 lakh.\n\nAn ombudsman is entrusted with two functions\u2014conciliation and award making. The awards passed\nby an ombudsman are binding on insurers and they are required to honor the awards within three months.\nThe Insurance Ombudsman Scheme is complementary to the regulatory functions of IRDA.\n",

Despite the publicity and the increasing awareness, it\ncontinues to be a chance affair for the layman.

After obtaining the\nlicense, agents have to enroll with the insurance company to be authorized to work as agents. Agents get\nthe license to sell policies of only one life insurance company and one non-life insurance company at a\ntime. They form a vital link between the insurer and the customer. They are paid a commission on every\npolicy they sell. An agent is now viewed as a financial advisor who is responsible for understanding the\ncustomer's needs, recommending and selling policies, and providing any further support. LIC has a net-\nwork of around 10.62 lakh agents while the private sector insurers have a network of 9.55 lakh agents. As\n\u2018on March 31, 2016, there were over 20.17 lakh agents and 416 corporate agents. According to the IRDA\nguidelines, the applicant for a corporate agency should normally be a company whose principal business\nshould be other than distribution of insurance products. Insurance business should be a subsidiary activity.\nHowever, in exceptional cases, grant of corporate agencies for exclusively doing insurance intermediation\n\n\ncan be considered by an insurer. In respect of such cases, the corporate agent should be a public limited\ncompany with a minimum share capital of \u00a350 lakh. The capital should be kept in the form of a deposit in\na bank account to be utilized for setting up the office, or be invested in assets, subject to approval by the\ninsurer. Persons who are not regulated by the RBI are not eligible for corporate agency license, unless they\nhave a substantial client base of their own or access to data to identify the prospective policy holders and\nhave a turnover, assets or income of atleast 15 crore. Only those persons which are part of a group having\nIndian Insurance company or a scheduled commercial bank within the group shall be eligible for issue\nof corporate agency license to do insurance business as the principal business provided this shall be the\nonly corporate agency amongst all the entities in the group. Corporate agencies, including bancassurance,\ncontributed over three-fourths of the business mobilized through all the new channels during 2008-09.\n\nInsurance is a financial product requiring technical and product knowledge. In order to develop\nagents as independent and competent financial advisors, the IRDA has stipulated compulsory training of\n100 hours followed by an eligibility test for agents. Those who successfully complete the test and training\nare granted a license by the IRDA. The IRDA permits companies, banks, and non-banking finance com-\npanies (NBFCs) to become insurance agents. Corporate agents will be tied to a single insurance company\nand will represent the insurance company in selling insurance product to prospective customers.\n\nRequirements for an Agent\n\n* Educational qualification: Class X examination (in rural areas) Class XII (urban areas)\n+ Formal qualification: 100 hours of training for life/general insurance. 150 hours training for both\n+ Licensing qualification: Examination to be conducted by the Insurance Institute of India\n\nCorporate Agents: IRDA has issued IRDAI (Registration of Corporate Agents) Regulations, 2015.

The brokers are retained by the insureds, and are thus primarily responsible to them.\n\nThe IRDA has allowed brokers to enter the insurance industry. To ensure the quality of service pro-\nvided to the end customer, the IRDA has created four categories of brokers and specified the minimum\ncapital requirement for each of the category.\n\nThe IRDA has made it mandatory for every insurance broker to take a professional indemnity insur-\nance cover with an insurer in India, to indemnify him against breach of duty, libel, slander, loss of money,\nor other property for which he is legally liable in consequence of any financial or fraudulent act, legal\nliability incurred by reason of loss of documents, and costs and expenses incurred in replacing such docu-\nments, or any financial penalty imposed on him.\n\nThe functions of brokers are specified by the IRDA and include provision of technical advice, advice\n\u2018on developments in the insurance market and the law, providing written acknowledgments and progress\nreports, and assisting in the negotiation of claims.

In the US, most insurance\ncompanies have their own TPAs, while, in India, TPAs are separate external entities. These TPAs serve\nmore than one insurer at a time. TPAs get a licence for a period of three years and after three years they\nhave to get the licence renewed.\n\nThird party administrators (TPAs) are distributors of insurance products in the health insurance sector.\nThey facilitate the smooth operation of a health cover by acting as a link between the insurance companies\nand their clients and hospitals. The IRDA has set up the minimum cap of one crore for TPAs. The IRDA\nhas also prescribed a qualified medical doctor as one of the corporate directors to obtain a licence. TPAs\nare engaged for post-claims management. They enable cashless payment of claims to the insured wherein\nthey settle claims with hospital instead of insurers.\n\nIn October 2002, the four state-owned non-life insurance companies\u2014National Insurance, New India\nAssurance, Oriental Insurance and United India Insurance appointed third-party administrators to per-\nform the task of networking with hospitals and screening health insurance claims. The TPAs were given a\ncommission of 5.6 per cent of the mediclaim insurance premium for providing this service. The four state\nowned general insurers have empanelled over two dozen third party administrations (TPAs) for manag-\ning the \u2018mediclaim\u2019 policy. All new mediclaim policies will be serviced by TPAs. Insurers have allocated\ndivisions falling under each regional office to an external TPA. The data, in respect of all new policies,\nwill be forwarded to the TPAs who, within seven days will issue an identity card and guidebook detailing\nclaim procedures. The TPAs will man 24-hour call centres and direct the insured to a suitable hospital,\nwith which they have a tie up, in the event of an ailment. The TPAs will also be provided with float funds\nby insurance companies to settle claims with hospitals. Insurers will pay a fee of around 5.5 per cent of\nthe premium which will be passed on to the insured.\n\nThe TPAs empanelled by the four insurers have a network ranging from expensive hospitals to small\nnursing homes. They are offering cashless hospitalization services since October 2002, through their\nextensive network. The cashless facility offers the policy holder a distinct benefit of not having to pay the\nhospital. The policy holder has to merely quote the policy number and display the health card which frees\nhim from the cumbersome reimbursement procedures of a traditional policy.\n\nAs on April 6, 2017, there were 27 empanelled TPAs. The growth of this particular line of business\nis hampered due to multiple complaints about servicing the insured, including repudiation of claims\ndue to conditions/exclusions in the policy; non-settlement of claim/delay in settlement of claim;\ncancellation of policy without giving any notice; settlement of claim for lesser amount; refusal to\n\nrenew policy in case of adverse claims experience; non-issue of list of hospitals; improper guid-\nance by 24-hour help lines; inaccessibility of toll-free numbers; non-receipt of settlement cheques\nwithin the stipulated time; nonreceipt of photo identity cards; wrong insertion of photos/names in\nthe identity cards; loading at the time of renewals (whether claim/no claim); and hike in premium\nfor introduction of TPAs.\n\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Bancassurance\n\nBancassurance is insurance companies tying up with banks to sell insurance products. Bancassurance is\nan innovative distribution channel in India. In France, over half of the insurance products are sold through\nbanks, while the share of bancassurance in Hongkong is 25 per cent, UK 18 per cent, and Singapore\n15 per cent. In the US, banks lease space to insurers and retail products of multiple insurers just similar\ntoa retailer selling different products of different companies under one roof.\n\nThe RBI, in recognition of the symbiotic relationship between banking and insurance industries, iden-\ntified three routes of participation in the insurance business, namely, \u2014 only referral model, a tie-up model\nwith an insurance company becoming a corporate agency model where the insurer and banker join hands\ntogether; and a joint venture model where a bank along with an Indian or foreign insurer starts its own\ninsurance company. However, most of the banks choose a corporate agency model or a joint venture\nmodel. Bancassurance emerged as a preferred route for banks as other routes involve compliance to\nstringent entry norms. Moreover, banks can increase their profits without setting aside additional capital.\nBanks have, of late, realized that they have to leverage their distribution strengths to increase their fee-\nbased income for survival. Over 20 banks have tied up with public and private sector insurance companies\nto sell their products. The synergy between some products (such as insurance cover for housing loans)\nmakes banks ideal partners of insurance companies. In addition, through this partnership, new insurance\ncompanies get a readymade consumer data-base and higher reach to compete with public sector insurance\ncompanies. In order to facilitate the banks to take up the business of insurance broking without having to\nset up a separate subsidiary, IRDA has allowed scheduled banks to function as Direct Insurance Brokers.\nThe banks need to obtain a prior approval of the RBI and designate a general manager or equivalent cadre\nofficer as principal officer to look after insurance broking business.\n\nCooperative banks, cover more than 65 per cent of the rural population. These banks can serve as\nimportant vehicles for distributing insurance products in rural areas. The private and foreign banks are\naggressive sellers of insurance products as commissions are over 35 per cent of the first year premium.\nLooking to the attractive margins in bancassurance, the public sector banks are focusing on this business.\n\nThe banks are allowed to have an insurance partner\u2014life, general & health insurance company\u2014to\nsell their insurance products. Now this limit has been increased by the IRDAI to three companies in each\ncategory, thus making the banks as insurance brokers.\n\nIn order to expand their reach, life insurance companies are coming up with alternate distribution\nchannels.\n\nDirect Marketing The insurance company gets a data base of potential customers, contacts them on the\ntelephone to market different policies of the company. Companies are increasingly targeting customers of\nforeign banks as they are accustomed to tele marketing. ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company sent\n50,000 direct mailers to office-goers in Mumbai through their lunch boxes.\n\nAutomobile Manufacturer Tie-ups Non-life insurers have tied up with automobile manufacturers to\nprovide \u2018free insurance\u2019 through their authorized car dealers for all new cars sold. Under the scheme\nof free insurance the insured does not pay the first premium but it is paid by the car dealer who is then\ncompensated by the manufacturer.\n\nForex Dealers Large travel-related relationship services such as Thomas Cook and Western Union who\nhave wide distribution networks are tapped by insurance companies to canvass and sell overseas travel\ninsurance policies.\n\nWorksite Marketing Insurance companies through their skilled marketing sell tailor-made insurance\npolicies to individual employees of large organizations.\n\nInternet Insurance companies sell products such as motor insurance, home insurance and personal\naccident insurance over the net.\n\nDepartmental Stores/Retailers of White Goods _ Insurance companies tie up with large departmental\nchains such as Shoppers\u2019 Stop or Westside to sell their products.\n\nMarine Cargo Insurance Through Clearing and Forwarding (C&F) Agents/Transporters/Carrier\nCompanies Insurance companies provide these agents technology support which enables them to issue\nmarine policies anywhere and anytime.\n\nINSURANCE MARKETING FIRMS (IMFs): Insurance marketing firm is a new distribution channel\nto solicit or procure insurance premium, to distribute other financial products by employing individuals\nlicensed to market, distribute and service such other financial products. Entities that are licensed as\ninsurance marketing firms will be able to distribute insurance products along with mutual funds,\npension products and certain other financial products such as banking/financial products of banks/\nNBFC regulated by RBI; and non-insurance products offered by Department of Posts, Government of\nIndia, provided that permissions are in place to distribute those financial products from the respective\nregulator. In respect of general insurance, the IMF is allowed to solicit or procure only retail lines of\ninsurance products as given in the file and use guidelines namely motor, health, personal accident,\nhouseholders, shopkeepers and such other insurance products approved by the authority from time to\ntime.\n\nIMF are permitted to distribute the insurance products of only two life insurers, two general insur-\ners and two health insurers at any point of time, and changing the insurer whose products are to be\ndistributed can only take place with the prior approval. IMFs are required to have a minimum capital\nof 210 lakh. They are also permitted to undertake survey functions through licensed surveyors on its\nrolls, policy servicing activities, and other activities which are permitted to be outsourced by insurers\nunder the applicable regulatory framework. To safeguard the interests of customers, the remuneration\nof IMF salespersons is not commission-based but rather a fixed amount, with the option of a perfor-\nmance incentive.\n\nInsurance Web Aggregators: It is also known as price comparison websites, have come up to enable\nthe self-directed customers to perform product research function online. These entities compile and\nprovide information about insurance policies of various companies on their website. Their primary\nmotive is to provide accurate information to potential buyers. The role and duties of such aggregators\nare defined in detail in the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (Web Aggregators)\nRegulations, 2013. In addition to enhancing transparency in the industry, web aggregators have made\nthe whole process of decision making with regard to insurance products more convenient for busy\nbuyers.\n\nThe IRDA took an initiative to develop a system, known as web aggregator, for comparison and distri-\nbution of insurance policies online. This initiative was taken for the benefit of prospective buyers\u2019 of the\ninsurance policy keeping in mind developing trends in e-commerce. The IRDA initially issued guidelines\nin November, 2011 to enable enthusiastic entrepreneurs to leverage technological advancements to apply\nfor license for comparison of insurance products of various insurance companies. Subsequently, it came\nout with IRDA (Web Aggregators) Regulations, 2013 and licensed web aggregators under the regulations.\nAt present, there are 16 web aggregators.\n\nPoint of Sales Person: There are number of persons who are involved in undertaking simple and\nroutine activities pertaining to solicitation and marketing of insurance policies for products in motor\ninsurance, travel insurance, personal accident insurance, etc., which require little underwriting as they are\nbased on the information provided by the prospect and the insurance policy is automatically generated\nby the system. The intervention required for such a product is minimal and the training and examination\nfor such persons could be of a lesser degree. In order to facilitate the growth of insurance business in\nthe country and to enhance insurance penetration and insurance density, \u2018Point of Sales Person\u2019 can be\nsponsored by the insurance company or the insurance intermediary with whom he shall work to solicit\nand market only certain pre-underwritten products approved by the IRDA and who will undergo online\ntraining. Every \u2018Point of Sales Person\u2019 shall be identified by his Aadhaar Card Number or his PAN Card.\nThe \u2018Point of Sales Person\u2019 shall be at least 10th pass.\n\nThe \u2018Point of Sales Person\u2019 can sell only the following pre-underwritten product.

Every policy sold through the \u2018Point of\nSales Person\u2019 shall be separately identified and prefixed by the name \u201cPOS\u201d \u2014 (name of product). This will\nenable not only giving an opportunity to people to secure gainful employment but also increase insurance\npenrtration.\n\nCommon Service Centre - Special Purpose Vehicle(CSC-SPV): The CSC-SPV markets insurance\nproducts and also offers other insurance related services through the CSC network of those insurance\ncompanies who have entered into an agreement with the CSC-SPV. CSC-SPV is the CSC e-Governance\nServices Limited, Special Purpose Vehicle incorporated to facilitate delivery of government, private and\nsocial sector services to citizens of India through CSC network.\n\nWithin the CSC framework, there are service partner agency which includes the state designated\nagency or the service centre agency or any other agency under the CSC scheme who will train, guide\nand mentor the Village Level Entrepreneurs (VLEs). Rural Authorised Person (RAP) shall be an indi-\nvidual Village Level Entrepreneur (VLE) registered and authorized by the CSC-SPV to operate and\nmanage a common service centre to market insurance products and offer insurance related services.\nHe should undergo 20 hour training and pass examination conducted by National Institute of Elec-\ntronics and Information Technology (NIELIT), and have a minimum qualification of 10th pass or\nequivalent.\n\nThe CSC-SPV shall market exclusive products under this channel which will be pre-fixed with the\nwords \u201cCSC\u201d, The maximum sum assured/insured allowed in these policies is 72 lakhs excluding the\nsum insured under motor insurance.

This\nservice allows subscribers to buy and store their policies in a dematerialized form (as e-policies). Beyond\ncliminating the risks of storage and loss, this facility provides convenience and safety to customers.\nMost importantly, e-policies are more economical to issue and service as compared to traditional paper\npolicies. This feature could give a boost to the distribution and issue of low-ticket policies to marginal\ncustomers and thereby increase insurance penetration\n",

                        "extracted-text": "RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nThe term \u2018risk\u2019 is generally used to refer to a situation which bears a probability of some financial loss.\nIt indicates uncertainty about a situation or a circumstance. However, it is only those circumstances or\nthe part of a circumstance that bears the possibility of a \u2018loss\u2019, that is referred to as risk. Thus risk can\nbe said to mean an uncertainty that has a likelihood of imposing some loss generally financial loss.\nGoing further, in the insurance world, the term risk is used to refer to a property or an individual (in\ncase of life insurance) insured. Technically the subject matter insured is called the \u2018exposure unit\u2019.\nRisk is also used interchangeably with perils like fire, earthquake, explosion, etc. In fact, operation\nof perils involves the risk of loss. Again risk is also used to describe a hazardous situation like stor-\nage of inflammable material. Presence of a \u2018hazard\u2019 increases the risk of loss. Thus notwithstanding\nthe context in which it is used, risk would mean simply \u2018a probability of loss\u2019. Risk management as a\nbranch of knowledge deals with entire gamut of issues relating to risks, starting from understanding the\nnature of risks and going up to methods of handling risks and financing risks. Risk management may\nbe defined as the process of planning, organizing, directing and controlling the resources and activi-\nties of an organization in order to minimize the adverse effects of potential losses at the least possible\ncost.\n\nIncreasing number of natural disasters, changes in demographic structure, volatility in financial mar-\nkets, rapid growth of financial services, regulatory changes, information explosion, and de-tariffing of\npremium structures are just some of the factors aggravating the risk profile of insurance companies.\nThey have come to terms with these changes and have started considering risk management as one of the\nstrategic functions,\n\n\nIn addition to the pure risks of property, liability, and manpower, insurers have to counter certain risks\npeculiar to the business of insurance. These risks are: Portfolio risks, solvency risks, marketing risks,\nmarket risks, and operational risks.\n\n* Portfolio risks: Portfolio for an insurer means the mix of business done by an insurer. For example,\nin case of life insurance, portfolio consists of term policies, endowment policies, unitlinked plans,\netc. In case of non-life it could be fire, motor, health, etc. In order to optimize profitability, it is\nessential for an insurer to maintain the right balance in its business portfolio. Any distortion in port-\nfolio is likely to expose the insurer to losses. Proper portfolio planning and constant monitoring and\ncontrol over operations is the key to control this risk.\n\nSolvency risks: The more is the business of the insurer, the higher is the risk exposure in terms of\nexpected losses. How much loss can an insurer bear on his own? This depends on the backup in\nterms of capital represented by assets of the insurer. This also involves valuation of outstanding\nliability in respect of policies issued by the insurer. In case of life insurance, such a valuation is\ndone by actuaries. The capital has to be commensurate with the outstanding liability otherwise the\ninsurer runs the risk of going insolvent in the event of huge losses. The IRDA has prescribed strin-\ngent norms in respect of capital adequacy to ensure that the risk of insolvency is addressed in right\nearnest. Thus with increase in business of an insurer, either the capital has to be raised or the excess\ntisk exposure has to be transferred through reinsurance.\n\nMarketing risks: Insurance is a business of volumes and in order to reach out to the targeted seg-\nments of customers, marketing plays a pivotal role. Any change in demographic structure includ-\ning consumer preference gives rise to marketing risks. Changes in demographic structure such as\ndecrease in death rates, change in life styles and new killer diseases like SARS and AIDS have\naltered the demographic composition of the population. The rapid growth of financial services has\nled to development of more and varied alternate channels of distribution, tie-ups, and alliances. The\nderegulation of insurance industry has led to the entry of private sector players which in turn, has\nincreased competition. A well-defined marketing strategy and positioning is critical to overcome all\nthese risks.\n\nMarket risks: Investment income is a crucial source of revenue for insurers. The revenue mix in\ninsurance business is largely dominated by investment incomes. In order to maintain profitability,\ninsurers have to be aggressive in investing their funds in high risk, high return securities which gives\nrise to market risk. The volatility in financial markets has made management of investible funds\nchallenging. Market risk cannot be completely eliminated by diversification. Hedging tools like\nfutures and options and prudent investment management help in mitigating this risk.\n\nOperational risk: Insurance is a service-intensive business. Policy and claims servicing are back-\nbones of insurance business, These days in order to raise service standards, information technology\nis being used in operations in a big way. Centralized servers storing the entire data of the insurer and\nwider area networks (WAN) pose a definite operational risk while enhancing the service standards.\nAny accident or calamity of the server site can lead to a total breakdown of operations countrywide\nresulting in loss of business. Business continuity planning, remotely located proxy servers, proper\nback-up of data, and effective contingency plans are some of the steps towards operational risk\nmanagement.\n\nThe insurance companies need to institutionalize risk management culture for successfully imple-\nmenting risk management.\n",

As per\nprovisions of PMFBY, insurance unit for major crops is village panchayat or other equivalent unit.\nPremium rates are actuarial supported by up-front subsidy in premium, farmers would pay premium of\n2% in Kharif season, 1.5% in Rabi season for food crops and oilseeds and 5% for annual commercial\nhorticulture crops. In case actuarial premium is less than above premium, actuarial premium will be\npaid by farmer. Balance between actuarial and capped premium would be payable by centre and state\ngovernment equally. District-level crop-wise scale of finance would serve as basis of sum insured at\nwhich three levels of Indemnity, 70%, 80% and 90% would be applicable. Insurer is responsible\nfor the claims liabilities\n\nThe scheme is implemented on an \u2018area approach basis\u2019. The unit of insurance shall be village/vil-\nlage panchayat level for major crops and for other crops, it may be a unit of size above the level of\nvillage/village panchayat. The loss assessment for crop losses due to non-preventable natural risks is on\narea approach. In case of majority of insured crops of a notified area are prevented from sowing/plant-\ning the insured crops due to adverse weather conditions that will be eligible for indemnity claims up to\nmaximum of 25% of the sum-insured. However, losses due to localized perils (Hailstorm, landslide &\ninundation) and post harvest losses due to specified perils, (Cyclone/Cyclonic rain & Unseasonal rains)\nshall be assessed at the affected insured field of the individual insured farmer. There will be a provision\nof on account claims in case of adverse seasonal conditions during crop season, viz., floods, prolonged\n\n\ndry spells, severe drought, and unseasonal rains. On account payment up to 25% of likely claims will be\nprovided, if the expected yield during the season is likely to be less than 50% of normal yield.\n\nWeather Based Crop Insurance Scheme (WBCIS): Apart from the above two yield guarantee\ninsurance schemes, the Government of India had introduced another scheme namely, Pilot Weather\nBased Crop Insurance Scheme (WBCIS) with effect from Kharif 2007, which became full-fledged\nscheme as a component of NCIP with its introduction. The scheme operates on an actuarial basis\nwith premium subsidy which ranges from 25% to 50% equally shared by centre and states. AIC has\nimplemented the scheme in various states during all previous Kharif and Rabi seasons starting Kharif\n2007. WBCIS is a parametric insurance product designed to provide insurance protection to the\ncultivator against adverse weather incidence during the cultivation period, such as deficit and excess\nrainfall, frost, heat (temperature), relative humidity, wind speed, etc., which are deemed to adversely\nimpact the crop yield.\n\nCrops and \u2018Reference Unit Areas (RUA)\u2019 are notified before the commencement of the season by the\nState Government Each RUA is linked to a Reference Weather Station (RWS), on the basis of which pay-\nout/claims are processed. The payouts are made on the basis of adverse variations in the current season's\nweather parameters as measured at Reference Weather Station (RWS). Claim under WBCIS is area based\nand automatic. The Company insured more than 35 different crops including perennial crops like Apple,\nCitrus crops, Grapes, Mango, Pomegranate, Cashew nut, Oil palm, etc.\n\nFrom Kharif 2016 onwards, WBCIS will be continued as restructured WBCIS wherein Farmers\u2019 Pre-\nmium rate has been reduced to 1.5% to 2% for FCOS and 5% for ACH crops keeping all other parameters\nsame.\n\n1. Traditional and Named Peril Insurance Products such as potato insurance, bio-fuel tree/plant\ninsurance and poppy insurance. Named Peril insurance policy is one which covers only those\nlosses which arise on account of perils specifically listed in the contract. These products operate\nat individual farm level with losses being on individual basis.\n\nAIC aims at providing financial security to person engaged in agriculture and allied activities\nthrough insurance products and other support services.\n\nExport Credit Guarantee Corporation Credit plays a vital role in expanding export trade but it also\nincreases the payment risks in export transactions. Hence the need for export credit insurance is felt. To\nfulfill this need, the Export Credit Guarantee Corporation (ECGC) of India offers a range of credit risk\ninsurance covers to exporters against loss in export of goods and services, guarantees to banks/financial\ninstitutions to enable exporters obtain better facilities, provides overseas investment insurance to Indian\ncompanies investing in joint ventures in the form of equity/loan. These schemes enable the exporters to\ndevelop their business, explore new markets and products, and get timely and adequate export finance.\nThe Reserve Bank of India has permitted banks to write off in addition to claims settled by ECGC the\nout standing export bills settled by other insurance companies which are regulated by the IRDA. This\ndirective of the RBI gives private insurance companies a large opportunity in this business and puts them\n\u2018on par with ECGC.\nThe private sector general insurance companies are:\n\nRoyal Sundaram Alliance Insurance Company Limited\nReliance General Insurance Company Limited\n\nIFFCO Tokio General Insurance Company Limited\nTATA AIG General Insurance Company Limited\n\nBajaj Allianz General Insurance Company Limited\nICICI Lombard General Insurance Company Limited\nCholamandalam General Insurance Company Limited\nHDFC- ERGO General Insurance Company Limited\nStar Health and Allied Insurance Company Limited\nApollo Munich Insurance Company Limited\n\n+ Future Generali India Insurance Company Limited\nUniversal Sompo General Insurance Company Limited\n+ Shriram General Insurance Company Limited\n\nBharti AXA General Insurance Company Limited\nRaheja QBE General Insurance Company Limited\n\nSBI General Insurance Company Limited\n\n* Max Bupa Health Insurance Company Limited\n\n+ L&T General Insurance Company Limited\n\n+ Religare Health Insurance Company Limited\n\n+ Magma HDI General Insurance Company Limited.\n\n* Liberty Videocon general Insurance Company Limited\n\nThe minimum paid-up capital of the general insurance companies was raised to 2100 crore under the\nmodified Insurance Act. The four nationalized general insurance companies enhanced their paid-up capi-\ntal from 240 crore to 2100 crore.\n\nThe general insurance market is not as big as the life insurance market. While life insurance accounts\nfor 81 per cent of the insurance market in India, general insurance accounts for the remaining 19 per cent.\n",

It can be taken only by the owner of the premises to be insured.\nA tenant cannot insure rented premises but he can insure the contents of the premises. Though fire\ninsurance is not compulsory, lending institutions and housing finance companies insist on the premises\nbeing insured against fire. Fire rates were revised twice after nationalization, in 1979 and 1987. Fire\ninsurance segment is the most lucrative as fire rates are governed by tariff. The competition is maxi-\nmum in this segment. Bulk of the premium comes from corporate clients with large industrial assets.\nFire insurance today accounts for a fifth of business for non-life insurance companies and brings in\nmost of their profits.\n\nMotor Insurance This covers the following:\n\n* Various types of cars, trucks, two-wheelers, and three-wheelers.\n\n+ There are two types of motor insurance, namely:\n\n+ Third party insurance which only insures the party/parties other than the owner in an accident.\nIt is mandatory for all registered vehicles plying on the Indian roads, under the provisions of the\nMotor Vehicle Act, 1988 which require every motor vehicle in a public place to insure against third\nparty risk.\n\n+ Comprehensive insurance which insures the owner as well as the third party involved.\n\nIn motor insurance, the rates were revised upwards twice, once in 1982 and then in 1990 as the high\ncost of repairs coupled with third party claims had adversely affected the incurred loss ratio. Motor insur-\nance is mandatory leading to good amount of premium collection but it is not being fancied upon as it\ncould lead to litigation problem. Still, motor insurance is the single largest and the fastest growing busi-\nness line for insurance companies. It accounts for over 40 per cent of the premium income of non-life\ninsurance companies.The motor insurance segment was de-tariffed from January 1, 2007.\n\nIRDA adopted a phased approach to detariffing in motor insurance.\n\n+ With a view to pre-empting a rate war in motor insurance, the regulator has asked companies not to\noffer vehicle cover at rates lower than 10 per cent of the tariff.\n\nIf the companies want to offer higher discounts after January 2007, they would have to explain their\npricing rationale.\n\nInsurers are allowed to marginally increase the rates for third party insurance.\n\nThe third party premium would go into a special pool which will be managed by General Insurance\nCouncil and all claims will be paid out of this pool.\n\nIf the premium in the pool is inadequate to meet all claims, the claims shortfall (losses) be shared by\nthe insurers in proportion of their overall business size (market share).\n\nInsurance companies will receive 10 per cent of the premium as management expenses, while\nGeneral Insurance Council will get 2.5 per cent for managing the pool.\n\nIn the first phase, companies will issue policies and settle claims through their branches. The claims\nshortfall would be shared by the industry at the end of the year.\n\nMarine Cargo Insurance This covers the following:\n\n* Cargo in transit.\n+ Cargo declaration policy.\n\nMarine Hull Insurance _ Inland vessels, ocean going vessels, fishing and scaling vessels, freight at risk,\nconstruction of ships, voyage insurance of various vessels, ship breaking insurance, oil and energy in\nrespect of onshore and offshore risks, including construction risk. The IRDA removed the price control\non insuring marine hulls from April 1, 2005. Now these classes of insurance come within the purview\nof the \u2018file and use\u2019 regulations, as applicable to non-tariff products. The marine hull portfolio is a 7400\ncrore business and with detariffing, the competition among general insurers to offer cheaper prices will\nincrease. As a result, the shipping industry will be the major beneficiary.\n\nNon-traditional/Rural Cattle/hens, crop, water pump for agriculture, hut, other livestock.\n\nBesides the traditional products, general insurers introduced longer term contracts such as deferred\nhealth insurance and project insurance including contractor's all-risk cover and the marine-cumerection\nrisk cover and credit insurance.\n\nAt present only fire and motor insurance premium rate are governed the by IRDA while in case of\nmarine, engineering and liability covers, the premium rates are determined through negotiation.\n\nAll classes of marine, hull insurance were de-tariffed with effect from April 1, 2005. With de-tarrifing,\nmarine insurance now falls within the purview of the \u2018file and use\u2019 regulations, as applicable to non-tariff\nproducts of the IRDA. This measure will benefit large Indian shipping companies to negotiate and attract\nthe best rates and select terms and conditions for themselves from the underwriters primarily because of\nthe size of their fleets. This will result in lower insurance costs and improved operating efficiency, thus\nenabling Indian ship owners to compete internationally.\n\nNew products introduced by the non-life insurers include Mutual Fund Package Policy providing cover\nin respect of the assured\u2019s legal liability to third parties for claims towards financial loss caused by neg-\nligent act, negligent error or negligent omission on the part of an officer/employee; Third Party Liability\nand Asset Protection covers are available in respect of mutual fund covering their business operations;\nPollution Liability Package Policy intended to cover damage costs of the insured due to slow and gradual\npollution activities; Even Insurance Policy indemnifies the insured against the loss or damage due to can-\ncellation of event. Weather insurance cover has been launched for the farming community, which suffers\nhigh losses year after year due to vagaries of nature. The specific products introduced by the insurers,\nwhich were aimed at the rural markets include Weather Insurance, Farm Income Insurance Scheme, Var-\nsha Bima (rainfall insurance), and Farmers\u2019 Package Policy.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Development of General Insurance\n\nBritish and other foreign insurance companies transacted general insurance business in India through\ntheir agents. Subsequently, they established their companies in India. The Triton Insurance Company\nLimited was the first general insurance company established in Calcutta in 1850. Foreign companies had\n\u2018a monopoly in the insurance business upto the close of the nineteenth century. The first Indian company\nto transact general insurance business was Indian Mercantile Insurance Company Limited in Bombay in\n1907. In 1957, the General Insurance Council framed a code of conduct for insuring fair transactions of\ngeneral insurance business. A Controller of Insurance was appointed to implement this code of conduct.\n\nIn 1956, insurers floated a reinsurance company, India Reinsurance Corporation Limited, for retention\nof the general insurance business in India. In 1961, the Indian Guarantee and General Insurance Com-\npany Limited, a government company along with India Reinsurance Corporation were notified as Indian\nreinsurers. The insurance companies voluntarily ceded to each of them 10 per cent of their gross direct\npremium. In 1961, the Government of India made it mandatory for every insurer to cede 20 per cent in\nfire and marine cargo, 10 per cent in marine hull and miscellaneous insurance, and 5 per cent in credit and\nsolvency business to these two reinsurers.\n\nIn 1966, Indian reinsurance companies formed the Reinsurance Pools in Fire and Hull departments\nfor retention of higher premiums in the country. The member companies ceded a specified percentage\nof premium to the respective pools which were managed by the two statutory reinsurers.\n\n\u2018A number of insurance companies indulged in unfair practices and hence the Insurance Act was\namended in 1968. This provided for regulation of investment of assets, setting up of the Tariff Advisory\nCommittee (TAC) under the chairmanship of the Controller of Insurance, minimum solvency margin,\n\nlicensing of surveyors and payment of premium before commencement of risk. The general insurance\nbusiness was concentrated in urban areas catering to the needs of trade and industry.\n\nThe government nationalized the general insurance business in 1972 by passing the General Insurance\nBusiness (Nationalization) Act, 1972. One hundred and seven insurers including branches of foreign\ncompanies operating in India were amalgamated and grouped into four companies, namely, The National\nInsurance Company Limited, The New India Assurance Company Limited, The Oriental Insurance Com-\npany Limited, and The United India Assurance Company Limited. The General Insurance Corporation\nwas incorporated as a holding company of these four companies in November 1972.\n\nThe general insurance industry in India is smaller than the life insurance industry. The total market\nsize in annual premiums is about half that of life insurance. The general insurance industry in India has\ncurrently about 20,000 crore of premium income with a five year compounded annual growth rate in\nthe 16 per cent range. The demand for general insurance is still generated by some form of mandatory\nor regulatory requirements. Motor vehicle insurance is compulsory and hence motor insurance premium\ndominates the total premium portfolio.\n\nThe growth of the general insurance business is hampered by lack of product innovation. Lack of qual-\nity data on risks and associated parameters handicaps product innovation.\n",

The Tariff\nAdvisory Committee looks into the pricing of non-life insurance products. The TAC determines the tar-\niffs of the insurance industry except for marine cargo and various personal lines of business. The tariff\nmechanism provides floor rates for various products. It prevents uneconomic competition and facilitates\nclassification of risks according to their special characteristics. The TAC has now been broad based with\nrepresentatives from various faculties besides the insurance industry. It has revised fire insurance and\nengineering tariffs.\n\nThe TAC controls and regulates the rates, advantages, terms and conditions that may be offered by\ninsurers in respect of general insurance business relating to fire, marine (hull), motor, engineering, and\nworkmen compensation. With effect from May 1, 2000, a simplified fire tariff with a significant reduction\nin premium rates was introduced. Large risks where the threshold limit of probable maximum loss (PML)\nis 71,054 crore or above, at any one location, or where the sum insured at any one location is 710,000\ncrore or above have been de-tariffed. These risks are beyond the tariff regime and would be guided by rates\navailable in the international markets, which are considerably cheaper than the tariff rates.\n\nMoreover, these mega risks require customization of products which are not available in the Indian\nmarket. As a result, insurers can now issue comprehensive insurance package policies for mega risk on\nreinsurance driven rates, terms and conditions.\n\nThe tariff regime will be gradually phased out. In view of this, the IRDA has prepared a vision TAC\ndocument to spell out the future role of the TAC. The tariff advisory committee will perform the follow-\ning functions:\n\n* Collection of data on premium and claims, analysis of such data, and dissemination of the results\nto the insurers.\n\n+ Report to IRDA on the underwriting health of the market and any aberrations in market behaviour.\n\n* Constitution of expert groups at the request of the General Insurance Council, to look into under-\nwriting issues and recommend necessary action.\n\n* Organize training of underwriters at the market level, and\n\n+ Attend to public grievances on non-availability of insurance and try to resolve the issues by discus-\nsion with insurers.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "De-tariffing in Non-life Insurance\n\nMost of the non-life insurance business transacted in India was governed by tariffs. Tariffs are documents\nthat prescribe the rates as well as policy coverage and conditions pertaining to a class of insurance. This\nhad resulted in a very little room for competition in these areas. This also left very little incentives for\nrating better-managed risks, thus resulting in avoidable claim costs for the insurers. To add fuel to fire,\nfeatures like adverse selection and moral hazard ensured that bottom lines of insurance always remained\nunder pressure regardless of volume of business.\n\nWith effect from January 01, 2007 price restrictions from all tariff classes of business viz. motor,\nengineering, fire and workman\u2019s compensation were removed. However uniform pricing continued for\n\nmotor third party risks for which a pool was created which was to be managed by GIC. In other words,\ninsurers were allowed to rate the risk according to their own perception and experience instead of going\nby the fixed price mentioned in erstwhile tariffs. This opened up the price wars among the insurers and\npremium rates for profitable classes of business like fire and engineering have fallen substantially. Pres-\nently, the discount rates on the tariff rates for these classes range from 50 to 80 per cent. This development\nhas been a boon in disguise for the consumers, particularly the industrial clients. For them the total outgo\non insurance premium of their assets has gone down drastically. On the other hand, this has meant lower\nmargins for insurers and lower commissions for intermediaries. Today after almost one and half years of\nprice liberation insurers have got themselves divided into two broad categories. Those who have built sub-\nstantial volumes established a sound customer base are going steady on discounts and are concentrating\non picking up better risks in order to increase profitability. On the other hand, insurers who are relatively\nnew in the market and are yet to establish themselves are concentrating on their toplines by offering heavy\ndiscounts, Price de-tariffing has also opened opportunities for public sector insurers to do their bit. They\nare huge entities with substantial reserves and thus can accumulate huge risks at a relatively cheaper\nprice. Due to this, many of the large corporate accounts that had shifted to private sector insurers are now\nback with their old PSU insurers.\n\nThe second phase of de-tariffing was liberalizing policy wordings. The erstwhile tariffs not only speci-\nfied the premium rates but also defined the coverage, exclusions and conditions for each product governed\nby tariffs. While de-tariffing the price, it was indicated by IRDA that full de-tariffing in respect of price\nas well as policy wordings will be done with effect from April 01, 2008. This was a crucial move since\nthis would have meant that not only the insurers will be charging the price at their discretion but will also\nbe able to customize the products as per the client's requirements. For this, the IRDA had requested the\nGeneral Insurance Council to draft standard policy wordings for all tariff classes of business. The insurers\non the other hand were requested to file the innovative products they wanted to sell as per the \u2018file and\nuse\u2019 procedure. For this the insurers were required to carry out detailed actuarial exercise for rating and\ndrafting the policy wordings.\n\nHowever this did not happen as expected. While the General Insurance Council did draft standard\npolicy wordings, very few insurers could file their products before the deadline. Carving out new products\nwas a new thing for the industry and despite the enthusiasm the exercise turned out to be ticklish. On the\nother hand the market was under going heavy to very heavy discounting on tariff rates which left very\nlittle margin for innovation. The market was so used to tariff products that even from the demand side\nvery little inclination was shown for innovation in product design. As a result the deadline of April 01,\n2008 for full de-tariffing could not be met and as of now the decision to liberalize policy wordings has\nbeen put on hold.\n\nHeavy discounting in price has, on the other hand, started showing results for insurers. Insurers have\nstarted feeling the heat of reduced price cushions in terms of exposed bottom lines. Prices have gone remark-\nably down but losses haven\u2019t. As a result, claims servicing has come under pressure and already there are\nunconfirmed reports of some insurers resorting to shoddy tactics for not paying claims.\n",

This margin can\nbe described as the ratio of free capital to the total business done by a company. If the losses are higher\nthan what a company has set aside in its reserves for anticipated claims, then a company ends up paying\nclaims out of its free capital which brings down a company\u2019s solvency ratio. If the solvency margin of an\ninsurer declines, the regulator can ask the company to bring in additional capital.

The four public sector undertakings\u2014New India, United India, National\nInsurance and Oriental Insurance Companies are competing aggressively with these new players. These\nPSUs and two private insurers\u2014ICICI Lombard General Insurance and Bajaj Allianz General Insur-\n\nance\u2014account for 90 per cent of the non-life market. The non-life industry grew by 19.10 per cent dur-\ning 2012-13. This growth was driven by health insurance and motor insurance. The number of policies\nunderwritten by the private sector non-life insurance companies has steadily increased.\n\nDuring the financial year 2012-13, the non-life insurers underwrote a premium of %62,973 crore\nrecording a growth of 19 per cent. The private non-life insures witnessed higher growth of 25 per cent\nby underwriting premium to the tune of $27,951 crore. Non-insurance companies reported underwriting\nlosses, higher incurred claims ratio and operating and management expenses. Despite these, they man-\naged to register profits on account of higher investment income.\n\nWith increase in competition, new products have been introduced to expand the general insurance\nmarket. ICICI Lombard offered Indian farmers a newly designed product \u2018weather insurance\u2019. This prod-\nuct was designed in association with the World Bank and micro finance institution\u2014Basix. This product\ninsures farmers against losses due to vagaries of weather relating to monsoons, humidity or tempera-\nture. Weather insurance does not suffer from the moral hazard and adverse selection problems. Also,\nthe administrative costs are lower than those of traditional crop insurance. Thus, it is beneficial to both\nfarmers and insurers. Moreover, it is easier for the insurer to transfer the risk to international financial\nmarkets through reinsurance. ICICI Lombard has executed around 90 weather insurance deals across 13\nstates and these deals have provided weather insurance solutions to about 2,00,000 farmers covering an\narea of about 2,50,000 acres.\n\nWith more joint ventures with foreign players and more innovations, the Indian investor will benefit.\nBranches and offices in the rural areas have been set up and rural sector products have been intro-\nduced by the non-life players. The non-life insurance companies are now focusing on retail business as\n\u2018opposed to corporate business. The nationalized companies have constituted an informal organization\ncalled General Insurance Public Sector Association (GIPSA) to suggest measures to expand the market\ncoverage.\n\nThe year 2007 witnessed a switch over to a tariff free pricing regime for non-life insurance. This\nbrought about hectic competition in pricing of non-life insurance products. However, only premium rates\nhave been freed and that too subject to comprehensive underwriting exercise. Thus, while real competi-\ntion will have to wait till full \u2018de-tariffing\u2019 it will be interesting to see how the industry responds to this\nlimited deregulation.\n",

Motor insurance still continues to dominate the\nsector. Like life insurance the penetration of non-life insurance is also abysmally low at 0.78 per cent\nin 2012.\n\nOn account of high claim ratios for health (96.43 per cent) and motor(87.06 per cent) insurance cou-\npled with a high operating cost ratio (21 per cent) profitability remains a concern for the non-life sector\nas well. The sector has not been able to generate underwriting profits since long and profits are generated\nonly on the basis of non-core revenues like investment income. The sector has not been able to develop\npersonal lines of business in a desired manner. Extending the out reach of insurance services to the low\nincome segment still remains a challenge. All this proves that the Indian insurance sector is still far from\nattaining a sustainable growth level.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "HEALTH INSURANCE\n\nHuman resource is the real wealth of a nation. An increase in national income does not always lead to\nhuman welfare. Economic development coupled with human development should be the primary objec-\ntive of a nation. India is one of the success stories of globalization with an average GDP growth rate of\n8 per cent since 2002-03. Despite high growth rate, it ranks 134 on human development index. The\nhuman development index provides a composite measure of three dimensions of human development:\nliving a long and healthy life, being educated and having a decent standard of living. India spends 4.8\nper cent of GDP on health, of which the public health expenditure is 1.2 per cent of GDP and private\nhealth expenditure is 3.6 per cent of GDP. The total health expenditure per capita in India is USD 82.\nThis is quite low in comparison to other developed and developing countries. On one hand, the country is\ngripped with communicable and non-communicable diseases resulting out of changing life styles, while\non the other hand, health care costs are escalating making access to quality health care difficult. With\n\ngovernment expenditure on health declining, health insurance has emerged as an alternative mechanism\nfor financing health care.\n\nHealth insurance, or health cover, is defined in the Registration of Indian Insurance Companies Regula-\ntions, 2000, as the effecting of contracts which provide sickness benefits or medical, surgical, or hospital\nexpense benefits, whether in-patient or out-patient, on an indemnity, reimbursement, service, prepaid,\nhospital or other plans basis, including assured benefits and long-term care.\n\nBoth life and non-life insurers registered with the IRDA can transact health insurance business. Star\nHealth and Allied Insurance Company is the first company to focus exclusively on health insurance. It\noffers health insurance as a stand alone product. Star Health is capitalized at 2105 crore and has a non-life\ninsurance license. It has a reinsurance arrangement with General Insurance Corporation (GIC). All claims\nbelow the claims ratio of 90 per cent will be picked up by GIC. IRDA has granted licence to three other\ninsurance companies to operate as stand alone health insurance companies viz. Apollo Munich Health\nInsurance Co. Ltd., Max Bupa Heath Insurance Co. Ltd. and Religare Health Insurance Co. Ltd. All the\ncompanies have received certificate of registration to carry on general insurance business to underwrite\nexclusively in the health, personal accident, and travel insurance segment.\n\nFor stand alone health insurance contracts, expertise in health product design and pricing, and efficient\nclaim settlement procedures are required.\n\nThe IRDA has encouraged both life and general insurance companies, old and new, to go in for\nrider policies offering health covers. Many new companies have gone in for riders offering a variety\nof health products. Riders are add-on benefits attached to the main life policy. To attract players to\nhealth insurance, life insurance companies will have no cap on health riders. While the relaxation has\nbeen given on the health riders, the 30 per cent cap on the premium of the base policy continues for\nother riders.\n\nThe general insurance industry has taken initiatives in standardising a uniform definition of \u2018Pre-\nExisting Diseases\u2019 and its exclusion wording . This uniform definition has come into effect from June\n1, 2008. It is expected that such standardization of terminology will increase clarity of the insured by\nminimizing ambiguity in policy wordings and also help comparability of health insurance products across\ninsurers.\n\nLaalth Imciiranca Dal\n\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Health Insurance Policies\n\nHealth policies available in India can be broadly classified in to:\nIndemnity based\u2014Mediclaim, health guard, healthwise, etc\u2014are the examples of indemnity based\npolicies. These policies provide for re imbursement of expenses incurred necessarily as a direct result of\nhospitalization necessitated by a covered disease, illness or injury.\nBenefit type-daily allowance, hospital cash, critical illness (standalone), or as a rider with the life\ninsurance policy. Such policies provide for lump-sum payment on happening of an event insured against\n\nby the policy.\n\n(1) Standard Health Insurance Policy Most of the health insurance policies available in the market\nprovide cover against the risk of hospitalization. While this has been the basic structure of the product\nright since its inception in late 1980s, some changes have taken place as regards the fringe benefits and\nexclusions, with the advent of private players in the insurance market.\n\nThe operative clause of a standard health insurance policy offers to indemnify the insured against\nhospitalization expenses incurred by him at a hospital or nursing home upon the advice of a duly\nqualified medical practitioner as a result of an illness, disease or injury contracted during the policy\nperiod.\n\n(2) Reimbursement and Cashless Policies\n\nReimbursement policies: This is the conventional method of indemnity in almost all non-life insur-\nance policies. The insured initially bears all the expenses which is later on reimbursed by the insurance\ncompany, provided the claim is admissible as per the policy. Preliminary notice of claim with particulars\nrelating to policy number, name of insured person in respect of whom claim is made, nature of illness!\ninjury and name and address of attending medical pra ner/hospital/nursing home has to be given by\nthe insured to the Company within 7 days from the date of hospitalization.\n\nIn a reimbursement claim, although the insured gets his money eventually in the form of the claim\nproceeds, he has to shell out money initially to get treated. to some extent this defeats the very purpose\n\n\nof insurance which is to provide monetary support at the time of peril. Due to this the industry went for\na novel concept that has commonly come to be known as the \u2018cashless\u2019 system. This system has been in\nvogue in foreign countries and was replicated in India after the insurance sector was opened for private\nplayers.\n\nCashless policies: Cashless model of hospitalization is a novel concept in India that allows a policyholder\nto avail medical treatment at any of the network hospitals of the insurer without paying cash. Insurers have\na panel of third party administrators (TPAs), who typically offer services across cities. Thus, a TPA is a\npoint of contact for a settlement of claims. They facilitate the smooth operation of a health cover by acting\nas a link between the insurance companies and their clients and hospitals. They enable cashless payment\nof claims to the insured wherein they settle claims with hospital instead of insurers. The hospital bills are\npaid by the TPA directly to the hospital, thus relieving the insured from the hassle of arranging funds in\nthe event of a major hospitalization.\n\n(3) Floater Policy This is again a new feature introduced post-liberalization. As per the standard\nhealth insurance product, separate sums had to be specified for each member of the family even in\ncases where the entire family was opting for insurance. While a common policy was issued, specific\nsum insured was to be mentioned against the names of each member. This system ignored the internal\ndiversification of risk among the family and the consequent risk reduction. Since standard premium\nrates were being applied to all family members, every member was considered to be an independent\nexposure unit. However in reality, the probability of all family members in a family falling ill in a single\nyear is very low. Due to this phenomenon, people used to either exclude their family members from\ncoverage or go for a lesser sum insured for spouse and children. As a matter of fact, where the working\nmember of a family is a male, the probability of him falling ill is more than his spouse and children.\nDue to this indirect adverse selection, insurers were deprived of the benefit of internal diversification\nin terms of reduced loss frequency.\n\nA family floater policy attempts to solve all these aberrations. This policy provides for a common\nsum insured for the entire family. The sum insured or the coverage amount can be used for the prin-\ncipal insured or together for the family members. Thus, having a family floater would imply that the\nentire family could claim up to the sum insured amount during the policy period. Technically, a family\nfloater policy considers the family as a single exposure unit as against the individual family members.\nBecause of this the premium chargeable for a family floater policy is much less than a conventional\npolicy with individual sum insured. Due to the reduced premium more families are attracted to buy\nthis policy. On the other hand since entire family is covered, the scope for adverse selection within the\nfamily is eliminated.\n\n(4) Group Mediclaim Policy The Group Mediclaim policy is available to any Group/Association/\nInstitution/Corporate body of more provided it has a central administration point and subject to a\nminimum number of persons to be covered.\n\nThe coverage under the policy is the same as under Individual Mediclaim with the following differ-\nences:\n\n1. Cumulative bonus and Health Check up expense are not payable\n2. Group discount in the premium is available\n\n3. Renewal premium is subject to Bonus/Malus clause.\n\n4. Maternity benefit extension is available at extra premium.\n\n(5) Cancer Medical Expenses Insurance Policy \u2018Two types of policies are devised for covering\nmedical expenses in relation to treatment of cancer. One policy is available to members of Indian Cancer\nSociety and another one for members of Cancer Patients Aids Association.\n\n(6) Health Riders Under Life Insurance Health insurance is a common area between life and\nnon-life insurance. In fact the regulatory framework for insurance companies encourages them to\nlaunch health insurance products. In developed insurance markets, health insurance is the exclusive\ndomain of life insurance companies. In India, unfortunately life insurers have not shown much\nkeenness towards standard health insurance. The IRDA has encouraged both life and general\ninsurance companies, old and new, to go on for rider policies offering health covers. Riders are add-\non benefits attached to the main policy. In most cases whatever is offered in form of \u2018health riders\u2019\nis nothing but critical illness or hospital daily cash allowance covers. The indemnity cover providing\n\nfor reimbursement of hospitalization expenses is nowhere to be seen. The salient features of health\nriders available with life insurance policies are summarized below:\n\n* This rider is added to a life insurance policy to protect the insured in the event of a critical illness.\nGenerally, the extra cover is equal to the sum assured on the base policy and is paid upon diag-\nnosis of the illness.\n\nThe plan is also renewable till the age of 65 years, without any medical examination, with premiums\nincreasing only once in every five years.\n\nWhile the illnesses covered and the premiums vary among insurers, most insurers cover cancer, coro-\nnary artery bypass, heart attack, kidney/renal failure, major organ transplant, and paralytic stroke.\nBefore adding this rider one must check illnesses covered and the exclusions.\n\nAnd, a few insurers terminate the base policy once a claim is made on the rider. Thus, a plan\nthat continues to give you life cover, at marginally higher premium on the rider, is preferable.\nUnder a Critical Illness policy, the amount of insurance has to be selected by the client. It is at\n4 levels\u20145 lakhs, 710 lakhs, 220 lakhs, and 225 lakhs.\n\n+ The premium paid for this rider qualifies for tax deduction under section 80D of the IT Act.\n\nOther Health Insurance Covers The health insurance vanilla products provide only for the\nexpenses wholly and necessarily incurred due to disease, illness or injury covered under the policy.\nBut, the exclusions contained there in create the biggest gap in the cover by omitting from the scope\nof cover pre-existing disease and conditions, and limiting the cover for payment of pre-hospitalization\nexpenses up to 30 days and post-hospitalization expenses up to 60 days (this period may differ\nfrom product to product). Even congenital diseases and defects, whether known or not known are\nexcluded from the scope of cover. It is estimated that in any hospitalization the percentage of direct\n(hospitalization) expenses and indirect or incidental expenses is in the ratio of 65 and 35, which\nclearly indicates the gap that exists in the coverage under a standard health insurance policy. Thus it\nis evident that many gaps are still there in the standard health insurance covers available in the market\nwaiting to be addressed.\n\nHealth is of the prime concern not only for a person but also for the society as ideally the health insur-\nance should not limit itself to the expenses or the pecuniary losses sustained by a person. Health insurance\nneeds to have a holistic view to address not only the loss aspect but to actively engage in the prevention of\nthe prevalence of diseases. The national goal of health for all can only be achieved by congruence of all\nthe state, the agencies, stakeholders on a common platform to ensure affordable, transparent and account-\nable healthcare to the whole society. It is not that no steps have been taken in that direction, but either it\nwas early or they did not get the right vehicle to reach the masses. The insurers have tried to bridge the gap\nby several permutations, combinations in an effort to provide better coverage. Separate benefit type cov-\ners like hospital cash (daily allowance), critical care, and overseas travel insurance have been introduced.\nLow budget health insurance schemes like Jan Arogya, Universal health insurance were introduced at the\ngovernment\u2019s behest. Nagreck Suraksha\u2014a combination of Personal Accident and Injury related hospi-\ntalization is available in the market, so is Rasta Aapati- a personal accident and road accident triggered\nhospitalization cover.\n\nHospital Cash Policies The private players, in a bid to gain entry in to the health insurance market,\ncame out with innovative products to address the growing need for increasing the options for more depth\nin coverage. One of the first Hospital Cash or Daily Allowance policies was launched in the year 2001. The\nneed for this policy was felt as the regular policy/ies did not cover the increased financial burden caused\nby hospitalization of a family member. The policy aims to provide cover against the additional expenses\nsuch as, transport, lodging and boarding, charges levied by the hospital for attending family member,\nhiring of personal attendant, etc. This cover is available as standalone cover with some companies and\nas an in-built benefit in the health insurance cover with others. It should always be taken as an addition\u2019\nextension of the regular health insurance rather than being considered as a substitute.\n\nThe policy provides for cash allowance per day ranging from %500 to %5,000 per day in case of hospi-\ntalization due to disease, illness, or injury suffered by the insured person. For this purpose hospitalization\nmeans a continuous stay in the hospital as an in-patient for 24 hours. Certain policies have provisions for\npaying twice the daily limit per day in case of admission in ICU or ICCU for a period not exceeding seven\ndays. The cover can be taken for the entire family, i.e. the proposer, spouse and dependant children in the\nage band of 3 months to 21 years.\n\nCritical Illness Covers (a) In the contemporary work environment which exerts very high stress levels\ncoupled with more materialistic lifestyle, the prevalence of lifestyle diseases is very high. We have grown\n\nmore accustomed to luxuries that offer all the comforts and overall our lives have become more sedentary.\nThe result is that India is fast becoming the world capital of Diabetes and Cardio-vascular diseases. Even\nthe cancer prevalence is very high in India.\n\nThe onset of critical illness does not come alone, i.e., medical and hospitalization expenses, but\ncan also have an adverse effect on the persons life in many ways. It can result into: (1) temporary loss\nof income; (2) reduced mobility affecting the quantum of income; (3) necessity to modify the house;\n(4) need for constant and specialized attention in certain cases. These and the other financial impli-\ncations associated with the persons ability to work as he used to before being afflicted with the life\nthreatening disease such as Heart Attack or Cancer can be suitably addressed by way of a Critical Illness\npolicy. Although these are considered life threatening, the modern medical science has been able to help\npatient survive, if treated proactively. Thus critical illness cover should be viewed as a tool by which\npeople affected get the necessary financial support to better manage their changed circumstances of\nlife.\n\nThe critical illness cover provides for a lump sum payment on the onset of the listed diseases. The\nnumber of diseases covered varies according to the market and the provider. depending upon the type\nof policy the number of diseases covered may vary from 5-35 in the policies available in the Indian\nmarket.\n\nThere also are some disease specific policies like cancer insurance, diabetes insurance, available in\nthe market. The basic critical illness policy covers the following listed diseases: (1) Cancer; (2) Coronary\nArtery Bypass Graft/Surgery; (3) First Heart Attack; (4) Kidney Failure; (5) Major Organ Transplant (as\na recipient); (6) Stroke.\n\nThe critical illness policies are sold either on standalone basis or as a rider to the Life insurance policy,\nhence, there are some basic differences in the sense that the standalone critical illness policies marketed\nby the non-life companies are single year policies whereas the plans sold by the life companies are long\nterm plans. In both the types the operative part is that the benefit under the policy accrues on the positive\ndiagnosis of the existence of the listed disease and survival following the diagnosis for a stipulated period\nwhich varies according to the plan and the provider but is usually 30 days.\n\nJan Arogya Bima Policy The Mediclaim policy was launched in the year 1986. Initially the scheme\nwas based on categories with fixed benefits under various heads. Later on the same was changed to\nSum Insured based and cover was offered from %15,000 to %3,00,000 in multiples of %5,000. It was\nargued that the premium was very high and that the weaker sections of the society could not afford such\nhigh premiums. Low levels of penetration were also attributed to this reason. The General Insurance\nCorporation of India introduced Jan Arogya Bima policy in the year 1998, a toned down version of the\nMediclaim policy.\n\nAs the scheme is based on the structure of Mediclaim, the terms, conditions and exclusions are similar\nto the basic policy. The scheme can be differentiated by its only feature which does not provide for either\nthe cumulative bonus or the free health check-up feature available under the regular Mediclaim policy.\nThe coverage is available to individual or for the entire family on the line of the basic policy. The sum\ninsured per person is limited to %5000. A very salient feature of the policy was that there was no agency\ncommission payable and the policy was intended to be sold through NGO's, government agencies, self-\nhelp groups and such other organizations. The premium for the scheme is as low as 270 for adult male or\nfemale and 250 for the dependant son/daughter up to the age of 25 years. As the scheme was supposed\nto be sold directly without intermediary and as the companies did not have the focus or will for direct\nmarketing, it did not take off as desired.\n\nCommunity-based Universal Health Insurance Scheme The scheme offers health protection\nand easy access to good health services to the weaker sections. It was announced in the Union Budget\n2003-04 and the responsibility for implementing it is given to the New India Assurance Company Ltd.\nUnder this scheme, a premium of @1 per day for an individual, 1.50 per day for a family of five\n(including the first 3 children) and %2 per day for a family of seven (including the first 3 children and\ndependent parents) will entitle eligibility to get reimbursement of medical expenses up to 30,000 towards\nhospitalization, a cover for death due to accident up to %25,000 and compensation due to loss of earning\nat the rate of 250 per day up to a maximum of 15 days after a waiting period of 3 days. For below-poverty\nline (BPL) families, the government will contribute 7100 per year towards their annual premium.\n\nMany states have recently initiated large scale health insurance programmes in association with non-\nlife insurers to protect their vulnerable groups from such health-related financial needs. Some prominent\nschemes are Rajiv Aarogyasri scheme in AP, and the centrally-sponsored Rashtriya Swasthya Bima\nYojana (RSBY) which has been launched in many states across the country.\n\nNagrik Suraksha Policy An accidental insurance cover providing compensation for accidental injuries\nand/or reimbursement of expenses incurred at hospital as a result of accidental injuries subject to limits.\nThis cover is for any citizen of India in the age group of 5 years to 70 years for family package and 18\nyears to 70 years for individual/group cover. The term for cover of individual policies range between\none year to four years and for group policies\u201412 months. The minimum sum insured is %1 lakh and\nmaximum is %5 lakhs with an option of enhancement of minimum limit of sum insured in multiples of\n%25,000/- upto a maximum of %5,00,000.\n\nPersonal Accident Policy This policy offers compensation in case of death or bodily injury to the\ninsured person, directly and solely as a result of an accident, by external, visible and violent means.\nThe policy operates worldwide and is a 24 hours cover. It provides comprehensive cover covering\ndeath, permanent disablements and temporary total disablements. Family Package cover is available to\nindividuals whereby the proposer, spouse and dependent children are covered under a single policy Group\npersonal accident policies are also available for specified groups.\n\nOverseas Medical Insurance All the health covers, which provide for the hospitalization expenses,\nare bound by the geographical limits of India. Hence, any person traveling out of India and contracting\nany illness or disease or sustains injury, can not claim under his health insurance for the expenses incurred\nout of India. To address this anomaly and looking to the increasing foreign travel undertaken by Indian\nPublic in the wake of liberalization of Indian economy, the need for overseas medical insurance was felt.\nThis policy covers medical expenses whilst traveling abroad for business/holiday/employment/studies.\nThe premium payable is in rupees and claims settled abroad are in foreign currency. As the number of\npersons traveling abroad has increased, this segment has become lucrative for the insurers.\n\nTax Benefits In order to cover a large number of people in the health insurance net, there are tax benefits\navailable under Section 80D. Medical cover premium is tax-deductible up to 715,000, with an additional\ndeduction of up to 85,000 if the policy is in the name of a senior citizen (65 years or older) and the premium\nis paid by him. If someone below 65 buys a plan for his dependents, he can avail benefit upto 715,000.\nMediclaim policies attract tax benefits under Section 80D. Deduction under this section is available if the\npremium is paid by cheque. The maximum amount of deduction available under this section is 715,000. This\nlimit stands enhanced to %20,000 in case an individual is a senior citizen. Tax benefits are also available in\ncase individuals pay for their parents and children who are dependant on them.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Conclusion\n\nHealth insurance is the fastest growing segment in the non-life insurance industry in India. The pre-\nmium from health insurance products grew from %675 crore in 2001-02 to 5,100 crore in 2007-08.\nIt is also emerging as an increasingly significant line of business for life insurance companies, and\nmany prominent life insurance companies now have health insurance products.\n\nThere is rich potential in the health insurance market. The insurance companies have been\nunable to exploit the potential of the health insurance market due to factors such as lack of awareness of\nthe need, nonviability of the stand alone health insurance businesses at 2100 crore equity, and a supply\nand demand mismatch, where quality hospitals are few on account of high infrastructure costs.\n\nThe growth of heath insurance in India is sluggish looking to its mammoth potential. Ideally, health\ninsurance should be the first thing to come to one\u2019s mind after life insurance. But it is bought only when\nit is urgently pressing. There is a general tendency of people to buy heath insurance after they reach\nmiddle age. Moreover, in an Indian family, it is usually the head of the family, or the breadwinner, or\nperson most prone to disease who is proposed for insurance or a higher sum insured. These features\nlead to the building of a skewed health portfolio instead of healthy portfolio. Besides, delay in claims\nsettlement and customer dissonance on account of exclusion of pre-existing diseases have led to cus-\ntomer reluctance in buying the product. Large amount of claims on account of inefficient underwrit-\ning have limited the number of stand-alone players in the health insurance market. The overall claims\nincidence is a whopping 6.36 per cent which is too high for health insurance. The average claim size\nis about 19,000. The incurred claims ratio is the highest among all the segments of non-life insur-\nance business. The age bracket of 41-60 years ended up with highest number of claims. The absence\nof actuarial support and credible database on health trends of sufficiently large demographic samples\ncoupled with non-standardization of healthcare costs have made it difficult to control claims costs.\nHeath insurers need to design proper pre-acceptance medical exams backed by actuarial rating to avoid\nhigh cost of claims.\n\n\nThe government is planning to substantially relax the entry norms, including paid-up capital require-\nment. The minimum capital requirement for health insurance companies is expected to be slashed from\nthe current level of 2100 crore to around 225 to 30 crore. Currently, health insurance comes under the\nscope of general insurance. A separate classification is proposed for insurance companies to distinguish\nthem from life and non-life insurance business.\n\nWith barely 3.27 crores people (less than 3per cent of the population) covered, health insurance com-\nmands a humble share in the business transacted by non-life insurers. Notwithstanding this nano-presence,\nhealth insurance has had a much larger share in associated controversies. Whether it is the pathetic service\noffered by some Third Party Administrators (TPAs) or hike in premium for higher age brackets by some\ninsurers, health insurance always tends to remain in the news. The real malaise however lies in the fact\nthat a highly regulated insurance industry is struggling against a much bigger and highly organized but\nunregulated healthcare industry. Also, the insurers have failed to promote the concept of insurance in\nright earnest and introduce products that induce people to buy health insurance at young age. However,\nwith TPAs aggressively negotiating with hospitals in an effort to ensure standard treatment protocols and\nstandardized cost structures on one hand and the expanding outreach of health insurance on the other have\nmade it a commercially viable proposition. A comprehensive healthcare regulation can increase the pace\nof growth of health insurance.\n",

This primary insurer transfers a part or all of\nthe risks he has insured to another insurer to reduce his own liability (the risk that he has assumed). This\nis known as reinsurance. Reinsurance is primarily an insurance of risks assumed by the primary insurer\nknown as the ceding company. This risk is shifted to another insurer known as the reinsurer. The ceding\ncompany may shift part or all of the insurance originally written to the reinsurer. The amount of the insur-\nance retained by the ceding company for its own account is called the retention. Retention is the amount\nof risk that an insurer is prepared to take on his own account. The amount of the insurance ceded to the\nreinsurer is known as the cession. The proportion of risk to be retained by the ceding company depends on\nfactors such as company\u2019s assets and investment income, portfolio of the risks premium levels, inflation,\nand reinsurance market conditions. Reinsurance operates on the same principle as direct insurance, i.e., to\nspread sharing of risks as widely as possible. The insurers seek protection of their own risk by reinsuring\nwith reliable reinsurers. Reinsurance evolved as a natural corollary to insurance. Reinsurance is used for\nseveral reasons:\n\n+ To increase the company\u2019s underwriting capacity which, in turn, would help to render improved\nservice to the reinsured and expand the market.\n\n* To spread the risks with as many insurers as possible.\n\n+ To obtain valuable advice and assistance with respect to pricing, underwriting practices, retention,\nand policy coverages.\n\n* To stabilise profits by leveling out peak risks/losses.\n\n+ To provide protection against catastrophic losses arising due to natural disasters, individual explo-\nsions, airline diasters and so on.\n\n+ To retire from the business or class of business or territory.\n\nThe reinsurance business assumes greater importance in the event of war and natural calamities\nwhen the smaller insurance firms find themselves unable to take on the full risk due to their lower\ncapital base.\n\nFigure 16.3 provides an overview of reinsurance.\n",

Facultative Reinsurance\n\nFacultative reinsurance is a reinsurance in which the reinsurer can accept or reject any risk presented by\nthe ceding company (insurance company seeking reinsurance). This means that it is not mandatory for\nthe reinsurer to accept the cover and he will accept it after naming his price terms and conditions. The\nreinsurer has the freedom to reject sub-standard risks if it so desires. The reinsurer retains the flexibility\n\nReineurance\n\n{\nType{ Treaty Facultative\nMethod { Proportional Non-proportional\nQuota Share \u2018Surplus Excess of Loss Stop Loss\n\u2014> Reinsurer \u2014> Reinsurer does Insurance Reinsurance\n\u2018Assumes Agreed not Participate in \u2014> Reinsurer Pays \u2014> A Rare and\nUpon, Fixed Quota all Risks Only when the Loss \u2018Comprehensive\nof all Insurance \u2014> Makes the Insurer's Exceeds the Agreed Form of Insurance\nStructure) Policies Portfolio Balanced Cover Limit \u2014> Reinsurer\n\u2014 Suitable for and Limits the \u2014\u2014 Obliged to\nNew, Developing Heaviest Exposure Cover any Part\nInsurance Companies Covers Per Covers Per of the Annual Loss\nRisk Catastrophic Burden that Exceeds\nEvent the Agreed Cover Limit\n\u2014 Suitable for Storm\nInsurance\n\nFigure 16.3 Reinsurance: Type, Method, and Structure\n\nto accept or reject each application for reinsurance. The ceding company also gets freedom in respect of\nthe portions of the risk to be reinsured and the choice of the reinsurer. Before underwriting any insur-\nance, the ceding company determines whether reinsurance can be obtained. It contacts several reinsurers\nand if a willing reinsurer is found, both (ceding company and reinsurer) enter into a valid contract. The\nceding company must disclose full information relating to the risk concerned to ensure validity of the\ncontract. Facultative insurance offers several advantages such as increasing flexibility and the under-\nwriting capacity of the ceding company. It is frequently used when a large amount of insurance is to be\nwritten. It stabilises the insurer's profits by shifting large losses to the reinsurer.\n\nHowever, it creates a sense of insecurity as the ceding company may not always be successful in insur-\ning its business. This uncertainty leads to a delay in the issue of policy. Facultative reinsurance is used\nto cover large individual risks such as car factories, large departmental stores and product liability for\npharmaceutical firms.\n\n2. Treaty Reinsurance\n\nTreaty reinsurance means the ceding company is obliged to cede and the reinsurer is obliged to accept\nan agreed share of all reinsurance of the type defined in the contract. Treaty insurance is automatic\nand certain as business that falls within the scope of the agreement is automatically reinsured, accord-\ning to the terms of the treaty. The ceding company has not to shop around for reinsurance before the\npolicy is written. This system is beneficial also to reinsurers as they are assured of a regular flow of\nbusiness. However, reinsurers could incur losses if the ceding company writes bad business or charges\ninadequate rates.\n\nReinsurance Treaties Reinsurance treaties can be of different types such as quota-share treaty, surplus-\nshare treaty, excess-of-loss treaty, and reinsurance pool.\n\nUnder a quota-share treaty, the ceding company and the reinsurer agree to share a fixed proportion of\npremium and losses. The ceding company retains, for its own account, a certain percentage of such risk.\nIn other words, the ceding company\u2019s retention limit is stated as a fixed percentage. This treaty is popular\namong new and unknown insurers.\n\nUnder a surplus-share treaty, the reinsurer agrees to accept insurance in excess of the retention with the\nceding company upto some maximum amount. The ceding company has complete discretion in respect of\nretention. The ceding companies which are financially sound can afford to have substantial retentions. The\npremiums and losses are shared based on the fraction of total insurance retained by the ceding company and\nthe reinsurer.\n\nUnder an excess-of-loss treaty, losses in excess of the retention limit are covered by the reinsurer upto\nsome maximum limit. It is a blanket agreement where all the claims made on local companies, above a\ncertain limit, are reimbursed by the reinsurers. This treaty is useful for protection against catastrophic\n\n* Treaty reinsurance\nis reinsurance of\nspecified types of risks\nthat are automatically\nceded and accepted.\n\nReinsurance Treaties\n\n* Quota-share treaty\n+ Surplus-share treaty\n* Excess-of-loss treaty\n* Reinsurance pool\n\nlosses. At the beginning of every financial year, non-life insurance companies have to renew their excess\nof loss reinsurance treaties in the international market.\n\nA reinsurance pool is a pool of reinsurers who jointly underwrite insurance as it may not be possible\nfor a single insurer alone to write large amounts of insurance. Huge exposure arise in nuclear power and\naviation which cannot be underwritten by a single insurance and reinsurance company and hence a rein-\nsurance pool reinsures the risk.\n\nBoth facultative and treaty reinsurance may be either proportional or non-proportional in type. In\nproportional reinsurance, the direct insurer, and reinsurer divide premiums and losses between them at a\npre-determined ratio. Proportional treaty insurance offers direct insurer protection against major devia-\ntions such as risk of random fluctuation, risk of change due to economic cycles, new laws and regulations,\nor social change. With non-proportional reinsurance, there is no contractually defined ratio for dividing\nlosses and premiums between the direct insurer and reinsurer. Non-proportional treaty insurance offers\ndirect insurer cover for catastrophe risk such as windstorm, earthquake and flood as well as large road,\naviation and marine accidents.\n\nThe pricing and terms and conditions of a reinsurance contract are based largely on the underwriting\ncapacity in the international market.\n\nThe two largest reinsurance companies Munich Re and Swiss Re, have combined stock market value\nof USD 50 billion (\u00a333 billion) and are seen as bell-wethers for the reinsurance industry. Munich Re has\nits presence in India through two ventures with Paramount Healthcare who are in the business of third\nparty administration and healthcare management.\n",

The Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) has the financial strength and capacity to absorb\nrisks fully. The number of life policies reinsured as well as the total sum of risk reinsured is quite\ninsignificant.\n\nThe need for reinsurance is higher in the case of general insurance as it involves complex risks. In the\npost-independence period, Indian general insurers obtained the reinsurance cover from foreign reinsur-\nance companies. This led to a drawing of foreign exchange. Hence, to maximize retention and to mini-\nmize the drain of foreign exchange, the general insurance business was nationalized.\n\nIn 2000, the outgo of premium money by way of reinsurance was around 210 billion. In order to\nincrease the retention of premia in India, the role of General Insurance Corporation of India (GIC) was\nreinforced as the official reinsurer by making an obligatory cession of 20 per cent of insurance business\nby the private insurance companies, written in India, to GIC. This percentage was reduced to 15 per cent\nfor the financial year 2007-08 and 10 per cent for 2008-09. IRDA has notified that the percentage ces-\nsions of the sum insured on each general insurance policy to be reinsured with the Indian reinsurer shall\nbe 5% in respect of insurance during the year Ist April, 2016 to 31st March, 2017 (except for government\nsponsored health insurance schemes, wherein it would be made \u2018NIL).\n\nThe IRDA has also issued regulations relating to both life and non-life reinsurance in 2000. To develop\ndomestic reinsurance market capacity, the IRDA stipulated that insurers should offer an opportunity to\nother Indian insurers to participate in facultative and treaty surpluses before placement of such cessions\noutside India.\n",

One hundred and seven insurers,\nincluding branches of foreign companies operating in India, were amalgamated and grouped into four\ncompanies, namely, The National Insurance Company Limited, The New India Assurance Company\nLimited, The Oriental Insurance Company Limited, and The United India Assurance Company Limited\nwith head offices at Calcutta, Bombay, Delhi, and Chennai. The General Insurance Corporation (GIC)\nwas incorporated as a holding company of these four general insurance companies in November 1972.\nThe Government of India subscribed to the capital of GIC which, in turn, subscribed to the capital of the\nfour companies. All the four companies are government companies registered under the Companies Act.\nThe GIC commenced business on January 1, 1973. GIC was formed for the purpose of superintending,\ncontrolling and carrying on the business of general insurance. The GIC was expected to generate com-\npetition among the four subsidiary companies. It was also entrusted to write directly the Aviation (Hull\nand Liability) insurance of the national carriers (Indian Airlines and Air India), Hindustan Aeronautics\nLimited, and the International Airport Authority of India.\n\nThe main objectives of GIC were superintending, controlling, and carrying on the business of general\ninsurance.\n\nThe functions of GIC as mentioned in the Act were as follows:\n\n+ The carrying on of any part of general insurance business as deemed desirable.\n\n+ Aiding, assisting and advising the companies in the matter of setting up of standard of conduct and\nsound practice in general insurance business and in rendering efficient customer service.\n\n+ Advising the acquiring companies in the matter of controlling the expenses including the payment\nof commission and other expenses.\n\n+ Advising the acquiring companies in the matter of investment of funds.\n\n+ Issuing directions to acquiring companies in relation to the conduct of general insurance business.\n\nIn November 2000, the government notified the General Insurance Corporation of India as the \u2018Indian\nReinsurer\u2019 under Section 101A of the Insurance Act, 1938. Insurance companies spread their risk by\nan arrangement with other underwriters or reinsurance companies known as reinsurers. The IRDA has\nprescribed that 20 per cent of the gross premium would have to be ceded compulsorily to GIC\u2014as a\nreinsurer by all insurers. GIC has turned into a full reinsurer barring crop insurance which it manages\nfor the time being on behalf of the government. GIC administers on behalf of the government, the Crop\nInsurance Scheme for areas and crops notified under it. GIC has to draw a reinsurance programme for the\nreinsurance industry every year and get it cleared by the IRDA.

The regional head office undertakes\nunderwriting, reinsurance and investment functions. The regional offices look into the administration and\nprovide support to divisional offices. The divisional offices consist of divisional managers and develop-\nment officers who also look into the training and development of agents. The divisional offices procure\nbusiness, underwrite new business, and settle claims. Under divisional offices there are branch offices,\nwhich also procure new business. This multi-layered distribution system impedes quick decision-making\nand is a major contributor to the high expense ratio. The major incentive is on premium collection and\nnot on account profitability.\n",

The life insurance contract provides\nfor the payment of an amount on the date of maturity of the contract or at specified dates at periodic\nintervals or at untimely (prematured) death. The contract also provides that the insured shall pay premium\nperiodically to the insurer.\n\nThere are five needs that life insurance can satisfy: dying young, living too long, disability, care for\nchildren, and wealth generation.\n\nLife insurance is generally a long-term contract which provides a sense of security to the assured and\nhis family. Life insurance is concerned with basically two hazards in the life of a person: that of dying\nprematurely leaving behind a dependent family and that of living to old age without financial support.\nToday, the nuclear family has replaced the joint family system, lifestyles have changed, needs and wants\nhave increased and, above all, uncertain future adversities of life have increased.

                        "extracted-text": "Life Insurance Products\n\nThere are four broad types of insurance policies to choose from\u2014endowment, money-back, whole-life,\nand term insurance.\n\n+ Endowment plan: Under this plan, insurance cover is available for a specific period or term. The\nsum assured is payable even if the assured dies during this tenure period. In other words, the sum\nassured together with bonus is payable on the date of maturity or in the event of the death of the\ninsured, whichever is earlier. The endowment policies are the most popular of all the life policies not\nonly in India but world over they are perceived as savings instrument.\n\n+ Money-back policies: Money-back policies are also popular in India. Under this policy, the sum\nassured is returned as lumpsum after defined intervals of time. In other words, the assured receives a\nfixed sum at fixed intervals during the term of the policy. Both endowment and moneyback policies\nare by far the most expensive products.\n\n+ Whole-life policy: As the name suggests, it covers risk for whole life and is an insurance cover\n\nagainst death. It primarily caters to protection of a policyholder\u2019s entire life. The policyholder pays\n\npremium throughout his life and on his death, the money is handed over to his family. This policy\nis not so popular as it does not take into consideration the increasing needs of the insurer during his\npost-retirement years. Moreover, the cost of insurance is higher. For instance, the annual premium is\n\n%3,000 per annum for a sum assured of %1 lakh. To balance this high cost, insurance firms combine\n\nthis policy with other types of policies.\n\nTerm insurance policy: Term Insurance is a pure risk product. This policy is like a whole-life policy\n\nbut offers risk cover for defined periods. This policy comes at a very low premium as the sum assured\n\nis payable only if the policyholder dies within the policy term. If he survives, he is not entitled to\nany payment on maturity, irrespective of premium payments made earlier. In case of term insurance,\nreserves are not accumulated and the premium is meant for offering protection alone. Therefore, the\nproduct offers high cover on payment of a small premium. Typically, the premium ranges between\n2250 to 7500 annually for a term policy of 21 lakh.\n\nTerm insurance is the cheapest form of insurance. A term policy is taken either by young people as a\nlife cover or as a security of their family against a long-term outstanding loan. This policy is not popu-\nlar among investors as there are no maturity benefits available on survival until the end of the term. To\nincrease its popularity, some private sector life insurers are offering a variant of the plain-vanilla term\ninsurance policy called \u2018premium-back term insurance\u2019. As the name suggests, at the end of the term, the\ninsured gets back in full whatever premiums he has paid. However, this policy carries higher premiums\nthan simple term insurance plan.\n\nThe life insurers now offer money-back options, pension plans, and unit-linked insurance, often with health\ninsurance riders with premium collected through either lumpsum payments or in multiple instalments.\n\nUnit-linked Insurance Policies These policies are becoming increasingly popular. Unit-linked\npolicies are those where part of the premium is invested in a fund (similar to a mutual fund) and the return\nis linked to the performance of the fund. The investors are given a choice of three funds\u2014a debt fund,\na balanced fund, and an equity fund for investment. Unit-linked plans are more flexible and transparent\ncompared to traditional insurance plans. Combining the protection and tax advantages of life insurance\nwith the prospect of investing in securities, unit-linked plans dominate a large chunk of the insurance\ncompanies\u2019 portfolio. Unit-linked products are sold both under the individual single premium and non-\nsingle premium segments. Some common types of funds available in ULIPs are Bond Fund, Protector\nFund, Secure Fund, Balanced Fund, Growth Fund, Index Fund, and Enhancer Fund. The choice of the\nfund depends on the risk appetite of the investor as the risk is to be borne by the investor. The investor\nalso has to bear certain charges such as premium allocation charges, mortality charges, fund management\ncharges, policy/administration charges, surrender charges, fund switching charges, and service tax.\n\nUnit linked insurance policies are like mutual funds. When you pay the premium, the company after\ndeducting stipulated charges, invests the amount in stock market instruments like equity and debenture.\nHere also the investors are given the choice whether they prefer to go for high risk (more investment in\nequity), medium risk and low risk. Thus, the major benefits to investors in ULIP is to have the benefit of\nappreciation of the investment, benefits of tax rebate as provided under section 80CC of the IT Act and above\nall, a life cover. Insurance companies are required to declare the NAV of various ULIPs on a daily basis.\n\nThere has been a surge in the demand for ULIPs on account of varied benefits such as flexibility to\nchoose sum assured and premium amount, option to change level of premium and asset allocation by\nswitching between funds, transparency in the net amount invested, tracking of investment performance\non a daily basis and option to withdraw money after five years.\n\n\nDespite the growing popularity of ULIPs, policy holders rely heavily on the advice rendered by the dis-\ntributors and agents. The complicated design of the policies makes them less aware of the product features\nand chances of mis-selling by agents are high. Agents withhold certain information that causes the most dam-\nage. They do not tell the buyer that if he exercises the option to stop paying premium after a few years, the rate\nof return will fall on account of high front loading charges in the initial three to four years of the policy and\nthe investor will get his money after deduction of all charges only after five years. Investor needs to stay long-\nterm to reap the benefits. To protect the interest of the customers, IRDA has taken the following initiatives:\n\n* Lock in period increased to five years: IRDA has increased the lock-in period for all unit-linked\nproducts from three years to five years, including top-up premiums, thereby making them long-term\nfinancial instruments, which basically provide risk protection.\n\nLevel paying premiums: Further, all regular premiumy/limited premium ULIPs shall have uniform/\n\nlevel paying premiums. Any additional payments shall be treated as single premium for the purpose\n\nof insurance cover.\n\n* Even distribution of charges: Charges on ULIPs are mandated to be evenly distributed during the\nlock in period to ensure that high front ending of expenses is eliminated.\n\n+ Minimum premium paying term of five years: All limited premium unit-linked insurance prod-\nucts, other than single premium products shall have premium paying term of at least five years.\n\n* Increase in risk component: Further, all unit-linked products, other than pension and annuity prod-\nucts shall provide a mortality cover or a health cover thereby increasing the risk cover component\nin such products.\n\n+ Minimum guaranteed return for pension products: As regards pension products, all ULIP pen-\nsion/annuity products shall offer a minimum guaranteed return of 4.5 per cent per annum or as\nspecified by IRDA from time to time. This will protect the life time savings for the pensioners from\nany adverse fluctuations at the time of maturity.\n\n+ Rationalization of cap on charges: With a view to smoothening the cap on charges, the capping\nhas been rationalized to ensure that the difference in yield is capped from the Sth year onwards. This\nwill not only reduce the overall charges on these products, but also smoothen the charge structure\nfor the policyholder.\n\n* Discontinuance of charges: IRDA has also addressed the issue of discontinuance of charges\nfor surrender of ULIPs. The IRDA (Treatment of Discontinued-Linked Insurance Policies)\nregulations brought out by IRDA in this regard ensure that policyholders do not get overcharged\nwhen they wish to discontinue their policies for any emergency cash requirement. The regula-\ntions stipulate that an insurer shall recover only the incurred acquisition costs in the event of\ndiscontinuance of policy and that these charges are not excessive. The discontinuance charges\nhave been capped both as percentage of fund value and premium and also in absolute value. The\nregulations also clearly define the grace period for different modes of premium payment. Upon\ndiscontinuance of a policy, a policyholder shall be entitled to exercise an option of either reviving\nthe policy or completely withdrawing from the policy without any risk cover. Further, the regula-\ntions also enable IRDA to order refund of discontinuance charges in case they are found excessive\non enquiry.\n\nGroup Insurance Policies Individual life insurance business is divided into three main business\nsegments\u2014individual regular business, single premium business, and individual pension business.\nThe group insurance segment mainly comprises of regular group insurance, corporate gratuity and\nsuperannuation plans. Regular group insurance policies cover groups of people such as employees in\na firm. Corporates purchase these policies to cover their employees. These policies are popular as the\npremium per employee turns out to be low. The group gratuity and superannuation plans are a result of\nstatutory obligation.\n",

They are:\n\nBajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company Limited\n\nBirla Sun-Life Insurance Company Limited\n\nHDFC Standard Life Insurance Company Limited\n\nICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company Limited\n\nING Vysya Life Insurance Company Limited\n\nMax New York Life Insurance Company Limited\nMetlife India Insurance Company Pvt.Limited\n\nKotak Mahindra Old Mutual Life Insurance Limited\nSBI Life Insurance Company Limited\n\nTATA AIG Life Insurance Company Limited\n\nReliance Life Insurance Company Limited\n\nAviva Life Insurance Company Limited\n\nSahara India Life Insurance Company Limited\n\nShriram Life Insurance Company Limited\n\nBharti AXA Life Insurance Company Limited\n\nFuture Generali India Life Insurance Company Limited\nIDBI Fortis Life Insurance Company Limited\n\nCanara HSBC Oriental Bank Of Commerce Life Insurance Company Limited\nAegon Religare Life Insurance Company Limited\n\nDLF Pramerica Life Insurance Company Limited\n\nStar Union Dai-ichi Life.\n\nIndia First Life Insurance Company Limited\n\nThe Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), which had a monopolistic control over the market,\nfaced a stiff competition from the new entrants. Competition led to the adoption of distinct marketing\nstrategies and alternative distribution channels.\n\nAmong the private sector players, ICICI Prudential is the market leader. ICICT\u2019s success is driven by\naggressive distribution, leveraging existing customer base, and detailed implementation planning. All\nnew entrants have expanded rapidly and have presence in about all cities across the country, represented\nby more than 13 lakh agents, They have introduced a large number of new products and collectively spent\nabout 2200 crore on advertising.\n\nTo compete and survive in this highly competitive environment, insurers are offering insurance solu-\ntions which are customized to match with individual needs. In order to provide better services to the\ncustomers, the insurers have set up national level call centres, interactive voice response systems and web-\nsites that provide interactive tools to help customers to plan their needs. To increase their reach, insurers\nhave tapped alternative distribution channels such as tie-ups with banks and retail giants like Shoppers\u2019\nStop. Insurers are also using their existing customer database and database of the distributors to cross-sell\nthe products. These strategies have increased customer awareness of insurance which has led to a growth\nin the life insurance business.\n\nThere is a large market for insurance untapped in rural areas. With 74 per cent of India\u2019s population\nliving in rural areas and contributing 40 per cent to national income, insurance companies are looking\nat rural markets as an opportunity rather than obligation. The private sector life insurance companies\nare designing innovative insurance products and marketing strategies for the rural market. Many of the\ncompanies have tied up with non-government organization and social activists agencies for promoting\nand distributing their products.\n\nThe private sector life insurance companies have been a in a position to capture around 30 per cent of the\nmarket share in a short span of twelve years. This reflects that they have succeeded in building faith among the\nIndian investors. Moreover, their success is also due to smart pricing and tailor-made design of the products.\n\nPrivate life insurance companies have brought in robust risk management and fund management practices.\n\nWith the entry of new players, the monolith LIC was forced to adopt better marketing strategies.\nIn fact, LIC\u2019s business grew tremendously after deregulation of the insurance sector. It could further\nstrengthen its brand equity inspite of the entry of some reputed private sector players. LIC has adopted a\nmarket savvy approach and introduced new products and policies. LIC has to aggressively explore new\nuntapped markets to meet the challenge of private sector players.\n\nThe IRDA has made it compulsory for life insurers to provide premium rates with a facility of a pre-\nmium calculator on their websites.

                        "extracted-text": "Changing Trends in Life Insurance\n\nInsurance contracts in India are typically sold rather than bought. Before deregulation, life insurance\npolicies were sold as tax-saving products by LIC. Insurance purchase decision was driven by a shortterm\n\n\nmotive to invest a small sum as premium to reduce tax liability. The two most popular products of LIC were\nEndowment and Money-Back Policies\u2014the saving products. They dominated the Indian insurance market,\naccounting for nearly 99.5 per cent of the policies sold and nearly 99.9 per cent of the premium income\nbefore deregulation. The mindset of the Indian consumer is changing. The Indian consumer no longer views\ninsurance as a tax-benefit induced exercise. This change has been due to the following reasons:\n\n+ The efforts of the private sector players who could successfully create an awareness that the primary\nfocus for any insurance cover is protection, savings is only a spin-off benefit. The entry of private\nsector companies has brought about a paradigm shift in the definition of the word insurance.\n\n+ A substantial drop in insurance prices, which created a preference for insurance products. Moreover,\nconsumers have realised that there are several options for deploying savings but there is no substi-\ntute for life insurance as a means of protection.\n\nThis changing trend has led to an increase in demand for insurance products which offer protection.\nThe insurance companies are aggressively marketing whole life and term plans.\n\nAnother trend is an increase in the awareness about purchasing the correct amount of risk cover com-\nmensurate with one\u2019s age, income, and profile. This has led to an increase in the size of the policy. Before\nderegulation, the policy sizes were restricted to the premium levels under which one would receive tax\nbenefits. Life insurance companies are offering tailor-made products to suit the differing needs of the con-\nsumers. Life insurance products are designed to adjust protection levels within the same policy. Moreover,\nthese companies are providing the clients with innovative, flexible, and attractive riders. Joint ventures\nwith renowned foreign insurance companies have provided an added advantage in product innovation.\n\nAfter opening up of the insurance sector, Unit-linked insurance policies (ULIPs) have become increas-\ningly popular but there has been a decline in ULIPs since 2010-11 due to sluggish market condition and\nhigh misselling of the product.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Maintenance of Solvency Margins of Insurers\n\nLife insurers are custodians and managers of investments of individuals. Every life insurer is required to\nmaintain an excess of value of its assets over the amount of its liabilities of not less than %50 crore (100\ncrore in the case of a reinsurer) or a sum equivalent based on a prescribed formula; as determined by\nregulations not exceeding 5 per cent of the mathematical reserves and a percentage not exceeding one per\ncent of the sum at risk for the policies on which the sum at risk is not negative, whichever isthe highest.\n\nBox 16.2 \u2018Human Life Value\u2019\u2014A Tool to Know Your Worth\n\nThe first thought that comes in mind to provide financial security for our family is life Insurance. Life insurance is the most ef-\nficient way of furnishing security & it offers people methods of achieving economic security. But, how much your family needs in\nyour absence would is a question, which you find difficult to answer. While there are several ways to arrive at the right amount of\ncover you need to provide the financial security to your family, the most efficient way is through calculating \u2018Human Life Value\u2019.\n\nHuman Life Value (HLV) is a methodology to determine the appropriate amount of sum assured you need to have at present in case of\nfuture loss of income. In simple words, itis that amount, which can ensure that the standard of living of the family is not affected even if the\nearning member is not there. HLV calculation is a tool that is used very effectively for financial planning around the world. It is a systematic\nway of understanding the gaps in the financial planning.\n\nHow do you determine your Human Life Value? Human Life Value is determined by three main factors:\n\n1. Your age\n\n2. Current and future expenses.\n\n3. Current and future income\n\nHow to Calculate:\n\nApproach 1: This approach focuses on income of the individual and family while arriving at the HLV. This approach is based on the simple\nreasoning that the value of one\u2019s life is equal to his earning capacity. In the event of death of the breadwinner in a family, it is the current\nas well as prospective income of the family member which is the real financial loss to the family. Hence the sum insured should take care of\nloss of income rather than anything else.\n\nLet see an example, where HLV is calculated for Mr Vivek Rao based on the present needs and income. Mr Vivek Rao aged 41 years has\nan annual income of 810 lakhs, spends 83 lakhs on his personal expenses (including Taxes). He has Fixed Deposits of 86 lakhs. He also has\na loan of 710 lakhs and plans to spend %10 lakhs each on his son\u2019s education and his daughter's marriage. His human life value will be as\nfollows:\n\n\nAnnual Gross Income 10,00,000\nLess Expense on Self including taxes 300,000\nContribution to Family Standard of Living 700,000\nMultiplying factor 15\nGross Human Life Value 1,05,00,000\nLess Liquid Assets 600,000\nAdd Liabilities 1,000,000\nAdd Amount to fulfill family needs like daughter's marriage & son's education 2,000,000\nHuman Life Value 1,29,00,000\n\nExpenditure on self-maintenance is 1/3 of gross income for people. This also includes varying tax liabilities. Liquid assets would be\navailable to the family in the event of the death of the breadwinner. It does not include the value of other assets like property or jewellery\nsince it is assumed that the family would continue using these assets.\n\nA fixed multiplier is applied on the annual income. Multipliers based on the age of the individual are given in the table below:\n\nAge Multiplying Factor\nUpto 35 years 25 times\n36 to 40 Years 20 times\n41 to 45 years 15 times\n46 to 50 years 12 Times\n51 to 60 years 10 Times\n61 to 65 years 5 Times\n\nThe multiplying factors given above are just thumb rules. Ideally they are supposed to reflect the \u201cworking life\u2019 of the individual at the\ntime of taking insurance. In order to customise HLV the age at which one would like to retire has to be fixed. The multiplier may be worked\nout accordingly.\n\n2: The basic flaw with the income approach is that because it focuses on income the sum insured works out to be too high.\nTaking insurance for such a high HLV may become expensive and unaffordable at times.\n\nAn alternative and perhaps a more logical approach is the expenditure approach. Insurance is ideally supposed to put the insured fam-\nly in the same position as they were before the unfortunate event of death. This can be done more properly if the underlying variable is\nexpenditure and not income.\n\nMoreover, expenditure is something which needs to be incurred over a period of time and not at a time and hence the proceeds of life\ninsurance should ideally provide enough capital to the family that yields a risk free return that is sufficient to defray expenses at a given\nstandard of living. The objective here is to ensure that family sustains at the same standard of living.\n\nThe following steps may be exercised:\n\n1, Calculate the annual expenditure on the family which is required to maintain their current standard of living.\n\n2. Add expenses like expenses on children\u2019s education and marriage to this amount.\n\n3. Ifthe period for which insurance is planned is more than 10 years, the expenditure amount has to be suitably adjusted for inflation.\nThe annual expense figure which is based on current prices need to be loaded to the extent of inflation. Instead of loading it for 15\nor 20 years it may be loaded for 10 years only. This is because loading it for 20 years would result in a very high figure and secondly\nthe peak of an individual's financial responsibility curve would be attained in next 10 years. After this the curve would anyway start\n\ndeclining.\n4 Estimate the risk free rate of return into which the life insurance proceeds would be invested by the family.\n\nExample:\n\nAnnual household expenditure including loan instalments 240,000\nExpenses on higher education for children 10,00,000\nRisk free rate of return 8%\nAmount that will yield a return equivalent to annual household expenditure. 30,00,000\n\u2018Add education expenses 10,00,000\nHLV 40,00,000\n\nThe Human Life Value is just indicative and a starting point in reference to a person\u2019s current ability to set aside money for him and his family\u2019s\nfuture financial security. There are ready calculators available for calculating the HLV based on current and future income and expenses as well.\n\u2018Once a prospect is convinced with the amount, he can choose various life insurance plans for covering yourself.\n\n\nIn addition, at the time of registration all the new insurers have been required to maintain a solvency\nratio of 1.5 times the normal requirements. All life insurers comply with the stipulated solvency ratio\nof 1.5.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "THE LIFE INSURANCE INDUSTRY\n\n\u2018There are 24 players in the life insurance industry\u2014one public sector (LIC) and the remaining twenty three are\nprivate sector players. The LIC is the largest insurer followed by ICICI Prudential Life Insurance and SBI Life.\n\n\u2018New business premium for the industry as a whole was around %1,07,362 crore during 2012-13 as compared\nto %1,13,942 crore during 2011-12. Life Insurance Corporation\u2019s market share increased to 73 per cent while\nthe markets have of private players declined marginally from 29.32 per cent in 2011-12 to 27.30 per cnet in\n2012-13.\n\nThe size of the life insurance market has grown over the thirteen years of opening up of the sector.\nThe growth of the life insurance industry in India was the fastest in the world in 2006. The industry\ngrowth rate was a remarkable high of 163 per cent during 2006. The individual single premium seg-\nment was the dominant accounting for 60 per cent of the new business growth. The unit-linked insur-\nance plans were a hot favourite among investors. Investors chose growth plans which invest in equity\nfollowed by balanced funds which invest in mix of equity and debt. The size of the life insurance mar-\nket increased on the strength of the growth of the economy, increase in per capita income and buoyant\nstock markets.\n\nLIC\u2019s performance was record breaking (184 per cent) in 2006 which pushed the industry's growth\nrate to 163 per cent. The life insurance business (measured in the context of first year premium) regis-\ntered a decline of 5.78 per cent in 2012-13, (94.96 per cent achieved in 2006-07). Insurance penetra-\ntion or premium volume as a ratio of GDP, for the year 2012 stood at 3.17 per cent for life insurance\nand 0.78 per cent for non-life insurance. Private insurers have improved their market share from 18.10\nper cent in 2006-07 to 30 per cent in 2012-13 in the total premium collected during the year.\n\nThere has been a shift in favour of pension products and an increase in the renewal premium. This\nreflects quality of business underwritten by the insurers and an increase in persistency ratio which, in turn,\nenables insurers to bring down the overall cost of doing business.\n\nMajority of the private sector players have not been able to report profits as this industry is capital\nintensive in nature. Insurers are required to inject capital at frequent intervals to achieve growth in pre-\nmium incomes. Moreover, high commission charges, training costs, maintaining the solvency margin\nand other costs eat up the revenues generated. During 2012-13, sixteen of the private sector companies\nreported net profits. The SBI Life insurance company was the first private company to report net profit\nof %2.02 crore in 2005-06. It reported higher net profit of 23.83 crore in 2006-07 and further increased\nits net profit level to 234.38 crore in 2007-08. The company succeeded in achieving an early break even\non account of its lower cost of operations due to the large network of its Indian partner, the State Bank\nof India. SBI Life has reported profits for 7 out of last 8 years. Bajaj Allianz has reported profits for four\nyears in a row.\n\nThe growth in life insurance industry in India gained momentum with the entry of new players. Rather\nthan taking away the market share of the existing public sector player, the private sector players have\nhelped expand this market by aggressive marketing and new product offerings. But the industry focus has\nbeen largely on \u2018selling\u2019 insurance rather than creating a risk management culture amongst individuals.\nThis is also why the share of insurance in overall GDP is a frugal 4.0 per cent for life insurance and 0.6 for\nnon-life insurance. The outreach of insurance is equally modest at 20 per cent of the insurable population\nin case of life and just around one per cent for health insurance.\n\nWhile the basic premise governing life insurance is risk coverage, an additional feature of savings\nhas traditionally accompanied insurance. In order to stimulate long-term savings with insurance, tax\nconcessions were made an integral part of life insurance. Due to this, the limited returns on life insur-\nance policies appeared lucrative in comparison to other investments like bank deposits, because of the\ntax breaks. However, post liberalization with more and more productive investment channels opening\nup for the retail investor, many of them with equivalent tax benefits, endowment products have lost\ntheir shine off-late.\n\nThe changing investment profile in the country gave birth to the concept of Unit Linked Insurance\nPlans (ULIPs). These new generation insurance products combine the modern high risk high return\ninvestment objectives with insurance. Accordingly, a part of the premium (known as mortality pre-\nmium) is charged for the risk cover and the rest is invested in select mutual funds as per the choice of\nthe investor. While ULIPs offer transparency, flexibility, and liquidity\u2014something that was missing in\nendowment products\u2014certain issues like inadequate disclosure of charges, posing them as short-term\ninvestment options, encouraging non-payment of premiums after few initial instalments have tended\nto undermine the vitality of these innovative products. Moreover, the mutual fund industry response to\nthe needs of retail investors through simple, transparent and cost effective mechanisms like Systematic\nInvestment Plans (SIPs) have given a stiff alternative to ULIPs. The aggressive selling of ULIPs by\ninsurers often without regard to the basic tenets of insurance and investing, prompted the insurance\nregulator (IRDA) to issue stringent guidelines on ULIPs in December 2005. Since then, things appear\nto have fairly stabilized.\n\n\nWhether ULIPs or endowment policies, life insurance has been sold more as an investment tool rather\nthan a crucial risk transfer mechanism. This blend of risk (protection) and return (investment) has not\nquite worked in favour of the layman insured investor. What is expected from the insurance industry in the\nyears to come is a more cohesive effort in expanding the outreach of insurance per-se and not the spurious\nmessage of protecting life as well as offering high return on investment.\n\nThe life insurance sector has been facing some turmoil since last few years. The premium growth at\nthe industry level has been chequered. On the other hand life insurance penetration in India remains at a\ndismal 3.17 and has in fact slipped over the past few years. Thus while a large untapped potential remains\nto be covered by the life insurance industry, the growth has already slowed down.\n\nThe problems with the life insurance sector are manifold. Aggressive selling of investment oriented\nproducts that could not generate adequate returns has resulted in large scale lapsation of life insur-\nance policies resulting in declining persistency ratios of insurers. This coupled with a slowdown of the\noverall economy and declining new business has slowed down the overall business growth. Profitabil-\nity of life insurers also remains erratic. Regulatory interventions and reducing access to fresh capital\nhas finally brought back bottom line focus in the industry but it will take a while before the adjusted\nbusiness models begin to show concrete impact on growth and profitability of the life insurance\nsector.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "MICRO INSURANCE\n\nThe use of insurance as a cover on risks is very poor in India. Even after the entry of private companies in\nthe insurance market, though one sees some improvement in the share of insurance in the overall GDP, the\nnumber of policies taken on life and health is low looking to the insurable population of India. In fact, the\nfocus of marketing insurance products has always been prosperous individuals in case of life and industry\nfor the non-life sector. Very little effort is made to reach the large low income population, particularly in\nthe rural areas.\n\nThe poor have greater risks of life, income and the standard of living than that of the rich. Due to\nabsence of savings, these risks can push families to poverty and indebtedness. A death of a breadwinner\nor an illness in a poor family is a much severe blow to the family as compared to a rich family. Insurance\nprovides financial support to individuals and families in such times which happen rarely but are very hard\nblows to low-income families. So looking at it from a social security point of view, the families that need\ninsurance the most are often least served.\n\nMicro insurance tries to find answers to the above questions. It aims at building mechanisms for insur-\ning the poor against various risks.\n\nMicro insurance is the insurance provided through the Micro insurance products which includes \u201cgen-\neral micro-insurance product\u201d. General micro insurance products cover health insurance contract, any\ncontract covering the belongings, such as hut, livestock or tools or instruments or any personal accident\ncontract, either on individual or group basis with a maximum amount of cover as rupees one lakh and\nminimum and maximum term cover of one year.\n\nMicro Insurance Products A micro insurance product is an insurance policy with a small sum insured\nand low premium. It is designed to reduce the fundamental risks of life, living and livelihood.\n\nRisk Product (Kind of Policy)\n\nLife Term Life Insurance, Accidental Death Insurance\n\nLiving Heath Insurance, Catastrophe (Sudden Calamity)\nInsurance\n\nLivelinoods \u2014_ Asset Insurance, Weather Insurance\n\nThe essential feature of an ideal micro insurance product that makes it successful is the right balance\nbetween insurability (capacity to take a policy) and saleability (possibility on the insurer's side to offer it).\nConsideration of risk involves frequency and severity. Frequency means the probability of risk arising at\nindividual level. Higher the frequency of risk, higher will be the response to the product. That is because\npeople always like protection against the risks that strike frequently. But its insurability will be reduced\nby higher frequency as claims-processing costs will increase. And that would increase premium. A high\npremium will act as a disincentive for people, who will in turn prefer not to buy insurance. This will result\n\nin insured people having to pay a higher premium. And if the frequency is too low, but the risk is high\nand insurable, people will hardly find insurance against such risk worth buying. In nutshell, the frequency\nhas to be high enough to be credible but low enough to keep claims processing costs within reasonable\nlimits.\n\nSeverity is the likely size of the loss. It is derived from expected losses of the group likely to buy a policy.\nIn simple terms, it is the average (mean) of losses suffered by members of a common group divided by the\nexpected number of members of the group. In addition to expected losses, the variability (standard deviation)\naround the mean also plays a role in arriving at the severity factor. In fact, variability in a loss distribution is the\nreal \u2018risk\u2019. It is because one has to assume that expected losses would occur in the long run. Expected losses\nand their deviation would provide the Probable Maximum Loss (PML) of loss distribution that is the severity\nfactor. High-severity risks (like flood, earthquake, etc) are bound to incite interest among the people and thus\nresult in high saleability. Very high probable maximum loss is likely to affect insurability. Thus while the severity\nof risk has to be sufficiently threatening for the people, it has to be low enough to keep PML within limits to be\ninsurable.\n\nIn order to see an impact on the risk profile of an insured population, it is necessary to see that the\nmicro insurance product is durable. Insurance, as a risk distribution tool, is useful only if pursued for a\nlong term. Too much activity, with insured persons moving in and out, will not only prevent impact on\nthe risk profile of the community but also make the product volatile. Thus a sustainable micro insurance\nprogramme presupposes the existence of an optimally priced product with frequency and severity factors\ncarefully balanced. If the risks covered do not naturally fall within the limits discussed above, they have\nto be manually adjusted through underwriting and marketing interventions.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Micro Insurance Distribution\n\nThe role of intermediary in micro insurance is much wider. The focus here is the community, not an indi-\nvidual. So it is essential to have very good ability to manage community risk and educate the masses on\nthe concept and benefits of insurance. The various functions performed by an intermediary (deliverer) are:\n\n(i Risk Identification and Assessment _ Identification and assessment of risk is the key starting point\ntoa sustainable micro insurance programme. The risks faced by the poor are diverse and vary according\nto the geographical and demographic profiles. Apart from this, affordability is the biggest deterrent.\nHence, proper risk assessment is a pre-requisite to the development of a balanced and sustainable\ninsurance product. For this, the experience of an intermediary is vital. The intermediary in order to\nperform this function should have good understanding of social and economic factors surrounding the\nmasses.\n\n(ii) Education and Awareness _ Insurance is always sold never bought. The concept of insurance as a\nrisk-transfer tool has yet to be understood by the affluent segment. The task of the intermediary becomes\nmore difficult with micro insurance. This calls for a concerted effort in educating the masses on the\nconcept as well as the benefits. Popularising the concept of insurance is necessary to ensure success in the\nform of large enrolment among the people.\n\nGi) Enrolment This is one of the conventional roles of an intermediary. Proper enrolment of the insured into\nthe programme involves accurate documentation of relevant details about the insured and delivery of policy\ndocuments. This stage marks the beginning of the relationship with the insured and thus warrants due care.\n\n(iv) Controlling Adverse Section and Moral Hazard Underwriting forms the crux of insurance\nbusiness. Underwriting is the process of selecting, classifying and rating (pricing) risk in consonance with\nthe insurance coverage offered. Intermediaries are field underwriters and thus in a better position to take\nnotice of instances of adverse selection and moral hazard. Adverse selection refers to a situation where\npeople with higher expected losses enter the insured population. It is either not possible or too costly for the\ninsurers to identify such clients a priori. For example, a person having blood pressure or diabetes taking a\nhealth insurance policy. Moral hazard is phenomenon whereby having insured a property, the insured lacks\nthe incentive to reduce his expected losses despite having some control over them. For example an insured\nnot caring to lock his vehicle because the insurer is going to pay for the loss in the event of a theft. The\ndeliverer\u2019s role is to try to control both these features at the field level itself. They are gatekeepers for insurers.\nIt is they who decide whether to accept the insurance proposal, on what terms and conditions and at what\nprice.\n\n(v) Marketing The intermediary needs distinct skills to market micro insurance products. He needs to\nbuild up confidence in the poor by making them aware of the ground-level realities. For doing this, he has\nto develop a credible image of himself and the system.\n\n(vi) Claim Servicing This again is a conventional role of the intermediary. It includes collecting claim\ndocuments in time, explaining the basis of claims settlement and payment of claims. The intermediary can\nreduce the time and effort in claim servicing if he clarifies the claim settlement process during earlier stages.\n\nIt is clear from the role defined above that service delivery function in micro insurance calls for an\nintermediary with multi-faceted traits. He should have a strong link with masses especially rural and poor\npopulation, sound administrative capability, strong understanding of the principles and practice of risk\nmanagement and insurance, and a long-term commitment.\n\nMicro insurance aims at improving the risk profile of the community. Hence it is essential for the inter-\nmediary to focus on various risks faced by the masses and offer solutions in terms of insurance products.\nThese functions put together involve a sizeable transaction cost in the entire delivery process. And cost\nrecovery is often a major irritant in micro insurance delivery. In most cases, this is possible only after a\ngestation period of about three to five years. This calls for very careful financial planning by the interme-\ndiary before initiating a micro insurance programme.\n\nMicro Insurance Delivery Models The micro insurance movement begun by Non-Governmental\nOrganizations (NGOs), Micro-Finance Institutions (MFIs) and Community-based Organizations (CBOs)\nmay not have taken off in a big way but has definitely made a serious attempt in increasing the spread of\ninsurance in the country.\n\nIn India, following distribution models have emerged in the evolution of micro insurance (Figure 16.6):\n\n(i) Partner-Agent Model Among the distribution models in micro-insurance, this is the common\ninsurance delivery model where the intermediary merely acts as a product-deliverer. Here, the insurance\ncompany bears the risk and the NGO acts as an agent . This model is useful for delivering simple insurance\nproducts like term life insurance. Examples of the partner-agent model in India include Shepherd and\nUnited India Insurance Company, and Karuna Trust and National Insurance Company.\n\nGi) Community-based/Mutual Model This is a self-insurance scheme where the community itself\npools the contributions and acts as an insurer. Members/clients are both the insured and the insurers as\nthe group is involved both in management and underwriting the risk collectively. This is particularly\nhelpfal in managing low severity risks like primary healthcare. People\u2019s Rural Health Promotion Scheme\n(PRHPS) introduced by People\u2019s Rural Education Movement (PREM) in Orissa, Arthik Samata Mandal-\nVijaywada,, Yashaswini Health Farmer Scheme introduced by the Karnataka Government are successful\ncommunity-based models.\n\nGi) Full-service Model This model has a much wider role for the intermediary. The insurer simply\ncarries the risk and all the remaining functions including claims-processing are taken up by the deliverer.\nThis model is useful for complicated and service intensive covers like health and weather insurance. Vimo\nSEWA is an integrated insurance program aiming to provide social protection for SEWA members to\ncover their life cycle needs and the various risks they face in their lives, through an insurance organization\nin which they themselves are users, owners and managers of all services. It offers three different integrated\ninsurance packages, which include coverage for death, sickness, and loss of assets. The three packages\nhave varying levels of premium and corresponding sums insured.\n\n(iv) Provider-driven Model This is the new addition in the micro insurance space. It aims at integrating\nservices like healthcare with insurance. The healthcare provider assumes the risk thereby eliminating a\ntier in the value chain. Service providers like hospitals who are anyway involved in the service-delivery\nchain, integrate themselves fully by assuming the risk themselves.\n\nThese models have a good potential in health insurance.\n",

In 1992 it extended its opera-\ntions to Andhra Pradesh and in 2004 to Tamil Nadu, Jharkhands, and Chhattisgarh.\n\nThe primary objectives of PREM\u2019s development programmes are to spread education, improve healthcare, and implement livelihood and\ngood governance initiatives among marginalized communities. Through PREM\u2019s direct intervention approximately 1,350,000 people in\n6,500 communities have benefitted from a wide range of development initiatives.\n\nPREM, with its network partnership of 152 independent voluntary and people's organizations, reaches more than 5,000,000 people in\n23 districts of Orissa through various developmental programmes and campaigns Traditionally Adivasi, Dalit and fisher people are socially\nexcluded in Orissa. Poverty, lack of awareness, and non-availability of facilities has resulted in non-accessibility of healthcare for such\nmarginalized communities.\n\nThis has left members of the communities vulnerable to ill health and diseases such as malaria, which is endemic to parts of PREM\u2019s proj-\nect area (and affects approximately 35per cent of the project population). Historically, infant and maternal mortality rates have been high\ndue to a lack of pre-natal and delivery services, while TB, Sickle Cell anaemia, and water-borne diseases, such as diarrhoea and typhoid, are\nmajor health hazards among the Adivasi and Dalit people.\n\nPREM's experience in providing referral medical care to approximately 10,000 foster children, along with their siblings and family members,\nbetween 1996 and 2001 provided the organization with critical data on annual healthcare need and expenditure among its project population and\nenabled it to develop a vision for the wide-scale provision of healthcare facilities and services The challenge for the organization was to provide\nmedical care in inaccessible areas and at the same time raise funds to support the treatment. In addressing this challenge PREM took the initiative\nto launch an experimental and innovative micro-insurance health scheme through village committees, called the People\u2019s Rural Health Promotion\n\u2018Scheme (PRHPS). The approach to operating the scheme was based on collecting a small annual premium fee from each and every member of the\nproject population and use the collected funds to provide necessary healthcare.\n\nA three-tier delivery system was formulated to provide healthcare in each village, at local Public Health Centres and, in referral cases, at\ndistrict hospitals, medical colleges and private nursing homes as per necessity.\n\nThe pilot project was initiated in 500 villages with a target membership of 100,000 people, with each person, including chil-\ndren, paying %20 per for annual membership. In the process a sum of %2,000,000 was collected in the first year. Approximately\n\n\n%1,500,000 was spent in providing healthcare facilities to the project population and a sum of 8500,000 per year, along with the returns from\nthe investments, contributed to the corpus. It has been estimated that, long-term, PRHPS will become self-sustaining.\n\nInthe three-tiered delivery approach, village level pharmacies were developed in each of the 500 villages. Local young men were trained\nas para-medical activists to distribute medicines deposited at village pharmacies for the treatment of common ailments. Each village has a\ncommittee that makes decisions on cases requiring referral to Public Health Centres or local hospitals and management of the funds avail-\nable. Those who need further treatment are helped to attend Public Health Centres and hospitals which are run by the government.\n\nThe results of the pilot project showed that about 75per cent of reported ailments were cured though first line intervention at village\npharmacy level, where 15 to 20 types of medicines are available. In cases where illness continued for two to three days, the patients visited\nPublic Health Centres where another 15per cent-2Oper cent of cases were cured. Only 5-10 per cent of the cases were referred to district\nlevel hospitals, medical colleges, or private nursing homes as per the necessity. The scheme bears the expenditure incurred for purchase of\nmedicines and fees for hospitalization to a maximum level of 23,600 per member per year.\n\nIn 2007 the International Labour Organization (ILO) conducted a study on a number of people-managed healthcare projects, including\nPRHPS. In its report ILO described PRHPS as \u2018one of the best case studies\u2019 in Asia.\n\n\u2018Subsequently, PREM was invited by the Ministry of Labour, Government of India, to make a presentation about the programme to policy\nmakers. In April 2008, the Government of India implemented a similar programme on a massive scale.\n\nSource: http://prem.org.in\n\nBajaj Allianz launched Development Goal To enable micro insurance to be an integral part of the country\u2019s wider insurance\nthe savings-linked system, it is necessary to\n\nmicro insurance . . ee\n\nscheme Swayam * adapt insurance companies to the requirements of the micro-insurance;\n\nShakti Suraksha, in + link them as wholesale institutions to self-help groups (SHGs) as retailers; and\nApril 2008 with SKS * upgrade SHGs to the level of financial cooperatives or village banks.\n\nmicrofinance.

                        "extracted-text": "Future of Micro Insurance\n\nInsurance outreach in India is quite modest\u2014to say the least. A large section of the insurable population is\nstill waiting to be insured for something as elementary as life. In such a situation, the potential appears to\nbe lucrative. However, issues like transaction costs, balancing scale and diversity and capacity-building of\ndeliverers and masses remain. Better operational efficiency, convergence with other activities like micro\nfinance and adherence to neatly designed business plans could be possible answers but they are by no\nmeans easy to implement at the ground level.\n\nA regulatory frame work also has a role in development of nascent areas like micro insurance. Pres-\nence of a regulation aimed at policy holders\u2019 protection can go a long way in promoting micro insurance.\nAs a first step, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) came up with IRDA (Micro\ninsurance) Regulations in 2005 but much more needs to be done.\n\nMicro Insurance being a low-price high volume business, its success and sustainability depends\nmainly on keeping the transactions costs down. Obligations of insurers in respect of rural and social\nsector, which have also contributed a lot in development and promotion of micro insurance products by\ninsurers in India. During 2010-2012, micro insurance in India witnessed an annual growth rate of 30%\nand accounted for almost 70% of the growth in micro insurance in Asia. This increase could be largely\nattributed to high economic growth, a rise in disposable income amongst the low-income households,\nvaried products, alternative distribution channels, use of technology and efficient claims processes which\nhave enabled cost-efficient scaling-up and servicing of micro insurance programs. Moreover, central and\nstate governments have launched social security and health insurance schemes that have led the growth\nof micro insurance in India\n\nOn the positive side, increasing competition in the insurance sector offers good news for micro insur-\nance. Commercial factors coupled with rural and social sector obligations of insurers are driving them\nto underwrite the hither denied \u2018bad\u2019 risks. Instead of pushing standard products, flexibility in terms of\ncustomized products is creeping in. Urban markets are fast getting saturated. Due to the congestion in\nurban markets, service providers are compelled to think of rural-centric solutions. So, micro insurance, as\na sector is going to be the obvious beneficiary of this trend.\n\nAll in all, the outlook for micro insurance looks good despite its problems. In the coming years, we\nmight see marketing of micro insurance being highly successful as it has taken place in micro finance.\n",

It is now recognized that provision of social security is an obligation\nof the government. Various laws, passed by the government for this purpose involve use of insurance,\ncompulsory or voluntary, as a tool of social security. Central and state governments contribute premiums\nunder certain social security schemes thus fulfilling their social commitments. Social insurance is con-\nsidered to be a type of social security, and in fact the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably. A\ngovernment-sponsored plan of social insurance spreads the risk among all members of society so that no\nsingle family is completely ruined or deprived of livelihood by an interruption of, or end to sources of\nincome. A government, on its own, cannot administer any social security scheme linked with insurance\n\nas it involves actuarial calculation of premiums and administering the claim process. These schemes\nrequire distributors in the form of banks and risk carriers in the form of insurance companies who would\nbe enrolling and servicing these schemes.\n\nSocial security schemes are not new to India and they have been in vogue even before 2015.\n\nThe Employees State Insurance Act, 1948 provides for Employees State Insurance Corporation to pay\nfor the expenses of sickness, disablement, maternity and death for the benefit of industrial employees and\ntheir families, who are insured persons.

Under the said scheme,\nrisk coverage available will be 22 lakh for accidental death and permanent total disability and %1 lakh\nfor permanent partial disability, for a one year period stretching from 1st June to 31st May. It is offered\nby public sector general insurance companies or any other general insurance company who are willing\nto offer the product on similar terms with necessary approvals and tie up with banks for this purpose.\nParticipating bank will be the master policy holder on behalf of the participating subscribers. It will be\nthe responsibility of the participating bank to recover the appropriate annual premium in one instalment,\nas per the option, from the account holders on or before the due date through \u2018auto-debit\u2019 process and\ntransfer the amount due to the insurance company.\n\nThese schemes have been able to achieve a decent scale by enrolling bank account holders especially,\nthe Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) account holders. This happened on account of mobiliza-\ntion by a good number of insurance companies to carry the risk as well as banks to distribute these prod-\nucts. These schemes could not make much impact due to poor advertisement and lack of awareness of\nthe schemes in rural areas. Insurance companies and banks took very little interest in popularizing these\nschemes since the cost of servicing the schemes and settling the claims was perceived to be higher. In\n2016-17, the second year of its operation, claims under the PMJJBY scheme exceeded premiums by 21\nper cent, making it unsustainable. An even worse outcome afflicted the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima\nYojana, which provides payment of 22 lakh for accidental deaths or grievous injuries. In this case, claims\nwere a whopping 70 per cent higher than premiums. By contrast, private insurance companies with simi-\nlar insurance policies have a claims rate less than half the premiums.\n",

The government initiated certain programmes for\nextension of social protection in the form of insurance and pension to lower income groups. The govern-\nment used its extensive rural banking infrastructure, post office and LICs agent network to distribute sub-\nsidized insurance products to low income households. This distribution network faced several challenges\nincluding accessing remote areas, reluctance of the poor to buy these products due to liquidity constraints\nand lack of insurance literacy. In the 1990s, NGOs and MFIs entered the insurance market by offering\ncustomized products and educating poor rural households. India\u2019s first micro-finance institution SEWA\nbank offers gender sensitive micro insurance\u2014Vimo SEWA\u2014a sustainable micro insurance.\n\nMutual insurance also known as community based health insurance is community-owned and gov-\nerned, owned and run with member participation. It has regular engagement with its members and is\ndesigned for long-term financial sustainability\n\nThere are 15 mutuals and cooperatives, across 13 states, providing insurance services to approxi-\nmately 1 million people using risk retention or risk sharing models. The other players in India are Uplift\n\n\nmutuals, IFFCO Tokio, Dhan Foundation, Shepherd and Goat Trust. Uplift mutuals has a strong ground\npresence in Pune and good governance\n\nLow-income families have formed cooperatives mostly with women as policy holders engaged in\nthe \u2014 made design and delivery of tailor insurance products. Moreover, the focus is on making the claims\nprocess easy and transparent. Members invest resources in insurance education and awareness to increase\ntheir membership and also have robust grievance redressal systems. These mutuals may not have the\ndesired scale but have been able to show clear impact in protecting the lives and livelihoods of the poor\nby bringing insurance services to those who previously didn\u2019t have access to them.\n\nMutual insurance is likely to remain an area of interest in the years to come, notwithstanding its\ninherent problems of scalability and financial viability besides the inability to offer inorganic growth.\nExpanding outreach among the low-income populations beyond the captive catchments of compulsory\nand subsidized models will compel a persevered endeavor on the voluntary side. The insurance regula-\ntor IRDA has promulgated the micro insurance regulations for rapid penetration of insurance among the\npoor and low income people in rural and urban areas. Despite all these efforts, still a majority of the low-\nincome group have low access to insurance.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Conclusion\n\nWith deregulation, competition has increased in the insurance sector. The entry of private sector play-\ners has brought about a paradigm shift in the definition of the word insurance. There is no doubt that the\ninsurance market is growing. The rate of annual growth is an average of 20 per cent for life and 15 per cent\nfor non-life. Despite this growth rate, India is under-insured when compared to other countries. As per the\nsurvey conducted by Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), the Indian insur-\nance market is one of the least insured markets in the world. India has a population of 1,044.15 million out\nof which only 100 million Indians have a life insurance policy. Almost 300 million people in the country\ncan afford to buy life insurance but of this only 20 per cent have an insurance cover. A huge chunk of the\npopulation is yet to be tapped. India\u2019s life insurance premium as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product\n(GDP) is 4 per cent as against 8.18 per cent in the UK, 11 per cent in the US, and 14 per cent in South Africa.\nIndian insurance is ranked 38 in the world with a low insurance penetration of 3.96 per cent and a paltry 5\nper cent being spent on insurance out of the average savings rate of 35 per cent. The ratio of sum assured to\nan individual\u2019s annual income is around 0.5 in India, while in developed countries, it averages around three.\n\nIndia\u2019s insurance sector has a long way to catch up with the rest of the world. The current size of the\nIndian insurance market is USD 56 billion, while the global insurance market is around USD 4,270 bil-\nlion. India accounts for just 1.32 per cent of the global insurance market, while the per capita insurance\npremium in India is USD 53, it is USD 5,167 in Japan, USD 9,785 in South Korea, USD 5,167 in Japan\nand USD 174 in China. The ratio of premium to GDP for India stands at only 3.96 per cent against 8.2 per\ncent in the US, 13 per cent in UK and 12.2 per cent in South Korea.\n\nThe untapped potential reveals that our human and physical assets are unprotected and neglected.\nInsurance penetration can be achieved by tapping the neglected rural markets. There is vast potential for\ninsurance growth in the rural sector. A recent survey by the Foundation for Research, Training and Educa-\ntion in Insurance (FORTE) suggests that insurance can be sold profitably to rural communities in India.\nThe survey revealed the following:\n\n+ There is a distinct hierarchy of needs in rural areas.\n\nRural people find security in groups.\n\nThe saving habit is very strong in rural areas.\n\nAverage savings across the three most important socio-economic strata comes to 30-35 per cent of\nannual income or about 713,500 annually which is significant.\n\nThere is a high level of awareness about life insurance and a fairly high level\u2014about 36 per cent\u2014\nalready own life insurance.\n\nFifty-one per cent of those who own life insurance would like to buy more.\n\nAmongst the savers, a significant percentage does not save through formal financial modes or insti-\ntutions.\n\nRural buyers of insurance prefer a half-yearly mode of premium payment to coincide with the time\nof harvest.\n\nIndia and China have been picked as the \u2018most promising insurance markets\u2019 in a recent study by Swiss Re,\n\u2018one of the world\u2019s largest life and health reinsurers. Although China and India accounted for just 4.62 per cent\nof the global insurance premiums, their huge economies and population size are supposedly capable of\n\ncreating \u2018ample opportunities for insurance\u2019. The Swiss Re study ranked India in the thirty eighth position\namong the life insurance market and seventy eighth in the non-life insurance market in the world.\n\nA faster growth of insurance in the rural sector can be achieved by insurance companies if they tie\nup with cooperative societies, regional rural banks, Kisan credit cardholders, self-help groups, NGOs,\npanchayats, and agents to distribute insurance products. This tie-up would help the insurance companies\nachieve insurance penetration in a cost-effective manner.\n",

Invest-\nment banks issue securities on behalf of both public as well as private companies, trade\nsecurities in the primary and secondary markets on behalf of individual and institutional\ninvestors, manage portfolios for high net-worth clients and corporates, and provide financial\nadvisory services to corporates, private equity groups, public entities, non-profit clients and\ninstitutional investors.\n\nInvestment banking differs from commercial banking in the sense that they do not accept\ndeposits and grant retail loans. While commercial banks mobilize savings in the form of\ndeposits and lend these funds to individuals, corporates and government, investment banks\nbring both the lender as well as the borrower together and help the lenders invest directly in\nthe business of the borrowers. The services of commercial banks are accessible by all, while\ninvestment banks serve mainly the large companies and high net-worth individuals.\n\nInvestment banks were known as merchant banks in the United Kingdom. In the United\nStates, a commercial bank could not undertake share broking or investment in shares till late\n1990s. Because of the stock-market crash of 1929 and the high risk involved in the capital-\nmarket activities, the Glass-Steagall Act, 1933 prohibited commercial banks from undertak-\ning investment banking. Hence, the stand-alone investment-banking model was born in the\nUnited States. The five big stand-alone investment banks, called \u2018bulge-bracket,\u2019 in the order\nof their establishment, were Lehman Brothers (1850), Goldman Sachs (1869), Merrill Lynch\n(1914), Bear Sterns (1923) and Morgan Stanley (1935). The Glass Steagall Act, 1933, was\nrepealed by Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999. The commercial banks in the United States\ncould undertake investment- banking activity and are now known as \u2018universal banks.\u2019 Citi-\ngroup, JP Morgan Chase and Credit Suisse are examples of Universal Banks. The acquisi-\ntion of the merchant banks in the United Kingdom by the investment banks of the United\nStates and the boom in the stock markets in the 1990s popularized the concept of investment\nbanking. In India, commercial banks and financial institutions set up subsidiaries in 1972\nto undertake this activity and it was known as \u2018merchant banking\u2019 till late 1990s. The ANZ\nGrindlays Bank was the first to set up a merchant-banking division in 1969 which offered\nissue-management services to corporates. With the advent of foreign-investment banks in\nIndia in the late 1990s, merchant banking started being referred as \u2018investment banking.\u201d\nMerchant-banking activity comes under the purview of the SEBI and regulations have been\nframed to regulate the activities of merchant bankers.\n",

The revenues during the year 2007 were the highest for\nthe investment-banking industry as a large number of deals worth $51 billion were struck. However, the sub-\nprime mortgage crisis took a toll on the global-investment banks. These investment banks were not under the\ncontrol of either the Federal Reserve Bank or the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which\nmade it easier for them to take higher risks. Wall Street's oldest and biggest investment banks collapsed in the\nlate 2008 as a result of the financial turmoil. Bear Stearns was acquired by JP Morgan Chase in March 2008.\nLehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy and was declared bankrupt in September 2008. The Asian\nand European operations of Lehman Brothers were bought by Nomura and the North American Lehman\noperations by Barclays Capital. Merill Lynch was acquired by Bank of America for $50 billion. Goldman\nSachs and Morgan Stanley converted themselves into bank-holding companies or commercial banks.\n\nThe impact of the collapse of these banks has been felt on the Indian investment banks. There will be\na drop in big deals and fat fees and revenues. Even in the midst of this gloomy environment, investment\nbanks have opportunities which they can tap with properly designed strategies and go global. The growth\nrate of the Indian economy has slowed down but it is fairly good when compared to the growth rate of\nthe developed countries. Even though the capital markets are in a dismal state, India is still an attractive\nmarket for investment. Even foreign investment banks have planned to start their operations in India. The\nIndian investment banks need to design new strategies for survival and growth, such as focusing on key\nbusiness areas, exploring new and alternate markets and market segments, creating alliances with bou-\ntique firms, developing strong and long-term relationship with the existing and new clients, giving quality\nadvice to clients and assisting them in every stage of their growth, hiring qualified staff and promoting\nethical behaviour.\n",

The traditional\nsettlement and clearing system have proved to be inadequate due to operational inefficien-\ncies. Hence, there has emerged a need to replace this traditional system with a new system\ncalled the \u2018depository system\u2019.\n\nDepository, in very simple terms, means a place where something is deposited for\nsafekeeping. A depository is an organization which holds securities of a shareholder in an\nelectronic form and facilitates the transfer of ownership of securities on the settlement dates.\nAccording to Section 2(e) of the Depositories Act, 1996, \u2018Depository means a company\nformed and registered under the Companies Act, 1956 and which has been granted a cer-\ntificate of registration under Section 12(1 A) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India\nAct, 1992.\"\n\nThe depository system revolves around the concept of paperless or scripless trading because\nthe shares in a depository are held in the form of electronic accounts, that is, in dematerialized\nform. This system is similar to the opening of an account in a bank wherein a bank will hold\nmoney on behalf of the investor and the investor has to open an account with the bank to utilize\nits services. Cash deposits and withdrawals are made in a bank, in lieu of which a receipt and\nbank passbook are given, while in depositories, scrips are debited and credited and an account\nstatement is issued to the investor from time to time. An investor in a bank deals directly with\nthe bank while an investor deals through a depository participant in a depository. A depository\nalso acts as a securities bank, where dematerialized physical securities are held in custody.\n\nAn effective and fully developed depository system is essential for maintaining and enhanc-\ning market efficiency, which is one of the core characteristics of a mature capital market.\n",

In dematerialization, paper certifi-\ncates are totally eliminated after verification by the custodians. In immobilization, initial paper certificates\nare preserved in safe vaults by custodians and further movement of papers are frozen.\n\nThe depository system provides a wide range of services.\n\n+ Primary market services by acting as a link between the issuers and the prospective shareholders.\n\n+ Secondary market services, by acting as a link between the investors and the clearing house of the\nexchange to facilitate the settlement of security transactions through book-keeping entries.\n\n+ Ancillary services, by providing services such as collecting dividends and interests, reporting cor-\nporate information, and crediting bonus, rights, shares.\n\nThese services lead to a reduction in both time and cost which ultimately benefits the investors, issu-\ners, intermediaries, and the nation as a whole.\n",

It eliminates all problems related with the holding of shares in physical form,\nthereby increasing investor confidence. An investor saves in terms of costs like stamp duty, postage, and\nbrokerage charges (Table 18.1). Pledging of shares and portfolio shuffling become convenient for an\ninvestor. This system enables trading of even a single share, thereby eliminating the problem of odd-lot\nshares. Shares get credited into the demat holder's account in a couple of days, unlike the physical mode\nwhere it took an average of a month to transfer the shares.\n\nFurther, loans against the pledged demat shares come at interest rates that are lower by 0.25 per cent\nto 1.5 per cent in comparison to pledged physical shares. The limit of loan against dematerialized security\nas collateral is double (at 20 lakh) of that against collateralized physical security (710 lakh). The Reserve\nBank of India has also reduced the minimum margin to 25 per cent for loans against dematerialized\nsecurities as against 50 per cent for loan against physical securities. Many brokerage firms have brought\ndown their brokerage to the extent of 0.5 per cent as the risk associated with bad delivery has reduced.\n\nThis system has facilitated the introduction of the rolling settlement system which, in turn, has led to\nshorter settlement cycles and a decrease in settlement risks and frauds. Lastly, this system helps in inte-\ngrating the domestic capital market with international capital markets.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "The Move on to a Depository System in India\n\nThe move on to a depository system in India was initiated by the Stock Holding Corporation of India\nLimited (SHCIL) in July 1992 when it prepared a concept paper on \u2018National Clearance and Depository\nSystem\u2019 in collaboration with Price Waterhouse under a programme sponsored by the US Agency for\nInternational Development. Thereafter, the government of India constituted a technical group under the\nchairmanship of R. Chandrasekaran, Managing Director, SHCIL, which submitted its report in 1993.\n\nSubsequently, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) constituted a seven-member squad\nto discuss the various structural and operational parameters of the depository system. The Government of\nIndia promulgated the Depositories Ordinance in September 1995, thus paving the way for setting up of\ndepositories in the country.\n\nSome features of the Depositories Ordinance are as follows:\n\n* The depository is a registered owner of the share while the shareholder is the beneficial owner\nretaining all the economic and voting rights arising out of share ownership.\n\n+ Shares in the depository will be fungible.\n\n* Transfers pertaining to sale and purchase will be effected automatically.\n\n+ Any loss or damage caused to the participant will be indemnified by the depository.\n\n\u00ab If trades are routed through depository, there is no need to pay stamp duty.\n\nThe Depositories Act was passed by the Parliament in August 1996. It lays down the legislative frame-\nwork for facilitating dematerialization and book entry transfer of securities in a depository. The act pro-\nvides that a depository is required to be a company under the Companies Act, 1956 and depository\nparticipants (DPs) need to be registered with the SEBI. The investors have the option to hold securities\nin physical or dematerialized form or to rematerialize securities previously held in dematerialized form.\n\nThe SEBI issued a consultative paper No. X on the draft regulations for depositories and participants\nin October 1995 for wide consultation and notified the regulations in May 1996. The SEBI has allowed\nmultiple depositories to ensure competition and transparency.\n\nThe Depositories Related Laws (Amendment) Ordinance, 1997, issued in January of that year enabled\nunits of mutual funds and UTI, securities of statutory corporations and public corporations to be dealt\nthrough depositories. The Dhanuka Panel in its draft Depository Act (Amendment) Bill, 1998 recommended\nempowering the SEBI to make trading in demat shares mandatory. The SEBI laid down an elaborate time\nschedule envisaging that beginning January 4, 1999, till March 26, 2001, 3,145 listed scrips or 40 per cent\nof the total listed securities would be traded compulsorily in the demat form. Besides equity, new debt issues\nwill also be in demat form. The minimum networth stipulated by the SEBI for a depository is 2100 crore.\n\nIt is mandatory for all listed companies to have their securities admitted for dematerialization with\nboth the depositories, viz, NSDL and CDSL. Securities include shares, debentures, bonds, commercial\npaper, certificate of deposits, pass through certificates, government securities and mutual fund units.\n\nSEBI (Depositories and Participants) (Amendment) Regulations 2008 were notified on March 17,\n2008, which provided for the shareholding such as\n\n1. sponsor should at all times hold at least 51 per cent shares in the depository;\n2. no person, cither singly or together with persons acting in concert, can hold more than 5 per cent\nof the equity share capital in the depository;\n\n3. the combined holding of all persons resident outside India in the equity share capital of the\ndepository will not exceed, at any time, 49 per cent of its total equity share capital, subject further\nto the following:\n\na. the combined holdings of such persons acquired through the foreign direct investment route\nare not more than 26 per cent of the total equity share capital, at any time;\n\nb. the combined holdings of foreign institutional investors are not more than 23 per cent of the\ntotal equity share capital, at any time;\n\nc. no foreign institutional investor acquires shares of the depository otherwise than through the\nsecondary market.\n",

The investor has to enter into an agreement with the DP after which he\nis issued a client account number or client ID number. PAN Card is now mandatory to operate a demat\naccount. The holder of a demat account is called \u2018beneficial owner\u2019 (BO). He can open more than one\naccount with the same or multiple DPs.\n\nDematerialization To convert his physical holdings of securities into the dematerialized form, the\ninvestor makes an application to the DP in a dematerialization request form (DRF). Within seven days, the\nDP forwards the form, along with the security certificates, to the issuer or its registrar and transfer agent\nafter electronically registering the request with the depository.\n\nThe depository electronically forwards the demat request to the respective issuer or its registrar and\ntransfer agent, who verifies the validity of the security certificates as well as the fact that the DRF has\nbeen made by a person recorded as a member in its register of members.\n\nAfter verification, the issuer or its registrar and transfer agent authorises an electronic credit for the\nsecurity in favour of the client. Thereafter, the depository causes the credit entries to be made in the\naccount of the client.\n\nRematerialization To withdraw his security balance with the depository, the investor makes an\napplication to the depository through its DP. He requests for the withdrawal of balance in his account in\na rematerialization request form (RRF). On receipt of the RRF, the participant checks whether sufficient\nfree relevant security balance is available in the client's account. If there is, the participant accepts the\nRRF and blocks the balance of the client to the extent of the rematerialization quantity and electronically\nforwards the request to the depository.\n\nOn receipt of the request, the depository blocks the balance of the participant to the extent of the\nrematerialization quantity in the depository system. The depository electronically forwards the accepted\nrematerialization application to the issuer or its registrar agent, which is done on a daily basis.\n\nThe registrar and transfer agent confirm electronically to the depository that the RRF has been\naccepted. Thereafter, the issuer or registrar and transfer agent despatches the share certificates arising out\nof the rematerialization request within 30 days.\n\nDistributing Dividend A company (issuer) or its registrar and transfer agent shall make known the\ndepository of the corporate actions such as dates for book closures, redemption or maturity of security,\nconversion of warrants, and call money from time to time. The depository will then electronically provide\na list of the holdings of the clients as on the cut-off date. The company can then distribute dividend,\ninterest, and other monetary benefits directly to the client on the basis of the list. If the benefits are in\nthe form of securities, the company or its registrar and transfer agent may distribute these, provided the\nnewly created security is an eligible security and the client has consented to receive the benefits through\ndepository.\n\nClosing an Account A client wanting to close an account shall make an application in the\nformat specified to that effect to the participant. The client may close his account if no balances\n\nare outstanding to his credit in the account. If any balance exists, the account may be closed in the\nfollowing manner: (i) By rematerialization of all its existing balances in his account and/or (ii) By\ntransferring his security balances to his other account held either with the same participant or with\na different participant.\n\nThe participant shall ensure that all pending transactions have been adjusted before closing such an\naccount. After ensuring that there are no balances in the client\u2019s account, the participant shall execute the\nrequest for closure of the client\u2019s account.\n",

For instance,\nmany DPs have launched interactive voice response (IVR) units. They have also slashed their service\ncharges and many of them are rendering free-market and off-market buy services to their corporate\nclients.\n\nBesides DPs, other business partners of the NSDL include issuing companies/their share transfer agents,\nclearing corporations/houses, and clearing members.

                        "extracted-text": "Growth in Demat Accounts\n\n\u2018As seen from Box 18.1, an impressive progress was achieved with regard to the dematerialization process.\n\u2018There was an expansion in the coverage of number of companies, number of DPs, number of beneficial\nowners, and turnover. The number of client accounts registered with the NSDL increased from 25.3 lakh in\nMay 2000 to I crore in August 2009. This increase indicates a continuing inclination for paperless trading.\n\nThe SEBI gradually added more number of scrips in the list for compulsory trading in the demat form.\nThe SEBI increased the number of scrips from 12 in January 1999 to 2,335 in June 2001. In order to\nexpedite the process of dematerialization, the SEBI made the settlement of trade in certain scrips manda-\ntory in demat form. Moreover all public issues, rights issues, and offer for sale shall be in the demat form.\nDelivery of underlying shares of Global Depository Receipt (GDR)/American Depository Receipt (ADR)\nshall compulsorily be in demat form.\n\nThe Union Budget for the year 1999-2000 did away with stamp duty on transfer of debt instruments\nwithin the depository mode to encourage the dematerialization process further.\n\nInvestors can use their demat accounts with the NSDL and the CDSL for buying and selling mutual\nfunds. An increasing trend in dematerialization was witnessed in instruments such as commercial papers\nand bonds since 2005-06.\n\nThe spurt in demat business can be largely attributed to the fact that it is now mandatory to trade in\ndemat shares. Almost 95 per cent of the issued capital in the market is converted into electronic firm.\nMoreover, the revival of the primary market after the Maruti Udyog Limited\u2019s IPO led to a rise in deposi-\ntory accounts of retail investors.\n\n\u2018A large number of shares were cornered through multiple share applications and opening of\nbenami dematerialized accounts by a few scamsters during the IPO scam that took place in April\n2006. Depositories and DPs were blamed for the IPO scam. SEBI levied on depositories\u2014both NSDL\nand CDSL\u2014116 crore as part of its disgorgement order. Disgorgement is the practice of recovering\nmoney from perpetrators of financial funds and compensating investors who have been impacted.\n\nSince the introduction of the depository system, dematerialization has progressed at a fast pace\nand has gained acceptance amongst the market participants. All actively traded scrips are held, traded\nand settled in the demat form. As the network of depositories expands and the proportion of securities\ndematerialized increases, the benefits of faster settlement of trades, short settlement cycles, reduced\ntransaction costs, and greater protection will increase liquidity in the stock markets. The ratio of demate-\nrialization to floating stock in the market is around 100 per cent. The shareholders who have not partici-\npated in the demat process are passive shareholders such as government, multinational corporations and\nsome Indian promoters. The government has not dematerialized holdings in public sector enterprises\n\nsuch as SBI, ONGC and BHEL, while foreign parent firms such as Unilever, Colgate, Palmolive, Procter\nand Gamble, and Pfizer have not dematerialized their holdings in their Indian subsidiaries as they have\nno intention of selling shares. The demat process has turned out to be the fastest of all programmes\nundertaken. At the beginning of 1997, not more than 100 stocks were available in the electronic form.\nBy June 2002, the number rose to 4,252. The demat quantity (number of securities) increased from\n16.39 billion in 2000 to 440 billion in 2010, an almost thirty-fold increase in first ten years. The Indian\nmarket has achieved this level of dematerialization in just four years while the US market could achieve\nit in 20 years. Dematerialization had a tremendous impact on liquidity and trading volumes in the equity\n\nsegment.\n",

A custodian is an\nintermediary which keeps the scrips of the clients in custody or is the keeper of the accounts of its\nclients. According to Securities and Exchange Board of India (Custodian of Securities) Regulations, 1996\ncustodian of securities means any person who carries on or proposes to carry on the business of providing\ncustodial services.\n\nCustodial services in relation to securities of a client or gold or gold related instruments held by a mutual\nfund or title deeds of real estate assets held by a real estate mutual fund scheme in accordance with the Securi-\nties and Exchange Board of India (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 means, safekeeping of such securities or\ngold or gold related instruments or title deeds of real estate assets and providing services incidental thereto,\nand includes\u2014\n\n(i) maintaining accounts of securities or gold or gold related instruments or title deeds of real estate\n\nassets of a client; (a) undertaking activities as a domestic depository in terms of the companies (Issue\nof Indian Depository Receipts) Rules, 2004;\n\n(ii) collecting the benefits or rights accruing to the client in respect of securities or gold or gold related\ninstruments or title deeds of real estate assets;\n\n(iii) keeping the client informed of the actions taken or to be taken by the issuer of securities, having a\nbearing on the benefits or rights accruing to the client; and\n\n(iv) maintaining and reconciling records of the services.\n\n\u2018A custodian shall have minimum net worth (the paid-up capital and the free reserves as on the date of the appli-\ncation) of rupees fifty crores.\n\nA custodian is not only a safekeeper of share certificates and a trustee of the same but also provides\nancillary services such as physical transfers of share certificates, collecting dividends and interest war-\nrants, and conforming to transfer regulations. Besides these, it updates clients on their investment status.\nTo claim benefits on behalf of its clients, a custodian keeps track of book closures, record dates, bonus\nand rights shares. For rendering these services, custodians charge a fee of 1 per cent of the total volume of\ntransactions. Scope of custodial services has been enlarged to include safekeeping of gold or gold related\ninstruments, consequent to introduction of gold and gold related instruments by the Indian mutual funds.\n\nEven though depositories have been set up, there is a need for custodians as they act as complements\nto depositories. The volume of transactions by fund managers is so large that custodial services are immi-\nnent. With depositories in existence, their volume of paper work has not only reduced but most of them\nalso act as depository participants. Custodians provide the infrastructure facilities which ease the post-\nissue, post-trade and settlement work.\n\nCustodians are clearing members but not trading members. They are involved in the process of clearing.\nThey settle trades on behalf of other trading members. A trading member may assign a particular trade to a\ncustodian for settlement. If the custodian confirms to settle that trade, then the clearing corporation assigns\nthat particular obligation to the custodian who is then required to settle it on the settlement day.\n\nIn India, the SHCIL and the SBI Share Holding Corporation are the most prominent custodians cater-\ning to the requirements of the UTI and financial institutions. The SHCIL is the leading custodian with a\n75 per cent market share. Other banks like Canara Bank and Indian Bank have promoted Canbank Com-\nputer Services and India Clearing and Depository Services Limited (ICDS). These custodians usually\nprovide services to institutional investors.\n\nAfter liberalization, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) were allowed to invest in the Indian capital\nmarket. Most of the FIIs\u2019 business is routed through foreign banks\u2019 custodians. According to the laws\ngoverning US funds, no US fund is allowed to use a custodian that does not have a capital adequacy\nof USD 200 million. No Indian custodian, including the SHCIL, meets this requirements; hence, only\n\nforeign banks operate as custodians for US-based FIls, pension funds, and corporates. Hong Kong Bank,\nDeutsche Bank, Citibank, and Standard Chartered Bank are some prominent foreign banks which operate\nas custodians. At present, there are 9 registered foreign custodians in India.\n\nA custodian must be registered with the SEBI. SEBI regulations provide the eligibility criteria and\ncode of conduct to be followed by a custodian. A custodian is required to participate in the clearing and\nsettlement process through the clearing house/clearing corporation. As on July 31, 2017, the number of\ncustodians registered with the SEBI stood at nineteen.\n",

The competition among\nfirms for a slice of the savings cake has increased. New instruments have been designed\nby companies to attract investors to subscribe to their issues. The market is flooded with a\nvariety of new and complex financial products, such as asset-backed securities and credit\nderivatives. These new instruments are embodied with complex features very difficult for an\nordinary investor to understand and analyse. Besides this, investors no longer evaluate the\ncreditworthiness of the borrowers by their names or size. Credit rating agencies have come\ninto existence to assist the investors in their investment decisions, by assessing the credit-\nworthiness of the borrowers.\n\nCredit rating is the assessment of a borrower's credit quality, Credit rating performs the\nfunction of credit risk evaluation reflecting the borrower's expected capability to repay the\ndebt as per terms of issue. Credit rating is merely an indicator of the current opinion of\nthe relative capacity of a borrowing entity to service its debt obligations within a specified\ntime period and with particular reference to the debt instrument being rated. Credit rating\nis not a recommendation to buy, hold or sell. It is a well-informed opinion made available\nto the public, and might influence their investment decisions. Credit rating, however, is not\na general purpose evaluation nor overall assessment of credit risk of a firm. Ratings neither\nevaluate the reasonableness of the issue price or possibilities for capital gains nor take into\naccount the liquidity in the secondary market. Ratings also do not take into account the\nrisk of prepayment by issuer. Although these are often related to the credit risk, the rating\nessentially is an opinion on the relative quality of the credit risk. An agency that performs the\nrating of debt instruments is known as credit rating agency. At present, the scope of a credit\nrating agency is not limited to rating of debts. Credit rating agencies now undertake financial\nanalysis and assessment of financial products, individuals, institutions, and governments.\n",

Credit rating agencies play a key\nrole in the infrastructure of the modern financial system.\n\nCredit rating enables investors to draw up the credit-risk profile and assess the adequacy\nor otherwise of the risk\u2014-premium offered by the market. It saves the investors, time and\nenables them to take a quick decision and provides them better choices among available\ninvestment opportunities based on their risk-return preferences. Issuers have a wider access\nto capital along with better pricing. Issuers with a high credit rating can raise funds at a\ncheaper rate thereby lowering their cost of capital. It acts as a marketing tool for the instru-\nment, enhances the company\u2019s reputation and recognition, and enables even lesser known.\ncompanies to raise funds from the capital market.\n\nCredit rating is a tool in the hands of financial intermediaries, such as banks and financial\ninstitutions that can be effectively employed for taking decisions relating to lending and\ninvestments.\n\nCredit rating helps the market regulators in promoting stability and efficiency in the secu-\nrities market. Ratings make markets more efficient and transparent. They play a tremendous\n\nrole in the growth of financial markets. It also helps in prescribing the requisite eligibility criteria for\nexisting as well as new debt instruments, and monitoring the financial soundness of organizations. Rat-\nings and rating changes influence the pricing of financial instruments.\n\nRatings help lenders, borrowers, issuers, investors, regulators and intermediaries make sound decisions.\nRatings help corporates and investors manage and mitigate risks, take pricing and valuation decisions,\nreduce time to market, generate more revenue and enhance returns.\n\nRating agencies also help shape public policy on infrastructure in emerging markets, and thereby help\ncatalyse economic growth and development in these geographies.\n\nRatings have assumed a much larger role in the global financial markets. Sovereign ratings affect the\nquantum of financial and investment flows to a country. Fund managers, international banks, and foreign\ndirect investors look at ratings for portfolio allocation as ratings reflect the overall health of the country\u2019s\neconomy.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Origin of the Concept of Credit Rating\n\nThis concept originated in the US in 1909 AD when the founder of Moody's Investor Service, John\nMoody, rated the US Rail Road Bonds. However, the relevance of this concept was realized only after\nthe great depression when investors lost all their money. Lack of symmetric information and high costs\nof collecting information increased the popularity of credit rating agencies. The world\u2019s biggest rating\nagencies are Moody's Investors Service and Standard and Poor's (S&P). They have been into the rat-\ning business for decades. Both Moody's and S&P have been rating bonds since 1916 and have captured\nthe lion\u2019s share. The nearest competitor of Moody\u2019s and S&P is Fitch Investors Service, which does not\neven share one-fifth of the business. These three rating agencies are given official recognition by the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These agencies have grown so powerful that even sovereign\ngovernments are wary of getting a poor rating from them. Journalist Thomas Friedman once said, \u201cThere\nare two superpowers in the world today. There is the United States and there is Moody's Bond Rating\nService. The US can destroy by dropping bombs and Moody\u2019s can destroy you by downgrading your\nbonds.\u201d\n\nInitially, rating agencies in the US rated instruments and published their ratings free of charge. They\nfinanced their operations through sale of publications and related materials. But with an increase in the\npopularity of ratings, they began to charge issuers for ratings. US rating agencies offer both solicited\nand unsolicited ratings. Unsolicited ratings are made explicit with an asterisk. The rating agency is not\ncompensated by the firm and rating is based on published information in case of unsolicited rating.\n\nThe rating giants have diversified their service portfolio in order to survive and grow. Besides rating\nbond issues\u2014their core rating business\u2014they have diversified into rating asset-backed securities, com-\nmercial papers, bank loans, and other financial products. These agencies also rate mutual funds, banks,\ninsurance companies, financial institutions, and sovereign governments. There are specialized agencies\nin the US that rate only financial institutions or insurance companies. Their latest move has been in the\nfield of risk consulting. Sovereign ratings are a new line of business for credit rating agencies. The first\nindustrial country to be rated was France by Standard and Poor's in 1959. Both Moody's and S&P rated a\nnon-industrial country, namely, Venezuela in October 1977. Fitch entered the business of sovereign rating\nonly in 1975. India has been assigned sovereign ratings by Moody\u2019s and S&P over a decade. India is also\nbeing rated by Fitch, Japan Credit Rating Agency and Japan Bond Research Institute. Moody's started\nrating India in 1988 with an investment grade rating and S&P started rating India in August 1990. Both\nthese agencies downgraded India\u2019s long-term sovereign credit rating to noninvestment grade during the\nexternal crisis of 1991. Recently both these agencies affirmed their positive outlook on India. They are yet\nto increase India\u2019s rating to investment grade.\n\nIndia was first among the developing world to set up a credit rating agency\u2014Credit Rating Informa-\ntion Services of India Limited (CRISIL) in 1988. Then came ICRA in 1990, followed by CARE in 1993.\nThe credit rating function was further institutionalized in the 1990s when the Reserve Bank and the SEBI\nmade credit rating mandatory for the issue of commercial paper (CP) and certain categories of debentures\nand debt instruments. For any public issue of corporate debts, credit rating has to be obtained from at least\none credit rating agency with the SEBI\u2019s approval and is disclosed in the offer document. In case where\nratings are obtained from more than one agency, all such ratings, including the unaccepted ones, would\nhave to be disclosed in the offer documents. Every rating would be reviewed by registered credit rating\nagency and revision would have to be disclosed to stock exchange. The issuer can also list debt securities\non private placement basis, provided they have been credit rated and meet other regulations. Issuer would\nhave to redeem debt securities in terms of offer documents.\n",

CRISIL is the market leader in the credit rating industry with a 70 per cent market share.\n\nThe regulator's support played an important role in the development of the credit rating industry. In\n1992, for the first time, the Reserve Bank introduced the requirement of rating for commercial paper. The\nSEBI followed up by introducing mandatory rating of bonds. The other growth drivers of the credit rat-\ning industry were declining interest rates, a shift towards market borrowings from bank loans and a steep\nincrease in the state government borrowings through special purpose vehicles. Besides these factors the\ngrowth in the private placement market of debt increased business volume in the credit rating industry.\nFor private placements, rating is not mandatory but banks and mutual funds ask for a rating. In 1997,\nthe penetration of rating, that is, the number of rated issues out of the total number of issues was 35 per\ncent. In the year 2002, it was 97 per cent. This means that the credit rating industry has transited from a\nregulatory-driven market to an investor-driven market in the growing debt markets. Between fiscal 1997\nand 2001, rated debt volumes increased from 213,743 crore to 52,746 crore, which is 84 per cent of the\ntotal issuance.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Rating Methodology\n\nIn India, the rating exercise starts at the request of the company. The process of obtaining a rating is quite\nlengthy and time consuming.\n\nThe rating of a financial instrument requires a thorough analysis of relevant factors that affect the\ncreditworthiness of the issuer. The primary focus of the rating exercise is to assess future cash generation\ncapability and their adequacy to meet debt obligations in adverse conditions. The analysis attempts to\ndetermine the long-term fundamentals and the probabilities of change in these fundamentals, which could\naffect the credit-worthiness of the borrower. Analysis typically involves at least five years of operating\nhistory and financial data as well as company and rating agency forecasts of future performance. Ratings\nare assigned after an in-depth study of both objective and subjective factors related to business, financial\nmanagement and so on. Ratings are based on an indepth study of the industry and an evaluation of the\nstrengths and weakness of the company. The analytical framework for rating consists of the following five\nbroad areas:\n\n1, Economy Analysis The Economic environment is assessed to determine the degree of operating\nrisk faced by the company in a given business. Here the economy wide factors which have a bearing on\nthe industry are taken into consideration. The strategic nature of the industry in the prevailing policy\nenvironment, regulatory oversight governing industries, etc. are also analysed.\n\n2. Business Analysis This covers an analysis of industry risk, market position in the country, operating\nefficiency of the company, and legal position.\n\n+ An analysis of industry risk focuses on the prospects of the industry and the competitive factors\naffecting the industry. Investment plans of the major players in the industry, demand supply factors,\nprice trends, changes in technology, international/domestic competitive factors in the industry, entry\nbarriers, capital intensity, business cycles, etc. are key ingredients of industry risk. Industry risk\ncovers an analysis of actual and estimated demand/supply, number of firms and potential entrants in\nthe industry, government policies relating to the industry, the performance of the industry, its future\npotentiality, and other factors.\n\n* Market position in the industry covers the study of market share of the firms (marketing strengths\nand weaknesses of the firm vis-a-vis its competitors), marketing arrangements, products, and\ncustomers.\n\n+ Operating efficiency is a study of production processes of the firm, its cost structure, locational\nadvantages, labour relationships, input availability, and prices.\n\n* Legal position covers a study of prospectus, accuracy of information, and filing of forms, returns,\nand so on with proper regulatory authorities.\n\n3. Financial Analysis It involves evaluation of past and expected future financial performance with\nemphasis on assessment of adequacy of cash flows towards debt servicing. Financial analysis includes an\nanalysis of accounting quality, earnings protection, cash flow adequacy, and financial flexibility.\n\nAccounting quality is known by the study of method of income recognition, inventory valuation,\ndepreciation policies, auditor\u2019s remarks, and off-balance liabilities accounts are noted. A review of\naccounting quality and adherence to prudential accounting norms are examined for measuring the\ncompany\u2019s performance. Prudent disclosures of material events affecting the company are reviewed.\nImpact of the auditor\u2019s qualifications and comments are quantified and analytical adjustments are\nmade to the accounts, if they are material. Off-balance sheet items are factored into the financial\nanalysis and adjustments made to the accounts, wherever necessary. Change of accounting policy in\na particular year which results in improved reported performance is also analyzed.\n\nEarnings protection is examined with reference to profitability ratios, earnings growth, and pro-\njected earnings, among others. Financial ratios are used to make a holistic assessment of financial\nperformance of the company, as also to see the company\u2019s performance\u2014intra-firm and inter-firm\nwithin the industry.\n\nAdequacy of cash flows includes a study of future cash flows, working capital needs, and capital\nbudgets. Cash flow analysis forms an important part of credit rating decisions. Availability of inter-\nnally generated cash for servicing debt is the most comforting factor for rating decisions as com-\npared to dependence on external sources of cash to cover temporary shortfalls.\n\nFinancial flexibility is examined in terms of whether alternative sources of liquidity are available to\nthe company as and when required. It also examines whether financing plans have been developed\nand the feasibility of such plans. Company's contingency plans under various stress scenarios are\nconsidered and examined. Ability to access capital markets and other sources of funds whenever\na company faces financial crunch is reviewed. Existence of liquid investments, access to lines of\ncredits from strong group concerns to tide over stress situations, ability to sell assets quickly, defer\ncapital expenditure, etc. are also considered.\n\nValidation of projections and sensitivity analysis: The projected performance of the company over\nthe life of the instrument is critically examined and assumptions underlying the projections are vali-\ndated. The critical parameters affecting the industry and the anticipated performance of the industry\nare identified.\n\nIn addition, a sensitivity analysis is performed through several \u2018what if? scenarios to assess a com-\npany\u2019s capacity to cope with changes in its operating environment. A scenario analysis is undertaken\nwherein each critical parameter is then stress tested to arrive at the performance of the company in a stress\nsituation, Debt service coverage for cach of the scenarios would indicate the capability of the company to\nservice its debt, under each scenario.\n\n4. Management Evaluation This includes a study of the track record of the management, the manage-\nment\u2019s capacity to overcome adverse situations, goals, philosophy, strategies, control systems, personnel\npolicies, and performance of group companies. An assessment of the management's plan in comparison\nto those of its competitors can provide important insights into the company\u2019s ability to sustain its business.\n\n5. Fundamental Analysis This covers an analysis of liquidity management, asset quality, profitability\nand interest, and tax sensitivity.\n\n+ Liquidity management can be known through a study of capital structure, matching of assets and\nliabilities, liquid assets, maturing deposits, among others.\n\n+ Asset quality includes the company\u2019s credit management, policies for monitoring credit, composi-\ntion of assets, and sector risk.\n\n+ Profitability is examined through a study of profitability ratios, spreads, reserves, and non-business\nincome.\n\n+ Interest and tax ser ity is in terms of exposure to interest rate charges, hedge against interest rate,\ntax provisions, and impact of tax law changes.\n\n\nThe above information is collected and then analysed by a team of professionals in an agency. Compa-\nnies are asked to fill up the forms and provide the required data. If necessary, meetings with top manage-\nment suppliers, and dealers, and a visit to the plant or proposed sites are arranged to collect and confirm\nadditional data and issues relating to credit evaluation of a firm. This team of professionals/analysts sub-\nmits their recommendations to the rating committee. The committee discusses this report and then assigns\nrating. Once the quantitative data is analysed, it is the seasoned judgement of the rating committee, which\nmakes rating of an agency unique and sometimes controversial. Rating involves a lot of subjectivity in the\nprocess; for instance, in case of bond ratings, besides a quantitative analysis of past performance, it is the\nfuture debt servicing capacity of a company that is relevant. An analysis of the estimate of this capacity\nis subjective and subjectivity cannot be ruled out.\n\nThe rating assigned is then notified to the issuer and only on his acceptance, the rating is published.\n\u2018A rating agency assures strict confidentiality of information to its client. If the client wants to furnish\nadditional information, he can do so and gets the rating reviewed again. Once the issuer decides to use\nand publish the rating, the agency has to continuously monitor it over the entire life of the instrument. The\nrating agency continuously monitors the corporate, and rating is monitored till the life of the instrument.\nThis process is known as surveillance.\n\nRating may be upgraded, downgraded, or continue unchanged, depending upon new information or\ndevelopments and their resultant effect on the debt instrument being rated. The revised ratings are also\npublished and made public in financial dailies and newspapers.\n",

Ratings are classified into three grades: high investment grades, investment grades and speculative\ngrades. In all, risk is classified into 14 or 15 categories. Signs \u2018+\u2019 or \u2018\u2014\u2019 are used to show the certainty\nof timely payment. The suffix + or \u2014 may be used to indicate the comparative position of the instrument\nwithin the group covered by the symbol. Thus FAA-lies one notch above FA+. To provide finer gradations,\nrating agencies attach plus or minus symbols to their ratings. The racing symbols for different instruments\nof the same company need not necessarily be the same.\n\nHigh Investment Grades\nAAA: Triple A denotes highest safety in terms of timely payment of interest and principal. The issuer\nis fundamentally strong and any adverse changes are not going to affect it.\nAA: Double A denotes high safety in terms of timely payment of interest and principal. The issuer\ndiffers in safety from AAA issue only marginally.\nA: denotes adequate safety in terms of timely payment of interest and principal. Changes in\ncircumstances can adversely affect such issues.\n\nBBB: Triple B denotes moderate safety in terms of timely payment of interest and principal specula-\ntive grades.\n\nSpeculative Grades\nBB: Double B denotes inadequate safety terms of timely payment of interest and principal.\nUncertain changes can lead to inadequate financial capacity to make timely payments in the\nimmediate future.\n\nB: Denotes high risk, Adverse changes could lead to inability or unwillingness to make timely\npayment.\n\nC: Denotes substantial risk. Issue rated is vulnerable to default.\n\nD: Denotes default in terms of timely payment of interest and principal.\n\nThese symbols are just a current opinion of an agency and they are not recommendations to invest or\nnot to invest. The rating assigned applies to a particular instrument of the company and is not a general\nevaluation of the company.\n\nRating Fees In the credit rating business, the users of rating services, such as investors, financial\nintermediaries and other end-users, do not pay for it. The issuer of the financial instrument pays fees to\nthe credit rating agency and this is the major source of revenue of the rating agency. Today, issuer's fees\nconstitute 95 per cent of the total revenues of rating agencies. In India, rating agencies charge 0.1 per cent\nof instrument size as rating fees. They also charge an annual surveillance fees at a rate of 0.03 per cent to\nmonitor the instrument during its life.\n",

New rating agencies came into existence\nand competition among them increased. There has been a significant increase in volume of rated debt. The\nrating business is going strong because of mandatory rating of IPOs, roll out of Basel II norms, rating of\nsecurity receipts of public-private partnership projects, increased market access by real estate companies,\nrating of urban municipal bonds, and RBI's stipulations that companies with borrowings of 210 crore and\nabove need to get rated. Despite the increase in popularity of rating, the credit rating business suffers from\ncertain limitations.\n\n* The credibility of rating is questionable. The institutions whose instruments were given the highest\nrating have not performed well. For example, CARE gave the highest rating to CRB Capital, which\nfailed. The CRB scam created a panic among investors and credit agencies alike. While investors\nqueued up to prematurely retire their deposits with NBFCs, rating agencies started downgrading\nalmost every company irrespective of their status.\n\nA frequent revision of grading by credit rating agencies, that is, sometimes upgrading and some-\ntimes downgrading, creates a confusion among investors questioning again the credibility of the\nexpertise of rating agencies.\n+ Around a third of the ratings done by credit rating agencies are not accepted by the clients. This has\nled to a competitive relaxation of rating standards by credit rating agencies. It should be mandatory\nto obtain at least two ratings as risk perception of rating agencies differ. Both the ratings should be\nmandatory published in the prospectus, advertisements, and newspapers,\n\nThe rating agencies do not perform an audit but rely solely on information provided by the issuer. If\nthe information provided is inaccurate and incomplete, the rating process is compromized.\n\n\n+ Often a credit rating agency gives a high rating to one instrument of a particular company on the one\n\nhand and on the other, frequently downgrades the rating of another instrument of the same company.\n\nThe rating exercise appears biased and investors not only get confused but lose their investments by\n\ndepending on these ratings.\n\nRating agencies often fail to correctly predict a borrower's financial health in the short-term. The\n\nlatest case is the non-convertible debenture (NCD) issue of BPL which was downgraded by CRISIL\n\nfrom A to D in one stroke. In other words, CRISIL downgraded the instrument by 12 stages. The\ninvestor, who depends on these ratings, is not given any warning by rating agencies to wind down\nhis investment in time.\n\n+ Rating agencies offer consultancy and financial advice to the clients whose papers they rate. This\nleads to a conflict of interest and compromise on their rating process to favour their clients. This has\nbeen highlighted by the financial crisis in the US. Hence, the government is working with regulators\non the new regulatory framework for credit rating agencies.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Types of Factoring\n\nBased on the features built into the factoring transactions, different types of factoring arrangements have\ncome into existence.\n\nRecourse factoring: In recourse factoring, the factor purchases trade debts and essentially renders\ncollection service and maintains sales ledgers. But, in case of default or non-payment by a trade\ndebtor, the client refunds the amount to the factor. Hence, recourse factoring does not include bad-\ndebts protection. It is popular in the developing countries.\n\nNon-recourse factoring: Under non-recourse factoring, the factor\u2019s obligation to the client becomes\nabsolute on the due date of the invoice, irrespective of the payment made or not made by the trade\ndebtor. In other words, if the trade debtor fails to make a payment, the factor cannot recover this\namount from the client. In non-recourse factoring, factor charges are high as they offer the client\nprotection against bad-debts. The loss arising out of irrecoverable receivables is borne by the factor.\nThis type of factoring arrangement is found in developed countries such as UK and USA, where\nreliable credit rating services are available.\n\nAdvance and maturity factoring: Sometimes, the factor and the client make an arrangement\nwhereby the factor pays a pre-specified portion of the factored receivables in advance to the client\n\u2018on submission of necessary documents. This type of arrangement is known as advance factoring.\nThe balance portion is paid upon collection or on the guaranteed payment date. Generally, factoring\nis advance factoring and factor pays 80 per cent of the invoice amount in advance.\n\nUnder maturity factoring no advance payment is made by the factor but payment is made only\non the guaranteed payment date or on the date of collection. Maturity factoring is also known as\ncollection factoring.\n\nOld line factoring: Old line factoring is also known as full factoring as it provides an entire spec-\ntrum of services, such as collection, credit protection, sales ledger administration, and short-term\nfinance. It includes all features of non-recourse and advance factoring.\n\nCross-border factoring/International factoring: In domestic factoring, three parties are involved,\nnamely, customer (buyer), client (seller), and factor (financial institution or intermediary) while in\ninternational factoring there are four parties, namely, exporter (client), importer (customer), export\nfactor, and import factor. Thus, in international business transactions, factoring services are pro-\nvided by factors of both countries, that is, the exporter country\u2019s factor and the importer country\u2019s\nfactor. This is known as cross-border factoring or international factoring.\n\nInvoice discount: Invoice discount is a variant of factoring. It provides finance against invoices\nbacked by letters of credit of banks. The factor provides finance once the letter of credit opening\nbank confirms the due date of payment.\n",

This proportion of finance is higher than the\nbank finance against credit sales.\n\n* The client can offer competitive credit terms to his buyers which, in turn, enable him to increase his\n\nsales and profits.\n\nThe cash realised from credit sales can be used to accelerate the production cycle.\n\nThe client is free from the tensions of monitoring his sales ledger and can concentrate on produc-\n\ntion, marketing, and other aspects. This results in a reduction in overhead expenses and an increase\n\nin sales and profits.\n\n+ Factoring results in a close internation among working capital components of the business. Efficient\nmanagement of one component can have positive impact on other component. For example, an\nincrease in liquidity enables the firm to avail of discounts on purchases of raw materials.\n\n+ The factor provides a comprehensive credit control system by analyzing payment history. This helps\nin assessing the quality of the debtors and monitoring their financial health.\n\n+ The client can expand his business by exploring new markets.\n\nBenefits to Customers (Buyers)\n\nThe benefits that the customers enjoy are as follows:\n\nFactoring facilitates the credit purchases of the customers as they get adequate credit period.\n+ Customers save on bank charges and expenses.\n\nThe customer has not to furnish any documents. He has merely to acknowledge the notification let-\nter, that is, an undertaking to make payment of the invoices to the factor. Customers are furnished\nwith periodical statements of outstanding invoices by the factor.\n\nFactoring does not impinge on the customer's rights vis-a-vis the supplier's in respect of quality of\ngoods, contractual obligations, and so on.\n\nBenefits to Banks\n\nFactoring improves liquidity of the clients and, thereby, improves the quality of advances of banks. Fac-\ntoring is not a threat to banking; it is a financial service complementary to that of the banks.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Comparison of Factoring with Bills Discounting and Cash Credit\n\nBoth bills discounting and cash credit are like factoring as they are short-term sources of finance but they\ndiffer in many respects from factoring.\n\nBills Discounting vis-a-vis Factoring\n\nBills discounting is an individual transaction in the sense that each bill is separately assessed and dis-\ncounted. Factoring is a financial service provided by a financial institution/intermediary on a whole\nturnover basis. Factoring is the provision of bulk finance against several unpaid trade invoices. This\ngives the client the liberty to draw desired finance only.\n\nIn case of bills discounting, each bill has to be individually accepted by the drawee, which takes\ntime. In factoring a one-time notification is taken from the customer at the commencement of the\nfacility.\n\nBills discounting is an expensive short-term source of finance as stamp duty is charged on certain\nusance bills together with bank charges. In case of factoring, no stamp duty is charged on the\ninvoices and hence it is less expensive than bills discounting.\n\nBills discounting involves more paper work as compared to factoring.\n\nIn case of bills discounting, the grace period for payment is usually three days while in case of fac-\ntoring, the grace period is higher.\n\nBills discounting requires submission of original documents such as bill of lading, challans, and\ninvoices. Only copies of such documents are required in factoring.\n\nIn bills discounting, charges are normally upfront whereas there are no upfront charges in case of\nfactoring. Finance charges are levied on the amount of money withdrawn.\n\nBills discounting is not an off-balance sheet mode of financing while factoring is.\n\nBills discounting is more domestic-related and usually falls within the working limits set by the\nbank for the customer. Factoring may be domestic or international and is not concerned with the\nworking capital limits set by the bank.\n\nBills discounting does not involve assignment of debts while factoring involves assignment of debts.\n\nCash Credit vis-a-vis Factoring\n\nCommercial banks allot two types of credit limits for their clients\u2014the cash credit limit and the loan\nlimit. The cash credit limit is for working capital requirement and is short-term in nature. The cash credit\nfunds can be withdrawn at a short notice for working capital requirements.\n\n+ In cash credit, the margin retained on receivables is usually 40 to 50 per cent as banks have no means\nof following up sundry debtors, while in case of factoring, the margin retained is 20 per cent.\n\n+ In case of cash credit, the drawing power on the basis of stock statements is computed once a\nmonth. If invoices are raised between submission of stock statement, no money can be drawn\nagainst them. Factoring is like cash sales\u2014prepayments against invoices are made as and when\nthey are factored.\n\nIn case of cash credit, the client has to submit various statements to the bank while no statements are\nto be submitted to the factor. On the contrary, the factor furnishes various reports to both the client\nand the customer.\n\nThe bank does not provide collection services to its clients while a factor renders debt collection\nservice to its clients.\n\nIn case of cash credit, once a book debt exceeds its usance period, it is removed from the eligible list.\nIn factoring, the factor allows generous grace period on factored receivables.\n\nTo avail cash credit facilities, processing fees are about one per cent of the limit and interest is linked\nto the prime lending rate. In case of factoring, the maximum processing fees are fixed and finance\ncharge is linked to the cost of funds.\n\nThus, factoring tends to increase the number of rotations by converting credit sales into cash sales in\na manner that banks cannot accomplish.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "International Factoring\n\nInternational factoring facilitates international trade. It is a comprehensive range of receivables man-\nagement and financing services wherein a factor provides an exporter with at least two of the following\nservices:\n\n* Credit management and bad debt protection.\n\n* Credit guarantee.\n\n+ Finance upto 90 per cent of the invoice value on shipment to approved debtor.\n* Collection services.\n\n+ Professional sales ledger and analysis.\n\nInternational factoring eases much of the credit and collection burden created by international sales.\nExport receivables that can be factored should have the following characteristics:\n\n+ The buyer's country should be covered by the factor.\n\n* The exporter\u2019s performance obligation should be completed at the time the exporter presents an\ninvoice for prepayment.\n\n* There should be multiple shipments or a continuous sales flow on an ongoing basis with the same\nbuyer or buyers. There should be assignment of the whole turnover with a buyer on a continuous\nbasis.\n\n+ Factoring transactions are best suited for credit periods upto 180 days and factoring facilities are\ntypically provided for \u2018open-account\u2019 transactions. In the absence of this, the buyers would have to\nopen a letter of credit (LC), thereby blocking bank limits.\n\nNeed for International Factoring\n\nAn exporter requires international factoring services to relieve him of the problems of collecting receiva-\nbles in a foreign country and the tensions arising from the unfamiliarity with the customer\u2019s creditworthi-\nness. Moreover, the demand for open account trading, where the importer makes the payment after he\nreceives the goods, has expanded globally and Indian exporters are also required to offer similar terms\nto importers in order to remain competitive. This has created a demand for better credit risk protection\nservices arising out of importers delaying payments or not making any payments at all. International\nfactoring provides credit assessment and protection, financing and collection services to exporters for\nregular sales in open account terms. International factoring requires no collateral or letter of credit (LC).\nA letter from a bank to a foreign bank authorizing the payment of a specified sum to the person or com-\npany named is known as letter of credit (LC). Letters of credit are widely used as a means of payment for\ngoods in foreign trade.\n\n\u2018An export factor in India pays 90 per cent as advance on the approved invoices and also gives a 100\nper cent risk protection on the receivables in the event of the buyer's failure to pay including insolvency.\n\nBenefits of International Factoring\n\n\u2018The exporter deals with only one factor even if his exports are spread across different countries. He can\nobtain experience of the correspondent factor not only in terms of getting an access to the creditworthi-\nness of the buyer but also in legal laws and business practices of these countries. The exporter\u2019s risk and\nbad debts are reduced. He can expand his business by exploring new markets.\n\nThe importer also benefits as he pays the invoice amount to a factoring company in his own country.\nThis is similar to making payment to domestic suppliers. The importer gets an access to open account\ncredit terms. In the absence of this, he would have to open letter of credit (LC), thereby blocking his\nbank limits.\n\nHlow Chart of International Factoring Transaction\n\nIn international factoring, there are four parties, that is, the exporter (client), the importer (customer),\nthe export factor, and the import factor (Figure 20.2). International factoring is a two factor system. The\nexport factor services the needs of clients in India while the import factor undertakes the credit assess-\nment of customer keeping in view the macro-conditions of the country and industry specific factors. It\nalso undertakes collections and follow-up required for realization on maturity.\n\nIn international factoring, there is no bank involved in the transaction. Alll the necessary documenta-\ntions and the RBI formalities are performed by the export factor who is an authorized dealer.\n\n* The exporter receives an order or regularly receives orders from an importer or importers and is able\nto estimate the financing requirement.\n\n+ The exporter provides the export factor with contact details of its customers alongwith estimates\n\nof the credit limits. The export factor forwards these details to correspondent import factors in the\n\nrelevant country.\n\nOn approval of the exporter\u2019s credit limits, the exporter enters into a factoring agreement with the\n\nexport factor.\n\nThe exporter ships the goods to his customer (importer).\n\nThe exporter submits the relevant documents such as invoice, bill of lading/airway bill, GR form,\n\nand so on to the export factor.\n+ The export factor scrutinises the documents and makes a prepayment as agreed upon to the\nexporter.\na Se) (1) Receives Order\nExporter Importer (2) Credit Limit Request\n\n(3) Approval\n\n(4) Delivers Goods\n\n(5) Submits Documents\n(2) |(3) | (8) | (6) (10) (8) (6) Prepayment\n\na.\n= (7) Documents\n(8) Collection\nExport Factor a Inport Factor (9) Payment Remittance\n\n(10) Balance Payment\n\nSource: Global Trade Finance Private Limited.\n\nFigure 20.2 International Factoring Transaction\n\n* The export factor directly forwards the documents to the customer(s) under advice to the correspon-\ndent factors.\n\n+ The correspondent factor (import factor) follows up with the customers and collect payments from\nthem.\n\n+ The correspondent factor (import factor) collects the payment and immediately remits it to the\nexport factor.\n\n+ On collection, the export factor credits the balance payment to the exporter\u2019s account after adjusting\nfor prepayments made.\n\nFactoring is most suitable for manufacturing and trading companies.

However, such as NBFCs\nwas required to raise the asset/income percentage as required at 7(i) above or unwind the factor-\ning business within a period of 2 years from the date of the above notification. It would be granted\nCoR as NBFC-Factor only after it reaches the required asset/income percentage.\n\nIn view of the above, the criteria regarding asset and income of factoring companies eligible for bank\nfinance have been reviewed. Accordingly, banks can henceforth extend financial assistance to support the\nfactoring business of factoring companies which comply with the following criteria:\n\n(a) The companies qualify as factoring companies and carry out their business under the provisions\nof the Factoring Regulation Act, 2011 and notifications issued by the reserve bank in this regard\nfrom time to time.\n\n(b) They derive at least 75 per cent of their income from factoring activity.\n\n(c) The receivables purchased/financed, irrespective of whether on \u2018with recourse\u2019 or \u2018without\nrecourse\u201d basis, form at least 75 per cent of the assets of the factoring company.\n\n(d) The assets/income referred to above would not include the assets/income relating to any bill dis-\ncounting facility extended by the factoring company.\n\n(c) The financial assistance extended by the factoring companies is secured by hypothecation or\nassignment of receivables in their favour.\n\n5. Conduct of Business ~The NBFC-Factors shall conduct the business of factoring in accordance with\nthe Act and the rules and regulations framed under the Act from time to time.\n\n6.

The receivable acquired under factoring which is not paid within such period of due date as\napplicable, should be treated as Non-Performing Asset (NPA) irrespective of when the receivable\nwas acquired by the factor or whether the factoring was carried out on \u201cwith recourse\u201d basis or\n\u201cnon-recourse\u201d basis. The entity on which the exposure was booked should be shown as NPA and\nprovisioning made accordingly.\n\n6A.

More\nthan I lakh businesses are currently using factoring to settle trade transactions with some seven million\ncustomers worldwide. The worldwide factoring volume is now over \u20ac2,376 billion a year. In the US, there\nare 120 factoring companies with a total turnover of \u20ac95,000 million. Asia is the second largest continent\nfor factoring forming 23.8 percent of the world total factoring volume. China is the largest factoring mar-\nket in Asia. In India, the domestic and international factoring volume is 2500 million euros and 1200 mil-\nlion euros, respectively. Higher domestic and international factoring volume is also expected to grow in\nIndia following the deregulation of some of the rules on factoring by the Reserve Bank of India. The fac-\ntoring volume is quite low in India. The factors inhibiting the growth of factoring volumes are as follows:\n\n+ Lack of a credit appraisal system and authentic information about customers and clients restricts\nthe growth of this business. As against this, in the UK and the USA, companies like Dunn and\nBradstreet are engaged in credit appraisal systems. Factors rely on their reports to enter into factor-\ning arrangements.\n\n+ Higher stamp duty on assigning of debt increases the cost of the client which reduces factoring\narrangements.\n\n+ Non-availability of permission to factoring companies for raising their debt restricts their financing\ncapacity and thereby the growth of the market.\n\nTo remove such limitations and to boost factoring, the following can be suggested:\n\nEliminate or reduce the stamp duty.\nDevelop a separate company which would give a true and fair credit appraisal report, covering all\naspects of the client and his customers account.\n\nThe debt raising capacity of factoring companies should be increased.\n\nA factoring law which would address the present inadequacies and impediments should be framed\nand passed.\n\nWorkshops and seminars should be organized by factoring companies to increase awareness and\nusefulness of factoring among small scale units.\n\nFactoring companies should extend their network of branches especially to those areas where small\nscale units are located.\n",

Here, it refers to the exporter relinquishing his\nright to a receivable due at a future date in exchange for immediate cash payment, at an agreed discount,\npassing all risks and responsibilities for collecting the debt to the forfaiter.\n\nForfaiting evolved in the 1960s. This concept was originally developed to help finance German exports\nto the Eastern bloc countries. The buyers of the Eastern bloc countries required credit and their need could\nnot be fulfilled through the then existing modes of finance. This gave birth to a new concept\u2014forfaiting.\n\nInitially, it was in Switzerland that many forfaiting houses mushroomed but over the last decade, Lon-\ndon has been the main centre for this market.\n\nIn India, the RBI vide its circular AD (GP Series) No. 3 dated February 13, 1992, approved forfaiting\nas an export financing option. Exim Bank was the first institution which got approval in 1992 to finance\nexports through forfaiting. Forfaiting facility is provided by an international forfaiting agency and a for-\nfaiting transaction is routed through an authorized dealer (AD). This authorized dealer provides services\nsuch as handling documentation and providing customs clarification for GR form purposes. Forfaiting\nproceeds are to be received in India as soon as possible after shipment but within the 180-day period\nspecified by the RBI for all exports.\n\nInitially, forfaiting developed as a fixed interest rate and medium-term (3 to 5 years) financing. Now\nit can be tailor-made to suit the exporter\u2019s requirements on the basis of interest rate, credit period, mora-\ntorium, and variable shipment schedule. Forfaiting can now be structured on a floating rate basis as\nwell as for shorter and longer periods ranging between 60 days to 10 years. It is also possible to finance\nmultinational corporates or state-owned entities risks. Earlier, the concept was restricted to post ship-\nment finance. Now the concept has been extended to provide pre-export finance, structured trade finance,\nproject finance, and even working capital.\n",

An aval means\nan unconditional financial obligation; it takes the form of an endorsement on a debt instrument like\na promissory note or bills of exchange. The act of giving an aval is known as avalizing. It represents\nan irrevocable, unconditional, and fully transferable guarantee given by the foreign buyer's local\nbank and is normally a requirement in forfaiting transaction.\n\nForfaiting is suitable for high-value exports such as capital goods, consumer durables, vehicles,\nconsultancy and construction contracts, project exports, and bulk commodities. Forfaiting is also\nsuitable for low value but repetitive products, including pharmaceuticals, dyes and chemicals, cotton\ntextiles and yarn, leather and garments, granite, handicrafts, and carpets.\n\nForfaiting is used in the following situations:\n\n+ There is a request for deferred payment for more than 60 days.\n\n* The contract is for at least USD 1,00,000 or its equivalent, in a freely convertible currency, and when\neach shipment is not less than USD 25,000.\n\n+ Either a letter of credit or a bank guarantee is available or the exporter believes that the buyer is an\nacceptable stand alone risk.\n\n* The sale is made to a buyer in a high credit risk country.\n\n* The exporters\u2019 own bank limits are inadequate or not available.\n",

In other words, it eliminates risks\nsuch as commercial risk, political risk, transfer risk, interest risk, and exchange risk.\n\nIt improves the liquidity of the exporter as it converts credit sales into a cash transaction.\n\nIt also relieves the balance sheet of contingent liabilities and helps the exporter to undertake more\nexports.\n\nIt enhances the competitive advantage of the exporter by enabling the exporter to provide more\ncredit, which increases the attractiveness of his offer. This, in turn, increases the volume of business\nand his ability to do business in risky countries.\n\nIt relieves the exporter from administration and collection hassles.\n\nIts documentation procedure is simple, enabling exporters to forfait transactions quickly and efficiently.\nIt does not affect the existing banking limits of the exporter.\n\nForfaiting is transaction specific and hence does not require a long-term banking relationship with\nthe forfaiter.\n\nThe exporter saves on insurance costs as forfeiting obviates the need for export credit insurance.\nForfaiting is beneficial to the importer also. For the importer, forfaiting is an alternative form of financ-\ning capacity that increases and diversifies borrowing capacity, speeds the conclusion of commercial\ncontract, avoids restrictive borrowing covenants, and frees him from administrative and legal hassles.\n",
