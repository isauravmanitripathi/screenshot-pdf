Key Points:

1. **Definition and Misconceptions**: Artificial intelligence (AI) is a poorly defined term encompassing various disciplines that have been subject to research, hype, and misconceptions about machine thinking.

2. **Current Capabilities**: Machines today do not "think" like humans but utilize algorithms that effectively approximate complex, nonlinear processes to automate tasks previously done by humans.

3. **Example of AI Application**: The language model GPT-2 exemplifies AI's capability to generate coherent text from prompts, highlighting the technology's complexity and ability to construct sentence structures.

4. **Learning Mechanism**: AI systems acquire abilities through examples rather than through handcrafted rules, challenging the notion that intelligence requires self-awareness.

5. **Relevance of Machine Intelligence**: The philosophical debate surrounding whether machines can "think" may be less significant than practical applications, likening it to an unrelated question about submarines.

6. **Deep Learning**: The discussed algorithms fall under deep learning, which involves training deep neural networks with large datasets to approximate complex functions and perform tasks traditionally associated with human intelligence.

7. **Functional Capabilities**: Deep learning enables the development of programs that perform tasks, such as image recognition and text-to-speech, which were previously exclusive to humans.
