OFF-BUDGET BORROWINGS\n\nWhy in the news?\n\nCentre for Social and Economic Progress (CSEP) recently released a report on \u2018Off-Budget Borrowings (OBB)\u2019\nby Indian Governments.\n\nAbout OBBs\n\n\u00ab OBBs refer to borrowings that are not reflected in the budget, even though budgetary resources will have\nto be used for their repayment.\noc. Thus, OBB is not part of the calculation of the fiscal indicators despite fiscal implications.\n\n* OBBs are taken not by government directly but by another public institution on its direction.\no For example, loan by FCI for paying food subsidy bill (this practice is discontinued from FY 2020-21).\n\nReasons for resorting to OBB\n\n\u00ab Bypass Fiscal Deficit targets under the FRBM Act, 2003,\n\u00ab Avoid borrowing limits under Article 293 (3) of the Constitution.\n\no Article mandates States to take consent of the Centre before raising any loan if they have any\noutstanding loan to the Centre or loans where the Centre is the guarantor.\n\n\u00ab Avoid delay in central grants, or reduction in other sources of revenue.\nImplications of high OBB\n\n\u00ab Ahidden liability that may lead to a debt trap for the government.\n\n\u00ab Adversely affects the accountability as it is generally scrutinized.\n\nMethods of OBB: National Savings Schemes Government Fully Serviced Bond, Domestic /Foreign Market\nborrowings, etc.\n\n2.3. CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT (CAD)\n\nWhy in the news?\n\nThe CAD widened to $9.2 billion from $1.3 billion in Quarter 1 of Financial Year 2024. Although, later it declined\nto 1% of gross domestic product (GDP) in Quarter 2 (2023-24).\n\nAbout Current Account Deficit (CAD)\n\n* Balance of Payments (BoP) records the transactions in goods, services, and assets between residents of a\ncountry with the rest of the world for a specified time period typically a year.\n\n* Current Account is one of the two accounts in the Balance of Payments (BoP).

Higher oil prices contribute to increased import costs, affecting the overall CAD.\n\n\u00ab Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Decline: Net FDI declined in the financial account, influencing the overall\nbalance.\n\nPotential threats from increasing CAD\n\nBased on historical perspective, India can sustain a CAD of 2.5-3.0% of GDP without getting into an external\nsector crisis (Economic Survey 2021-22). But a deficit beyond that can have an impact on following -\n\n\u00ab Foreign investment: Pull out of foreign institutional investors or limited capital flow.\n\n\u00ab Exchange Rate: High Current Account Deficit for a long term decreases the global demand of the currency\nand can lead to a situation of free fall in currency exchange rate.\n\n\u00ab Inflation: Price instability in turn fuels inflationary concerns, leading to further reduction in domestic\nsavings, leading to lower investments or foreign borrowing to fund growth needs.\n\n\u00ab Payment imbalances: They can lead to a BoP crisis as was observed in the Asian Financial Crisis (1997) and\nthe recent Sri Lankan crisis.\n\n2.4.

Further, ICRR was\ndiscontinued in phased manner as liquidity situation stabilized.\n\nCRR and ICRR\n\n* Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR): It is the share of a bank\u2019s Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL) that is\nmandated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to be maintained with the latter as reserves in the form of liquid\ncash.\n\no Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL) shows the difference between the sum of demand and time\nliabilities (deposits) of a bank (with the public or the other bank) and the deposits in the form of assets\nheld by the other bank.\n\no As per the RBI Act 1934, all Scheduled Commercial Banks (that includes public and private sector\nbanks, foreign banks, regional rural banks, and cooperative banks) are required to maintain the CRR.\n\n* Incremental Cash Reserve Ratio (ICRR): |-CRR is similar to the CRR, wherein banks need to set aside a\ncertain portion of their money with the RBI. They do not earn any interest on this. It has following differences-\n\noc RBIhas the option to impose ICRR in addition to the CRR.\no Theinterest rate charged would be different from CRR.\n\ne\n\nHow ICRR is applied along with CRR?\n\nApplication of only CRR Application of ICRR with CRR\n\nLet NDTL\nbe Rs. 100\n\nLet new NDTL\nbe Rs. 150\n\nIncrease in\nNDTL be Rs. 50\n\nApplication Application\nApplication of of CRR of ICRR\nCRR at 4.5% at 4.5% at10o%\nRs.4.5 Rs. 6.75 Rs.5\n| Deposit form CRR | Deposit form CRR + Deposit form ICRR |\nTotal maintenance with Total maintenance with RBI Rs.11.75\n\nRBI Rs. 4.5\n\nEffect of ICRR\n\n* Manage Liquidity: There was a recent increase in liquidity in the economy due to a pickup in government\nspending, sustained foreign inflows, and withdrawal of Rs. 2000 notes, among others.\n\n\u00ab Inflation Control: India\u2019s retail inflation (measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI)) rose to 7.5% in July\ncompared with 4.9% in June. Hence requiring a tighter monetary policy.\n\n\u00ab Banking Resilience: The incremental CRR increases protection against the potential threat of Bank Run.\no Bank Run is when the customers of a bank or other financial institution withdraw their deposits at the\n\nsame time over fears about the Bank\u2019s solvency.\n\n* Decreased Lending: Lower lending will, in turn, bring down demand for goods and services, reducing the\n\nAggregate Demand of the Economy.\n\n\nOther Liquidity Management Tools\n\n* Standing Deposit Facility (SDF): SDF allows the RBI to absorb liquidity (deposit) from banks without\ngiving government securities in return to the banks.\n\n* Altering Repo and Reverse repo rates: Altering these rates directly affects the deposit rate in banks as\nwell as their lending rates.\n\n* Open Market Operation (OMO): OMO refers to sale or purchase of government securities (bonds) by\nthe RBI.\n\n* Ways and Means Advances (WMA): It is a temporary loan facility to the central and state governments.\n\n4.2.

Later, the\nmaintenance of the benchmark was brought under the purview of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority\n(FCA).\n\n* Calculation: Before 2021, LIBOR was calculated for five currencies (U.S. dollar, Euro, Pound, Swiss Franc\nand Japanese Yen) for seven tenors.\n\no. After the announcement of its phased rollback in March 2021, only U.S.-dollar LIBOR was allowed to\nbe published.\n\nLIBOR transition benefits to India\n\n\u00ab Reduction in financing cost as the calculation of reference rates going forward will be more robust and\ntransparent.\n\n\u00ab Reduced borrowing costs as lenders and investors may require lower interest rates or spreads.\n\n* More competition: The introduction of alternate reference rates may introduce more competition in the\nmarket for reference o\n\nBy Alternatives for LIBOR\n\nrates.\nIndia\u2019s Transition Scenario\n\n* Alternative Reference\n\nRates (ARRs): The RBI has\nestablished a system of \u00a9) \u20ac @ \u00ae 6\n\nAlternative Reference Us's Europe's Japan's China's India\u2019s\nRates (ARRs) that allows Secured European Tokyo Shanghai Modified\n\nOvernight Interbank interbank Interbank Mumbai\nbanks to choose rates Financing Offered offered Offered Interbank\nfrom a basket of Rate (EuRIBOR) Rate Rate Forward\ncurrencies rather than the (SOFR) (TIBOR) (SHIBOR) Outright\nBritish pound for (unaror)\ninternational financial\n\ntransactions.\no RBI has added Modified MIFOR to the list of significant benchmarks administered by FBIL.\n\nFallback Clause: RBI has pushed for the insertion of fallback clauses in all remaining legacy financial\n\ncontracts that reference LIBOR or MIFOR.\n\nco The fallback clause refers to an agreement for revised considerations when the reference rate is no\nmore published \u2014 important for transparency and consistency.\n\nFinancial Benchmarks India Pvt Ltd (FBIL)\n\nGenesis: It was formed in 2014 as a private limited\n\ncompany under the Companies Act, 2013.\n\n0 Itis jointly owned by Fixed Income Money Market and\nDerivatives Association of India (FIMMDA), Foreign\nExchange Dealers Association of India (FEDA) and\nIndian bank Association (IBA).\n\nObjective: Its aim is to develop and administer\n\nbenchmarks relating to money market, government\n\nsecurities and foreign exchange in India.\n\nRegulation: FBIL is regulated by the Reserve bank of India.\n\nuP\n\nro\nFunctions of FBIL\nCollection and submission of market\ndata and information including polled\ndata\n\n$\n\nFormulation, adoption and periodic\nreview of benchmark calculation\nmethodologies\n\nCalculation, publication and\nadministration of benchmark.\n\n",
