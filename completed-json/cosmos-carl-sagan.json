I shall have no more if I possess worlds. By space the universe\n\nencompasses and swallows me up like an atom; by thought I comprehend the world.\n- Blaise Pascal, Pens\u00e9es\n\nThe known is finite, the unknown infinite; intellectually we stand on an islet in the\nmidst of an illimitable ocean of inexplicability. Our business in every generation is\nto reclaim a little more land.\n\n- T. H. Huxley, 1887\n\nThe Cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be. Our feeblest contemplations of the\nCosmos stir us - there is a tingling in the spine, a catch in the voice, a faint sensation, as ifa\ndistant memory, of falling from a height. We know we are approaching the greatest of\nmysteries.\n\nThe size and age of the Cosmos are beyond ordinary human understanding. Lost\nsomewhere between immensity and eternity is our tiny planetary home. In a cosmic\nperspective, most human concerns seem insignificant, even petty. And yet our species is\nyoung and curious and brave and shows much promise. In the last few millennia we have\nmade the most astonishing and unexpected discoveries about the Cosmos and our place\nwithin it, explorations that are exhilarating to consider. They remind us that humans have\nevolved to wonder, that understanding is a joy, that knowledge is prerequisite to survival. I\nbelieve our future depends on how well we know this Cosmos in which we float like a mote\nof dust in the morning sky.\n\nThose explorations required skepticism and imagination both. Imagination will\noften carry us to worlds that never were. But without it, we go nowhere. Skepticism enables\nus to distinguish fancy from fact, to test our speculations. The Cosmos is rich beyond\nmeasure - in elegant facts, in exquisite interrelationships, in the subtle machinery of awe.\n\nThe surface of the Earth is the shore of the cosmic ocean. From it we have learned\n\nmost of what we know. Recently, we have waded a little out to sea, enough to dampen our\ntoes or, at most, wet our ankles. The water seems inviting. The ocean calls. Some part of\nour being knows this is from where we came. We long to return. These aspirations are not,\nI think, irreverent, although they may trouble whatever gods may be.\n\nThe dimensions of the Cosmos are so large that using familiar units of distance,\nsuch as meters or miles, chosen for their utility on Earth, would make little sense. Instead,\nwe measure distance with the speed of light. In one second a beam of light travels 186,000\nmiles, nearly 300,000 kilometers or seven times around the Earth. In eight minutes it will\ntravel from the Sun to the Earth. We can say the Sun is eight light-minutes away. In a year,\nit crosses nearly ten trillion kilometers, about six trillion miles, of intervening space. That\nunit of length, the distance light goes in a year, is called a light-year. It measures not time\nbut distances - enormous distances.\n\nThe Earth is a place. It is by no means the only place. It is not even a typical place.\nNo planet or star or galaxy can be typical, because the Cosmos is mostly empty. The only\ntypical place is within the vast, cold, universal vacuum, the everlasting night of\nintergalactic space, a place so strange and desolate that, by comparison, planets and stars\nand galaxies seem achingly rare and lovely. If we were randomly inserted into the Cosmos,\nthe chance that we would find ourselves on or near a planet would be less than one in a\nbillion trillion trillion* (10\u00b0, a one followed by 33 zeroes). In everyday life such odds are\ncalled compelling. Worlds are precious.\n\n* We use the American scientific convention for large numbers: one billion = 1,000,000,000 = 10\u00b0;\none trillion = 1,000,000,000,000= 10\u201d, etc. The exponent counts the number of zeroes after the one.\n\nFrom an intergalactic vantage point we would see, strewn like sea froth on the\nwaves of space, innumerable faint, wispy tendrils of light. These are the galaxies. Some are\nsolitary wanderers; most inhabit communal clusters, huddling together, drifting endlessly in\nthe great cosmic dark. Before us is the Cosmos on the grandest scale we know. We are in\nthe realm of the nebulae, eight billion light-years from Earth, halfway to the edge of the\nknown universe.\n\nA galaxy is composed of gas and dust and stars billions upon billions of stars. Every\nstar may be a sun to someone. Within a galaxy are stars and worlds and, it may be, a\nproliferation of living things and intelligent beings and spacefaring civilizations. But from\nafar, a galaxy reminds me more of a collection of lovely found objects - seashells, perhaps,\nor corals, the productions of Nature laboring for aeons in the cosmic ocean.\n\nThere are some hundred billion do! ) galaxies, each with, on the average, a hundred\nbillion stars. In all the galaxies, there are perhaps as many planets as stars, 10'! x 10'!~\n10\u201d, ten billion trillion. In the face of such overpowering numbers, what is the likelihood\nthat only one ordinary star, the Sun, is accompanied by an inhabited planet? Why should\nwe, tucked away in some forgotten corner of the Cosmos, be so fortunate? To me, it seems\nfar more likely that the universe is brimming over with life. But we humans do not yet\nknow. We are just beginning our explorations. From eight billion light-years away we are\nhard pressed to find even the cluster in which our Milky Way Galaxy is embedded, much\nless the Sun or the Earth. The only planet we are sure is inhabited is a tiny speck of rock\nand metal, shining feebly by reflected sunlight, and at this distance utterly lost.\n\nBut presently our journey takes us to what astronomers on Earth like to call the\nLocal Group of galaxies. Several million light-years across, it is composed of some twenty\n\nconstituent galaxies. It is a sparse and obscure and unpretentious cluster. One of these\ngalaxies is M31, seen from the Earth in the constellation Andromeda. Like other spiral\ngalaxies, it is a huge pinwheel of stars, gas and dust. M31 has two small satellites, dwarf\nelliptical galaxies bound to it by gravity, by the identical law of physics that tends to keep\nme in my chair. The laws of nature are the same throughout the Cosmos. We are now two\nmillion light-years from home.\n\nBeyond M31 is another, very similar galaxy, our own, its spiral arms turning\nslowly, once every quarter billion years. Now, forty thousand light-years from home, we\nfind ourselves falling toward the massive center of the Milky Way. But if we wish to find\nthe Earth, we must redirect our course to the remote outskirts of the Galaxy, to an obscure\nlocale near the edge of a distant spiral arm.\n\nOur overwhelming impression, even between the spiral arms, is of stars streaming\nby us - a vast array of exquisitely self-luminous stars, some as flimsy as a soap bubble and\nso large that they could contain ten thousand Suns or a trillion Earths; others the size of a\nsmall town and a hundred trillion times denser than lead. Some stars are solitary, like the\nSun. Most have companions. Systems are commonly double, two stars orbiting one\nanother. But there is a continuous gradation from triple systems through loose clusters of a\nfew dozen stars to the great globular clusters, resplendent with a million suns. Some double\nstars are so close that they touch, and starstuff flows beneath them. Most are as separated as\nJupiter is from the Sun. Some stars, the supernovae, are as bright as the entire galaxy that\ncontains them; others, the black holes, are invisible from a few kilometers away. Some\nshine with a constant brightness; others flicker uncertainly or blink with an unfaltering\nrhythm. Some rotate in stately elegance; others spin so feverishly that they distort\nthemselves to oblateness. Most shine mainly in visible and infrared light; others are also\nbrilliant sources of X-rays or radio waves. Blue stars are hot and young; yellow stars,\nconventional and middle-aged; red stars, often elderly and dying; and small white or black\nstars are in the final throes of death. The Milky Way contains some 400 billion stars of all\nsorts moving with a complex and orderly grace. Of all the stars, the inhabitants of Earth\nknow close-up, so far, but one.\n\nEach star system is an island in space, quarantined from its neighbors by the light-\nyears. I can imagine creatures evolving into glimmerings of knowledge on innumerable\nworlds, every one of them assuming at first their puny planet and paltry few suns to be all\nthat is. We grow up in isolation. Only slowly do we teach ourselves the Cosmos.\n\nSome stars may be surrounded by millions of lifeless and rocky worldlets, planetary\nsystems frozen at some early stage in their evolution. Perhaps many stars have planetary\nsystems rather like our own: at the periphery, great gaseous ringed planets and icy moons,\nand nearer to the center, small, warm, blue-white, cloud-covered worlds. On some,\nintelligent life may have evolved, reworking the planetary surface in some massive\nengineering enterprise. These are our brothers and sisters in the Cosmos. Are they very\ndifferent from us? What is their form, biochemistry, neurobiology, history, politics, science,\ntechnology, art, music, religion, philosophy? Perhaps some day we will know them.\n\nWe have now reached our own backyard, a light-year from Earth. Surrounding our\nSun is a spherical swarm of giant snow-balls composed of ice and rock and organic\nmolecules: the cometary nuclei. Every now and then a passing star gives a tiny gravitational\ntug, and one of them obligingly careens into the inner solar system. There the Sun heats it,\nthe ice is vaporized, and a lovely cometary tail develops.\n\nWe approach the planets of our system, largish worlds, captives of the Sun,\n\ngravitationally constrained to follow nearly circular orbits, heated mainly by sunlight.\nPluto, covered with methane ice and accompanied by its solitary giant moon Charon, is\nilluminated by a distant Sun, which appears as no more than a bright point of light in a\npitchblack sky. The giant gas worlds, Neptune, Uranus, Saturn - the jewel of the solar\nsystem - and Jupiter all have an entourage of icy moons. Interior to the region of gassy\nplanets and orbiting icebergs are the warm, rocky provinces of the inner solar system. There\nis, for example, the red planet Mars, with soaring volcanoes, great rift valleys, enormous\nplanet-wide sandstorms, and, just possibly, some simple forms of life. All the planets orbit\nthe Sun, the nearest star, an inferno of hydrogen and helium gas engaged in thermonuclear\nreactions, flooding the solar system with light.\n\nFinally, at the end of all our wanderings, we return to our tiny, fragile, blue-white\nworld, lost in a cosmic ocean vast beyond our most courageous imaginings. It is a world\namong an immensity of others. It may be significant only for us. The Earth is our home, our\nparent. Our kind of life arose and evolved here. The human species is coming of age here. It\nis on this world that we developed our passion for exploring the Cosmos, and it is here that\nwe are, in some pain and with no guarantees, working out our destiny.\n\nWelcome to the planet Earth - a place of blue nitrogen skies, oceans of liquid water,\ncool forests and soft meadows, a world positively rippling with life. In the cosmic\nperspective it is, as I have said, poignantly beautiful and rare; but it is also, for the moment,\nunique. In all our journeying through space and time, it is, so far, the only world on which\nwe know with certainty that the matter of the Cosmos has become alive and aware. There\nmust be many such worlds scattered through space, but our search for them begins here,\nwith the accumulated wisdom of the men and women of our species, garnered at great cost\nover a million years. We are privileged to live among brilliant and passionately inquisitive\npeople, and in a time when the search for knowledge is generally prized. Human beings,\nborn ultimately of the stars and now for a while inhabiting a world called Earth, have begun\ntheir long voyage home.\n\nThe discovery that the Earth is a /ittle world was made, as so many important\nhuman discoveries were, in the ancient Near East, in a time some humans call the third\ncentury B.C., in the greatest metropolis of the age, the Egyptian city of Alexandria. Here\nthere lived a man named Eratosthenes. One of his envious contemporaries called him\n\u2018Beta,\u2019 the second letter of the Greek alphabet, because, he said, Eratosthenes was second\nbest in the world in everything. But it seems clear that in almost everything Eratosthenes\nwas \u2018Alpha.\u2019 He was an astronomer, historian, geographer, philosopher, poet, theater critic\nand mathematician. The titles of the books he wrote range from Astronomy to On Freedom\n\nfrom Pain. He was also the director of the great library of Alexandria, where one day he\nread in a papyrus book that in the southern frontier outpost of Syene, near the first cataract\nof the Nile, at noon on June 21 vertical sticks cast no shadows. On the summer solstice, the\nlongest day of the year, as the hours crept toward midday, the shadows of temple columns\ngrew shorter. At noon, they were gone. A reflection of the Sun could then be seen in the\nwater at the bottom of a deep well. The Sun was directly overhead.\n\nIt was an observation that someone else might easily have ignored. Sticks, shadows,\nreflections in wells, the position of the Sun - of what possible importance could such simple\neveryday matters be? But Eratosthenes was a scientist, and his musings on these\ncommonplaces changed the world; in a way, they made the world. Eratosthenes had the\npresence of mind to do an experiment, actually to observe whether in Alexandria vertical\nsticks cast shadows near noon on June 21. And, he discovered, sticks do.\n\nEratosthenes asked himself how, at the same moment, a stick in Syene could cast no\nshadow and a stick in Alexandria, far to the north, could cast a pronounced shadow.\nConsider a map of ancient Egypt with two vertical sticks of equal length, one stuck in\nAlexandria, the other in Syene. Suppose that, at a certain moment, each stick casts no\nshadow at all. This is perfectly easy to understand - provided the Earth is flat. The Sun\nwould then be directly overhead. If the two sticks cast shadows of equal length, that also\nwould make sense on a flat Earth: the Sun\u2019s rays would then be inclined at the same angle\nto the two sticks. But how could it be that at the same instant there was no shadow at Syene\nand a substantial shadow at Alexandria?\n\nThe only possible answer, he saw, was that the surface of the Earth is curved. Not\nonly that: the greater the curvature, the greater the difference in the shadow lengths. The\nSun is so far away that its rays are parallel when they reach the Earth. Sticks placed at\ndifferent angles to the Sun\u2019s rays cast shadows of different lengths. For the observed\ndifference in the shadow lengths, the distance between Alexandria and Syene had to be\nabout seven degrees along the surface of the Earth; that is, if you imagine the sticks\nextending down to the center of the Earth, they would there intersect at an angle of seven\ndegrees. Seven degrees is something like one-fiftieth of three hundred and sixty degrees,\nthe full circumference of the Earth. Eratosthenes knew that the distance between\nAlexandria and Syene was approximately 800 kilometers, because he hired a man to pace it\nout. Eight hundred kilometers times 50 is 40,000 kilometers: so that must be the\ncircumference of the Earth.*\n\n* Or if you like to measure things in miles, the distance between Alexandria and Syene is about 500\nmiles, and 500 miles x 50 = 25,000 miles.\n\nThis is the right answer. Eratosthenes\u2019 only tools were sticks, eyes, feet and brains,\nplus a taste for experiment. With them he deduced the circumference of the Earth with an\nerror of only a few percent, a remarkable achievement for 2,200 years ago. He was the first\nperson accurately to measure the size of a planet.\n\nThe Mediterranean world at that time was famous for seafaring. Alexandria was the\ngreatest seaport on the planet. Once you knew the Earth to be a sphere of modest diameter,\nwould you not be tempted to make voyages of exploration, to seek out undiscovered lands,\nperhaps even to attempt to sail around the planet? Four hundred years before Eratosthenes,\nAfrica had been circumnavigated by a Phoenician fleet in the employ of the Egyptian\nPharaoh Necho. They set sail, probably in frail open boats, from the Red Sea, turned down\nthe east coast of Africa up into the Atlantic, returning through the Mediterranean. This epic\njourney took three years, about as long as a modern Voyager spacecraft takes to fly from\nEarth to Saturn.\n\nAfter Eratosthenes\u2019 discovery, many great voyages were attempted by brave and\nventuresome sailors. Their ships were tiny. They had only rudimentary navigational\ninstruments. They used dead reckoning and followed coastlines as far as they could. In an\nunknown ocean they could determine their latitude, but not their longitude, by observing,\nnight after night, the position of the constellations with respect to the horizon. The familiar\nconstellations must have been reassuring in the midst of an unexplored ocean. The stars are\nthe friends of explorers, then with seagoing ships on Earth and now with spacefaring ships\nin the sky. After Eratosthenes, some may have tried, but not until the time of Magellan did\nanyone succeed in circumnavigating the Earth. What tales of daring and adventure must\n\nearlier have been recounted as sailors and navigators, practical men of the world, gambled\ntheir lives on the mathematics of a scientist from Alexandria?\n\nIn Eratosthenes\u2019 time, globes were constructed portraying the Earth as viewed from\nspace; they were essentially correct in the well-explored Mediterranean but became more\nand more inaccurate the farther they strayed from home. Our present knowledge of the\nCosmos shares this disagreeable but inevitable feature. In the first century, the Alexandrian\ngeographer Strabo wrote:\n\nThose who have returned from an attempt to circumnavigate the Earth do not say\nthey have been prevented by an opposing continent, for the sea remained perfectly\nopen, but, rather, through want of resolution and scarcity of provision ....\nEratosthenes says that if the extent of the Atlantic Ocean were not an obstacle, we\nmight easily pass by sea from Iberia to India .... It is quite possible that in the\ntemperate zone there may be one or two habitable Earths .... Indeed, if [this other\npart of the world] is inhabited, it is not inhabited by men such as exist in our parts,\nand we should have to regard it as another inhabited world.\n\nHumans were beginning to venture, in almost every sense that matters, to other worlds.\n\nThe subsequent exploration of the Earth was a worldwide endeavor, including\nvoyages from as well as to China and Polynesia. The culmination was, of course, the\ndiscovery of America by Christopher Columbus and the journeys of the following few\ncenturies, which completed the geographical exploration of the Earth. Columbus\u2019 first\nvoyage is connected in the most straight-forward way with the calculations of Eratosthenes.\nColumbus was fascinated by what he called \u2018the Enterprise of the Indies,\u2019 a project to reach\nJapan, China and India not by following the coastline of Africa and sailing East but rather\nby plunging boldly into the unknown Western ocean - or, as Eratosthenes had said with\nstartling prescience, \u2018to pass by sea from Iberia to India.\u2019\n\nColumbus had been an itinerant peddler of old maps and an assiduous reader of the\nbooks by and about the ancient geographers, including Eratosthenes, Strabo and Ptolemy.\nBut for the Enterprise of the Indies to work, for ships and crews to survive the long voyage,\nthe Earth had to be smaller than Eratosthenes had said. Columbus therefore cheated on his\ncalculations, as the examining faculty of the University of Salamanca quite correctly\npointed out. He used the smallest possible circumference of the Earth and the greatest\neastward extension of Asia he could find in all the books available to him, and then\nexaggerated even those. Had the Americas not been in the way, Columbus\u2019 expeditions\nwould have failed utterly.\n\nThe Earth is now thoroughly explored. It no longer promises new continents or lost\nlands. But the technology that allowed us to explore and inhabit the most remote regions of\nthe Earth now permits us to leave our planet, to venture into space, to explore other worlds.\nLeaving the Earth, we are now able to view it from above, to see its solid spherical shape of\nEratosthenian dimensions and the outlines of its continents, confirming that many of the\nancient mapmakers were remarkably competent. What a pleasure such a view would have\ngiven to Eratosthenes and the other Alexandrian geographers.\n\nIt was in Alexandria, during the six hundred years beginning around 300 B.C., that\nhuman beings, in an important sense, began the intellectual adventure that has led us to the\nshores of space. But of the look and feel of that glorious marble city, nothing remains.\nOppression and the fear of learning have obliterated almost all memory of ancient\n\nAlexandria. Its population was marvelously diverse. Macedonian and later Roman soldiers,\nEgyptian priests, Greek aristocrats, Phoenician sailors, Jewish merchants, visitors from\nIndia and sub-Saharan Africa - everyone, except the vast slave population - lived together\nin harmony and mutual respect for most of the period of Alexandria\u2019s greatness.\n\nThe city was founded by Alexander the Great and constructed by his former\nbodyguard. Alexander encouraged respect for alien cultures and the open-minded pursuit of\nknowledge. According to tradition - and it does not much matter whether it really happened\n- he descended beneath the Red Sea in the world\u2019s first diving bell. He encouraged his\ngenerals and soldiers to marry Persian and Indian women. He respected the gods of other\nnations. He collected exotic lifeforms, including an elephant for Aristotle, his teacher. His\ncity was constructed on a lavish scale, to be the world center of commerce, culture and\nlearning. It was graced with broad avenues thirty meters wide, elegant architecture and\nstatuary, Alexander\u2019s monumental tomb, and an enormous lighthouse, the Pharos, one of\nthe seven wonders of the ancient world.\n\nBut the greatest marvel of Alexandria was the library and its associated museum\n(literally, an institution devoted to the specialties of the Nine Muses). Of that legendary\nlibrary, the most that survives today is a dank and forgotten cellar of the Serapeum, the\nlibrary annex, once a temple and later reconsecrated to knowledge. A few moldering\nshelves may be its only physical remains. Yet this place was once the brain and glory of the\ngreatest city on the planet, the first true research institute in the history of the world. The\nscholars of the library studied the entire Cosmos. Cosmos is a Greek word for the order of\nthe universe. It is, in a way, the opposite of Chaos. It implies the deep interconnectedness\nof all things. It conveys awe for the intricate and subtle way in which the universe is put\ntogether. Here was a community of scholars, exploring physics, literature, medicine,\nastronomy, geography, philosophy, mathematics, biology, and engineering. Science and\nscholarship had come of age. Genius flourished there. The Alexandrian Library is where we\nhumans first collected, seriously and systematically, the knowledge of the world.\n\nIn addition to Eratosthenes, there was the astronomer Hiparchus, who mapped the\nconstellations and estimated the brightness of the stars; Euclid, who brilliantly systematized\ngeometry and told his king, struggling over a difficult mathematical problem, \u2018There is no\nroyal road to geometry\u2019; Dionysius of Thrace, the man who defined the parts of speech and\ndid for the study of language what Euclid did for geometry; Herophilus, the physiologist\nwho firmly established that the brain rather than the heart is the seat of intelligence; Heron\nof Alexandria, inventor of gear trains and steam engines and the author of Automata, the\nfirst book on robots; Apollonius of Perga, the mathematician who demonstrated the forms\nof the conic sections* - ellipse, parabola and hyperbola - the curves, as we now know,\nfollowed in their orbits by the planets, the comets and the stars; Archimedes, the greatest\nmechanical genius until Leonardo da Vinci; and the astronomer and geographer Ptolemy,\nwho compiled much of what is today the pseudoscience of astrology: his Earth-centered\nuniverse held sway for 1,500 years, a reminder that intellectual capacity is no guarantee\nagainst being dead wrong. And among those great men was a great woman, Hypatia,\nmathematician and astronomer, the last light of the library, whose martyrdom was bound up\nwith the destruction of the library seven centuries after its founding, a story to which we\nwill return.\n\n*So called because they can be produced by slicing through a cone at various angles. Eighteen\ncenturies later, the writings of Apollonius on conic sections would be employed by Johannes Kepler in\n\nunderstanding for the first time the movement of the planets.\n\nThe Greek Kings of Egypt who succeeded Alexander were serious about learning.\nFor centuries, they supported research and maintained in the library a working environment\nfor the best minds of the age. It contained ten large research halls, each devoted to a\nseparate subject; fountains and colonnades; botanical gardens; a zoo; dissecting rooms; an\nobservatory; and a great dining hall where, at leisure, was conducted the critical discussion\nof ideas.\n\nThe heart of the library was its collection of books. The organizers combed all the\ncultures and languages of the world. They sent agents abroad to buy up libraries.\nCommercial ships docking in Alexandria were searched by the police - not for contraband,\nbut for books. The scrolls were borrowed, copied and then returned to their owners.\nAccurate numbers are difficult to estimate, but it seems probable that the Library contained\nhalf a million volumes, each a handwritten papyrus scroll. What happened to all those\nbooks? The classical civilization that created them disintegrated, and the library itself was\ndeliberately destroyed. Only a small fraction of its works survived, along with a few\npathetic scattered fragments. And how tantalizing those bits and pieces are! We know, for\nexample, that there was on the library shelves a book by the astronomer Aristarchus of\nSamos, who argued that the Earth is one of the planets, which like them orbits the Sun, and\nthat the stars are enormously far away. Each of these conclusions is entirely correct, but we\nhad to wait nearly two thousand years for their rediscovery. If we multiply by a hundred\nthousand our sense of loss for this work of Aristarchus, we begin to appreciate the grandeur\nof the achievement of classical civilization and the tragedy of its destruction.\n\nWe have far surpassed the science known to the ancient world. But there are\nirreparable gaps in our historical knowledge. Imagine what mysteries about our past could\nbe solved with a borrower\u2019s card to the Alexandrian Library. We know of a three-volume\nhistory of the world, now lost, by a Babylonian priest named Berossus. The first volume\ndealt with the interval from the Creation to the Flood, a period he took to be 432,000 years\nor about a hundred times longer than the Old Testament chronology. I wonder what was in\nit.\n\nThe ancients knew that the world is very old. They sought to look into the distant\npast. We now know that the Cosmos is far older than they ever imagined. We have\nexamined the universe in space and seen that we live on a mote of dust circling a humdrum\nstar in the remotest corner of an obscure galaxy. And if we are a speck in the immensity of\nspace, we also occupy an instant in the expanse of ages. We now know that our universe -\nor at least its most recent incarnation - is some fifteen or twenty billion years old. This is\nthe time since a remarkable explosive event called the Big Bang. At the beginning of this\nuniverse, there were no galaxies, stars or planets, no life or civilizations, merely a uniform,\nradiant fireball filling all of space. The passage from the Chaos of the Big Bang to the\nCosmos that we are beginning to know is the most awesome transformation of matter and\nenergy that we have been privileged to glimpse. And until we find more intelligent beings\nelsewhere, we are ourselves the most spectacular of all the transformations - the remote\ndescendants of the Big Bang, dedicated to understanding and further transforming the\nCosmos from which we spring.\n",

But Darwin\npoured new lifeblood into the ancient frame; the bonds burst, and the revivified\nthought of ancient Greece has proved itself to be a more adequate expression of the\nuniversal order of things than any of the schemes which have been accepted by the\ncredulity and welcomed by the superstition of 70 later generations of men.\n\n- T. H. Huxley, 1887\n\nProbably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended\nfrom some one primordial form, into which life was first breathed .... There is\ngrandeur in this view of life . . . that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on\naccording to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms\nmost beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.\n\n- Charles Darwin, The Origin of Species, 1859\n\nA community of matter appears to exist throughout the visible universe, for the stars\ncontain many of the elements which exist in the Sun and Earth. It is remarkable that\nthe elements most widely diffused through the host of stars are some of those most\nclosely connected with the living organisms of our globe, including hydrogen,\nsodium, magnesium, and iron. May it not be that, at least, the brighter stars are like\nour Sun, the upholding and energizing centres of systems of worlds, adapted to be\nthe abode of living beings?\n\n- William Huggins, 1865\n\nAll my life I have wondered about the possibility of life elsewhere. What would it be like?\nOf what would it be made? All living things on our planet are constructed of organic\nmolecules - complex microscopic architectures in which the carbon atom plays a central\nrole. There was once a time before life, when the Earth was barren and utterly desolate. Our\nworld is now overflowing with life. How did it come about? How, in the absence of life,\nwere carbon-based organic molecules made? How did the first living things arise? How did\nlife evolve to produce beings as elaborate and complex as we, able to explore the mystery\nof our own origins?\n\nAnd on the countless other planets that may circle other suns, is there life also? Is\nextraterrestrial life, if it exists, based on the same organic molecules as life on Earth? Do\nthe beings of other worlds look much like life on Earth? Or are they stunningly different -\nother adaptations to other environments? What else is possible? The nature of life on Earth\nand the search for life elsewhere are two sides of the same question - the search for who we\nare.\n\nIn the great dark between the stars there are clouds of gas and dust and organic\nmatter. Dozens of different kinds of organic molecules have been found there by radio\ntelescopes. The abundance of these molecules suggests that the stuff of life is everywhere.\nPerhaps the origin and evolution of life is, given enough time, a cosmic inevitability. On\nsome of the billions of planets in the Milky Way Galaxy, life may never arise. On others, it\nmay arise and die out, or never evolve beyond its simplest forms. And on some small\nfraction of worlds there may develop intelligences and civilizations more advanced than\nour own.\n\nOccasionally someone remarks on what a lucky coincidence it is that the Earth is\nperfectly suitable for life - moderate temperatures, liquid water, oxygen atmosphere, and so\non. But this is, at least in part, a confusion of cause and effect. We earthlings are supremely\nwell adapted to the environment of the Earth because we grew up here. Those earlier forms\nof life that were not well adapted died. We are descended from the organisms that did well.\nOrganisms that evolve on a quite different world will doubtless sing its praises too.\n\nAll life on Earth is closely related. We have a common organic chemistry and a\ncommon evolutionary heritage. As a result, our biologists are profoundly limited. They\nstudy only a single kind of biology, one lonely theme in the music of life. Is this faint and\nreedy tune the only voice for thousands of light-years? Or is there a kind of cosmic fugue,\nwith themes and counterpoints, dissonances and harmonies, a billion different voices\nplaying the life music of the Galaxy?\n\nLet me tell you a story about one little phrase in the music of life on Earth. In the\nyear 1185, the Emperor of Japan was a seven-year-old boy named Antoku. He was the\nnominal leader of a clan of samurai called the Heike, who were engaged in a long and\nbloody war with another samurai clan, the Genji. Each asserted a superior ancestral claim to\nthe imperial throne. Their decisive naval encounter, with the Emperor on board ship,\noccurred at Danno-ura in the Japanese Inland Sea on April 24, 1185. The Heike were\noutnumbered, and outmaneuvered. Many were killed. The survivors, in massive numbers,\nthrew themselves into the sea and drowned. The Lady Nii, grandmother of the Emperor,\nresolved that she and Antoku would not be captured by the enemy. What happened next is\ntold in The Tale of the Heike:\n\nThe Emperor was seven years old that year but looked much older. He was so\nlovely that he seemed to shed a brilliant radiance and his long, black hair hung loose\nfar down his back. With a look of surprise and anxiety on his face he asked the\nLady Nii, \u2018Where are you to take me?\u2019\n\nShe turned to the youthful sovereign, with tears streaming down her cheeks,\nand . . . comforted him, binding up his long hair in his dove-colored robe. Blinded\nwith tears, the child sovereign put his beautiful, small hands together. He turned\nfirst to the East to say farewell to the god of Ise and then to the West to repeat the\nNembutsu [a prayer to the Amida Buddha]. The Lady Nii took him tightly in her\narms and with the words \u2018In the depths of the ocean is our capitol,\u2019 sank with him at\nlast beneath the waves.\n\nThe entire Heike battle fleet was destroyed. Only forty-three women survived. These\nladies-in-waiting of the imperial court were forced to sell flowers and other favors to the\nfishermen near the scene of the battle. The Heike almost vanished from history. But a\n\nragtag group of the former ladies-in-waiting and their offspring by the fisher-folk\nestablished a festival to commemorate the battle. It takes place on the twenty-fourth of\nApril every year to this day. Fishermen who are the descendants of the Heike dress in hemp\nand black headgear and proceed to the Akama shrine which contains the mausoleum of the\ndrowned Emperor. There they watch a play portraying the events that followed the Battle of\nDanno-ura. For centuries after, people imagined that they could discern ghostly samurai\narmies vainly striving to bail the sea, to cleanse it of blood and defeat and humiliation.\n\nThe fishermen say the Heike samurai wander the bottoms of the Inland Sea still - in\nthe form of crabs. There are crabs to be found here with curious markings on their backs,\npatterns and indentations that disturbingly resemble the face of a samurai. When caught,\nthese crabs are not eaten, but are returned to the sea in commemoration of the doleful\nevents at Danno-ura.\n\nThis legend raises a lovely problem. How does it come about that the face of a\nwarrior is incised on the carapace of a crab? The answer seems to be that humans made the\nface. The patterns on the crab\u2019s shell are inherited. But among crabs, as among people,\nthere are many different hereditary lines. Suppose that, by chance, among the distant\nancestors of this crab, one arose with a pattern that resembled, even slightly, a human face.\nEven before the battle of Danno-ura, fishermen may have been reluctant to eat such a crab.\nIn throwing it back, they set in motion an evolutionary process: If you are a crab and your\ncarapace is ordinary, the humans will eat you. Your line will leave fewer descendants. If\nyour carapace looks a little like a face, they will throw you back. You will leave more\ndescendants. Crabs had a substantial investment in the patterns on their carapaces. As the\ngenerations passed, of crabs and fishermen alike, the crabs with patterns that most\nresembled a samurai face survived preferentially until eventually there was produced not\njust a human face, not just a Japanese face, but the visage of a fierce and scowling samurai.\nAll this has nothing to do with what the crabs want. Selection is imposed from the outside.\nThe more you look like a samurai, the better are your chances of survival. Eventually, there\ncome to be a great many samurai crabs.\n\nThis process is called artificial selection. In the case of the Heike crab it was\neffected more or less unconsciously by the fishermen, and certainly without any serious\ncontemplation by the crabs. But humans have deliberately selected which plants and\nanimals shall live and which shall die for thousands of years. We are surrounded from\nbabyhood by familiar farm and domestic animals, fruits and trees and vegetables. Where do\nthey come from? Were they once free-living in the wild and then induced to adopt a less\nstrenuous life on the farm? No, the truth is quite different. They are, most of them, made by\nus.\n\nTen thousand years ago, there were no dairy cows or ferret hounds or large ears of\ncorn. When we domesticated the ancestors of these plants and animals - sometimes\ncreatures who looked quite different - we controlled their breeding. We made sure that\ncertain varieties, having properties we consider desirable, preferentially reproduced. When\nwe wanted a dog to help us care for sheep, we selected breeds that were intelligent,\nobedient and had some pre-existing talent to herd, which is useful for animals who hunt in\npacks. The enormous distended udders of dairy cattle are the result of a human interest in\nmilk and cheese. Our corn, or maize, has been bred for ten thousand generations to be more\ntasty and nutritious than its scrawny ancestors; indeed, it is so changed that it cannot even\nreproduce without human intervention.\n\nThe essence of artificial selection - for a Heike crab, a dog, a cow or an ear of corn -\n\nis this: Many physical and behavioral traits of plants and animals are inherited. They breed\ntrue. Humans, for whatever reason, encourage the reproduction of some varieties and\ndiscourage the reproduction of others. The variety selected for preferentially reproduces; it\neventually becomes abundant; the variety selected against becomes rare and perhaps\nextinct.\n\nBut if humans can make new varieties of plants and animals, must not nature do so\nalso? This related process is called natural selection. That life has changed fundamentally\nover the aeons is entirely clear from the alterations we have made in the beasts and\nvegetables during the short tenure of humans on Earth, and from the fossil evidence. The\nfossil record speaks to us unambiguously of creatures that once were present in enormous\nnumbers and that have now vanished utterly.* Far more species have become extinct in the\nhistory of the Earth than exist today; they are the terminated experiments of evolution.\n\n* Although traditional Western religious opinion stoutly maintained the contrary, as for example, the\n1770 opinion of John Wesley: \u2018Death is never permitted to destroy [even] the most inconsiderable species.\u2019\n\nThe genetic changes induced by domestication have occurred very rapidly. The\nrabbit was not domesticated until early medieval times (it was bred by French monks in the\nbelief that new-born bunnies were fish and therefore exempt from the prohibitions against\neating meat on certain days in the Church calendar); coffee in the fifteenth century; the\nsugar beet in the nineteenth century; and the mink is still in the earliest stages of\ndomestication. In less than ten thousand years, domestication has increased the weight of\nwool grown by sheep from less than one kilogram of rough hairs to ten or twenty kilograms\nof uniform, fine down; or the volume of milk given by cattle during a lactation period from\na few hundred to a million cubic centimeters. If artificial selection can make such major\nchanges in so short a period of time, what must natural selection, working over billions of\nyears, be capable of? The answer is all the beauty and diversity of the biological world.\nEvolution is a fact, not a theory.\n\nThat the mechanism of evolution is natural selection is the great discovery\nassociated with the names of Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace. More than a\ncentury ago, they stressed that nature is prolific, that many more animals and plants are\nborn than can possibly survive and that therefore the environment selects those varieties\nwhich are, by accident, better suited for survival. Mutations - sudden changes in heredity -\nbreed true. They provide the raw material of evolution. The environment selects those few\nmutations that enhance survival, resulting in a series of slow transformations of one\nlifeform into another, the origin of new species.*\n\n* In the Mayan holy book the Popol Vuh, the various forms of life are described as unsuccessful\nattempts by gods with a predilection for experiment to make people. Early tries were far off the mark, creating\nthe lower animals; the penultimate attempt, a near miss, made the monkeys. In Chinese myth, human beings\narose from the body lice of a god named P\u2019an Ku. In the eighteenth century, de Buffon proposed that the\nEarth was much older than Scripture suggested, that the forms of life somehow changed slowly over the\nmillennia, but that the apes were the forlorn descendants of people. While these notions do not precisely\nreflect the evolutionary process described by Darwin and Wallace, they are anticipations of it - as are the\nviews of Democritus, Empedocles and other early Ionian scientists who are discussed in Chapter 7.\n\nDarwin\u2019s words in The Origin of Species were:\n\nMan does not actually produce variability; he only unintentionally exposes organic\nbeings to new conditions of life, and then Nature acts on the organisation, and\ncauses variability. But man can and does select the variations given to him by\nNature, and thus accumulate them in any desired manner. He thus adapts animals\nand plants for his own benefit or pleasure. He may do this methodically, or he may\ndo it unconsciously by preserving the individuals most useful to him at the time,\nwithout any thought of altering the breed .... There is no obvious reason why the\nprinciples which have acted so efficiently under domestication should not have\nacted under Nature . .. . More individuals are born than can possibly survive .. . .\nThe slightest advantage in one being, of any age or during any season, over those\nwith which it comes into competition, or better adaptation in however slight a\ndegree to the surrounding physical conditions, will turn the balance.\n\nT. H. Huxley, the most effective nineteenth-century defender and popularizer of evolution,\nwrote that the publications of Darwin and Wallace were a \u2018flash of light, which to a man\nwho has lost himself in a dark night, suddenly reveals a road which, whether it takes him\nstraight home or not, certainly goes his way .... My reflection, when I first made myself\nmaster of the central idea of the \u2018Origin of Species,\u2019 was, \u2018How extremely stupid not to\nhave thought of that!\u2019 I suppose that Columbus\u2019 companions said much the same .... The\nfacts of variability, of the struggle for existence, of adaptation to conditions, were notorious\nenough; but none of us had suspected that the road to the heart of the species problem lay\nthrough them, until Darwin and Wallace dispelled the darkness.\u2019\n\nMany people were scandalized - some still are - at both ideas, evolution and natural\nselection. Our ancestors looked at the elegance of life on Earth, at how appropriate the\nstructures of organisms are to their functions, and saw evidence for a Great Designer. The\nsimplest one-celled organism is a far more complex machine than the finest pocket watch.\nAnd yet pocket watches do not spontaneously self-assemble, or evolve, in slow stages, on\ntheir own, from, say, grandfather clocks. A watch implies a watchmaker. There seemed to\nbe no way in which atoms and molecules could somehow spontaneously fall together to\ncreate organisms of such awesome complexity and subtle functioning as grace every region\nof the Earth. That each living thing was specially designed, that one species did not become\nanother, were notions perfectly consistent with what our ancestors with their limited\nhistorical records knew about life. The idea that every organism was meticulously\nconstructed by a Great Designer provided a significance and order to nature and an\nimportance to human beings that we crave still. A Designer is a natural, appealing and\naltogether human explanation of the biological world. But, as Darwin and Wallace showed,\nthere is another way, equally appealing, equally human, and far more compelling: natural\nselection, which makes the music of life more beautiful as the aeons pass.\n\nThe fossil evidence could be consistent with the idea of a Great Designer; perhaps\nsome species are destroyed when the Designer becomes dissatisfied with them, and new\nexperiments are attempted on an improved design. But this notion is a little disconcerting.\nEach plant and animal is exquisitely made; should not a supremely competent Designer\nhave been able to make the intended variety from the start? The fossil record implies trial\nand error, an inability to anticipate the future, features inconsistent with an efficient Great\nDesigner (although not with a Designer of a more remote and indirect temperament).\n\nWhen I was a college undergraduate in the early 1950\u2019s, I was fortunate enough to\nwork in the laboratory of H. J. Muller, a great geneticist and the man who discovered that\n\nradiation produces mutations. Muller was the person who first called my attention to the\nHeike crab as an example of artificial selection. To learn the practical side of genetics, I\nspent many months working with fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster (which means the\nblack-bodied dew-lover) - tiny benign beings with two wings and big eyes. We kept them\nin pint milk bottles. We would cross two varieties to see what new forms emerged from the\nrearrangement of the parental genes, and from natural and induced mutations. The females\nwould deposit their eggs on a kind of molasses the technicians placed inside the bottles; the\nbottles were stoppered; and we would wait two weeks for the fertilized eggs to become\nlarvae, the larvae pupae, and the pupae to emerge as new adult fruit flies.\n\nOne day I was looking through a low-power binocular microscope at a newly\narrived batch of adult Drosophila immobilized with a little ether, and was busily separating\nthe different varieties with a camel\u2019s-hair brush. To my astonishment, I came upon\nsomething very different: not a small variation such as red eyes instead of white, or neck\nbristles instead of no neck bristles. This was another, and very well-functioning, kind of\ncreature with much more prominent wings and long feathery antennae. Fate had arranged, I\nconcluded, that an example of a major evolutionary change in a single generation, the very\nthing Muller had said could never happen, should take place in his own laboratory. It was\nmy unhappy task to explain it to him.\n\nWith heavy heart I knocked on his office door. \u2018Come in,\u2019 came the muffled cry. I\nentered to discover the room darkened except for a single small lamp illuminating the stage\nof the microscope at which he was working. In these gloomy surroundings I stumbled\nthrough my explanation. I had found a very different kind of fly. I was sure it had emerged\nfrom one of the pupae in the molasses. I didn\u2019t mean to disturb Muller but... \u201cDoes it look\nmore like Lepidoptera than Diptera?\u2019 he asked, his face illuminated from below. I didn\u2019t\nknow what this meant, so he had to explain: \u2018Does it have big wings? Does it have feathery\nantennae?\u2019 I glumly nodded assent.\n\nMuller switched on the overhead light and smiled benignly. It was an old story.\nThere was a kind of moth that had adapted to Drosphila genetics laboratories. It was\nnothing like a fruit fly and wanted nothing to do with fruit flies. What it wanted was the\nfruit flies\u2019 molasses. In the brief time that the laboratory technician took to unstopper and\nstopper the milk bottle - for example, to add fruit flies - the mother moth made a dive-\nbombing pass, dropping her eggs on the run into the tasty molasses. I had not discovered a\nmacro-mutation. I had merely stumbled upon another lovely adaptation in nature, itself the\nproduct of micromutation and natural selection.\n\nThe secrets of evolution are death and time - the deaths of enormous numbers of\nlifeforms that were imperfectly adapted to the environment; and time for a long succession\nof small mutations that were by accident adaptive, time for the slow accumulation of\npatterns of favorable mutations. Part of the resistance to Darwin and Wallace derives from\nour difficulty in imagining the passage of the millennia, much less the aeons. What does\nseventy million years mean to beings who live only one-millionth as long? We are like\nbutterflies who flutter for a day and think it is forever.\n\nWhat happened here on Earth may be more or less typical of the evolution of life on many\nworlds; but in such details as the chemistry of proteins or the neurology of brains, the story\nof life on Earth may be unique in all the Milky Way Galaxy. The Earth condensed out of\ninterstellar gas and dust some 4.6 billion years ago. We know from the fossil record that the\norigin of life happened soon after, perhaps around 4.0 billion years ago, in the ponds and\n\noceans of the primitive Earth. The first living things were not anything so complex as a\none-celled organism, already a highly sophisticated form of life. The first stirrings were\nmuch more humble. In those early days, lightning and ultraviolet light from the Sun were\nbreaking apart the simple hydrogen-rich molecules of the primitive atmosphere, the\nfragments spontaneously recombining into more and more complex molecules. The\nproducts of this early chemistry were dissolved in the oceans, forming a kind of organic\nsoup of gradually increasing complexity, until one day, quite by accident, a molecule arose\nthat was able to make crude copies of itself, using as building blocks other molecules in the\nsoup. (We will return to this subject later.)\n\nThis was the earliest ancestor of deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA, the master molecule\nof life on Earth. It is shaped like a ladder twisted into a helix, the rungs available in four\ndifferent molecular parts, which constitute the four letters of the genetic code. These rungs,\ncalled nucleotides, spell out the hereditary instructions for making a given organism. Every\nlifeform on Earth has a different set of instructions, written out in essentially the same\nlanguage. The reason organisms are different is the differences in their nucleic acid\ninstructions. A mutation is a change in a nucleotide, copied in the next generation, which\nbreeds true. Since mutations are random nucleotide changes, most of them are harmful or\nlethal, coding into existence nonfunctional enzymes. It is a long wait before a mutation\nmakes an organism work better. And yet it is that improbable event, a small beneficial\nmutation in a nucleotide a ten-millionth of a centimeter across, that makes evolution go.\n\nFour billion years ago, the Earth was a molecular Garden of Eden. There were as\nyet no predators. Some molecules reproduced themselves inefficiently, competed for\nbuilding blocks and left crude copies of themselves. With reproduction, mutation and the\nselective elimination of the least efficient varieties, evolution was well under way, even at\nthe molecular level. As time went on, they got better at reproducing. Molecules with\nspecialized functions eventually joined together, making a kind of molecular collective -\nthe first cell. Plant cells today have tiny molecular factories, called chloroplasts, which are\nin charge of photosynthesis - the conversion of sunlight, water and carbon dioxide into\ncarbohydrates and oxygen. The cells in a drop of blood contain a different sort of molecular\nfactory, the mitochondrion, which combines food with oxygen to extract useful energy.\nThese factories exist in plant and animal cells today but may once themselves have been\nfree-living cells.\n\nBy three billion years ago, a number of one-celled plants had joined together,\nperhaps because a mutation prevented a single cell from separating after splitting in two.\nThe first multicellular organisms had evolved. Every cell of your body is a kind of\ncommune, with once free-living parts all banded together for the common good. And you\nare made of a hundred trillion cells. We are, each of us, a multitude.\n\nSex seems to have been invented around two billion years ago. Before then, new\nvarieties of organisms could arise only from the accumulation of random mutations - the\nselection of changes, letter by letter, in the genetic instructions. Evolution must have been\nagonizingly slow. With the invention of sex, two organisms could exchange whole\nparagraphs, pages and books of their DNA code, producing new varieties ready for the\nsieve of selection. Organisms are selected to engage in sex - the ones that find it\nuninteresting quickly become extinct. And this is true not only of the microbes of two\nbillion years ago. We humans also have a palpable devotion to exchanging segments of\nDNA today.\n\nBy one billion years ago, plants, working cooperatively, had made a stunning\n\nchange in the environment of the Earth. Green plants generate molecular oxygen. Since the\noceans were by now filled with simple green plants, oxygen was becoming a major\nconstituent of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, altering it irreversibly from its original hydrogen-\nrich character and ending the epoch of Earth history when the stuff of life was made by\nnonbiological processes. But oxygen tends to make organic molecules fall to pieces.\nDespite our fondness for it, it is fundamentally a poison for unprotected organic matter. The\ntransition to an oxidizing atmosphere posed a supreme crisis in the history of life, and a\ngreat many organisms, unable to cope with oxygen, perished. A few primitive forms, such\nas the botulism and tetanus bacilli, manage to survive even today only in oxygen-free\nenvironments. The nitrogen in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere is much more chemically inert and\ntherefore much more benign than oxygen. But it, too, is biologically sustained. Thus, 99\npercent of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere is of biological origin. The sky is made by life.\n\nFor most of the four billion years since the origin of life, the dominant organisms\nwere microscopic blue-green algae, which covered and filled the oceans. Then some 600\nmillion years ago, the monopolizing grip of the algae was broken and an enormous\nproliferation of new lifeforms emerged, an event called the Cambrian explosion. Life had\narisen almost immediately after the origin of the Earth, which suggests that life may be an\ninevitable chemical process on an Earth-like planet. But life did not evolve much beyond\nblue-green algae for three billion years, which suggests that large lifeforms with specialized\norgans are hard to evolve, harder even than the origin of life. Perhaps there are many other\nplanets that today have abundant microbes but no big beasts and vegetables.\n\nSoon after the Cambrian explosion, the oceans teemed with many different forms of\nlife. By 500 million years ago there were vast herds of trilobites, beautifully constructed\nanimals, a little like large insects; some hunted in packs on the ocean floor. They stored\ncrystals in their eyes to detect polarized light. But there are no trilobites alive today; there\nhave been none for 200 million years. The Earth used to be inhabited by plants and animals\nof which there is today no living trace. And of course every species now on the planet once\ndid not exist. There is no hint in the old rocks of animals like us. Species appear, abide\nmore or less briefly and then flicker out.\n\nBefore the Cambrian explosion species seem to have succeeded one another rather\nslowly. In part this may be because the richness of our information declines rapidly the\nfarther into the past we peer; in the early history of our planet, few organisms had hard\nparts and soft beings leave few fossil remains. But in part the sluggish rate of appearance of\ndramatically new forms before the Cambrian explosion is real; the painstaking evolution of\ncell structure and biochemistry is not immediately reflected in the external forms revealed\nby the fossil record. After the Cambrian explosion, exquisite new adaptations followed one\nanother with comparatively breathtaking speed. In rapid succession, the first fish and the\nfirst vertebrates appeared; plants, previously restricted to the oceans, began the colonization\nof the land; the first insect evolved, and its descendants became the pioneers in the\ncolonization of the land by animals; winged insects arose together with the amphibians,\ncreatures something like the lungfish, able to survive both on land and in the water; the first\ntrees and the first reptiles appeared; the dinosaurs evolved; the mammals emerged, and then\nthe first birds; the first flowers appeared; the dinosaurs became extinct; the earliest\ncetaceans, ancestors to the dolphins and whales, arose and in the same period the primates -\nthe ancestors of the monkeys, the apes and the humans. Less than ten million years ago, the\nfirst creatures who closely resembled human beings evolved, accompanied by a spectacular\nincrease in brain size. And then, only a few million years ago, the first true humans\n\nemerged.\n\nHuman beings grew up in forests; we have a natural affinity for them. How lovely a\ntree is, straining toward the sky. Its leaves harvest sunlight to photosynthesize, so trees\ncompete by shadowing their neighbors. If you look closely you can often see two trees\npushing and shoving with languid grace. Trees are great and beautiful machines, powered\nby sunlight, taking in water from the ground and carbon dioxide from the air, converting\nthese materials into food for their use and ours. The plant uses the carbohydrates it makes\nas an energy source to go about its planty business. And we animals, who are ultimately\nparasites on the plants, steal the carbohydrates so we can go about our business. In eating\nthe plants we combine the carbohydrates with oxygen dissolved in our blood because of our\npenchant for breathing air, and so extract the energy that makes us go. In the process we\nexhale carbon dioxide, which the plants then recycle to make more carbohydrates. What a\nmarvelous cooperative arrangement - plants and animals each inhaling the other\u2019s\nexhalations, a kind of planet-wide mutual mouth-to-stoma resuscitation, the entire elegant\ncycle powered by a star 150 million kilometers away.\n\nThere are tens of billions of known kinds of organic molecules. Yet only about fifty\nof them are used for the essential activities of life. The same patterns are employed over\nand over again, conservatively, ingeniously for different functions. And at the very heart of\nlife on Earth the proteins that control cell chemistry, and the nucleic acids that carry the\nhereditary instructions - we find these molecules to be essentially identical in all the plants\nand animals. An oak tree and I are made of the same stuff. If you go far enough back, we\nhave a common ancestor.\n\nThe living cell is a regime as complex and beautiful as the realm of the galaxies and\nthe stars. The elaborate machinery of the cell has been painstakingly evolved over four\nbillion years. Fragments of food are transmogrified into cellular machinery. Today\u2019s white\nblood cell is yesterday\u2019s creamed spinach. How does the cell do it? Inside is a labyrinthine\nand subtle architecture that maintains its own structure, transforms molecules, stores energy\nand prepares for self-replication. If we could enter a cell, many of the molecular specks we\nwould see would be protein molecules, some in frenzied activity, others merely waiting.\nThe most important proteins are enzymes, molecules that control the cell\u2019s chemical\nreactions. Enzymes are like assembly-line workers, each specializing in a particular\nmolecular job: Step 4 in the construction of the nucleotide guanosine phosphate, say, or\nStep 11 in the dismantling of a molecule of sugar to extract energy, the currency that pays\nfor getting the other cellular jobs done. But the enzymes do not run the show. They receive\ntheir instructions - and are in fact themselves constructed - on orders sent from those in\ncharge. The boss molecules are the nucleic acids. They live sequestered in a forbidden city\nin the deep interior, in the nucleus of the cell.\n\nIf we plunged through a pore into the nucleus of the cell, we would find something\nthat resembles an explosion in a spaghetti factory - a disorderly multitude of coils and\nstrands, which are the two kinds of nucleic acids: DNA, which knows what to do, and\nRNA, which conveys the instructions issued by DNA to the rest of the cell. These are the\nbest that four billion years of evolution could produce, containing the full complement of\ninformation on how to make a cell, a tree or a human work. The amount of information in\nhuman DNA, if written out in ordinary language, would occupy a hundred thick volumes.\nWhat is more, the DNA molecules know how to make, with only very rare exceptions,\nidentical copies of themselves. They know extraordinarily much.\n\nDNA is a double helix, the two intertwined strands resembling a \u2018spiral\u2019 staircase. It\n\nis the sequence or ordering of the nucleotides along either of the constituent strands that is\nthe language of life. During reproduction, the helices separate, assisted by a special\nunwinding protein, each synthesizing an identical copy of the other from nucleotide\nbuilding blocks floating about nearby in the viscous liquid of the cell nucleus. Once the\nunwinding is underway, a remarkable enzyme called DNA polymerase helps ensure that the\ncopying works almost perfectly. If a mistake is made, there are enzymes which snip the\nmistake out and replace the wrong nucleotide by the right one. These enzymes are a\nmolecular machine with awesome powers.\n\nIn addition to making accurate copies of itself - which is what heredity is about -\nnuclear DNA directs the activities of the cell - which is what metabolism is about - by\nsynthesizing another nucleic acid called messenger RNA, each of which passes to the\nextranuclear provinces and there controls the construction, at the right time, in the right\nplace, of one enzyme. When all is done, a single enzyme molecule has been produced,\nwhich then goes about ordering one particular aspect of the chemistry of the cell.\n\nHuman DNA is a ladder a billion nucleotides long. Most possible combinations of\nnucleotides are nonsense: they would cause the synthesis of proteins that perform no useful\nfunction. Only an extremely limited number of nucleic acid molecules are any good for\nlifeforms as complicated as we. Even so, the number of useful ways of putting nucleic acids\ntogether is stupefyingly large - probably far greater than the total number of electrons and\nprotons in the universe. Accordingly, the number of possible individual human beings is\nvastly greater than the number that have ever lived: the untapped potential of the human\nspecies is immense. There must be ways of putting nucleic acids together that will function\nfar better - by any criterion we choose - than any human being who has ever lived.\nFortunately, we do not yet know how to assemble alternative sequences of nucleotides to\nmake alternative kinds of human beings. In the future we may well be able to assemble\nnucleotides in any desired sequence, to produce whatever characteristics we think desirable\n- a sobering and disquieting prospect.\n\nEvolution works through mutation and selection. Mutations might occur during\nreplication if the enzyme DNA polymerase makes a mistake. But it rarely makes a mistake.\nMutations also occur because of radioactivity or ultraviolet light from the Sun or cosmic\nrays or chemicals in the environment, all of which can change the nucleotides or tie the\nnucleic acids up in knots. If the mutation rate is too high, we lose the inheritance of four\nbillion years of painstaking evolution. If it is too low, new varieties will not be available to\nadapt to some future change in the environment. The evolution of life requires a more or\nless precise balance between mutation and selection. When that balance is achieved,\nremarkable adaptations occur.\n\nA change in a single DNA nucleotide causes a change in a single amino acid in the\nprotein for which that DNA codes. The red blood cells of people of European descent look\nroughly globular. The red blood cells of some people of African descent look like sickles or\ncrescent moons. Sickle cells carry less oxygen and consequently transmit a kind of anemia.\nThey also provide major resistance against malaria. There is no question that it is better to\nbe anemic than to be dead. This major influence on the function of the blood - so striking as\nto be readily apparent in photographs of red blood cells - is the result of a change in a single\nnucleotide out of the ten billion in the DNA of a typical human cell. We are still ignorant of\nthe consequences of changes in most of the other nucleotides.\n\nWe humans look rather different than a tree. Without a doubt we perceive the world\ndifferently than a tree does. But down deep, at the molecular heart of life, the trees and we\n\nare essentially identical. We both use nucleic acids for heredity; we both use proteins as\nenzymes to control the chemistry of our cells. Most significantly, we both use precisely the\nsame code book for translating nucleic acid information into protein information, as do\nvirtually all the other creatures on the planet.* The usual explanation of this molecular\nunity is that we are, all of us - trees and people, angler fish and slime molds and paramecia\n- descended from a single and common instance of the origin of life in the early history of\nour planet. How did the critical molecules then arise?\n\n* The genetic code turns out to be not quite identical in all parts of all organisms on the Earth. At\nleast a few cases are known where the transcription from DNA information into protein information in a\nmitochondrion employs a different code book from that used by the genes in the nucleus of the very same\ncell. This points to a long evolutionary separation of the genetic codes of mitochondria and nuclei, and is\nconsistent with the idea that mitochondria were once free-living organisms incorporated into the cell in a\nsymbiotic relationship billions of years ago. The development and emerging sophistication of that symbiosis\nis, incidentally, one answer to the question of what evolution was doing between the origin of the cell and the\nproliferation of many-celled organisms in the Cambrian explosion.\n\nIn my laboratory at Cornell University we work on, among other things,\nprebiological organic chemistry, making some notes of the music of life. We mix together\nand spark the gases of the primitive Earth: hydrogen, water, ammonia, methane, hydrogen\nsulfide - all present, incidentally, on the planet Jupiter today and throughout the Cosmos.\nThe sparks correspond to lightning - also present on the ancient Earth and on modern\nJupiter. The reaction vessel is initially transparent: the precursor gases are entirely\ninvisible. But after ten minutes of sparking, we see a strange brown pigment slowly\nstreaking the sides of the vessel. The interior gradually becomes opaque, covered with a\nthick brown tar. If we had used ultraviolet light - simulating the early Sun - the results\nwould have been more or less the same. The tar is an extremely rich collection of complex\norganic molecules, including the constituent parts of proteins and nucleic acids. The stuff of\nlife, it turns out, can be very easily made.\n\nSuch experiments were first performed in the early 1950\u2019s by Stanley Miller, then a\ngraduate student of the chemist Harold Urey. Urey had argued compellingly that the early\natmosphere of the Earth was hydrogen-rich, as is most of the Cosmos; that the hydrogen\nhas since trickled away to space from Earth, but not from massive Jupiter; and that the\norigin of life occurred before the hydrogen was lost. After Urey suggested that such gases\nbe sparked, someone asked him what he expected to make in such an experiment. Urey\nreplied, \u2018Beilstein.\u2019 Beilstein is the massive German compendium in 28 volumes, listing all\nthe organic molecules known to chemists.\n\nUsing only the most abundant gases that were present on the early Earth and almost\nany energy source that breaks chemical bonds, we can produce the essential building blocks\nof life. But in our vessel are only the notes of the music of life - not the music itself. The\nmolecular building blocks must be put together in the correct sequence. Life is certainly\nmore than the amino acids that make up its proteins and the nucleotides that make up its\nnucleic acids. But even in ordering these building blocks into long-chain molecules, there\nhas been substantial laboratory progress. Amino acids have been assembled under primitive\nEarth conditions into molecules resembling proteins. Some of them feebly control useful\nchemical reactions, as enzymes do. Nucleotides have been put together into strands of\nnucleic acid a few dozen units long. Under the right circumstances in the test tube, short\nnucleic acids can synthesize identical copies of themselves.\n\nNo one has so far mixed together the gases and waters of the primitive Earth and at\nthe end of the experiment had something craw] out of the test tube. The smallest living\nthings known, the viroids, are composed of less than 10,000 atoms. They cause several\ndifferent diseases in cultivated plants and have probably most recently evolved from more\ncomplex organisms rather than from simpler ones. Indeed, it is hard to imagine a still\nsimpler organism that is in any sense alive. Viroids are composed exclusively of nucleic\nacid, unlike the viruses, which also have a protein coat. They are no more than a single\nstrand of RNA with either a linear or a closed circular geometry. Viroids can be so small\nand still thrive because they are thoroughgoing, unremitting parasites. Like viruses, they\nsimply take over the molecular machinery of a much larger, well-functioning cell and\nchange it from a factory for making more cells into a factory for making more viroids.\n\nThe smallest known free-living organisms are the PPLO (pleuropneumonia-like\norganisms) and similar small beasts. They are composed of about fifty million atoms. Such\norganisms, having to be more self-reliant, are also more complicated than viroids and\nviruses. But the environment of the Earth today is not extremely favorable for simple forms\nof life. You have to work hard to make a living. You have to be careful about predators. In\nthe early history of our planet, however, when enormous amounts of organic molecules\nwere being produced by sunlight in a hydrogen-rich atmosphere, very simple, nonparasitic\norganisms had a fighting chance. The first living things may have been something like free-\nliving viroids only a few hundred nucleotides long. Experimental work on making such\ncreatures from scratch may begin by the end of the century. There is still much to be\nunderstood about the origin of life, including the origin of the genetic code. But we have\nbeen performing such experiments for only some thirty years. Nature has had a four-\nbillion-year head start. All in all, we have not done badly.\n\nNothing in such experiments is unique to the Earth. The initial gases, and the energy\nsources, are common throughout the Cosmos. Chemical reactions like those in our\nlaboratory vessels may be responsible for the organic matter in interstellar space and the\namino acids found in meteorites. Some similar chemistry must have occurred on a billion\nother worlds in the Milky Way Galaxy. The molecules of life fill the Cosmos.\n\nBut even if life on another planet has the same molecular chemistry as life here,\nthere is no reason to expect it to resemble familiar organisms. Consider the enormous\ndiversity of living things on Earth, all of which share the same planet and an identical\nmolecular biology. Those other beasts and vegetables are probably radically different from\nany organism we know here. There may be some convergent evolution because there may\nbe only one best solution to a certain environmental problem - something like two eyes, for\nexample, for binocular vision at optical frequencies. But in general the random character of\nthe evolutionary process should create extraterrestrial creatures very different from any that\nwe know.\n\nI cannot tell you what an extraterrestrial being would look like. I am terribly limited\nby the fact that I know only one kind of life, life on Earth. Some people - science fiction\nwriters and artists, for instance - have speculated on what other beings might be like. I am\nskeptical about most of those extraterrestrial visions. They seem to me to rely too much on\nforms of life we already know. Any given organism is the way it is because of a long series\nof individually unlikely steps. I do not think life anywhere else would look very much like\na reptile, or an insect or a human - even with such minor cosmetic adjustments as green\nskin, pointy ears and antennae. But if you pressed me, I could try to imagine something\nrather different.\n\nOn a giant gas planet like Jupiter, with an atmosphere rich in hydrogen, helium,\nmethane, water and ammonia, there is no accessible solid surface, but rather a dense cloudy\natmosphere in which organic molecules may be falling from the skies like manna from\nheaven, like the products of our laboratory experiments. However, there is a characteristic\nimpediment to life on such a planet: the atmosphere is turbulent, and down deep it is very\nhot. An organism must be careful that it is not carried down and fried.\n\nTo show that life is not out of the question in such a very different planet, my\nCornell colleague E. E. Salpeter and I have made some calculations. Of course, we cannot\nknow precisely what life would be like in such a place, but we wanted to see if, within the\nlaws of physics and chemistry, a world of this sort could possibly be inhabited.\n\nOne way to make a living under these conditions is to reproduce before you are\nfried and hope that convection will carry some of your offspring to the higher and cooler\nlayers of the atmosphere. Such organisms could be very little. We call them sinkers. But\nyou could also be a floater, some vast hydrogen balloon pumping helium and heavier gases\nout of its interior and leaving only the lightest gas, hydrogen; or a hot-air balloon, staying\nbuoyant by keeping your interior warm, using energy acquired from the food you eat. Like\nfamiliar terrestrial balloons, the deeper a floater is carried, the stronger is the buoyant force\nreturning it to the higher, cooler, safer regions of the atmosphere. A floater might eat\npreformed organic molecules, or make its own from sunlight and air, somewhat as plants\ndo on Earth. Up to a point, the bigger a floater is, the more efficient it will be. Salpeter and\nJ imagined floaters kilometers across, enormously larger than the greatest whale that ever\nwas, beings the size of cities.\n\nThe floaters may propel themselves through the planetary atmosphere with gusts of\ngas, like a ramjet or a rocket. We imagine them arranged in great lazy herds for as far as the\neye can see, with patterns on their skin, an adaptive camouflage implying that they have\nproblems, too. Because there is at least one other ecological niche in such an environment:\nhunting. Hunters are fast and maneuverable. They eat the floaters both for their organic\nmolecules and for their store of pure hydrogen. Hollow sinkers could have evolved into the\nfirst floaters, and self-propelled floaters into the first hunters. There cannot be very many\nhunters, because if they consume all the floaters, the hunters themselves will perish.\n\nPhysics and chemistry permit such lifeforms. Art endows them with a certain\ncharm. Nature, however, is not obliged to follow our speculations. But if there are billions\nof inhabited worlds in the Milky Way Galaxy, perhaps there will be a few populated by the\nsinkers, floaters and hunters which our imaginations, tempered by the laws of physics and\nchemistry, have generated.\n\nBiology is more like history than it is like physics. You have to know the past to\nunderstand the present. And you have to know it in exquisite detail. There is as yet no\npredictive theory of biology, just as there is not yet a predictive theory of history. The\nreasons are the same: both subjects are still too complicated for us. But we can know\nourselves better by understanding other cases. The study of a single instance of\nextraterrestrial life, no matter how humble, will deprovincialize biology. For the first time,\nthe biologists will know what other kinds of life are possible. When we say the search for\nlife elsewhere is important, we are not guaranteeing that it will be easy to find - only that it\nis very much worth seeking.\n\nWe have heard so far the voice of life on one small world only. But we have at last\nbegun to listen for other voices in the cosmic fugue.\n",

Twelve Signs of the Zodiac, as the Religion says, are the\ntwelve commanders on the side of light; and the seven planets are said to be the\nseven commanders on the side of darkness. And the seven planets oppress all\ncreation and deliver it over to death and all manner of evil: for the twelve signs of\nthe Zodiac and the seven planets rule the fate of the world.\n\n- The late Zoroastrian book, the Menok i Xrat\n\nTo tell us that every species of thing is endowed with an occult specific quality by\nwhich it acts and produces manifest effects, is to tell us nothing; but to derive two or\nthree general principles of motion from phenomena, and afterwards to tell us how\nthe properties and actions of all corporeal things follow from those manifest\nprinciples, would be a very great step.\n\n- Isaac Newton, Optics\n\nWe do not ask for what useful purpose the birds do sing, for song is their pleasure\nsince they were created for singing. Similarly, we ought not to ask why the human\nmind troubles to fathom the secrets of the heavens . . .

There\nwould be nothing to figure out. There would be no impetus for science. And if we lived in\nan unpredictable world, where things changed in random or very complex ways, we would\nnot be able to figure things out. Again, there would be no such thing as science. But we live\nin an in-between universe, where things change, but according to patterns, rules, or, as we\ncall them, laws of nature. If I throw a stick up in the air, it always falls down. If the sun sets\nin the west, it always rises again the next morning in the east. And so it becomes possible to\nfigure things out. We can do science, and with it we can improve our lives.\n\nHuman beings are good at understanding the world. We always have been. We were\nable to hunt game or build fires only because we had figured something out. There was a\ntime before television, before motion pictures, before radio, before books. The greatest part\nof human existence was spent in such a time. Over the dying embers of the campfire, on a\nmoonless night, we watched the stars.\n\nThe night sky is interesting. There are patterns there. Without even trying, you can\nimagine pictures. In the northern sky, for example, there is a pattern, or constellation, that\nlooks a little ursine. Some cultures call it the Great Bear. Others see quite different images.\n\nThese pictures are not, of course, really in the night sky; we put them there ourselves. We\nwere hunter folk, and we saw hunters and dogs, bears and young women, all manner of\nthings of interest to us. When seventeenth-century European sailors first saw the southern\nskies they put objects of seventeenth century interest in the heavens - toucans and peacocks,\ntelescopes and microscopes, compasses and the sterns of ships. If the constellations had\nbeen named in the twentieth century, I suppose we would see bicycles and refrigerators in\nthe sky, rock-and-roll \u2018stars\u2019 and perhaps even mushroom clouds - a new set of human.\nhopes and fears placed among the stars.\n\nOccasionally our ancestors would see a very bright star with a tail, glimpsed for just\na moment, hurtling across the sky. They called it a falling star, but it is not a good name:\nthe old stars are still there after the falling star falls. In some seasons there are many falling\nstars; in others very few. There is a kind of regularity here as well.\n\nLike the Sun and the Moon, stars always rise in the east and set in the west, taking\nthe whole night to cross the sky if they pass overhead. There are different constellations in\ndifferent seasons. The same constellations always rise at the beginning of autumn, say. It\nnever happens that a new constellation suddenly rises out of the east. There is an order, a\npredictability, a permanence about the stars. In a way, they are almost comforting.\n\nCertain stars rise just before or set just after the Sun - and at times and positions that\nvary with the seasons. If you made careful observations of the stars and recorded them over\nmany years, you could predict the seasons. You could also measure the time of year by\nnoting where on the horizon the Sun rose each day. In the skies was a great calendar,\navailable to anyone with dedication and ability and the means to keep records.\n\nOur ancestors built devices to measure the passing of the seasons. In Chaco Canyon,\nin New Mexico, there is a great roofless ceremonial kiva or temple, dating from the\neleventh century. On June 21, the longest day of the year, a shaft of sunlight enters a\nwindow at dawn and slowly moves so that it covers a special niche. But this happens only\naround June 21. I imagine the proud Anasazi people, who described themselves as \u2018The\nAncient Ones,\u201d gathered in their pews every June 21, dressed in feathers and rattles and\nturquoise to celebrate the power of the Sun. They also monitored the apparent motion of the\nMoon: the twenty-eight higher niches in the kiva may represent the number of days for the\nMoon to return to the same position among the constellations. These people paid close\nattention to the Sun and the Moon and the stars. Other devices based on similar ideas are\nfound at Angkor Wat in Cambodia; Stonehenge in England; Abu Simbel in Egypt; Chich\u00e9n\nItza in Mexico; and the Great Plains in North America.\n\nSome alleged calendrical devices may just possibly be due to chance - an accidental\nalignment of window and niche on June 21, say. But there are other devices wonderfully\ndifferent. At one locale in the American Southwest is a set of three upright slabs which\nwere moved from their original position about 1,000 years ago. A spiral a little like a\ngalaxy has been carved in the rock. On June 21, the first day of summer, a dagger of\nsunlight pouring through an opening between the slabs bisects the spiral; and on December\n21, the first day of winter, there are two daggers of sunlight that flank the spiral, a unique\napplication of the midday sun to read the calendar in the sky.\n\nWhy did people all over the world make such an effort to learn astronomy? We\nhunted gazelles and antelope and buffalo whose migrations ebbed and flowed with the\nseasons. Fruits and nuts were ready to be picked in some times but not in others. When we\ninvented agriculture, we had to take care to plant and harvest our crops in the right season.\nAnnual meetings of far-flung nomadic tribes were set for prescribed times. The ability to\n\nread the calendar in the skies was literally a matter of life and death. The reappearance of\nthe crescent moon after the new moon; the return of the Sun after a total eclipse; the rising\nof the Sun in the morning after its troublesome absence at night were noted by people\naround the world: these phenomena spoke to our ancestors of the possibility of surviving\ndeath. Up there in the skies was also a metaphor of immortality.\n\nThe wind whips through the canyons in the American Southwest, and there is no\none to hear it but us - a reminder of the 40,000 generations of thinking men and women\nwho preceded us, about whom we know almost nothing, upon whom our civilization is\nbased.\n\nAs ages passed, people learned from their ancestors. The more accurately you knew\nthe position and movements of the Sun and Moon and stars, the more reliably you could\npredict when to hunt, when to sow and reap, when to gather the tribes. As precision of\nmeasurement improved, records had to be kept, so astronomy encouraged observation and\nmathematics and the development of writing.\n\nBut then, much later, another rather curious idea arose, an assault by mysticism and\nsuperstition into what had been largely an empirical science. The Sun and stars controlled\nthe seasons, food, warmth. The Moon controlled the tides, the life cycles of many animals,\nand perhaps the human menstrual* period - of central importance for a passionate species\ndevoted to having children. There was another kind of object in the sky, the wandering or\nvagabond stars called planets. Our nomadic ancestors must have felt an affinity for the\nplanets. Not counting the Sun and the Moon, you could see only five of them. They moved\nagainst the background of more distant stars. If you followed their apparent motion over\nmany months, they would leave one constellation, enter another, occasionally even do a\nkind of slow loop-the-loop in the sky. Everything else in the sky had some real effect on\nhuman life. What must the influence of the planets be?\n\n* The root of the word means \u2018Moon.\u2019\n\nIn contemporary Western society, buying a magazine on astrology - at a newsstand,\nsay - is easy; it is much harder to find one on astronomy. Virtually every newspaper in\nAmerica has a daily column on astrology; there are hardly any that have even a weekly\ncolumn on astronomy. There are ten times more astrologers in the United States than\nastronomers. At parties, when I meet people who do not know I am a scientist, 1 am\nsometimes asked, \u2018Are you a Gemini?\u2019 (chances of success, one in twelve), or \u2018What sign\nare you?\u2019 Much more rarely am I asked, \u2018Have you heard that gold is made in supernova\nexplosions?\u2019 or \u2018When do you think Congress will approve a Mars Rover?\u2019\n\nAstrology contends that which constellation the planets are in at the moment of your\nbirth profoundly influences your future. A few thousand years ago, the idea developed that\nthe motions of the planets determined the fates of kings, dynasties, empires. Astrologers\nstudied the motions of the planets and asked themselves what had happened the last time\nthat, say, Venus was rising in the Constellation of the Goat; perhaps something similar\nwould happen this time as well. It was a subtle and risky business. Astrologers came to be\nemployed only by the State. In many countries it was a capital offense for anyone but the\nofficial astrologer to read the portents in the skies: a good way to overthrow a regime was\nto predict its downfall. Chinese court astrologers who made inaccurate predictions were\nexecuted. Others simply doctored the records so that afterwards they were in perfect\nconformity with events. Astrology developed into a strange combination of observations,\n\nmathematics and careful record-keeping with fuzzy thinking and pious fraud.\n\nBut if the planets could determine the destinies of nations, how could they avoid\ninfluencing what will happen to me tomorrow? The notion of a personal astrology\ndeveloped in Alexandrian Egypt and spread through the Greek and Roman worlds about\n2,000 years ago. We today can recognize the antiquity of astrology in words such as\ndisaster, which is Greek for \u2018bad star,\u2019 influenza, Italian for (astral) \u2018influence\u2019; mazeltov,\nHebrew - and, ultimately, Babylonian - for \u2018good constellation,\u2019 or the Yiddish word\nshlamazel, applied to someone plagued by relentless ill-fortune, which again traces to the\nBabylonian astronomical lexicon. According to Pliny, there were Romans considered\nsideratio, \u2018planetstruck.\u2019 Planets were widely thought to be a direct cause of death. Or\nconsider consider: it means \u2018with the planets,\u2019 evidently the prerequisite for serious\nreflection. John Graunt compiled the mortality statistics in the City of London in 1632.\nAmong the terrible losses from infant and childhood diseases and such exotic illnesses as\n\u2018the rising of the lights\u2019 and \u2018the King\u2019s evil,\u2019 we find that, of 9,535 deaths, 13 people\nsuccumbed to \u2018planet,\u2019 more than died of cancer. I wonder what the symptoms were.\n\nAnd personal astrology is with us still: consider two different newspaper astrology\ncolumns published in the same city on the same day. For example, we can examine the\nNew York Post and the New York Daily News on September 21, 1979. Suppose you are a\nLibra - that is, born between September 23 and October 22. According to the astrologer for\nthe Post, \u2018a compromise will help ease tension\u2019; useful, perhaps, but somewhat vague.\nAccording to the Daily News\u2019s astrologer, you must \u2018demand more of yourself,\u2019 an\nadmonition that is also vague but also different. These \u2018predictions\u2019 are not predictions;\nrather they are pieces of advice - they tell what to do, not what will happen. Deliberately,\nthey are phrased so generally that they could apply to anyone. And they display major\nmutual inconsistencies. Why are they published as unapologetically as sports statistics and\nstock market reports?\n\nAstrology can be tested by the lives of twins. There are many cases in which one\ntwin is killed in childhood, in a riding accident, say, or is struck by lightning, while the\nother lives to a prosperous old age. Each was born in precisely the same place and within\nminutes of the other. Exactly the same planets were rising at their births. If astrology were\nvalid, how could two such twins have such profoundly different fates? It also turns out that\nastrologers cannot even agree among themselves on what a given horoscope means. In\ncareful tests, they are unable to predict the character and future of people they knew\nnothing about except their time and place of birth.*\n\n* Skepticism about astrology and related doctrines is neither new nor exclusive to the West. For\nexample, in the Essays on Idleness, written in 1332 by Tsurezuregusa Kenko, we read:\nThe Yin-Yang teachings (in Japan] have nothing to say on the subject of the Red Tongue Days.\nFormerly people did not avoid these days, but of late - I wonder who is responsible for starting this\ncustom - people have taken to saying things such as, \u2018An enterprise begun on a Red Tongue Day will\nnever see an end,\u2019 or, \u2018Anything you say or do on a Red Tongue Day is bound to come to naught:\nyou lose what you\u2019ve won, your plans are undone.\u2019 What nonsense! If one counted the projects\nbegun on carefully selected \u2018lucky days\u2019 which came to nothing in the end, they would probably be\nquite as many as the fruitless enterprises begun on the Red Tongue days.\n\nThere is something curious about the national flags of the planet Earth. The flag of\nthe United States has fifty stars; the Soviet Union and Israel, one each; Burma, fourteen;\nGrenada and Venezuela, seven; China, five; Iraq, three; Sio Tom\u00e9 a Principe, two; Japan,\n\nUruguay, Malawi, Bangladesh and Taiwan, the Sun; Brazil, a celestial sphere; Australia,\nWestern Samoa, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea, the constellation of the Southern\nCross; Bhutan, the dragon pearl, symbol of the Earth; Cambodia, the Angkor Wat\nastronomical observatory; India, South Korea and the Mongolian Peoples\u2019 Republic,\ncosmological symbols. Many socialist nations display stars. Many Islamic countries display\ncrescent moons. Almost half of our national flags exhibit astronomical symbols. The\nphenomenon is transcultural, non-sectarian, worldwide. It is also not restricted to our time:\nSumerian cylinder seals from the third millennium B.C. and Taoist flags in\nprerevolutionary China displayed constellations. Nations, I do not doubt, wish to embrace\nsomething of the power and credibility of the heavens. We seek a connection with the\nCosmos. We want to count in the grand scale of things. And it turns out we are connected -\nnot in the personal, small-scale unimaginative fashion that the astrologers pretend, but in\nthe deepest ways, involving the origin of matter, the habitability of the Earth, the evolution\nand destiny of the human species, themes to which we will return.\n\nModern popular astrology runs directly back to Claudius Ptolemaeus, whom we call\nPtolemy, although he was unrelated to the kings of the same name. He worked in the\nLibrary of Alexandria in the second century. All that arcane business about planets\nascendant in this or that solar or lunar \u2018house\u2019 or the \u2018Age of Aquarius\u2019 comes from\nPtolemy, who codified the Babylonian astrological tradition. Here is a typical horoscope\nfrom Ptolemy\u2019s time, written in Greek on papyrus, for a little girl born in the year 150: \u2018The\nbirth of Philoe. The 10th year of Antoninus Caesar the lord, Phamenoth 15 to 16, first hour\nof the night. Sun in Pisces, Jupiter and Mercury in Aries, Saturn in Cancer, Mars in Leo,\nVenus and the Moon in Aquarius, horoscopus Capricorn.\u2019 The method of enumerating the\nmonths and the years has changed much more over the intervening centuries than have the\nastrological niceties. A typical excerpt from Ptolemy\u2019s astrological book, the Tetrabiblos,\nreads: \u2018Saturn, if he is in the orient, makes his subjects in appearance dark-skinned, robust,\nblack-haired, curly-haired, hairy-chested, with eyes of moderate size, of middling stature,\nand in temperament having an excess of the moist and cold.\u2019 Ptolemy believed not only that\nbehavior patterns were influenced by the planet\u2019s and the stars but also that questions of\nstature, complexion, national character and even congenital physical abnormalities were\ndetermined by the stars. On this point modern astrologers seem to have adopted a more\ncautious position.\n\nBut modern astrologers have forgotten about the precession of the equinoxes, which\nPtolemy understood. They ignore atmospheric refraction, about which Ptolemy wrote. They\npay almost no attention to all the moons and planets, asteroids and comets, quasars and\npulsars, exploding galaxies, symbiotic stars, cataclysmic variables and X-ray sources that\nhave been discovered since Ptolemy\u2019s time. Astronomy is a science - the study of the\nuniverse as it is. Astrology is a pseudoscience - a claim, in the absence of good evidence,\nthat the other planets affect our everyday lives. In Ptolemy\u2019s time the distinction between\nastronomy and astrology was not clear. Today it is.\n\nAs an astronomer, Ptolemy named the stars, listed their brightnesses, gave good\nreasons for believing that the Earth is a sphere, set down rules for predicting eclipses and,\nperhaps most important, tried to understand why planets exhibit that strange, wandering\nmotion against the background of distant constellations. He developed a predictive model\nto understand planetary motions and decode the message in the skies. The study of the\nheavens brought Ptolemy a kind of ecstasy. \u2018Mortal as I am,\u2019 he wrote, \u2018I know that I am\nborn for a day. But when I follow at my pleasure the serried multitude of the stars in their\n\ncircular course, my feet no longer touch the Earth. . .\u201d\n\nPtolemy believed that the Earth was at the center of the universe; that the Sun,\nMoon, planets and stars went around the Earth. This is the most natural idea in the world.\nThe Earth seems steady, solid, immobile, while we can see the heavenly bodies rising and\nsetting each day. Every culture has leaped to the geocentric hypothesis. As Johannes Kepler\nwrote, \u2018It is therefore impossible that reason not previously instructed should imagine\nanything other than that the Earth is a kind of vast house with the vault of the sky placed on\ntop of it; it is motionless and within it the Sun being so small passes from one region to\nanother, like a bird wandering through the air.\u2019 But how do we explain the apparent motion\nof the planets - Mars, for example, which had been known for thousands of years before\nPtolemy\u2019s time? (One of the epithets given Mars by the ancient Egyptians was sekded-of\nem khetkhet, which means \u2018who travels backwards,\u2019 a clear reference to its retrograde or\nloop-the-loop apparent motion.)\n\nPtolemy\u2019s model of planetary motion can be represented by a little machine, like\nthose that, serving a similar purpose, existed in Ptolemy\u2019s time.* The problem was to figure\nout a \u2018real\u2019 motion of the planets, as seen from up there, on the \u2018outside,\u2019 which would\nreproduce with great accuracy the apparent motion of the planets, as seen from down here,\non the \u2018inside.\u2019\n\n* Four centuries earlier, such a device was constructed by Archimedes and examined and described\nby Cicero in Rome, where it had been carried by the Roman general Marcellus, one of whose soldiers had,\ngratuitously and against orders, killed the septuagenarian scientist during the conquest of Syracuse.\n\nThe planets were imagined to go around the Earth affixed to perfect transparent\nspheres. But they were not attached directly to the spheres, but indirectly, through a kind of\noff-center wheel. The sphere turns, the little wheel rotates, and, as seen from the Earth,\nMars does its loop-the-loop. This model permitted reasonably accurate predictions of\nplanetary motion, certainly good enough for the precision of measurement available in\nPtolemy\u2019s day, and even many centuries later.\n\nPtolemy\u2019s aetherial spheres, imagined in medieval times to be made of crystal, are\nwhy we still talk about the music of the spheres and a seventh heaven (there was a\n\u2018heaven,\u2019 or sphere for the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, and\none more for the stars). With the Earth the center of the Universe, with creation pivoted\nabout terrestrial events, with the heavens imagined constructed on utterly unearthly\nprinciples, there was little motivation for astronomical observations. Supported by the\nChurch through the Dark Ages, Ptolemy\u2019s model helped prevent the advance of astronomy\nfor a millennium. Finally, in 1543, a quite different hypothesis to explain the apparent\nmotion of the planets was published by a Polish Catholic cleric named Nicholas\nCopernicus. Its most daring feature was the proposition that the Sun, not the Earth, was at\nthe center of the universe. The Earth was demoted to just one of the planets, third from the\nSun, moving in a perfect circular orbit. (Ptolemy had considered such a heliocentric model\nbut rejected it immediately; from the physics of Aristotle, the implied violent rotation of the\nEarth seemed contrary to observation.)\n\nIt worked at least as well as Ptolemy\u2019s spheres in explaining the apparent motion of\nthe planets. But it annoyed many people. In 1616 the Catholic Church placed Copernicus\u2019\nwork on its list of forbidden books \u2018until corrected\u2019 by local ecclesiastical censors, where it\nremained until 1835.* Martin Luther described him as \u2018an upstart astrologer . . . This fool\n\nwishes to reverse the entire science of astronomy. But Sacred Scripture tells us that Joshua\ncommanded the Sun to stand still, and not the Earth.\u2019 Even some of Copernicus\u2019 admirers\nargued that he had not really believed in a Sun-centered universe but had merely proposed\nit as a convenience for calculating the motions of the planets.\n\n* Ina recent inventory of nearly every sixteenth-century copy of Copernicus\u2019 book, Owen Gingerich\nhas found the censorship to have been ineffective: only 60 percent of the copies in Italy were \u2018corrected,\u2019 and\nnot one in Iberia.\n\nThe epochal confrontation between the two views of the Cosmos - Earth-centered\nand Sun-centered - reached a climax in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in the\nperson of a man who was, like Ptolemy, both astrologer and astronomer. He lived in a time\nwhen the human spirit was fettered and the mind chained; when the ecclesiastical\npronouncements of a millennium or two earlier on scientific matters were considered more\nreliable than contemporary findings made with techniques unavailable to the ancients;\nwhen deviations, even on arcane theological matters, from the prevailing doxological\npreferences, Catholic or Protestant, were punished by humiliation, taxation, exile, torture or\ndeath. The heavens were inhabited by angels, demons and the Hand of God, turning the\nplanetary crystal spheres. Science was barren of the idea that underlying the phenomena of\nNature might be the laws of physics. But the brave and lonely struggle of this man was to\nignite the modern scientific revolution.\n\nJohannes Kepler was born in Germany in 1571 and sent as a boy to the Protestant\nseminary school in the provincial town of Maulbronn to be educated for the clergy. It was a\nkind of boot camp, training young minds in the use of theological weaponry against the\nfortress of Roman Catholicism. Kepler, stubborn, intelligent and fiercely independent,\nsuffered two friendless years in bleak Maulbronn, becoming isolated and withdrawn, his\nthoughts devoted to his imagined unworthiness in the eyes of God. He repented a thousand\nsins no more wicked than another\u2019s and despaired of ever attaining salvation.\n\nBut God became for him more than a divine wrath craving propitiation. Kepler\u2019s God was\nthe creative power of the Cosmos. The boy\u2019s curiosity conquered his fear. He wished to\nlearn the eschatology of the world; he dared to contemplate the Mind of God. These\ndangerous visions, at first insubstantial as a memory, became a lifelong obsession. The\nhubristic longings of a child seminarian were to carry Europe out of the cloister of medieval\nthought.\n\nThe sciences of classical antiquity had been silenced more than a thousand years\nbefore, but in the late Middle Ages some faint echoes of those voices, preserved by Arab\nscholars, began to insinuate themselves into the European educational curriculum. In\nMaulbronn, Kepler heard their reverberations, studying, besides theology, Greek and Latin,\nmusic and mathematics. In the geometry of Euclid he thought he glimpsed an image of\nperfection and cosmic glory. He was later to write: \u2018Geometry existed before the Creation.\nIt is co-eternal with the mind of God . .. Geometry provided God with a model for the\nCreation . .. Geometry is God Himself.\u201d\n\nIn the midst of Kepler\u2019s mathematical raptures, and despite his sequestered life, the\nimperfections of the outside world must also have molded his character. Superstition was a\nwidely available nostrum for people powerless against the miseries of famine, pestilence\nand deadly doctrinal conflict. For many, the only certainty was the stars, and the ancient\nastrological conceit prospered in the courtyards and taverns of fear-haunted Europe. Kepler,\n\nwhose attitude toward astrology remained ambiguous all his life, wondered whether there\nmight be hidden patterns underlying the apparent chaos of daily life. If the world was\ncrafted by God, should it not be examined closely? Was not all of creation an expression of\nthe harmonies in the mind of God? The book of Nature had waited more than a millennium\nfor a reader.\n\nIn 1589, Kepler left Maulbronn to study for the clergy at the great university in\nTiibingen and found it a liberation. Confronted by the most vital intellectual currents of the\ntime, his genius was immediately recognized by his teachers - one of whom introduced the\nyoung man to the dangerous mysteries of the Copernican hypothesis. A heliocentric\nuniverse resonated with Kepler\u2019s religious sense, and he embraced it with fervor. The Sun\nwas a metaphor for God, around Whom all else revolves. Before he was to be ordained, he\nwas made an attractive offer of secular employment, which - perhaps because he felt\nhimself indifferently suited to an ecclesiastical career - he found himself accepting. He was\nsummoned to Graz, in Austria, to teach secondary school mathematics, and began a little\nlater to prepare astronomical and meteorological almanacs and to cast horoscopes. \u2018God\nprovides for every animal his means of sustenance,\u2019 he wrote. \u2018For the astronomer, He has\nprovided astrology.\u2019\n\nKepler was a brilliant thinker and a lucid writer, but he was a disaster as a\nclassroom teacher. He mumbled. He digressed. He was at times utterly incomprehensible.\nHe drew only a handful of students his first year at Graz; the next year there were none. He\nwas distracted by an incessant interior clamor of associations and speculations vying for his\nattention. And one pleasant summer afternoon, deep in the interstices of one of his\ninterminable lectures, he was visited by a revelation that was to alter radically the future of\nastronomy. Perhaps he stopped in mid-sentence. His inattentive students, longing for the\nend of the day, took little notice, I suspect, of the historic moment.\n\nThere were only six planets known in Kepler\u2019s time: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,\nJupiter and Saturn. Kepler wondered why only six? Why not twenty, or a hundred? Why\ndid they have the spacing between their orbits that Copernicus had deduced? No one had\never asked such questions before. There were known to be five regular or \u2018platonic\u2019 solids,\nwhose sides were regular polygons, as known to the ancient Greek mathematicians after the\ntime of Pythagoras. Kepler thought the two numbers were connected, that the reason there\nwere only six planets was because there were only five regular solids, and that these solids,\ninscribed or nested one within another, would specify the distances of the planets from the\nSun. In these perfect forms, he believed he had recognized the invisible supporting\nstructures for the spheres of the six planets. He called his revelation The Cosmic Mystery.\nThe connection between the solids of Pythagoras and the disposition of the planets could\nadmit but one explanation: the Hand of God, Geometer.\n\nKepler was amazed that he - immersed, so he thought, in sin - should have been\ndivinely chosen to make this great discovery. He submitted a proposal for a research grant\nto the Duke of Wiirttemberg, offering to supervise the construction of his nested solids as a\nthree-dimensional model so that others could glimpse the beauty of the holy geometry. It\nmight, he added, be contrived of silver and precious stones and serve incidentally as a ducal\nchalice. The proposal was rejected with the kindly advice that he first construct a less\nexpensive version out of paper, which he promptly attempted to do: \u2018The intense pleasure I\nhave received from this discovery can never be told in words . . . I shunned no calculation\nno matter how difficult. Days and nights I spent in mathematical labors, until I could see\nwhether my hypothesis would agree with the orbits of Copernicus or whether my joy was to\n\nvanish into thin air.\u2019 But no matter how hard he tried, the solids and the planetary orbits did\nnot agree well. The elegance and grandeur of the theory, however, persuaded him that the\nobservations must be in error, a conclusion drawn when the observations are unobliging by\nmany other theorists in the history of science. There was then only one man in the world\nwho had access to more accurate observations of apparent planetary positions, a self-exiled\nDanish nobleman who had accepted the post of Imperial Mathematician in the Court of the\nHoly Roman Emperor, Rudolf I. That man was Tycho Brahe. By chance, at Rudolf\u2019s\nsuggestion, he had just invited Kepler, whose mathematical fame was growing, to join him\nin Prague.\n\nA provincial schoolteacher of humble origins, unknown to all but a few\nmathematicians, Kepler was diffident about Tycho\u2019s offer. But the decision was made for\nhim. In 1598, one of the many premonitory tremors of the coming Thirty Years\u2019 War\nengulfed him. The local Catholic archduke, steadfast in dogmatic certainty, vowed he\nwould rather \u2018make a desert of the country than rule over heretics.\u2019* Protestants were\nexcluded from economic and political power, Kepler\u2019s school was closed, and prayers,\nbooks and hymns deemed heretical were forbidden. Finally the townspeople were\nsummoned to individual examinations on the soundness of their private religious\nconvictions, those refusing to profess the Roman Catholic faith being fined a tenth of their\nincome and, upon pain of death, exiled forever from Graz. Kepler chose exile: \u2018Hypocrisy I\nhave never learned. I am in earnest about faith. I do not play with it.\u2019\n\n* By no means the most extreme such remark in medieval or Reformation Europe. Upon being asked\nhow to distinguish the faithful from the infidel in the siege of a largely Albigensian city, Domingo de\nGuzman, later known as Saint Dominic, allegedly replied: \u2018Kill them all. God will know his own.\u2019\n\nLeaving Graz, Kepler, his wife and stepdaughter set out on the difficult journey to\nPrague. Theirs was not a happy marriage. Chronically ill, having recently lost two young\nchildren, his wife was described as \u2018stupid, sulking, lonely, melancholy.\u2019 She had no\nunderstanding of her husband\u2019s work and, having been raised among the minor rural\ngentry, she despised his impecunious profession. He for his part alternately admonished\nand ignored her, \u2018for my studies sometimes made me thoughtless; but I learned my lesson, I\nlearned to have patience with her. When I saw that she took my words to heart, I would\nrather have bitten my own finger than to give her further offense.\u2019 But Kepler remained\npreoccupied with his work.\n\nHe envisioned Tycho\u2019s domain as a refuge from the evils of the time, as the place\nwhere his Cosmic Mystery would be confirmed. He aspired to become a colleague of the\ngreat Tycho Brahe, who for thirty-five years had devoted himself, before the invention of\nthe telescope, to the measurement of a clockwork universe, ordered and precise. Kepler\u2019s\nexpectations were to be unfulfilled. Tycho himself was a flamboyant figure, festooned with\na golden nose, the original having been lost in a student duel fought over who was the\nsuperior mathematician. Around him was a raucous entourage of assistants, sycophants,\ndistant relatives and assorted hangers-on. Their endless revelry, their innuendoes and\nintrigues, their cruel mockery of the pious and scholarly country bumpkin depressed and\nsaddened Kepler: \u2018Tycho . . . is superlatively rich but knows not how to make use of it. Any\nsingle instrument of his costs more than my and my whole family\u2019s fortunes put together.\u2019\n\nImpatient to see Tycho\u2019s astronomical data, Kepler would be thrown only a few\nscraps at a time: \u2018Tycho gave me no opportunity to share in his experiences. He would\n\nonly, in the course of a meal and, in between other matters, mention, as if in passing, today\nthe figure of the apogee of one planet, tomorrow the nodes of another . .. Tycho posesses\nthe best observations . . . He also has collaborators. He lacks only the architect who would\nput all this to use.\u2019 Tycho was the greatest observational genius of the age, and Kepler the\ngreatest theoretician. Each knew that, alone, he would be unable to achieve the synthesis of\nan accurate and coherent world system, which they both felt to be imminent. But Tycho\nwas not about to make a gift of his life\u2019s work to a much younger potential rival. Joint\nauthorship of the results, if any, of the collaboration was for some reason unacceptable. The\nbirth of modern science - the offspring of theory and observation - teetered on the precipice\nof their mutual mistrust. In the remaining eighteen months that Tycho was to live, the two\nquarreled and were reconciled repeatedly. At a dinner given by the Baron of Rosenberg,\nTycho, having robustly drunk much wine, \u2018placed civility ahead of health,\u2019 and resisted his\nbody\u2019s urgings to leave, even if briefly, before the baron. The consequent urinary infection\nworsened when Tycho resolutely rejected advice to temper his eating and drinking. On his\ndeathbed, Tycho bequeathed his observations to Kepler, and \u2018on the last night of his gentle\ndelirium, he repeated over and over again these words, like someone composing a poem:\n\u201cLet me not seem to have lived in vain . . . Let me not seem to have lived in vain.\u201d \u2019\n\nAfter Tycho\u2019s death, Kepler, now the new Imperial Mathematician, managed to\nextract the observations from Tycho\u2019s recalcitrant family. His conjecture that the orbits of\nthe planets are circumscribed by the five platonic solids was no more supported by Tycho\u2019s\ndata than by Copernicus\u2019. His \u2018Cosmic Mystery\u2019 was disproved entirely by the much later\ndiscoveries of the planets Uranus, Neptune and Pluto - there are no additional platonic\nsolids* that would determine their distances from the Sun. The nested Pythagorean solids\nalso made no allowance for the existence of the Earth\u2019s moon, and Galileo\u2019s discovery of\nthe four large moons of Jupiter was also discomfiting. But far from becoming morose,\nKepler wished to find additional satellites and wondered how many satellites each planet\nshould have. He wrote to Galileo: \u2018I immediately began to think how there could be any\naddition to the number of the planets without overturning my Mysterium Cosmographicum,\naccording to which Euclid\u2019s five regular solids do not allow more than six planets around\nthe Sun. . . lam so far from disbelieving the existence of the four circumjovial planets that\nI long for a telescope, to anticipate you, if possible, in discovering two around Mars, as the\nproportion seems to require, six or eight round Saturn, and perhaps one each round\nMercury and Venus.\u2019 Mars does have two small moons, and a major geological feature on\nthe larger of them is today called the Kepler Ridge in honor of this guess. But he was\nentirely mistaken about Saturn, Mercury and Venus, and Jupiter has many more moons\nthan Galileo discovered. We still do not really know why there are only nine planets, more\nor less, and why they have the relative distances from the Sun that they do. (See Chapter 8.)\n\n* The proof of this statement can be found in Appendix 2.\n\nTycho\u2019s observations of the apparent motion of Mars and other planets through the\nconstellations were made over a period of many years. These data, from the last few\ndecades before the telescope was invented, were the most accurate that had yet been\nobtained. Kepler worked with a passionate intensity to understand them: What real motion\nof the Earth and Mars about the Sun could explain, to the precision of measurement, the\napparent motion of Mars in the sky, including its retrograde loops through the background\nconstellations? Tycho had commended Mars to Kepler because its apparent motion seemed\n\nmost anomalous, most difficult to reconcile with an orbit made of circles. (To the reader\nwho might be bored by his many calculations, he later wrote: \u2018If you are wearied by this\ntedious procedure, take pity on me who carried out at least seventy trials.\u201d)\n\nPythagoras, in the sixth century B.C., Plato, Ptolemy and all the Christian\nastronomers before Kepler had assumed that the planets moved in circular paths. The circle\nwas thought to be a \u2018perfect\u2019 geometrical shape and the planets, placed high in the heavens,\naway from earthly \u2018corruption,\u2019 were also thought to be in some mystical sense \u2018perfect\u2019\nGalileo, Tycho and Copernicus were all committed to uniform circular planetary motion,\nthe latter asserting that \u2018the mind shudders\u2019 at the alternative, because \u2018it would be\nunworthy to suppose such a thing in a Creation constituted in the best possible way.\u2019 So at\nfirst Kepler tried to explain the observations by imagining that the Earth and Mars moved\nin circular orbits about the Sun.\n\nAfter three years of calculation, he believed he had found the correct values for a\nMartian circular orbit, which matched ten of Tycho\u2019s observations within two minutes of\narc. Now, there are 60 minutes of arc in an angular degree, and 90 degrees, a right angle,\nfrom the horizon to the zenith. So a few minutes of arc is a very small quantity to measure -\nespecially without a telescope. It is one-fifteenth the angular diameter of the full Moon as\nseen from Earth. But Kepler\u2019s replenishable ecstasy soon crumbled into gloom - because\ntwo of Tycho\u2019s further observations were inconsistent with Kepler\u2019s orbit, by as much as\neight minutes of arc:\n\nDivine Providence granted us such a diligent observer in Tycho Brahe that his\nobservations convicted this . . . calculation of an error of eight minutes; it is only\nright that we should accept God\u2019s gift with a grateful mind . . . If I had believed that\nwe could ignore these eight minutes, I would have patched up my hypothesis\naccordingly. But, since it was not permissible to ignore, those eight minutes pointed\nthe road to a complete reformation in astronomy.\n\nThe difference between a circular orbit and the true orbit could be distinguished\nonly by precise measurement and a courageous acceptance of the facts: \u2018The universe is\nstamped with the adornment of harmonic proportions, but harmonies must accommodate\nexperience.\u2019 Kepler was shaken at being compelled to abandon a circular orbit and to\nquestion his faith in the Divine Geometer. Having cleared the stable of astronomy of circles\nand spirals, he was left, he said, with \u2018only a single cartful of dung,\u2019 a stretched-out circle\nsomething like an oval.\n\nEventually, Kepler came to feel that his fascination with the circle had been a\ndelusion. The Earth was a planet, as Copernicus had said, and it was entirely obvious to\nKepler that the Earth, wracked by wars, pestilence, famine and unhappiness, fell short of\nperfection. Kepler was one of the first people since antiquity to propose that the planets\nwere material objects made of imperfect stuff like the Earth. And if planets were\n\u2018imperfect,\u2019 why not their orbits as well? He tried various oval-like curves, calculated\naway, made some arithmetical mistakes (which caused him at first to reject the correct\nanswer) and months later in some desperation tried the formula for an ellipse, first codified\nin the Alexandrian Library by Apollonius of Perga. He found that it matched Tycho\u2019s\nobservations beautifully: \u2018The truth of nature, which I had rejected and chased away,\nreturned by stealth through the back door, disguising itself to be accepted . .. Ah, what a\nfoolish bird I have been!\u2019\n\nKepler had found that Mars moves about the Sun not in a circle, but in an ellipse.\nThe other planets have orbits much less elliptical than that of Mars, and if Tycho had urged\nhim to study the motion of, say, Venus, Kepler might never have discovered the true orbits\nof the planets. In such an orbit the Sun is not at the center but is offset, at the focus of the\nellipse. When a given planet is at its nearest to the Sun, it speeds up. When it is at its\nfarthest, it sows down. Such motion is why we describe the planets as forever falling\ntoward, but never reaching, the Sun. Kepler\u2019s first law of planetary motion is simply this: A\nplanet moves in an ellipse with the Sun at one focus.\n\nIn uniform circular motion, an equal angle or fraction of the arc of a circle is\ncovered in equal times. So, for example, it takes twice as long to go two-thirds of the way\naround a circle as it does to go one-third of the way around. Kepler found something\ndifferent for elliptical orbits: As the planet moves along its orbit, it sweeps out a little\nwedge-shaped area within the ellipse. When it is close to the Sun, in a given period of time\nit traces out a large arc in its orbit, but the area represented by that arc is not very large\nbecause the planet is then near the Sun. When the planet is far from the Sun, it covers a\nmuch smaller arc in the same period of time, but that arc corresponds to a bigger area\nbecause the Sun is now more distant. Kepler found that these two areas were precisely the\nsame no matter how elliptical the orbit: the long skinny area, corresponding to the planet\nfar from the Sun, and the shorter, squatter area, when the planet is close to the Sun, are\nexactly equal. This was Kepler\u2019s second law of planetary motion: Planets sweep out equal\nareas in equal times.\n\nKepler\u2019s first two laws may seem a little remote and abstract: planets move in\nellipses, and sweep out equal areas in equal times. Well, so what? Circular motion is easier\nto grasp. We might have a tendency to dismiss these laws as mere mathematical tinkering,\nsomething removed from everyday life. But these are the laws our planet obeys as we\nourselves, glued by gravity to the surface of the Earth, hurtle through interplanetary space.\nWe move in accord with laws of nature that Kepler first discovered. When we send\nspacecraft to the planets, when we observe double stars, when we examine the motion of\ndistant galaxies; we find that throughout the universe Kepler\u2019s laws are obeyed.\n\nMany years later, Kepler came upon his third and last law of planetary motion, a\nlaw that relates the motion of various planets to one another, that lays out correctly the\nclockwork of the solar system. He described it in a book called The Harmonies of the\nWorld. Kepler understood many things by the word harmony: the order and beauty of\nplanetary motion, the existence of mathematical laws explaining that motion - an idea that\ngoes back to Pythagoras - and even harmony in the musical sense, the \u2018harmony of the\nspheres.\u2019 Unlike the orbits of Mercury and Mars, the orbits of other planets depart so little\nfrom circularity that we cannot make out their true shapes even in an extremely accurate\ndiagram. The Earth is our moving platform from which we observe the motion of the other\nplanets against the backdrop of distant constellations. The inner planets move rapidly in\ntheir orbits - that is why Mercury has the name it does: Mercury was the messenger of the\ngods. Venus, Earth and Mars move progressively less rapidly about the Sun. The outer\nplanets, such as Jupiter and Saturn, move stately and slow, as befits the kings of the gods.\n\nKepler\u2019s third or harmonic law states that the squares of the periods of the planets\n(the times for them to complete one orbit) are proportional to the cubes of their average\ndistance from the Sun; the more distant the planet, the more slowly it moves, but according\nto a precise mathematical law: P\u2019 = a\u2019, where P represents the period of revolution of the\nplanet about the Sun, measured in years, and a the distance of the planet from the Sun\n\nmeasured in \u2018astronomical units.\u2019 An astronomical unit is the distance of the Earth from the\nSun. Jupiter, for example, is five astronomical units from the Sun, and a=5x5x5=125.\nWhat number times itself equals 125? Why, 11, close enough. And 11 years is the period\nfor Jupiter to go once around the Sun. A similar argument applies for every planet and\nasteroid and comet. Not content merely to have extracted from Nature the laws of planetary\nmotion, Kepler endeavored to find some still more fundamental underlying cause, some\ninfluence of the Sun on the kinematics of worlds. The planets sped up on approaching the\nSun and slowed down on retreating from it. Somehow the distant planets sensed the Sun\u2019s\npresence. Magnetism also was an influence felt at a distance, and in a stunning anticipation\nof the idea of universal gravitation, Kepler suggested that the underlying cause was akin to\nmagnetism:\n\nMy aim in this is to show that the celestial machine is to be likened not to a divine\norganism but rather to a clockwork . . . , insofar as nearly all the manifold\nmovements are carried out by means of a single, quite simple magnetic force, as in\nthe case of a clockwork [where] all motions [are caused] by a simple weight.\n\nMagnetism is, of course, not the same as gravity, but Kepler\u2019s fundamental\ninnovation here is nothing short of breathtaking: he proposed that quantitative physical\nlaws that apply to the Earth are also the underpinnings of quantitative physical laws that\ngovern the heavens. It was the first nonmystical explanation of motion in the heavens; it\nmade the Earth a province of the Cosmos. \u2018Astronomy,\u2019 he said \u2018is part of physics.\u2019 Kepler\nstood at a cusp in history; the last scientific astrologer was the first astrophysicist.\n\nNot given to quiet understatement, Kepler assessed his discoveries in these words:\n\nWith this symphony of voices man can play through the eternity of time in less than\nan hour, and can taste in small measure the delight of God, the Supreme Artist . . . 1\nyield freely to the sacred frenzy . . . the die is cast, and I am writing the book - to be\nread either now or by posterity, it matters not. It can wait a century for a reader, as\nGod Himself has waited 6,000 years for a witness.\n\nWithin the \u2018symphony of voices,\u2019 Kepler believed that the speed of each planet corresponds\nto certain notes in the Latinate musical scale popular in his day - do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti,\ndo. He claimed that in the harmony of the spheres, the tones of Earth are fa and mi, that the\nEarth is forever humming fa and mi, and that they stand in a straightforward way for the\nLatin word for famine. He argued, not unsuccessfully, that the Earth was best described by\nthat single doleful word.\n\nExactly eight days after Kepler\u2019s discovery of his third law, the incident that\nunleashed the Thirty Years\u2019 War transpired in Prague. The war\u2019s convulsions shattered the\nlives of millions, Kepler among them. He lost his wife and son to an epidemic carried by\nthe soldiery, his royal patron was deposed, and he was excommunicated by the Lutheran\nChurch for his uncompromising individualism on matters of doctrine. Kepler was a refugee\nonce again. The conflict, portrayed by both the Catholics and the Protestants as a holy war,\nwas more an exploitation of religious fanaticism by those hungry for land and power. In the\npast, wars had tended to be resolved when the belligerent princes had exhausted their\nresources. But now organized pillage was introduced as a means of keeping armies in the\n\nfield. The savaged population of Europe stood helpless as plowshares and pruning hooks\nwere literally beaten into swords and spears.*\n\n* Some examples are still to be seen in the Graz armory.\n\nWaves of rumor and paranoia swept through the countryside, enveloping especially\nthe powerless. Among the many scapegoats chosen were elderly women living alone, who\nwere charged with witchcraft. Kepler\u2019s mother was carried away in the middle of the night\nin a laundry chest. In Kepler\u2019s little hometown of Weil der Stadt, roughly three women\nwere tortured and killed as witches every year between 1615 and 1629. And Katharina\nKepler was a cantankerous old woman. She engaged in disputes that annoyed the local\nnobility, and she sold soporific and perhaps hallucinogenic drugs as do contemporary\nMexican curanderas. Poor Kepler believed that he himself had contributed to her arrest.\n\nIt came about because Kepler wrote one of the first works of science fiction,\nintended to explain and popularize science. It was called the Somnium, \u2018The Dream.\u2019 He\nimagined a journey to the Moon, the space travelers standing on the lunar surface and\nobserving the lovely planet Earth rotating slowly in the sky above them. By changing our\nperspective we can figure out how worlds work. In Kepler\u2019s time one of the chief\nobjections to the idea that the Earth turns was the fact that people do not feel the motion. In\nthe Somnium he tried to make the rotation of the Earth plausible, dramatic, comprehensible:\n\u2018As long as the multitude does not err .... I want to be on the side of the many. Therefore, I\ntake great pains to explain to as many people as possible.\u2019 (On another occasion he wrote in\na letter, \u2018Do not sentence me completely to the treadmill of mathematical calculations -\nleave me time for philosophical speculations, my sole delight.\u2019*)\n\n* Brahe, like Kepler, was far from hostile to astrology, although he carefully distinguished his own\nsecret version of astrology from the more common variants of his time, which he thought conducive to\nsuperstition. In his book Astronomiae Instauratae Mechonica, published in 1598, he argued that astrology is\n\u2018really more reliable than one would think\u2019 if charts of the position of the stars were properly improved. Brahe\nwrote: \u2018I have been occupied in alchemy, as much as by the celestial studies, from my 23rd year.\u2019 But both of\nthese pseudosciences, he felt, had secrets far too dangerous for the general populace (although entirely safe,\nhe thought, in the hands of those princes and kings from whom he sought support). Brahe continued the long\nand truly dangerous tradition of some scientists who believe that only they and the temporal and ecclesiastical\npowers can be trusted with arcane knowledge: \u2018It serves no useful purpose and is unreasonable, to make such\nthings generally known.\u2019 Kepler, on the other hand, lectured on astronomy in schools, published extensively\nand often at his own expense, and wrote science fiction, which was certainly not intended primarily for his\nscientific peers. He may not have been a popular writer of science in the modern sense, but the transition in\nattitudes in the single generation that separated Tycho and Kepler is telling.\n\nWith the invention of the telescope, what Kepler called \u2018lunar geography\u2019 was\nbecoming possible. In the Somnium, he described the Moon as filled with mountains and\nvalleys and as \u2018porous, as though dug through with hollows and continuous caves,\u2019 a\nreference to the lunar craters Galileo had recently discovered with the first astronomical\ntelescope. He also imagined that the Moon had its inhabitants, well adapted to the\ninclemencies of the local environment. He describes the slowly rotating Earth viewed from\nthe lunar surface and imagines the continents and oceans of our planet to produce some\nassociative image like the Man in the Moon. He pictures the near contact of southern Spain\nwith North Africa at the Straits of Gibraltar as a young woman in a flowing dress about to\nkiss her lover - although rubbing noses looks more like it to me.\n\nBecause of the length of the lunar day and night Kepler described \u2018the great\nintemperateness of climate and the most violent alternation of extreme heat and cold on the\nMoon,\u2019 which is entirely correct. Of course, he did not get everything right. He believed,\nfor example, that there was a substantial lunar atmosphere and oceans and inhabitants. Most\ncurious is his view of the origin of the lunar craters, which make the Moon, he says, \u2018not\ndissimilar to the face of a boy disfigured with smallpox.\u2019 He argued correctly that the\ncraters are depressions rather than mounds. From his own observations he noted the\nramparts surrounding many craters and the existence of central peaks. But he thought that\ntheir regular circular shape implied such a degree of order that only intelligent life could\nexplain them. He did not realize that great rocks falling out of the sky would produce a\nlocal explosion, perfectly symmetric in all directions, that would carve out a circular cavity\n- the origin of the bulk of the craters on the Moon and the other terrestrial planets. He\ndeduced instead \u2018the existence of some race rationally capable of constructing those\nhollows on the surface of the Moon. This race must have many individuals, so that one\ngroup puts one hollow to use while another group constructs another hollow.\u2019 Against the\nview that such great construction projects were unlikely, Kepler offered as counterexamples\nthe pyramids of Egypt and the Great Wall of China, which can, in fact, be seen today from\nEarth orbit. The idea that geometrical order reveals an underlying intelligence was central\nto Kepler\u2019s life. His argument on the lunar craters is a clear foreshadowing of the Martian\ncanal controversy (Chapter 5). It is striking that the observational search for extraterrestrial\nlife began in the same generation as the invention of the telescope, and with the greatest\ntheoretician of the age.\n\nParts of the Somnium were clearly autobiographical. The hero, for example, visits\nTycho Brahe. He has parents who sell drugs. His mother consorts with spirits and daemons,\none of whom eventually provides the means to travel to the moon. The Somnium makes\nclear to us, although it did not to all of Kepler\u2019s contemporaries, that \u2018in a dream one must\nbe allowed the liberty of imagining occasionally that which never existed in the world of\nsense perception.\u2019 Science fiction was a new idea at the time of the Thirty Years\u2019 War, and\nKepler\u2019s book was used as evidence that his mother was a witch.\n\nIn the midst of other grave personal problems. Kepler rushed to Wiirttemberg to\nfind his seventy-four-year-old mother chained in a Protestant secular dungeon and\nthreatened, like Galileo in a Catholic dungeon, with torture. He set about, as a scientist\nnaturally would, to find natural explanations for the various events that had precipitated the\naccusations of witchcraft, including minor physical ailments that the burghers of\nWiirttemberg had attributed to her spells. The research was successful, a triumph, as was\nmuch of the rest of his life, of reason over superstition. His mother was exiled, with a\nsentence of death passed on her should she ever return to Wiirttemberg; and Kepler\u2019s\nspirited defense apparently led to a decree by the Duke forbidding further trials for\nwitchcraft on such slender evidence.\n\nThe upheavals of the war deprived Kepler of much of his financial support, and the\nend of his life was spent fitfully, pleading for money and sponsors. He cast horoscopes for\nthe Duke of Wallenstein, as he had done for Rudolf II, and spent his final years in a\nSilesian town controlled by Wallenstein and called Sagan. His epitaph, which he himself\ncomposed, was: \u2018I measured the skies, now the shadows I measure. Sky-bound was the\nmind, Earth-bound the body rests.\u2019 But the Thirty Years\u2019 War obliterated his grave. Ifa\nmarker were to be erected today, it might read, in homage to his scientific courage: \u2018He\npreferred the hard truth to his dearest illusions.\u2019\n\nJohannes Kepler believed that there would one day be \u2018celestial ships with sails\nadapted to the winds of heaven\u2019 navigating the sky, filled with explorers \u2018who would not\nfear the vastness\u2019 of space. And today those explorers, human and robot, employ as\nunerring guides on their voyages through the vastness of space the three laws of planetary\nmotion that Kepler uncovered during a lifetime of personal travail and ecstatic discovery.\n\nThe lifelong quest of Johannes Kepler, to understand the motions of the planets, to seek a\nharmony in the heavens, culminated thirty-six years after his death, in the work of Isaac\nNewton. Newton was born on Christmas Day, 1642, so tiny that, as his mother told him\nyears later, he would have fit into a quart mug. Sickly, feeling abandoned by his parents,\nquarrelsome, unsociable, a virgin to the day he died, Isaac Newton was perhaps the greatest\nscientific genius who ever lived.\n\nEven as a young man, Newton was impatient with insubstantial questions, such as\nwhether light was \u2018a substance or an accident,\u2019 or how gravitation could act over an\nintervening vacuum. He early decided that the conventional Christian belief in the Trinity\nwas a misreading of Scripture. According to his biographer, John Maynard Keynes,\n\nHe was rather a Judaic Monotheist of the school of Maimonides. He arrived at this\nconclusion, not on so-to-speak rational or sceptical grounds, but entirely on the\ninterpretation of ancient authority. He was persuaded that the revealed documents\ngave no support to the Trinitarian doctrines which were due to late falsifications.\nThe revealed God was one God. But this was a dreadful secret which Newton was at\ndesperate pains to conceal all his life.\n\nLike Kepler, he was not immune to the superstitions of his day and had many encounters\nwith mysticism. Indeed, much of Newton\u2019s intellectual development can be attributed to\nthis tension between rationalism and mysticism. At the Stourbridge Fair in 1663, at age\ntwenty, he purchased a book on astrology, \u2018out of a curiosity to see what there was in it.\u2019\nHe read it until he came to an illustration which he could not understand, because he was\nignorant of trigonometry. So he purchased a book on trigonometry but soon found himself\nunable to follow the geometrical arguments. So he found a copy of Euclid\u2019s Elements of\nGeometry, and began to read. Two years later he invented the differential calculus.\n\nAs a student, Newton was fascinated by light and transfixed by the Sun. He took to\nthe dangerous practice of staring at the Sun\u2019s image in a looking glass:\n\nIn a few hours I had brought my eyes to such a pass that I could look upon no bright\nobject with neither eye but I saw the Sun before me, so that I durst neither write nor\nread but to recover the use of my eyes shut my self up in my chamber made dark\nthree days together & used all means to divert my imagination from the Sun. For if I\nthought upon him I presently saw his picture though I was in the dark.\n\nIn 1666, at the age of twenty-three, Newton was an undergraduate at Cambridge University\nwhen an outbreak of plague forced him to spend a year in idleness in the isolated village of\nWoolsthorpe, where he had been born. He occupied himself by inventing the differential\nand integral calculus, making fundamental discoveries on the nature of light and laying the\nfoundation for the theory of universal gravitation. The only other year like it in the history\n\nof physics was Einstein\u2019s \u2018Miracle Year\u2019 of 1905. When asked how he accomplished his\n\nastonishing discoveries, Newton replied unhelpfully, \u2018By thinking upon them.\u2019 His work\n\nwas so significant that his teacher at Cambridge, Isaac Barrow, resigned his chair of\n\nmathematics in favor of Newton five years after the young student returned to college.\nNewton, in his mid-forties, was described by his servant as follows:\n\nI never knew him to take any recreation or pastime either in riding out to take the\nair, walking, bowling, or any other exercise whatever, thinking all hours lost that\nwere not spent in his studies, to which he kept so close that he seldom left his\nchamber unless [to lecture] at term time . . . where so few went to hear him, and\nfewer understood him, that ofttimes he did in a manner, for want of hearers, read to\nthe walls.\n\nStudents both of Kepler and of Newton never knew what they were missing.\n\nNewton discovered the law of inertia, the tendency of a moving object to continue\nmoving in a straight line unless something influences it and moves it out of its path. The\nMoon, it seemed to Newton, would fly off in a straight line, tangential to its orbit, unless\nthere were some other force constantly diverting the path into a near circle, pulling it in the\ndirection of the Earth. This force Newton called gravity, and believed that it acted at a\ndistance. There is nothing physically connecting the Earth and the Moon. And yet the Earth\nis constantly pulling the Moon toward us. Using Kepler\u2019s third law, Newton\nmathematically deduced the nature of the gravitational force.* He showed that the same\nforce that pulls an apple down to Earth keeps the Moon in its orbit and accounts for the\nrevolutions of the then recently discovered moons of Jupiter in their orbits about that\ndistant planet.\n\n* Sadly, Newton does not acknowledge his debt to Kepler in his masterpiece the Principia. But in a\n1686 letter to Edmund Halley, he says of his law of gravitation: \u2018I can affirm that I gathered it from Kepler\u2019s\ntheorem about twenty years ago.\u201d\n\nThings had been falling down since the beginning of time. That the Moon went\naround the Earth had been believed for all of human history. Newton was the first person\never to figure out that these two phenomena were due to the same force. This is the\nmeaning of the word \u2018universal\u2019 as applied to Newtonian gravitation. The same law of\ngravity applies everywhere in the universe.\n\nIt is a law of the inverse square. The force declines inversely as the square of\ndistance. If two objects are moved twice as far away, the gravity now pulling them together\nis only one-quarter as strong. If they are moved ten times farther away, the gravity is ten\nsquared, 10\u201d = 100 times smaller. Clearly, the force must in some sense be inverse - that is,\ndeclining with distance. If the force were direct, increasing with distance, then the strongest\nforce would work on the most distant objects, and I suppose all the matter in the universe\nwould find itself careering together into a single cosmic lump. No, gravity must decrease\nwith distance, which is why a comet or a planet moves slowly when far from the Sun and\nfaster when close to the Sun - the gravity it feels is weaker the farther from the Sun it is.\n\nAll three of Kepler\u2019s laws of planetary motion can be derived from Newtonian\nprinciples. Kepler\u2019s laws were empirical, based upon the painstaking observations of Tycho\nBrahe. Newton\u2019s laws were theoretical, rather simple mathematical abstractions from which\n\nall of Tycho\u2019s measurements could ultimately be derived. From these laws, Newton wrote\nwith undisguised pride in the Principia, \u2018I now demonstrate the frame of the System of the\nWorld.\u2019\n\nLater in his life, Newton presided over the Royal Society, a fellowship of scientists,\nand was Master of the Mint, where he devoted his energies to the suppression of counterfeit\ncoinage. His natural moodiness and reclusivity grew; he resolved to abandon those\nscientific endeavors that brought him into quarrelsome disputes with other scientists,\nchiefly on issues of priority; and there were those who spread tales that he had experienced\nthe seventeenth-century equivalent of a \u2018nervous breakdown.\u2019 However, Newton continued\nhis lifelong experiments on the border between alchemy and chemistry, and some recent\nevidence suggests that what he was suffering from was not so much a psychogenic ailment\nas heavy metal poisoning, induced by systematic ingestion of small quantities of arsenic\nand mercury. It was a common practice for chemists of the time to use the sense of taste as\nan analytic tool.\n\nNevertheless his prodigious intellectual powers persisted unabated. In 1696, the\nSwiss mathematician Johann Bernoulli challenged his colleagues to solve an unresolved\nissue called the brachistochrone problem, specifying the curve connecting two points\ndisplaced from each other laterally, along which a body, acted upon by gravity, would fall\nin the shortest time. Bernoulli originally specified a deadline of six months, but extended it\nto a year and a half at the request of Leibniz, one of the leading scholars of the time, and the\nman who had, independently of Newton, invented the differential and integral calculus. The\nchallenge was delivered to Newton at four P.M. on January 29, 1697. Before leaving for\nwork the next morning, he had invented an entire new branch of mathematics called the\ncalculus of variations, used it to solve the brachistochrone problem and sent off the\nsolution, which was published, at Newton\u2019s request, anonymously. But the brilliance and\noriginality of the work betrayed the identity of its author. When Bernoulli saw the solution,\nhe commented. \u2018We recognize the lion by his claw.\u2019 Newton was then in his fifty-fifth year.\n\nThe major intellectual pursuit of his last years was a concordance and calibration of\nthe chronologies of ancient civilizations, very much in the tradition of the ancient historians\nManetho, Strabo and Eratosthenes. In his last, posthumous work, \u2018The Chronology of\nAncient Kingdoms Amended,\u2019 we find repeated astronomical calibrations of historical\nevents; an architectural reconstruction of the Temple of Solomon; a provocative claim that\nall the Northern Hemisphere constellations are named after the personages, artifacts and\nevents in the Greek story of Jason and the Argonauts, and the consistent assumption that\nthe gods of all civilizations, with the single exception of Newton\u2019s own, were merely\nancient kings and heroes deified by later generations.\n\nKepler and Newton represent a critical transition in human history, the discovery\nthat fairly simple mathematical laws pervade all of Nature; that the same rules apply on\nEarth as in the skies; and that there is a resonance between the way we think and the way\nthe world works. They unflinchingly respected the accuracy of observational data, and their\npredictions of the motion of the planets to high precision provided compelling evidence\nthat, at an unexpectedly deep level, humans can understand the Cosmos. Our moder global\ncivilization, our view of the world and our present exploration of the Universe are\nprofoundly indebted to their insights.\n\nNewton was guarded about his discoveries and fiercely competitive with his\nscientific colleagues. He thought nothing of waiting a decade or two after its discovery to\npublish the inverse square law. But before the grandeur and intricacy of Nature, he was,\n\nlike Ptolemy and Kepler, exhilarated as well as disarmingly modest. Just before his death\nhe wrote: \u2018I do not know what I may appear to the world; but to myself I seem to have been\nonly like a boy, playing on the seashore, and diverting myself, in now and then finding a\nsmoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, while the great ocean of truth lay all\nundiscovered before me.\u2019\n",

I had just raised my axe to hoop a cask, when\nsuddenly . . . the sky was split in two, and high above the forest the whole northern\npart of the sky appeared to be covered with fire. At that moment I felt a great heat as\nif my shirt had caught fire . . . I wanted to pull off my shirt and throw it away, but at\n\nthat moment there was a bang in the sky, and a mighty crash was heard. I was\nthrown on the ground about three sajenes away from the porch and for a moment I\nlost consciousness. My wife ran out and carried me into the hut. The crash was\nfollowed by a noise like stones falling from the sky, or guns firing. The Earth\ntrembled, and when I lay on the ground I covered my head because I was afraid that\nstones might hit it. At that moment when the sky opened, a hot wind, as from a\ncannon, blew past the huts from the north. It left its mark on the ground...\n\nWhen I sat down to have my breakfast beside my plough, I heard sudden bangs, as\nif from gun-fire. My horse fell to its knees. From the north side above the forest a\nflame shot up . . . Then I saw that the fir forest had been bent over by the wind and I\nthought of a hurricane. I seized hold of my plough with both hands, so that it would\nnot be carried away. The wind was so strong that it carried off some of the soil from\nthe surface of the ground, and then the hurricane drove a wall of water up the\nAngara. I saw it all quite clearly, because my land was on a hillside.\n\nThe roar frightened the horses to such an extent that some galloped off in panic,\ndragging the ploughs in different directions, and others collapsed.\n\nThe carpenters, after the first and second crashes, had crossed themselves in\nstupefaction, and when the third crash resounded they fell backwards from the\nbuilding onto the chips of wood. Some of them were so stunned and utterly terrified\nthat I had to calm them down and reassure them. We all abandoned work and went\ninto the village. There, whole crowds of local inhabitants were gathered in the\nstreets in terror, talking about this phenomenon.\n\nI was in the fields . . . and had only just got one horse harnessed to the harrow and\nbegun to attach another when suddenly I heard what sounded like a single loud shot\nto the right. I immediately turned round and saw an elongated flaming object flying\nthrough the sky. The front part was much broader than the tail end and its color was\nlike fire in the day-time. It was many times bigger than the sun but much dimmer,\nso that it was possible to look at it with the naked eye. Behind the flames trailed\nwhat looked like dust. It was wreathed in little puffs, and blue streamers were left\nbehind from the flames . . . As soon as the flame had disappeared, bangs louder than\nshots from a gun were heard, the ground could be felt to tremble, and the window\npanes in the cabin were shattered.\n\n... was washing wool on the bank of the River Kan. Suddenly a noise like the\nfluttering of the wings of a frightened bird was heard . . . and a kind of swell came\nup the river. After this came a single sharp bang so loud that one of the workmen. .\n. fell into the water.\n\nThis remarkable occurrence is called the Tunguska Event. Some scientists have suggested\nthat it was caused by a piece of hurtling antimatter, annihilated on contact with the ordinary\nmatter of the Earth, disappearing in a flash of gamma rays. But the absence of radioactivity\nat the impact site gives no support to this explanation. Others postulate that a mini black\nhole passed through the Earth in Siberia and out the other side. But the records of\n\natmospheric shock waves show no hint of an object booming out of the North Atlantic later\nthat day. Perhaps it was a spaceship of some unimaginably advanced extraterrestrial\ncivilization in desperate mechanical trouble, crashing in a remote region of an obscure\nplanet. But at the site of the impact there is no trace of such a ship. Each of these ideas has\nbeen proposed, some of them more or less seriously. Not one of them is strongly supported\nby the evidence. The key point of the Tunguska Event is that there was a tremendous\nexplosion, a great shock wave, an enormous forest fire, and yet there is no impact crater at\nthe site. There seems to be only one explanation consistent with all the facts: In 1908 a\npiece of comet hit the Earth.\n\nIn the vast spaces between the planets there are many objects, some rocky, some\nmetallic, some icy, some composed partly of organic molecules. They range from grains of\ndust to irregular blocks the size of Nicaragua or Bhutan. And sometimes, by accident, there\nis a planet in the way. The Tunguska Event was probably caused by an icy cometary\nfragment about a hundred meters across - the size of a football field - weighing a million\ntons, moving at about 30 kilometers per second, 70,000 miles per hour.\n\nIf such an impact occurred today it might be mistaken, especially in the panic of the\nmoment, for a nuclear explosion. The cometary impact and fireball would simulate all\neffects of a one-megaton nuclear burst, including the mushroom cloud, with two\nexceptions: there would be no gamma radiation or radioactive fallout. Could a rare but\nnatural event, the impact of a sizable cometary fragment, trigger a nuclear war? A strange\nscenario: a small comet hits the Earth, as millions of them have, and the response of our\ncivilization is promptly to self-destruct. It might be a good idea for us to understand comets\nand collisions and catastrophes a little better than we do. For example, an American Vela\nsatellite detected an intense double flash of light from the vicinity of the South Atlantic and\nWestern Indian Ocean on September 22, 1979. Early speculation held that it was a\nclandestine test of a low yield (two kilotons, about a sixth the energy of the Hiroshima\nbomb) nuclear weapon by South Africa or Israel. The political consequences were\nconsidered serious around the world. But what if the flashes were instead caused by the\nimpact of a small asteroid or a piece of a comet? Since airborne over-flights in the vicinity\nof the flashes showed not a trace of unusual radioactivity in the air, this is a real possibility\nand underscores the dangers in an age of nuclear weapons of not monitoring impacts from\nspace better than we do.\n\nA comet is made mostly of ice - water (H20) ice, with a little methane (CHy) ice,\nand some ammonia (NHs) ice. Striking the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, a modest cometary\nfragment would produce a great radiant fireball and a mighty blast wave, which would burn\ntrees, level forests and be heard around the world. But it might not make much of a crater in\nthe ground. The ices would all be melted during entry. There would be few recognizable\npieces of the comet left - perhaps only a smattering of small grains from the non-icy parts\nof the cometary nucleus. Recently, the Soviet scientist E. Sobotovich has identified a large\nnumber of tiny diamonds strewn over the Tunguska site. Such diamonds are already known\nto exist in meteorites that have survived impact, and that may originate ultimately from\ncomets.\n\nOn many a clear night, if you look patiently up at the sky, you will see a solitary\nmeteor blazing briefly overhead. On some nights you can see a shower of meteors, always\non the same few days of every year - a natural fireworks display, an entertainment in the\nheavens. These meteors are made by tiny grains, smaller than a mustard seed. They are less\nshooting stars than falling fluff. Momentarily brilliant as they enter the Earth\u2019s atmosphere,\n\nthey are heated and destroyed by friction at a height of about 100 kilometers. Meteors are\nthe remnants of comets.* Old comets, heated by repeated passages near the Sun, break up,\nevaporate and disintegrate. The debris spreads to fill the full cometary orbit. Where that\norbit intersects the orbit of the Earth, there is a swarm of meteors waiting for us. Some part\nof the swarm is always at the same position in the Earth\u2019s orbit, so the meteor shower is\nalways observed on the same day of every year. June 30, 1908 was the day of the Beta\nTaurid meteor shower, connected with the orbit of Comet Encke. The Tunguska Event\nseems to have been caused by a chunk of Comet Encke, a piece substantially larger than the\ntiny fragments that cause those glittering, harmless meteor showers.\n\n* That meteors and meteorites are connected with the comets was first proposed by Alexander von\nHumboldt in his broad-gauge popularization of all of science, published in the years 1845 to 1862, a work\ncalled Kosmos. It was reading Humboldt\u2019s earlier work that fired the young Charles Darwin to embark on a\ncareer combining geographical exploration and natural history. Shortly thereafter he accepted a position as\nnaturalist aboard the ship HMS Beagle, the event that led to The Origin of Species.\n\nComets have always evoked fear and awe and superstition. Their occasional\napparitions disturbingly challenged the notion of an unalterable and divinely ordered\nCosmos. It seemed inconceivable that a spectacular streak of milk-white flame, rising and\nsetting with the stars night after night, was not there for a reason, did not hold some portent\nfor human affairs. So the idea arose that comets were harbingers of disaster, auguries of\ndivine wrath - that they foretold the deaths of princes, the fall of kingdoms. The\nBabylonians thought that comets were celestial beards. The Greeks thought of flowing hair,\nthe Arabs of flaming swords. In Ptolemy\u2019s time comets were elaborately classified as\n\u201cbeams,\u201d \u2018trumpets,\u2019 \u2018jars\u2019 and so on, according to their shapes. Ptolemy thought that\ncomets bring wars, hot weather and \u2018disturbed conditions.\u2019 Some medieval depictions of\ncomets resemble unidentified flying crucifixes. A Lutheran \u2018Superintendent\u2019 or Bishop of\nMagdeburg named Andreas Celichius published in 1578 a \u2018Theological Reminder of the\nNew Comet,\u2019 which offered the inspired view that a comet is \u2018the thick smoke of human\nsins, rising every day, every hour, every moment, full of stench and horror before the face\nof God, and becoming gradually so thick as to form a comet, with curled and plaited\ntresses, which at last is kindled by the hot and fiery anger of the Supreme Heavenly Judge.\u2019\nBut others countered that if comets were the smoke of sin, the skies would be continually\nablaze with them.\n\nThe most ancient record of an apparition of Halley\u2019s (or any other) Comet appears\nin the Chinese Book of Prince Huai Nan, attendant to the march of King Wu against Zhou\nof Yin. The year was 1057 B.C. The approach to Earth of Halley\u2019s Comet in the year 66 is\nthe probable explanation of the account by Josephus of a sword that hung over Jerusalem\nfor a whole year. In 1066 the Normans witnessed another return of Halley\u2019s Comet. Since it\nmust, they thought, presage the fall of some kingdom, the comet encouraged, in some sense\nprecipitated, the invasion of England by William the Conqueror. The comet was duly noted\nin a newspaper of the time, the Bayeux Tapestry. In 1301, Giotto, one of the founders of\nmodern realistic painting, witnessed another apparition of Comet Halley and inserted it into\na nativity scene. The Great Comet of 1466 - yet another return of Halley\u2019s Comet -\npanicked Christian Europe; the Christians feared that God, who sends comets, might be on\nthe side of the Turks, who had just captured Constantinople.\n\nThe leading astronomers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were fascinated\n\nby comets, and even Newton became a little giddy over them. Kepler described comets as\ndarting through space \u2018as the fishes in the sea,\u2019 but being dissipated by sunlight, as the\ncometary tail always points away from the sun. David Hume, in many cases an\nuncompromising rationalist, at least toyed with the notion that comets were the\nreproductive cells - the eggs or sperm - of planetary systems, that planets are produced by a\nkind of interstellar sex. As an undergraduate, before his invention of the reflecting\ntelescope, Newton spent many consecutive sleepless nights searching the sky for comets\nwith his naked eye, pursuing them with such fervor that he felt ill from exhaustion.\nFollowing Tycho and Kepler, Newton concluded that the comets seen from Earth do not\nmove within our atmosphere, as Aristotle and others had thought, but rather are more\ndistant than the Moon, although closer than Saturn. Comets shine, as the planets do, by\nreflected sunlight, \u2018and they are much mistaken who remove them almost as far as the fixed\nstars; for if it were so, the comets could receive no more light from our Sun than our planets\ndo from the fixed stars.\u2019 He showed that comets, like planets, move in ellipses: \u2018Comets are\na sort of planets revolved in very eccentric orbits about the Sun.\u2019 This demystification, this\nprediction of regular cometary orbits, led his friend Edmund Halley in 1707 to calculate\nthat the comets of 1531, 1607 and 1682 were apparitions at 76-year intervals of the same\ncomet, and predicted its return in 1758. The comet duly arrived and was named for him\nposthumously. Comet Halley has played an interesting role in human history, and may be\nthe target of the first space vehicle probe of a comet, during its return in 1986.\n\nModern planetary scientists sometimes argue that the collision of a comet with a\nplanet might make a significant contribution to the planetary atmosphere. For example, all\nthe water in the atmosphere of Mars today could be accounted for by a recent impact of a\nsmall comet. Newton noted that the matter in the tails of comets is dissipated in\ninterplanetary space, lost to the comet and little by little attracted gravitationally to nearby\nplanets. He believed that the water on the Earth is gradually being lost, \u2018spent upon\nvegetation and putrefaction, and converted into dry earth . . . The fluids, if they are not\nsupplied from without, must be in a continual decrease, and quite fail at last.\u2019 Newton\nseems to have believed that the Earth\u2019s oceans are of cometary origin, and that life is\npossible only because cometary matter falls upon our planet. In a mystical reverie, he went\nstill further: \u2018I suspect, moreover, that it is chiefly from the comets that spirit comes, which\nis indeed the smallest but the most subtle and useful part of our air, and so much required to\nsustain the life of all things with us.\u2019\n\nAs early as 1868 the astronomer William Huggins found an identity between some\nfeatures in the spectrum of a comet and the spectrum of natural or \u2018olefiant\u2019 gas. Huggins\nhad found organic matter in the comets; in subsequent years cyanogen, CN, consisting of a\ncarbon and a nitrogen atom, the molecular fragment that makes cyanides, was identified in\nthe tails of comets. When the Earth was about to pass through the tail of Halley\u2019s Comet in\n1910, many people panicked. They overlooked the fact that the tail of a comet is\nextravagantly diffuse: the actual danger from the poison in a comet\u2019s tail is far less than the\ndanger, even in 1910, from industrial pollution in large cities.\n\nBut that reassured almost no one. For example, headlines in the San Francisco\nChronicle for May 15, 1910, include \u2018Comet Camera as Big as a House,\u2019 \u2018Comet Comes\nand Husband Reforms,\u2019 \u2018Comet Parties Now Fad in New York.\u2019 The Los Angeles\nExaminer adopted a light mood: \u2018Say! Has That Comet Cyanogened You Yet? . . . Entire\nHuman Race Due for Free Gaseous Bath,\u2019 \u2018Expect \u201cHigh Jinks,\u201d \u2018Many Feel Cyanogen\nTang,\u2019 \u2018Victim Climbs Trees, Tries to Phone Comet.\u2019 In 1910 there were parties, making\n\nmerry before the world ended of cyanogen pollution. Entrepreneurs hawked anti-comet\npills and gas masks, the latter an eerie premonition of the battlefields of World War 1.\n\nSome confusion about comets continues to our own time. In 1957, I was a graduate\nstudent at the University of Chicago\u2019s Yerkes Observatory. Alone in the observatory late\none night, I heard the telephone ring persistently. When I answered, a voice, betraying a\nwell-advanced state of inebriation, said, \u2018Lemme talk to a shtrominer.\u2019 \u2018Can I help you?\u2019\n\u201cWell, see, we\u2019re havin\u2019 this garden party out here in Wilmette, and there\u2019s somethin\u2019 in the\nsky. The funny part is, though, if you look straight at it, it goes away. But if you don\u2019t look\nat it, there it is.\u201d The most sensitive part of the retina is not at the center of the field of view.\nYou can see faint stars and other objects by averting your vision slightly. I knew that,\nbarely visible in the sky at this time, was a newly discovered comet called Arend-Roland.\nSo I told him that he was probably looking at a comet. There was a long pause, followed by\nthe query: \u2018Wash\u2019a comet?\u2019 \u2018A comet,\u2019 I replied, \u2018is a snowball one mile across.\u2019 There was\na longer pause, after which the caller requested, \u2018Lemme talk to a real shtrominer.\u2019 When\nHalley\u2019s Comet reappears in 1986, I wonder what political leaders will fear the apparition,\nwhat other silliness will then be upon us.\n\nWhile the planets move in elliptical orbits around the Sun, their orbits are not very\nelliptical. At first glance they are, by and large, indistinguishable from circles. It is the\ncomets - especially the long-period comets - that have dramatically elliptical orbits. The\nplanets are the old-timers in the inner solar system; the comets are the newcomers. Why are\nthe planetary orbits nearly circular and neatly separated one from the other? Because if\nplanets had very elliptical orbits, so that their paths intersected, sooner or later there would\nbe a collision. In the early history of the solar system, there were probably many planets in\nthe process of formation. Those with elliptical crossing orbits tended to collide and destroy\nthemselves. Those with circular orbits tended to grow and survive. The orbits of the present\nplanets are the orbits of the survivors of this collisional natural selection, the stable middle\nage of a solar system dominated by early catastrophic impacts.\n\nIn the outermost solar system, in the gloom far beyond the planets, there is a vast\nspherical cloud of a trillion cometary nuclei, orbiting the Sun no faster than a racing car at\nthe Indianapolis 500.* A fairly typical comet would look like a giant tumbling snowball\nabout 1 kilometer across. Most never penetrate the border marked by the orbit of Pluto. But\noccasionally a passing star makes a gravitational flurry and commotion in the cometary\ncloud, and a group of comets finds itself in highly elliptical orbits, plunging toward the\nSun. After its path is further changed by gravitational encounters with Jupiter or Saturn, it\ntends to find itself, once every century or so, careering toward the inner solar system.\nSomewhere between the orbits of Jupiter and Mars it would begin heating and evaporating.\nMatter blown outwards from the Sun\u2019s atmosphere, the solar wind, carries fragments of\ndust and ice back behind the comet, making an incipient tail. If Jupiter were a meter across,\nour comet would be smaller than a speck of dust, but when fully developed, its tail would\nbe as great as the distances between the worlds. When within sight of the Earth on each of\nits orbits, it would stimulate outpourings of superstitious fervor among the Earthlings. But\neventually they would understand that it lived not in their atmosphere, but out among the\nplanets. They would calculate its orbit. And perhaps one day soon they would launch a\nsmall space vehicle devoted to exploring this visitor from the realm of the stars.\n\n* The Earth is r= 1 astronomical unit = 150,000,000 kilometers from the Sun. Its roughly circular\norbit then has a circumference of 2ar ~10\u00b0 km. Our planet circulates once along this path every year. One year\n\n=3x 10\u2019 seconds. So the Earth\u2019s orbital speed is 10\u00b0 km/3 x 10\u201d sec ~30 km/sec. Now consider the spherical\nshell of orbiting comets that many astronomers believe surrounds the solar system at a distance ~100,000\nastronomical units, almost halfway to the nearest star. From Kepler\u2019s third law it immediately follows that the\norbital period about the Sun of any one of them is about (10\u00b0)\"? = 10\" =3 x 10\u201d or 30 million years. Once\naround the Sun is a long time if you live in the outer reaches of the solar system. The cometary orbit is 27a =\n2n x 10\u00b0 x 1.5 x 10\u00b0 km 10\" km around, and its speed is therefore only 10'*km/ 10'\u00b0 sec = 0.1 km/sec 220\nmiles per hour.\n\nSooner or later comets will collide with planets. The Earth and its companion the\nMoon must be bombarded by comets and small asteroids, debris left over from the\nformation of the solar system. Since there are more small objects than large ones, there\nshould be more impacts by small objects than by large ones. An impact of a small cometary\nfragment with the Earth, as at Tunguska, should occur about once every thousand years.\nBut an impact with a large comet, such as Halley\u2019s Comet, whose nucleus is perhaps\ntwenty kilometers across, should occur only about once every billion years.\n\nWhen a small, icy object collides with a planet or a moon, it may not produce a very\nmajor scar. But if the impacting object is larger or made primarily of rock, there is an\nexplosion on impact that carves out a hemispherical bowl called an impact crater. And if no\nprocess rubs out or fills in the crater, it may last for billions of years. Almost no erosion\noccurs on the Moon and when we examine its surface, we find it covered with impact\ncraters, many more than can be accounted for by the rather sparse population of cometary\nand asteroidal debris that now fills the inner solar system. The lunar surface offers eloquent\ntestimony of a previous age of the destruction of worlds, now billions of years gone.\n\nImpact craters are not restricted to the Moon. We find them throughout the inner\nsolar system - from Mercury, closest to the Sun, to cloud-covered Venus to Mars and its\ntiny moons, Phobos and Deimos. These are the terrestrial planets, our family of worlds, the\nplanets more or less like the Earth. They have solid surfaces, interiors made of rock and\niron, and atmospheres ranging from near-vacuum to pressures ninety times higher than the\nEarth\u2019s. They huddle around the Sun, the source of light and heat, like campers around a\nfire. The planets are all about 4.6 billion years old. Like the Moon, they all bear witness to\nan age of impact catastrophism in the early history of the solar system.\n\nAs we move out past Mars we enter a very different regime - the realm of Jupiter\nand the other giant or Jovian planets. These are great worlds, composed largely of hydrogen\nand helium, with smaller amounts of hydrogen-rich gases such as methane, ammonia and\nwater. We do not see solid surfaces here, only the atmosphere and the multicolored clouds.\nThese are serious planets, not fragmentary worldlets like the Earth. A thousand Earths\ncould fit inside Jupiter. If a comet or an asteroid dropped into the atmosphere of Jupiter, we\nwould not expect a visible crater, only a momentary break in the clouds. Nevertheless, we\nknow there has been a many-billion-year history of collisions in the outer solar system as\nwell - because Jupiter has a great system of more than a dozen moons, five of which were\nexamined close up by the Voyager spacecraft. Here again we find evidence of past\ncatastrophes. When the solar system is all explored, we will probably have evidence for\nimpact catastrophism on all nine worlds, from Mercury to Pluto, and on all the smaller\nmoons, comets and asteroids.\n\nThere are about 10,000 craters on the near side of the Moon, visible to telescopes on\nEarth. Most of them are in the ancient lunar highlands and date from the time of the final\naccretion of the Moon from interplanetary debris. There are about a thousand craters larger\n\nthan a kilometer across in the maria (Latin for \u2018seas\u2019), the lowland regions that were\nflooded, perhaps by lava, shortly after the formation of the Moon, covering over the pre-\nexisting craters. Thus, very roughly, craters on the Moon should be formed today at the rate\nof about 10\u00b0 years/10\u2018 craters, = 10\u00b0 years/crater, a hundred thousand years between\ncratering events. Since there may have been more interplanetary debris a few billion years\nago than there is today, we might have to wait even longer than a hundred thousand years\nto see a crater form on the Moon. Because the Earth has a larger area than the Moon, we\nmight have to wait something like ten thousand years between collisions that would make\ncraters as big as a kilometer across on our planet. And since Meteor Crater, Arizona, an\nimpact crater about a kilometer across, has been found to be twenty or thirty thousand years\nold, the observations on the Earth are in agreement with such crude calculations.\n\nThe actual impact of a small comet or asteroid with the Moon might make a\nmomentary explosion sufficiently bright to be visible from the Earth. We can imagine our\nancestors gazing idly up on some night a hundred thousand years ago and noting a strange\ncloud arising from the unilluminated part of the Moon, suddenly struck by the Sun\u2019s rays.\nBut we would not expect such an event to have happened in historical times. The odds\nagainst it must be something like a hundred to one. Nevertheless, there is an historical\naccount which may in fact describe an impact on the Moon seen from Earth with the naked\neye: On the evening of June 25, 1178, five British monks reported something extraordinary,\nwhich was later recorded in the chronicle of Gervase of Canterbury, generally considered a\nreliable reporter on the political and cultural events of his time, after he had interviewed the\neyewitnesses who asserted, under oath, the truth of their story. The chronicle reads:\n\nThere was a bright New Moon, and as usual in that phase its horns were tilted\ntowards the east. Suddenly, the upper horn split in two. From the midpoint of the\ndivision, a flaming torch sprang up, spewing out fire, hot coals, and sparks.\n\nThe astronomers Derral Mulholland and Odile Calame have calculated that a lunar\nimpact would produce a dust cloud rising off the surface of the Moon with an appearance\ncorresponding rather closely to the report of the Canterbury monks.\n\nIf such an impact were made only 800 years ago, the crater should still be visible.\nErosion on the Moon is so inefficient, because of the absence of air and water, that even\nsmall craters a few billion years old are still comparatively well preserved. From the\ndescription recorded by Gervase, it is possible to pinpoint the sector of the Moon to which\nthe observations refer. Impacts produce rays, linear trails of fine powder spewed out during\nthe explosion. Such rays are associated with the very youngest craters on the Moon - for\nexample, those named after Aristarchus and Copernicus and Kepler. But while the craters\nmay withstand erosion on the Moon, the rays, being exceptionally thin, do not. As time\ngoes on, even the arrival of micrometeorites - fine dust from space stirs up and covers over\nthe rays, and they gradually disappear. Thus rays are a signature of a recent impact.\n\nThe meteoriticist Jack Hartung has pointed out that a very recent, very fresh-looking\nsmall crater with a prominent ray system lies exactly in the region of the Moon referred to\nby the Canterbury monks. It is called Giordano Bruno after the sixteenth-century Roman\nCatholic scholar who held that there are an infinity of worlds and that many are inhabited.\nFor this and other crimes he was bummed at the stake in the year 1600.\n\nAnother line of evidence consistent with this interpretation has been provided by\nCalame and Mulholland. When an object impacts the Moon at high speed, it sets the Moon\n\nslightly wobbling. Eventually the vibrations die down but not in so short a period as eight\nhundred years. Such a quivering can be studied by laser reflection techniques. The Apollo\nastronauts emplaced in several locales on the Moon special mirrors called laser retro-\nreflectors. When a laser beam from Earth strikes the mirror and bounces back, the round-\ntrip travel time can be measured with remarkable precision. This time multiplied by the\nspeed of light gives us the distance to the Moon at that moment to equally remarkable\nprecision. Such measurements, performed over a period of years, reveal the Moon to be\nlibrating, or quivering with a period (about three years) and amplitude (about three meters),\nconsistent with the idea that the crater Giordano Bruno was gouged out less than a thousand\nyears ago.\n\nAll this evidence is inferential and indirect. The odds, as I have said, are against\nsuch an event happening in historical times. But the evidence is at least suggestive. As the\nTunguska Event and Meteor Crater, Arizona, also remind us, not all impact catastrophes\noccurred in the early history of the solar system. But the fact that only a few of the lunar\ncraters have extensive ray systems also reminds us that, even on the Moon, some erosion\noccurs.* By noting which craters overlap which and other signs of lunar stratigraphy, we\ncan reconstruct the sequence of impact and flooding events of which the production of\ncrater Bruno is perhaps the most recent example.\n\n* On Mars, where erosion is much more efficient, although there are many craters there are virtually\nno ray craters, as we would expect.\n\nThe Earth is very near the Moon. If the Moon is so severely cratered by impacts,\nhow has the Earth avoided them? Why is Meteor Crater so rare? Do the comets and\nasteroids think it inadvisable to impact an inhabited planet? This is an unlikely forbearance.\nThe only possible explanation is that impact craters are formed at very similar rates on both\nthe Earth and the Moon, but that on the airless, waterless Moon they are preserved for\nimmense periods of time, while on the Earth slow erosion wipes them out or fills them in.\nRunning water, windblown sand and mountain-building are very slow processes. But over\nmillions or billions of years, they are capable of utterly erasing even very large impact\nscars.\n\nOn the surface of any moon or planet, there will be external processes, such as\nimpacts from space, and internal processes, such as earthquakes; there will be fast,\ncatastrophic events, such as volcanic explosions, and processes of excruciating slowness,\nsuch as the pitting of a surface by tiny airbome sand grains. There is no general answer to\nthe question of which processes dominate, the outside ones or the inside ones; the rare but\nviolent events, or the common and inconspicuous occurrences. On the Moon, the outside,\ncatastrophic events hold sway; on Earth, the inside, slow processes dominate. Mars is an\nintermediate case.\n\nBetween the orbits of Mars and Jupiter are countless asteroids, tiny terrestrial\nplanets. The largest are a few hundred kilometers across. Many have oblong shapes and are\ntumbling through space. In some cases there seem to be two or more asteroids in tight\nmutual orbits. Collisions among the asteroids happen frequently, and occasionally a piece is\nchipped off and accidentally intercepts the Earth, falling to the ground as a meteorite. In the\nexhibits, on the shelves of our museums are the fragments of distant worlds. The asteroid\nbelt is a great grinding mill, producing smaller and smaller pieces down to motes of dust.\nThe bigger asteroidal pieces, along with the comets, are mainly responsible for the recent\n\ncraters on planetary surfaces. The asteroid belt may be a place where a planet was once\nprevented from forming because of the gravitational tides of the giant nearby planet Jupiter;\nor it may be the shattered remains of a planet that blew itself up. This seems improbable\nbecause no scientist on Earth knows how a planet might blow itself up, which is probably\njust as well.\n\nThe rings of Saturn bear some resemblance to the asteroid belt: trillions of tiny icy\nmoonlets orbiting the planet. They may represent debris prevented by the gravity of Saturn\nfrom accreting into a nearby moon, or they may be the remains of a moon that wandered\ntoo close and was torn apart by the gravitational tides. Alternatively, they may be the steady\nstate equilibrium between material ejected from a moon of Saturn, such as Titan, and\nmaterial falling into the atmosphere of the planet. Jupiter and Uranus also have ring\nsystems, discovered only recently, and almost invisible from the Earth. Whether Neptune\nhas a ring is a problem high on the agenda of planetary scientists. Rings may be a typical\nadornment of Jovian-type planets throughout the cosmos.\n\nMajor recent collisions from Saturn to Venus were alleged in a popular book,\nWorlds in Collision, published in 1950 by a psychiatrist named Immanuel Velikovsky. He\nproposed that an object of planetary mass, which he called a comet, was somehow\ngenerated in the Jupiter system. Some 3,500 years ago, it careered in toward the inner solar\nsystem and made repeated encounters with the Earth and Mars, having as incidental\nconsequences the parting of the Red Sea, allowing Moses and the Israelites to escape from\nPharaoh, and the stopping of the Earth from rotating on Joshua\u2019s command. It also caused,\nhe said, extensive vulcanism and floods.* Velikovsky imagined the comet, after a\ncomplicated game of interplanetary billiards, to settle down into a stable, nearly circular\norbit, becoming the planet Venus - which he claimed never existed before then.\n\n* As far as I know, the first essentially nonmystical attempt to explain a historical event by cometary\nintervention was Edmund Halley\u2019s proposal that the Noachic flood was \u2018the casual Choc [shock] of a Comet.\u2019\n\nAs I have discussed at some length elsewhere, these ideas are almost certainly\nwrong. Astronomers do not object to the idea of major collisions, only to major recent\ncollisions. In any model of the solar system it is impossible to show the sizes of the planets\non the same scale as their orbits, because the planets would then be almost too small to see.\nIf the planets were really shown to scale, as grains of dust, we would easily note that the\nchance of collision of a particular comet with the Earth in a few thousand years is\nextraordinarily low. Moreover, Venus is a rocky and metallic, hydrogen-poor planet,\nwhereas Jupiter - where Velikovsky supposed it comes from - is made almost entirely of\nhydrogen. There are no energy sources for comets or planets to be ejected by Jupiter. If one\npassed by the Earth, it could not \u2018stop\u2019 the Earth\u2019s rotation, much less start it up again at\ntwenty-four hours a day. No geological evidence supports the idea of an unusual frequency\nof vulcanism or floods 3,500 years ago. There are Mesopotamian inscriptions referring to\nVenus that predate the time when Velikovsky says Venus changed from a comet into a\nplanet.* It is very unlikely that an object in such a highly elliptical orbit could be rapidly\nmoved into the nearly perfectly circular orbit of present-day Venus. And so on.\n\n* The Adda cylinder seal, dating from the middle of the third millennium B.C., prominently displays\nInanna, the goddess of Venus, the morning star, and precursor of the Babylonian Ishtar.\n\nMany hypotheses proposed by scientists as well as by non-scientists turn out to be\nwrong. But science is a self-correcting enterprise. To be accepted, all new ideas must\nsurvive rigorous standards of evidence. The worst aspect of the Velikovsky affair is not that\nhis hypotheses were wrong or in contradiction to firmly established facts, but that some\nwho called themselves scientists attempted to suppress Velikovsky\u2019s work. Science is\ngenerated by and devoted to free inquiry: the idea that any hypothesis, no matter how\nstrange, deserves to be considered on its merits. The suppression of uncomfortable ideas\nmay be common in religion and politics, but it is not the path to knowledge; it has no place\nin the endeavor of science. We do not know in advance who will discover fundamental new\ninsights.\n\nVenus has almost the same mass,* size, and density as the Earth. As the nearest\nplanet, it has for centuries been thought of as the Earth\u2019s sister. What is our sister planet\nreally like? Might it be a balmy, summer planet, a little warmer than the Earth because it is\na little closer to the Sun? Does it have impact craters, or have they all eroded away? Are\nthere volcanoes? Mountains? Oceans? Life?\n\n* Itis, incidentally, some 30 million times more massive than the most massive comet known.\n\nThe first person to look at Venus through the telescope was Galileo in 1609. He saw\nan absolutely featureless disc. Galileo noted that it went through phases, like the Moon,\nfrom a thin crescent to a full disc, and for the same reason: we are sometimes looking\nmostly at the night side of Venus and sometimes mostly at the day side, a finding that\nincidentally reinforced the view that the Earth went around the Sun and not vice versa. As\noptical telescopes became larger and their resolution (or ability to discriminate fine detail)\nimproved, they were systematically turned toward Venus. But they did no better than\nGalileo\u2019s. Venus was evidently covered by a dense layer of obscuring cloud. When we look\nat the planet in the morning or evening skies, we are seeing sunlight reflected off the clouds\nof Venus. But for centuries after their discovery, the composition of those clouds remained\nentirely unknown.\n\nThe absence of anything to see on Venus led some scientists to the curious\nconclusion that the surface was a swamp, like the Earth in the Carboniferous Period. The\nargument - if we can dignify it by such a word - went something like this:\n\n\u2018I can\u2019t see a thing on Venus.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u2019\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s totally covered with clouds.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhat are clouds made of?\u2019\n\n\u201cWater, of course.\u2019\n\n\u2018Then why are the clouds of Venus thicker than the clouds on Earth?\u2019\n\n\u201cBecause there\u2019s more water there.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if there is more water in the clouds, there must be more water on the surface.\nWhat kind of surfaces are very wet?\u2019\n\n\u201cSwamps.\u201d\n\nAnd if there are swamps, why not cyacads and dragonflies and perhaps even dinosaurs on\nVenus? Observation: There was absolutely nothing to see on Venus. Conclusion: It must be\ncovered with life. The featureless clouds of Venus reflected our own predispositions. We\n\nare alive, and we resonate with the idea of life elsewhere. But only careful accumulation\nand assessment of the evidence can tell us whether a given world is inhabited. Venus turns\nout not to oblige our predispositions.\n\nThe first real clue to the nature of Venus came from work with a prism made of\nglass or a flat surface, called a diffraction grating, covered with fine, regularly spaced, ruled\nlines. When an intense beam of ordinary white light passes through a narrow slit and then\nthrough a prism or grating, it is spread into a rainbow of colors called a spectrum. The\nspectrum runs from high frequencies* of visible light to low ones - violet, blue, green,\nyellow, orange and red. Since we see these colors, it is called the spectrum of visible light.\nBut there is far more light than the small segment of the spectrum we can see. At higher\nfrequencies, beyond the violet, is a part of the spectrum called the ultraviolet: a perfectly\nreal kind of light, carrying death to the microbes. It is invisible to us, but readily detectable\nby bumblebees and photoelectric cells. There is much more to the world than we can see.\nBeyond the ultraviolet is the X-ray part of the spectrum, and beyond the X-rays are the\ngamma rays. At lower frequencies, on the other side of red, is the infrared part of the\nspectrum. It was first discovered by placing a sensitive thermometer in what to our eyes is\nthe dark beyond the red. The temperature rose. There was light falling on the thermometer\neven though it was invisible to our eyes. Rattlesnakes and doped semiconductors detect\ninfrared radiation perfectly well. Beyond the infrared is the vast spectral region of the radio\nwaves. From gamma rays to radio waves, all are equally respectable brands of light. All are\nuseful in astronomy. But because of the limitations of our eyes, we have a prejudice, a bias,\ntoward that tiny rainbow band we call the spectrum of visible light.\n\n* Light is a wave motion; its frequency is the number of wave crests, say, entering a detection\ninstrument, such as a retina, in a given unit of time, such as a second. The higher the frequency, the more\nenergetic the radiation.\n\nradio\n\n3\n3\ni3\n\ninfrared\n\u2014\u2014 Sere co + ~\n\n+ + + +\norm OA Wk \u2014 100K 000K am TQ44m 10Q4aM TOOQUM Tem 10cm\n10,000K=Jum \u201410,000,um =1em\nSchematic diagram of the electromagnetic spectrum, ranging from the shortest wavelengths\n\n(gamma rays) to the longest (radio waves). The wavelength of light is measured in\nAngstroms (A), micrometers (om), centimeters (cm) and meters (m).\n\nIn 1844, the philosopher Auguste Comte was searching for an example of a sort of\nknowledge that would be always hidden. He chose the composition of distant stars and\n\n+\nIm\n\nplanets. We would never physically visit them, he thought, and with no sample in hand it\nseemed we would forever be denied knowledge of their composition. But only three years\nafter Comte\u2019s death, it was discovered that a spectrum can be used to determine the\nchemistry of distant objects. Different molecules and chemical elements absorb different\nfrequencies or colors of light, sometimes in the visible and sometimes elsewhere in the\nspectrum. In the spectrum of a planetary atmosphere, a single dark line represents an image\nof the slit in which light is missing, the absorption of sunlight during its brief passage\nthrough the air of another world. Each such line is made by a particular kind of molecule or\natom. Every substance has its characteristic spectral signature. The gases on Venus can be\nidentified from the Earth, 60 million kilometers away. We can divine the composition of\nthe Sun (in which helium, named after the Greek sun god Helios, was first found); of\nmagnetic A stars rich in europium; of distant galaxies analyzed through the collective light\nof a hundred billion constituent stars. Astronomical spectroscopy is an almost magical\ntechnique. It amazes me still. Auguste Comte picked a particularly unfortunate example.\n\nIf Venus were soaking wet, it should be easy to see the water vapor lines in its\nspectrum. But the first spectroscopic searches, attempted at Mount Wilson Observatory\naround 1920, found not a hint, not a trace, of water vapor above the clouds of Venus,\nsuggesting an arid, desert-like surface, surmounted by clouds of fine drifting silicate dust.\nFurther study revealed enormous quantities of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, implying\nto some scientists that all the water on the planet had combined with hydrocarbons to form\ncarbon dioxide, and that therefore the surface of Venus was a global oil field, a planet-wide\nsea of petroleum. Others concluded that there was no water vapor above the clouds because\nthe clouds were very cold, that all the water had condensed out into water droplets, which\ndo not have the same pattern of spectral lines as water vapor. They suggested that the planet\nwas totally covered with water - except perhaps for an occasional limestone-encrusted\nisland, like the cliffs of Dover. But because of the vast quantities of carbon dioxide in the\natmosphere, the sea could not be ordinary water; physical chemistry required carbonated\nwater. Venus, they proposed, had a vast ocean of seltzer.\n\nThe first hint of the true situation came not from spectroscopic studies in the visible\nor near-infrared parts of the spectrum, but rather from the radio region. A radio telescope\nworks more like a light meter than a camera. You point it toward some fairly broad region\nof the sky, and it records how much energy, in a particular radio frequency, is coming down\nto Earth. We are used to radio signals transmitted by some varieties of intelligent life -\nnamely, those who run radio and television stations. But there are many other reasons for\nnatural objects to give off radio waves. One is that they are hot. And when, in 1956, an\nearly radio telescope was turned toward Venus, it was discovered to be emitting radio\nwaves as if it were at an extremely high temperature. But the real demonstration that the\nsurface of Venus is astonishingly hot came when the Soviet spacecraft of the Venera series\nfirst penetrated the obscuring clouds and landed on the mysterious and inaccessible surface\nof the nearest planet. Venus, it turns out, is broiling hot. There are no swamps, no oil fields,\nno seltzer oceans. With insufficient data, it is easy to go wrong.\n\nWhen I greet a friend, I am seeing her in reflected visible light, generated by the\nSun, say, or by an incandescent lamp. The light rays bounce off my friend and into my eye.\nBut the ancients, including no less a figure than Euclid, believed that we see by virtue of\nrays somehow emitted by the eye and tangibly, actively contacting the object observed.\nThis is a natural notion and can still be encountered, although it does not account for the\ninvisibility of objects in a darkened room. Today we combine a laser and a photocell, or a\n\nradar transmitter and a radio telescope, and in this way make active contact by light with\ndistant objects. In radar astronomy, radio waves are transmitted by a telescope on Earth,\nstrike, say, that hemisphere of Venus that happens to be facing the Earth, and bounce back.\nAt many wavelengths the clouds and atmosphere of Venus are entirely transparent to radio\nwaves. Some places on the surface will absorb them or, if they are very rough, will scatter\nthem sideways and so will appear dark to radio waves. By following the surface features\nmoving with Venus as it rotates, it was possible for the first time to determine reliably the\nlength of its day - how long it takes Venus to spin once on its axis. It turns out that, with\nrespect to the stars, Venus turns once every 243 Earth days, but backwards, in the opposite\ndirection from all other planets in the inner solar system. As a result, the Sun rises in the\nwest and sets in the east, taking 118 Earth days from sunrise to sunrise. What is more, it\npresents almost exactly the same face to the Earth each time it is closest to our planet.\nHowever the Earth\u2019s gravity has managed to nudge Venus into this Earth-locked rotation\nrate, it cannot have happened rapidly. Venus could not be a mere few thousand years old\nbut, rather, it must be as old as all the other objects in the inner solar system.\n\nRadar pictures of Venus have been obtained, some from ground-based radar\ntelescopes, some from the Pioneer Venus vehicle in orbit around the planet. They show\nprovocative evidence of impact craters. There are just as many craters that are not too big\nor too small on Venus as there are in the lunar highlands, so many that Venus is again\ntelling us that it is very old. But the craters of Venus are remarkably shallow, almost as if\nthe high surface temperatures have produced a kind of rock that flows over long periods of\ntime, like taffy or putty, gradually softening the relief. There are great mesas here, twice as\nhigh as the Tibetan plateau, an immense rift valley, possibly giant volcanoes and a\nmountain as high as Everest. We now see before us a world previously hidden entirely by\nclouds - its features first explored by radar and by space vehicles.\n\nThe surface temperatures on Venus, as deduced from radio astronomy and\nconfirmed by direct spacecraft measurements are around 480\u00b0C or 900\u00b0F, hotter than the\nhottest household oven. The corresponding surface pressure is 90 atmospheres, 90 times the\npressure we feel from the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, the equivalent of the weight of water 1\nkilometer below the surface of the oceans. To survive for long on Venus, a space vehicle\nwould have to be refrigerated as well as built like a deep submersible.\n\nSomething like a dozen space vehicles from the Soviet Union and United States\nhave entered the dense Venus atmosphere, and penetrated the clouds; a few of them have\nactually survived for an hour or so on the surface.* Two spacecraft in the Soviet Venera\nseries have taken pictures down there. Let us follow in the footsteps of these pioneering\nmissions, and visit another world.\n\n* Pioneer Venus was a successful US mission in 1978-79, combining an orbiter and four\natmospheric entry probes, two of which briefly survived the inclemencies of the Venus surface. There are\nmany unexpected developments in mustering spacecraft to explore the planets. This is one of them: Among\nthe instruments aboard one of the Pioneer Venus entry probes was a net flux radiometer, designed to measure\nsimultaneously the amount of infrared energy flowing upwards and downwards at each position in the Venus\natmosphere. The instrument required a sturdy window that was also transparent to infrared radiation. A 13.5-\nkarat diamond was imported and milled into the desired window. However, the contractor was required to pay\na $12,000 import duty. Eventually, the US Customs service decided that after the diamond was launched to\nVenus it was unavailable for trade on Earth and refunded the money to the manufacturer.\n\nIn ordinary visible light, the faintly yellowish clouds of Venus can be made out, but\n\nthey show, as Galileo first noted, virtually no features at all. If the cameras look in the\nultraviolet, however, we see a graceful, complex swirling weather system in the high\natmosphere, where the winds are around 100 meters per second, some 220 miles per hour.\nThe atmosphere of Venus is composed of 96 percent carbon dioxide. There are small traces\nof nitrogen, water vapor, argon, carbon monoxide and other gases, but the only\nhydrocarbons or carbohydrates present are there in less than 0.1 parts per million. The\nclouds of Venus turn out to be chiefly a concentrated solution of sulfuric acid. Small\nquantities of hydrochloric acid and hydrofluoric acid are also present. Even at its high, cool\nclouds, Venus turns out to be a thoroughly nasty place.\n\nHigh above the visible cloud deck, at about 70 kilometers altitude, there is a\ncontinuous haze of small particles. At 60 kilometers, we plunge into the clouds, and find\nourselves surrounded by droplets of concentrated sulfuric acid. As we go deeper, the cloud\nparticles tend to get bigger. The pungent gas, sulfur dioxide, SO2, is present in trace\namounts in the lower atmosphere. It is circulated up above the clouds, broken down by\nultraviolet light from the Sun and recombined with water there to form sulfuric acid - which\ncondenses into droplets, settles, and at lower altitudes is broken down by heat into SO2 and\nwater again, completing the cycle. It is always raining sulfuric acid on Venus, all over the\nplanet, and not a drop ever reaches the surface.\n\nThe sulfur-colored mist extends downwards to some 45 kilometers above the\nsurface of Venus, where we emerge into a dense but crystal-clear atmosphere. The\natmospheric pressure is so high, however, that we cannot see the surface. Sunlight is\nbounced about by atmospheric molecules until we lose all images from the surface. There is\nno dust here, no clouds, just an atmosphere getting palpably denser. Plenty of sunlight is\ntransmitted by the overlying clouds, about as much as on an overcast day on the Earth.\n\nWith searing heat, crushing pressures, noxious gases and everything suffused in an\neerie, reddish glow, Venus seems less the goddess of love than the incarnation of hell. As\nnearly as we can make out, at least some places on the surface are strewn fields of jumbled,\nsoftened irregular rocks, a hostile, barren landscape relieved only here and there by the\neroded remnants of a derelict spacecraft from a distant planet, utterly invisible through the\nthick, cloudy, poisonous atmosphere.*\n\n* In this stifling landscape, there is not likely to be anything alive, even creatures very different from\nus. Organic and other conceivable biological molecules would simply fall to pieces. But, as an indulgence, let\nus imagine that intelligent life once evolved on such a planet. Would it then invent science? The development\nof science on Earth was spurred fundamentally by observations of the regularities of the stars and planets. But\nVenus is completely cloud-covered. The night is pleasingly long - about 59 Earth days long - but nothing of\nthe astronomical universe would be visible if you looked up into the night sky of Venus. Even the Sun would\nbe invisible in the daytime; its light would be scattered and diffused over the whole sky - just as scuba divers\nsee only a uniform enveloping radiance beneath the sea. Ifa radio telescope were built on Venus, it could\ndetect the Sun, the Earth and other distant objects. If astrophysics developed, the existence of stars could\neventually be deduced from the principles of physics, but they would be theoretical constructs only. I\nsometimes wonder what their reaction would be if intelligent beings on Venus one day learned to fly, to sail\nin the dense air, to penetrate the mysterious cloud veil 45 kilometers above them and eventually to emerge out\nthe top of the clouds, to look up and for the first time witness that glorious universe of Sun and planets and\nstars.\n\nVenus is a kind of planet-wide catastrophe. It now seems reasonably clear that the\nhigh surface temperature comes about through a massive greenhouse effect. Sunlight passes\nthrough the atmosphere and clouds of Venus, which are semi-transparent to visible light,\n\nand reaches the surface. The surface being heated endeavors to radiate back into space. But\nbecause Venus is much cooler than the Sun, it emits radiation chiefly in the infrared rather\nthan the visible region of the spectrum. However, the carbon dioxide and water vapor* in\nthe Venus atmosphere are almost perfectly opaque to infrared radiation, the heat of the Sun\nis efficiently trapped, and the surface temperature rises - until the little amount of infrared\nradiation that trickles out of this massive atmosphere just balances the sunlight absorbed in\nthe lower atmosphere and surface.\n\n* At the present time there is still a little uncertainty about the abundance of water vapor on Venus.\nThe gas chromatograph on the Pioneer Venus entry probes gave an abundance of water in the lower\natmosphere of a few tenths of a percent. On the other hand, infrared measurements by the Soviet entry\nvehicles, Veneras 11 and 12, gave an abundance of about a hundredth of a percent. If the former value\napplies, then carbon dioxide and water vapor alone are adequate to seal in almost all the heat radiation from\nthe surface and keep the Venus ground temperature at about 480\u00b0C. If the latter number applies - and my\nguess is that it is the more reliable estimate - then carbon dioxide and water vapor alone are adequate to keep\nthe surface temperature only at about 380\u00b0C, and some other atmospheric constituent is necessary to close the\nremaining infrared frequency windows in the atmospheric greenhouse. However, the small quantities of SO,\nCO and HCI, all of which have been detected in the Venus atmosphere, seem adequate for this purpose. Thus\nrecent American and Soviet missions to Venus seem to have provided verification that the greenhouse effect\nis indeed the reason for the high surface temperature.\n\nOur neighboring world turns out to be a dismally unpleasant place. But we will go back to\nVenus. It is fascinating in its own right. Many mythic heroes in Greek and Norse\nmythology, after all, made celebrated efforts to visit Hell. There is also much to be learned\nabout our planet, a comparative Heaven, by comparing it with Hell.\n\nThe Sphinx, half human, half lion, was constructed more than 5,500 years ago. Its\nface was once crisp and cleanly rendered. It is now softened and blurred by thousands of\nyears of Egyptian desert sandblasting and by occasional rains. In New York City there is an\nobelisk called Cleopatra\u2019s Needle, which came from Egypt. In only about a hundred years\nin that city\u2019s Central Park, its inscriptions have been almost totally obliterated, because of\nsmog and industrial pollution - chemical erosion like that in the atmosphere of Venus.\nErosion on Earth slowly wipes out information, but because they are gradual - the patter of\na raindrop, the sting of a sand grain - those processes can be missed. Big structures, such as\nmountain ranges, survive tens of millions of years; smaller impact craters, perhaps a\nhundred thousand*; and large-scale human artifacts only some thousands. In addition to\nsuch slow and uniform erosion, destruction also occurs through catastrophes large and\nsmall. The Sphinx is missing a nose. Someone shot it off in a moment of idle desecration -\nsome say it was Mameluke Turks, others, Napoleonic soldiers.\n\n* More precisely, an impact crater 10 kilometers in diameter is produced on the Earth about once\nevery 500,000 years; it would survive erosion for about 300 million years in areas that are geologically stable,\nsuch as Europe and North America. Smaller craters are produced more frequently and destroyed more rapidly,\nespecially in geologically active regions.\n\nOn Venus, on Earth and elsewhere in the solar system, there is evidence for\ncatastrophic destruction, tempered or overwhelmed by slower, more uniform processes: on\nthe Earth, for example, rainfall, coursing into rivulets, streams and rivers of running water,\ncreating huge alluvial basins; on Mars, the remnants of ancient rivers, perhaps arising from\nbeneath the ground; on Io, a moon of Jupiter, what seem to be broad channels made by\n\nflowing liquid sulfur. There are mighty weather systems on the Earth - and in the high\natmosphere of Venus and on Jupiter. There are sandstorms on the Earth and on Mars;\nlightning on Jupiter and Venus and Earth. Volcanoes inject debris into the atmospheres of\nthe Earth and Io. Internal geological processes slowly deform the surfaces of Venus, Mars,\nGanymede and Europa, as well as Earth. Glaciers, proverbial for their slowness, produce\nmajor reworkings of landscapes on the Earth and probably also on Mars. These processes\nneed not be constant in time. Most of Europe was once covered with ice. A few million\nyears ago, the present site of the city of Chicago was buried under three kilometers of frost.\nOn Mars, and elsewhere in the solar system, we see features that could not be produced\ntoday, landscapes carved hundreds of millions or billions of years ago when the planetary\nclimate was probably very different.\n\nThere is an additional factor that can alter the landscape and the climate of Earth:\nintelligent life, able to make major environmental changes. Like Venus, the Earth also has a\ngreenhouse effect due to its carbon dioxide and water vapor. The global temperature of the\nEarth would be below the freezing point of water if not for the greenhouse effect. It keeps\nthe oceans liquid and life possible. A little greenhouse is a good thing. Like Venus, the\nEarth also has about 90 atmospheres of carbon dioxide; but it resides in the crust as\nlimestone and other carbonates, not in the atmosphere. If the Earth were moved only a little\ncloser to the Sun, the temperature would increase slightly. This would drive some of the\nCO); out of the surface rocks, generating a stronger greenhouse effect, which would in turn\nincrementally heat the surface further. A hotter surface would vaporize still more\ncarbonates into CO}, and there would be the possibility of a runaway greenhouse effect to\nvery high temperatures. This is just what we think happened in the early history of Venus,\nbecause of Venus\u2019s proximity to the Sun. The surface environment of Venus is a warning:\nsomething disastrous can happen to a planet rather like our own.\n\nThe principal energy sources of our present industrial civilization are the so-called\nfossil fuels. We burn wood and oil, coal and natural gas, and, in the process, release waste\ngases, principally CO, into the air. Consequently, the carbon dioxide content of the Earth\u2019s\natmosphere is increasing dramatically. The possibility of a runaway greenhouse effect\nsuggests that we have to be careful: Even a one- or two-degree rise in the global\ntemperature can have catastrophic consequences. In the burning of coal and oil and\ngasoline, we are also putting sulfuric acid into the atmosphere. Like Venus, our\nstratosphere even now has a substantial mist of tiny sulfuric acid droplets. Our major cities\nare polluted with noxious molecules. We do not understand the long-term effects of our\ncourse of action.\n\nBut we have also been perturbing the climate in the opposite sense. For hundreds of\nthousands of years human beings have been burning and cutting down forests and\nencouraging domestic animals to graze on and destroy grasslands. Slash-and-burn\nagriculture, industrial tropical deforestation and overgrazing are rampant today. But forests\nare darker than grasslands, and grasslands are darker than deserts. As a consequence, the\namount of sunlight that is absorbed by the ground has been declining, and by changes in the\nland use we are lowering the surface temperature of our planet. Might this cooling increase\nthe size of the polar ice cap, which, because it is bright, will reflect still more sunlight from\nthe Earth, further cooling the planet, driving a runaway albedo* effect?\n\n* The albedo is the fraction of the sunlight striking a planet that is reflected back to space. The\nalbedo of the Earth is some 30 to 35 percent. The rest of the sunlight is absorbed by the ground and is\n\nresponsible for the average surface temperature.\n\nOur lovely blue planet, the Earth, is the only home we know. Venus is too hot. Mars\nis too cold. But the Earth is just right, a heaven for humans. After all, we evolved here. But\nour congenial climate may be unstable. We are perturbing our poor planet in serious and\ncontradictory ways. Is there any danger of driving the environment of the Earth toward the\nplanetary Hell of Venus or the global ice age of Mars? The simple answer is that nobody\nknows. The study of the global climate, the comparison of the Earth with other worlds, are\nsubjects in their earliest stages of development. They are fields that are poorly and\ngrudgingly funded. In our ignorance, we continue to push and pull, to pollute the\natmosphere and brighten the land, oblivious of the fact that the long-term consequences are\nlargely unknown.\n\nA few million years ago, when human beings first evolved on Earth, it was already\na middle-aged world, 4.6 billion years along from the catastrophes and impetuosities of its\nyouth. But we humans now represent a new and perhaps decisive factor. Our intelligence\nand our technology have given us the power to affect the climate. How will we use this\npower? Are we willing to tolerate ignorance and complacency in matters that affect the\nentire human family? Do we value short-term advantages above the welfare of the Earth?\nOr will we think on longer time scales, with concern for our children and our\ngrandchildren, to understand and protect the complex life-support systems of our planet?\nThe Earth is a tiny and fragile world. It needs to be cherished.\n",

The astronomer dutifully replied: NOBODY\nKNOWS, NOBODY KNOWS, NOBODY KNOWS. . . 250 times. But despite this\nconfession of ignorance, asserted with dogged persistence by an expert, no one paid any\nheed, and from that time to this, we hear authoritative pronouncements by those who think\nthey have deduced life on Mars, and by those who think they have excluded it. Some\npeople very much want there to be life on Mars; others very much want there to be no life\non Mars. There have been excesses in both camps. These strong passions have somewhat\nfrayed the tolerance for ambiguity that is essential to science. There seem to be many\npeople who simply wish to be told an answer, any answer, and thereby avoid the burden of\nkeeping two mutually exclusive possibilities in their heads at the same time. Some\nscientists have believed that Mars is inhabited on what has later proved to be the flimsiest\nevidence. Others have concluded the planet is lifeless because a preliminary search for a\nparticular manifestation of life has been unsuccessful or ambiguous. The blues have been\nplayed more than once for the red planet.\n\nWhy Martians? Why so many eager speculations and ardent fantasies about\nMartians, rather than, say, Saturnians or Plutonians? Because Mars seems, at first glance,\nvery Earthlike. It is the nearest planet whose surface we can see. There are polar ice caps,\ndrifting white clouds, raging dust storms, seasonally changing patterns on its red surface,\neven a twenty-four-hour day. It is tempting to think of it as an inhabited world. Mars has\nbecome a kind of mythic arena onto which we have projected our earthly hopes and fears.\n\nBut our psychological predispositions pro or con must not mislead us. All that matters is\nthe evidence, and the evidence is not yet in. The real Mars is a world of wonders. Its future\nprospects are far more intriguing than our past apprehensions about it. In our time we have\nsifted the sands of Mars, we have established a presence there, we have fulfilled a century\nof dreams!\n\nNo one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this\nworld was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man\u2019s\nand yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their various\nconcerns, they were scrutinized and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man\nwith a microscope might scrutinize the transient creatures that swarm and multiply\nin a drop of water. With infinite complacency, men went to and fro over this globe\nabout their little affairs, serene in their assurances of their empire over matter. It is\npossible that the infusoria under the microscope do the same. No one gave a thought\nto the older worlds of space as sources of human danger, or thought of them only to\ndismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable. It is curious to\nrecall some of the mental habits of those departed days. At most, terrestrial men\nfancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to themselves and\nready to welcome a missionary enterprise. Yet across the gulf of space, minds that\nare to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool\nand unsympathetic, regarded this Earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely\ndrew their plans against us.\n\nThese opening lines of H. G. Wells\u2019 1897 science fiction classic The War of the Worlds\nmaintain their haunting power to this day.* For all of our history, there has been the fear, or\nhope, that there might be life beyond the Earth. In the last hundred years, that premonition\nhas focused on a bright red point of light in the night sky. Three years before The War of\nthe Worlds was published, a Bostonian named Percival Lowell founded a major\nobservatory where the most elaborate claims in support of life on Mars were developed.\nLowell dabbled in astronomy as a young man, went to Harvard, secured a semi-official\ndiplomatic appointment to Korea, and otherwise engaged in the usual pursuits of the\nwealthy. Before he died in 1916, he had made major contributions to our knowledge of the\nnature and evolution of the planets, to the deduction of the expanding universe and, in a\ndecisive way, to the discovery of the planet Pluto, which is named after him. The first two\nletters of the name Pluto are the initials of Percival Lowell. Its symbol is M, a planetary\nmonogram.\n\n* In 1938, a radio version, produced by Orson Welles, transposed the Martian invasion from England\nto the eastern United States, and frightened millions in war-jittery America into believing that the Martians\nwere in fact attacking.\n\nBut Lowell\u2019s lifelong love was the planet Mars. He was electrified by the\nannouncement in 1877 by an Italian astronomer, Giovanni Schiaparelli, of canali on Mars.\nSchiaparelli had reported during a close approach of Mars to Earth an intricate network of\nsingle and double straight lines crisscrossing the bright areas of the planet. Canali in Italian\nmeans channels or grooves, but was promptly translated into English as canals, a word that\nimplies intelligent design. A Mars mania coursed through Europe and America, and Lowell\n\nfound himself swept up with it.\n\nIn 1892, his eyesight failing, Schiaparelli announced he was giving up observing\nMars. Lowell resolved to continue the work. He wanted a first-rate observing site,\nundisturbed by clouds or city lights and marked by good \u2018seeing,\u2019 the astronomer\u2019s term for\na steady atmosphere through which the shimmering of an astronomical image in the\ntelescope is minimized. Bad seeing is produced by small-scale turbulence in the atmosphere\nabove the telescope and is the reason the stars twinkle. Lowell built his observatory far\naway from home, on Mars Hill in Flagstaff, Arizona.* He sketched the surface features of\nMars, particularly the canals, which mesmerized him. Observations of this sort are not easy.\nYou put in long hours at the telescope in the chill of the early morning. Often the seeing is\npoor and the image of Mars blurs and distorts. Then you must ignore what you have seen.\nOccasionally the image steadies and the features of the planet flash out momentarily,\nmarvelously. You must then remember what has been vouchsafed to you and accurately\ncommit it to paper. You must put your preconceptions aside and with an open mind set\ndown the wonders of Mars.\n\n* Isaac Newton had written \u2018If the Theory of making Telescopes could at length be fully brought into\npractice, yet there would be certain Bounds beyond which Telescopes could not perform. For the Air through\nwhich we look upon the Stars, is in perpetual tremor . . . The only remedy is the most serene and quiet Air,\nsuch as may perhaps be found on the tops of the highest mountains above the grosser Clouds.\u2019\n\nPercival Lowell\u2019s notebooks are full of what he thought he saw: bright and dark\nareas, a hint of polar cap, and canals, a planet festooned with canals. Lowell believed he\nwas seeing a globe girdling network of great irrigation ditches, carrying water from the\nmelting polar caps to the thirsty inhabitants of the equatorial cities. He believed the planet\nto be inhabited by an older and wiser race, perhaps very different from us. He believed that\nthe seasonal changes in the dark areas were due to the growth and decay of vegetation. He\nbelieved that Mars was, very closely, Earth-like. All in all, he believed too much.\n\nLowell conjured up a Mars that was ancient, arid, withered, a desert world. Still, it\nwas an Earth-like desert. Lowell\u2019s Mars had many features in common with the American\nSouthwest, where the Lowell Observatory was located. He imagined the Martian\ntemperatures a little on the chilly side but still as comfortable as \u2018the South of England.\u2019\nThe air was thin, but there was enough oxygen to be breathable. Water was rare, but the\nelegant network of canals carried the life-giving fluid all over the planet.\n\nWhat was in retrospect the most serious contemporary challenge to Lowell\u2019s ideas\ncame from an unlikely source. In 1907, Alfred Russel Wallace, co-discoverer of evolution\nby natural selection, was asked to review one of Lowell\u2019s books. He had been an engineer\nin his youth and, while somewhat credulous on such issues as extrasensory perception, was\nadmirably skeptical on the habitability of Mars. Wallace showed that Lowell had erred in\nhis calculation of the average temperatures on Mars; instead of being as temperate as the\nSouth of England, they were, with few exceptions, everywhere below the freezing point of\nwater. There should be permafrost, a perpetually frozen subsurface. The air was much\nthinner than Lowell had calculated. Craters should be as abundant as on the Moon. And as\nfor the water in the canals:\n\nAny attempt to make that scanty surplus [of water], by means of overflowing\ncanals, travel across the equator into the opposite hemisphere, through such terrible\n\ndesert regions and exposed to such a cloudless sky as Mr Lowell describes, would\nbe the work of a body of madmen rather than of intelligent beings. It may be safely\nasserted that not one drop of water would escape evaporation or insoak at even a\nhundred miles from its source.\n\nThis devastating and largely correct physical analysis was written in Wallace\u2019s eighty-\nfourth year. His conclusion was that life on Mars - by this he meant civil engineers with an\ninterest in hydraulics - was impossible. He offered no opinion on microorganisms.\n\nDespite Wallace\u2019s critique, despite the fact that other astronomers with telescopes\nand observing sites as good as Lowell\u2019s could find no sign of the fabled canals, Lowell\u2019s\nvision of Mars gained popular acceptance. It had a mythic quality as old as Genesis. Part of\nits appeal was the fact that the nineteenth century was an age of engineering marvels,\nincluding the construction of enormous canals: the Suez Canal, completed in 1869; the\nCorinth Canal, in 1893; the Panama Canal, in 1914; and, closer to home, the Great Lake\nlocks, the barge canals of upper New York State, and the irrigation canals of the American\nSouthwest. If Europeans and Americans could perform such feats, why not Martians?\nMight there not be an even more elaborate effort by an older and wiser species,\ncourageously battling the advance of desiccation on the red planet?\n\nWe have now sent reconnaissance satellites into orbit around Mars. The entire\nplanet has been mapped. We have landed two automated laboratories on its surface. The\nmysteries of Mars have, if anything, deepened since Lowell\u2019s day. However, with pictures\nfar more detailed than any view of Mars that Lowell could have glimpsed, we have found\nnot a tributary of the vaunted canal network, not one lock. Lowell and Schiaparelli and\nothers, doing visual observations under difficult seeing conditions, were misled - in part\nperhaps because of a predisposition to believe in life on Mars.\n\nThe observing notebooks of Percival Lowell reflect a sustained effort at the\ntelescope over many years. They show Lowell to have been well aware of the skepticism\nexpressed by other astronomers about the reality of the canals. They reveal a man\nconvinced that he has made an important discovery and distressed that others have not yet\nunderstood its significance. In his notebook for 1905, for example, there is an entry on\nJanuary 21: \u2018Double canals came out by flashes, convincing of reality.\u2019 In reading Lowell\u2019s\nnotebooks I have the distinct but uncomfortable feeling that he was really seeing\nsomething. But what?\n\nWhen Paul Fox of Comell and I compared Lowell\u2019s maps of Mars with the Mariner\n9 orbital imagery sometimes with a resolution a thousand times superior to that of Lowell\u2019s\nEarthbound twenty-four-inch refracting telescope - we found virtually no correlation at all.\nIt was not that Lowell\u2019s eye had strung up disconnected fine detail on the Martian surface\ninto illusory straight lines. There was no dark mottling or crater chains in the position of\nmost of his canals. There were no features there at all. Then how could he have drawn the\nsame canals year after year? How could other astronomers some of whom said they had not\nexamined Lowell\u2019s maps closely until after their own observations - have drawn the same\ncanals? One of the great findings of the Mariner 9 mission to Mars was that there are time-\nvariable streaks and splotches on the Martian surface - many connected with the ramparts\nof impact craters - which change with the seasons. They are due to windblown dust, the\npatterns varying with the seasonal winds. But the streaks do not have the character of the\ncanals, they are not in the position of the canals, and none of them is large enough\nindividually to be seen from the Earth in the first place. It is unlikely that there were real\n\nfeatures on Mars even slightly resembling Lowell\u2019s canals in the first few decades of this\ncentury that have disappeared without a trace as soon as close-up spacecraft investigations\nbecame possible.\n\nThe canals of Mars seem to be some malfunction, under difficult seeing conditions,\nof the human hand/eye/brain combination (or at least for some humans; many other\nastronomers, observing with equally good instruments in Lowell\u2019s time and after, claimed\nthere were no canals whatever). But this is hardly a comprehensive explanation, and I have\nthe nagging suspicion that some essential feature of the Martian canal problem still remains\nundiscovered. Lowell always said that the regularity of the canals was an unmistakable sign\nthat they were of intelligent origin. This is certainly true. The only unresolved question was\nwhich side of the telescope the intelligence was on.\n\nLowell\u2019s Martians were benign and hopeful, even a little god-like, very different\nfrom the malevolent menace posed by Wells and Welles in The War of the Worlds. Both\nsets of ideas passed into the public imagination through Sunday supplements and science\nfiction. I can remember as a child reading with breathless fascination the Mars novels of\nEdgar Rice Burroughs. I journeyed with John Carter, gentleman adventurer from Virginia,\nto \u2018Barsoom,\u2019 as Mars was known to its inhabitants. I followed herds of eight-legged beasts\nof burden, the thoats. I won the hand of the lovely Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium. I\nbefriended a four-meter-high green fighting man named Tars Tarkas. I wandered within the\nspired cities and domed pumping stations of Barsoom, and along the verdant banks of the\nNilosyrtis and Nepenthes canals.\n\nMight it really be possible - in fact and not fancy - to venture with John Carter to\nthe Kingdom of Helium on the planet Mars? Could we venture out on a summer evening,\nour way illuminated by the two hurtling moons of Barsoom, for a journey of high scientific\nadventure? Even if all Lowell\u2019s conclusions about Mars, including the existence of the\nfabled canals, turned out to be bankrupt, his depiction of the planet had at least this virtue:\nit aroused generations of eight-year-olds, myself among them, to consider the exploration\nof the planets as a real possibility, to wonder if we ourselves might one day voyage to\nMars. John Carter got there by standing in an open field, spreading his hands and wishing. I\ncan remember spending many an hour in my boyhood, arms resolutely outstretched in an\nempty field, imploring what I believed to be Mars to transport me there. It never worked.\nThere had to be some other way.\n\nLike organisms, machines also have their evolutions. The rocket began, like the\ngunpowder that first powered it, in China where it was used for ceremonial and aesthetic\npurposes. Imported to Europe around the fourteenth century, it was applied to warfare,\ndiscussed in the late nineteenth century as a means of transportation to the planets by the\nRussian schoolteacher Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, and first developed seriously for high\naltitude flight by the American scientist Robert Goddard. The German V-2 military rocket\nof World War II employed virtually all of Goddard\u2019s innovations and culminated in 1948 in\nthe two-stage launching of the V-2/WAC Corporal combination to the then-unprecedented\naltitude of 400 kilometers. In the 1959s, engineering advances organized by Sergei Korolov\nin the Soviet Union and Wernher von Braun in the United States, funded as delivery\nsystems for weapons of mass destruction, led to the first artificial satellites. The pace of\nprogress has continued to be brisk: manned orbital flight; humans orbiting, then landing on\nthe moon; and unmanned spacecraft outward bound throughout the solar system. Many\nother nations have now launched spacecraft, including Britain, France, Canada, Japan and\nChina, the society that invented the rocket in the first place.\n\nAmong the early applications of the space rocket, as Tsiolkovsky and Goddard\n(who as a young man had read Wells and had been stimulated by the lectures of Percival\nLowell) delighted in imagining, were an orbiting scientific station to monitor the Earth\nfrom a great height and a probe to search for life on Mars. Both these dreams have now\nbeen fulfilled.\n\nImagine yourself a visitor from some other and quite alien planet, approaching\nEarth with no preconceptions. Your view of the planet improves as you come closer and\nmore and more fine detail stands out. Is the planet inhabited? At what point can you\ndecide? If there are intelligent beings, perhaps they have created engineering structures that\nhave high-contrast components on a scale of a few kilometers, structures detectable when\nour optical systems and distance from the Earth provide kilometer resolution. Yet at this\nlevel of detail, the earth seems utterly barren. There is no sign of life, intelligent or\notherwise, in places we call Washington, New York, Boston, Moscow, London, Paris,\nBerlin, Tokyo and Peking. If there are intelligent beings on Earth, they have not much\nmodified the landscape into regular geometrical patterns at kilometer resolution.\n\nBut when we improve the resolution tenfold, when we begin to see detail as small\nas a hundred meters across, the situation changes. Many places on Earth seem suddenly to\ncrystallize out, revealing an intricate pattern of squares and rectangles, straight lines and\ncircles. These are, in fact, the engineering artifacts of intelligent beings: roads, highways,\ncanals, farmland, city streets - a pattern disclosing the twin human passions for Euclidean\ngeometry and territoriality. On this scale, intelligent life can be discerned in Boston and\nWashington and New York. And at ten-meter resolution, the degree to which the landscape\nhas been reworked first really becomes evident. Humans have been very busy. These\nphotos have been taken in daylight. But at twilight or during the night, other things are\nvisible: oil-well fires in Libya and the Persian Gulf; deepwater illumination by the Japanese\nsquid fishing fleet; the bright lights of large cities. And if, in daylight, we improve our\nresolution so we can make out things that are a meter across, then we begin to detect for the\nfirst time individual organisms - whales, cows, flamingos, people.\n\nIntelligent life on Earth first reveals itself through the geometric regularity of its\nconstructions. If Lowell\u2019s canal network really existed, the conclusion that intelligent\nbeings inhabit Mars might be similarly compelling. For life to be detected on Mars\nphotographically, even from Mars orbit, it must likewise have accomplished a major\nreworking of the surface. Technical civilizations, canal builders, might be easy to detect.\nBut except for one or two enigmatic features, nothing of the sort is apparent in the exquisite\nprofusion of Martian surface detail uncovered by unmanned spacecraft. However, there are\nmany other possibilities, ranging from large plants and animals to microorganisms, to\nextinct forms, to a planet that is now and was always lifeless. Because Mars is farther from\nthe Sun than is the Earth, its temperatures are considerably lower. Its air is thin, containing\nmostly carbon dioxide but also some molecular nitrogen and argon and very small\nquantities of water vapor, oxygen and ozone. Open bodies of liquid water are impossible\ntoday because the atmospheric pressure on Mars is too low to keep even cold water from\nrapidly boiling. There may be minute quantities of liquid water in pores and capillaries in\nthe soil. The amount of oxygen is far too little for a human being to breathe. The ozone\nabundance is so small that germicidal ultraviolet radiation from the Sun strikes the Martian\nsurface unimpeded. Could any organism survive in such an environment?\n\nTo test this question, many years ago my colleagues and I prepared chambers that\nsimulated the Martian environment as it was then known, inoculated them with terrestrial\n\nmicroorganisms and waited to see if anybody survived. Such chambers are called, of\ncourse, Mars Jars. The Mars Jars cycled the temperatures within a typical Martian range\nfrom a little above the freezing point around noon to about -80\u00b0C just before dawn, in an\nanoxic atmosphere composed chiefly of CO, and No. Ultraviolet lamps reproduced the\nfierce solar flux. No liquid water was present except for very thin films wetting individual\nsand grains. Some microbes froze to death after the first night and were never heard from\nagain. Others gasped and perished from lack of oxygen. Some died of thirst, and some were\nfried by the ultraviolet light. But there were always a fair number of varieties of terrestrial\nmicrobes that did not need oxygen; that temporarily closed up shop when the temperatures\ndropped too low; that hid from the ultraviolet light under pebbles or thin layers of sand. In\nother experiments, when small quantities of liquid water were present, the microbes\nactually grew. If terrestrial microbes can survive the Martian environment, how much better\nMartian microbes, if they exist, must do on Mars. But first we must get there.\n\nThe Soviet Union maintains an active program of unmanned planetary exploration.\nEvery year or two the relative positions of the planets and the physics of Kepler and\nNewton permit the launch of a spacecraft to Mars or Venus with a minimum expenditure of\nenergy. Since the early 1960\u2019s the U.S.S.R. has missed few such opportunities. Soviet\npersistence and engineering skills have eventually paid off handsomely. Five Soviet\nspacecraft - Venera 8 through 12 - have landed on Venus and successfully returned data\nfrom the surface, no insignificant feat in so hot, dense and corrosive a planetary\natmosphere. Yet despite many attempts, the Soviet Union has never landed successfully on\nMars - a place that, at least at first sight, seems more hospitable, with chilly temperatures, a\nmuch thinner atmosphere and more benign gases; with polar ice caps, clear pink skies,\ngreat sand dunes, ancient river beds, a vast rift valley, the largest volcanic construct, so far\nas we know, in the solar system, and balmy equatorial summer afternoons. It is a far more\nEarth-like world than Venus.\n\nIn 1971, the Soviet Mars 3 spacecraft entered the Martian atmosphere. According to\nthe information automatically radioed back, it successfully deployed its landing systems\nduring entry, correctly oriented its ablation shield downward, properly unfurled its great\nparachute and fired its retro-rockets near the end of its descent path. According to the data\nreturned by Mars 3, it should have landed successfully on the red planet. But after landing,\nthe spacecraft returned a twenty-second fragment of a featureless television picture to Earth\nand then mysteriously failed. In 1973, a quite similar sequence of events occurred with the\nMars 6 lander, in that case the failure occurring within one second of touchdown. What\nwent wrong?\n\nThe first illustration I ever saw of Mars 3 was on a Soviet postage stamp\n(denomination, 16 kopecks), which depicted the spacecraft descending through a kind of\npurple muck. The artist was trying, I think, to illustrate dust and high winds: Mars 3 had\nentered the Martian atmosphere during an enormous global dust storm. We have evidence\nfrom the U.S. Mariner 9 mission that near-surface winds of more than 140 meters per\nsecond - faster than half the speed of sound on Mars - arose in that storm. Both our Soviet\ncolleagues and we think it likely that these high winds caught the Mars 3 spacecraft with\nparachute unfurled, so that it landed gently in the vertical direction but with breakneck\nspeed in the horizontal direction. A spacecraft descending on the shrouds of a large\nparachute is particularly vulnerable to horizontal winds. After landing, Mars 3 may have\nmade a few bounces, hit a boulder or other example of Martian relief, tipped over, lost the\nradio link with its carrier \u2018bus\u2019 and failed.\n\nBut why did Mars 3 enter in the midst of a great dust storm? The Mars 3 mission\nwas rigidly organized before launch. Every step it was to perform was loaded into the on-\nboard computer before it left earth. There was no opportunity to change the computer\nprogram, even as the extent of the great 1971 dust storm became clear. In the jargon of\nspace exploration, the Mars 3 mission was preprogrammed, not adaptive. The failure of\nMars 6 is more mysterious. There was no planet-wide storm when this spacecraft entered\nthe Martian atmosphere, and no reason to suspect a local storm, as sometimes happens, at\nthe landing site. Perhaps there was an engineering failure just at the moment of touchdown.\nOr perhaps there is something particularly dangerous about the Martian surface.\n\nThe combination of Soviet successes in landing on Venus and Soviet failures in\nlanding on Mars naturally caused us some concern about the U.S. Viking mission, which\nhad been informally scheduled to set one of its two descent craft gently down on the\nMartian surface on the Bicentennial of the United States, July 4, 1976. Like its Soviet\npredecessors, the Viking landing maneuver involved an ablation shield, a parachute and\nretro-rockets. Because the Martian atmosphere is only 1 percent as dense as the Earth\u2019s, a\nvery large parachute, eighteen meters in diameter, was deployed to slow the spacecraft as it\nentered the thin air of Mars. The atmosphere is so thin that if Viking had landed at a high\nelevation there would not have been enough atmosphere to brake the descent adequately: it\nwould have crashed. One requirement, therefore, was for a landing site in a low-lying\nregion. From Mariner 9 results and ground-based radar studies, we knew many such areas.\n\nTo avoid the probable fate of Mars 3, we wanted Viking to land in a place and time\nat which the winds were low. Winds that would make the lander crash were probably\nstrong enough to lift dust off the surface. If we could check that the candidate landing site\nwas not covered with shifting, drifting dust, we would have at least a fair chance of\nguaranteeing that the winds were not intolerably high. This was one reason that each\nViking lander was carried into Mars orbit with its orbiter, and descent delayed until the\norbiter surveyed the landing site. We had discovered with Mariner 9 that characteristic\nchanges in the bright and dark patterns on the Martian surface occur during times of high\nwinds. We certainly would not have certified a Viking landing site as safe if orbital\nphotographs had shown such shifting patterns. But our guarantees could not be 100 percent\nreliable. For example, we could imagine a landing site at which the winds were so strong\nthat all mobile dust had already been blown away. We would then have had no indication\nof the high winds that might have been there. Detailed weather predictions for Mars were,\nof course, much less reliable than for Earth. (Indeed one of the many objectives of the\nViking mission was to improve our understanding of the weather on both planets.)\n\nBecause of communication and temperature constraints, Viking could not land at\nhigh Martian latitudes. Farther poleward than about 45 or 50 degrees in both hemispheres,\neither the time of useful communication of the spacecraft with the Earth or the period\nduring which the spacecraft would avoid dangerously low temperatures would have been\nawkwardly short.\n\nWe did not wish to land in too rough a place. The spacecraft might have tipped over\nand crashed, or at the least its mechanical arm, intended to acquire Martian soil samples,\nmight have become wedged or been left waving helplessly a meter too high above the\nsurface. Likewise, we did not want to land in places that were too soft. If the spacecraft\u2019s\nthree landing pods had sunk deeply into a loosely packed soil, various undesirable\nconsequences would have followed, including immobilization of the sample arm. But we\ndid not want to land in a place that was too hard either - had we landed in a vitreous lava\n\nfield, for example, with no powdery surface material, the mechanical arm would have been\nunable to acquire the sample vital to the projected chemistry and biology experiments.\n\nThe best photographs then available of Mars - from the Mariner 9 orbiter - showed\nfeatures no smaller than 90 meters (100 yards) across. The Viking orbiter pictures\nimproved this figure only slightly. Boulders one meter (three feet) in size were entirely\ninvisible in such photographs, and could have had disastrous consequences for the Viking\nlander. Likewise, a deep, soft powder might have been indetectable photographically.\nFortunately, there was a technique that enabled us to determine the roughness or softness of\na candidate landing site: radar. A very rough place would scatter radar from Earth off to the\nsides of the beam and therefore appear poorly reflective, or radar-dark. A very soft place\nwould also appear poorly reflective because of the many interstices between individual\nsand grains. While we were unable to distinguish between rough places and soft places, we\ndid not need to make such distinctions for landing-site selection. Both, we knew, were\ndangerous. Preliminary radar surveys suggested that as much as a quarter to a third of the\nsurface area of Mars might be radar-dark, and therefore dangerous for Viking. But not all of\nMars can be viewed by Earth-based radar - only a swath between about 25\u00b0 N and about\n25\u00b0 S. The Viking orbiter carried no radar system of its own to map the surface.\n\nThere were many constraints - perhaps, we feared, too many. Our landing sites had\nto be not too high, too windy, too hard, too soft, too rough or too close to the pole. It was\nremarkable that there were any places at all on Mars that simultaneously satisfied all our\nsafety criteria. But it was also clear that our search for safe harbors had led us to landing\nsites that were, by and large, dull.\n\nWhen each of the two Viking orbiter-lander combinations was inserted into Martian\norbit, it was unalterably committed to landing at a certain Jatitude on Mars. If the low point\nin the orbit was at 21\u00b0 Martian north latitude, the lander would touch down at 21\u00b0 N,\nalthough, by waiting for the planet to turn beneath it, it could land at any longitude\nwhatever. Thus the Viking science teams selected candidate latitudes for which there was\nmore than one promising site. Viking 1 was targeted for 21\u00b0 N. The prime site was in a\nregion called Chryse (Greek for \u2018the land of gold\u2019), near the confluence of four sinuous\nchannels thought to have been carved in previous epochs of Martian history by running\nwater. The Chryse site seemed to satisfy all safety criteria. But the radar observations had\nbeen made nearby, not in the Chryse landing site itself. Radar observations of Chryse were\nmade for the first time - because of the geometry of Earth and Mars - only a few weeks\nbefore the nominal landing date.\n\nThe candidate landing latitude for Viking 2 was 44\u00b0 N; the prime site, a locale\ncalled Cydonia, chosen because, according to some theoretical arguments, there was a\nsignificant chance of small quantities of liquid water there, at least at some time during the\nMartian year. Since the Viking biology experiments were strongly oriented toward\norganisms that are comfortable in liquid water, some scientists held that the chance of\nViking finding life would be substantially improved in Cydonia. On the other hand, it was\nargued that, on so windy a planet as Mars, microorganisms should be everywhere if they\nare anywhere. There seemed to be merit to both positions; and it was difficult to decide\nbetween them. What was quite clear, however, was that 44\u00b0 N was completely inaccessible\nto radar site-certification; we had to accept a significant risk of failure with Viking 2 if it\nwas committed to high northern latitudes. It was sometimes argued that if Viking 1 was\ndown and working well we could afford to accept a greater risk with Viking 2. I found\nmyself making very conservative recommendations on the fate of a billion-dollar mission. I\n\ncould imagine, for example, a key instrument failure in Chryse just after an unfortunate\ncrash landing in Cydonia. To improve the Viking options, additional landing sites,\ngeologically very different from Chryse and Cydonia, were selected in the radar-certified\nregion near 4\u00b0 S latitude. A decision on whether Viking 2 would set down at high or at low\nlatitude was not made until virtually the last minute, when a place with the hopeful name of\nUtopia, at the same latitude as Cydonia, was chosen.\n\nFor Viking 1, the original landing site seemed, after we examined orbiter\nphotographs and late-breaking Earth-based radar data, unacceptably risky. For a while I\nworried that Viking 1 had been condemned, like the legendary Flying Dutchman, to wander\nthe skies of Mars forever, never to find safe haven. Eventually we found a suitable spot,\nstill in Chryse but far from the confluence of the four ancient channels. The delay prevented\nus from setting down on July 4, 1976, but it was generally agreed that a crash landing on\nthat date would have been an unsatisfactory two hundredth birthday present for the United\nStates. We deboosted from orbit and entered the Martian atmosphere sixteen days later.\n\nAfter an interplanetary voyage of a year and a half, covering a hundred million\nkilometers the long way round the Sun, each orbiter/lander combination was inserted into\nits proper orbit about Mars; the orbiters surveyed candidate landing sites; the landers\nentered the Martian atmosphere on radio command and correctly oriented ablation shields,\ndeployed parachutes, divested coverings, and fired retro-rockets. In Chryse and Utopia, for\nthe first time in human history, spacecraft had touched down, gently and safely, on the red\nplanet. These triumphant landings were due in considerable part to the great skill invested\nin their design, fabrication and testing, and to the abilities of the spacecraft controllers. But\nfor so dangerous and mysterious a planet as Mars, there was also at least an element of\nluck.\n\nImmediately after landing, the first pictures were to be returned. We knew we had\nchosen dull places. But we could hope. The first picture taken by the Viking 1 lander was\nof one of its own footpads - in case it were to sink into Martian quicksand, we wanted to\nknow about it before the spacecraft disappeared. The picture built up, line by line, until\nwith enormous relief we saw the footpad sitting high and dry above the Martian surface.\nSoon other pictures came into being, each picture element radioed individually back to\nEarth.\n\nI remember being transfixed by the first lander image to show the horizon of Mars.\nThis was not an alien world, I thought. I knew places like it in Colorado and Arizona and\nNevada. There were rocks and sand drifts and a distant eminence, as natural and\nunselfconscious as any landscape on Earth. Mars was a place. I would, of course, have been\nsurprised to see a grizzled prospector emerge from behind a dune leading his mule, but at\nthe same time the idea seemed appropriate. Nothing remotely like it ever entered my mind\nin all the hours I spent examining the Venera 9 and 10 images of the Venus surface. One\nway or another, I knew, this was a world to which we would return.\n\nThe landscape is stark and red and lovely: boulders thrown out in the creation of a\ncrater somewhere over the horizon, small sand dunes, rocks that have been repeatedly\ncovered and uncovered by drifting dust, plumes of fine-grained material blown about by the\nwinds. Where did the rocks come from? How much sand has been blown by wind? What\nmust the previous history of the planet have been to create sheared rocks, buried boulders,\npolygonal gouges in the ground? What are the rocks made of? The same materials as the\nsand? Is the sand merely pulverized rock or something else? Why is the sky pink? What is\nthe air made of? How fast does the wind blow? Are there marsquakes? How does the\n\natmospheric pressure and the appearance of the landscape change with the seasons?\n\nFor every one of these questions Viking has provided definitive or at least plausible\nanswers. The Mars revealed by the Viking mission is of enormous interest - particularly\nwhen we remember that the landing sites were chosen for their dullness. But the cameras\nrevealed no sign of canal builders, no Barsoomian aircars or short swords, no princesses or\nfighting men, no thoats, no footprints, not even a cactus or a kangaroo rat. For as far as we\ncould see, there was not a sign of life.*\n\n* There was a brief flurry when the uppercase letter B, a putative Martian graffito, seemed to be\nvisible on a small boulder in Chryse. But later analysis showed it to be a trick of light and shadow and the\nhuman talent for pattern recognition. It also seemed remarkable that the Martians should have tumbled\nindependently to the Latin alphabet. But there was just a moment when resounding in my head was the distant\necho of a word from my boyhood - Barsoom.\n\nPerhaps there are large lifeforms on Mars, but not in our two landing sites. Perhaps\nthere are smaller forms in every rock and sand grain. For most of its history, those regions\nof the Earth not covered by water looked rather like Mars today - with an atmosphere rich\nin carbon dioxide, with ultraviolet light shining fiercely down on the surface through an\natmosphere devoid of ozone. Large plants and animals did not colonize the land until the\nlast 10 percent of Earth history. And yet for three billion years there were microorganisms\neverywhere on Earth. To look for life on Mars, we must look for microbes.\n\nThe Viking lander extends human capabilities to other and alien landscapes. By\nsome standards, it is about as smart as a grasshopper; by others, only as intelligent as a\nbacterium. There is nothing demeaning in these comparisons. It took nature hundreds of\nmillions of years to evolve a bacterium, and billions to make a grasshopper. With only a\nlittle experience in this sort of business, we are becoming fairly skillful at it. Viking has\ntwo eyes as we do, but they also work in the infrared, as ours do not; a sample arm that can\npush rocks, dig and acquire soil samples; a kind of finger that it puts up to measure wind\nspeed and direction; a nose and taste buds, of a sort, with which it senses, to a much higher\nprecision than we can, the presence of trace molecules; an interior ear with which it can\ndetect the rumbling of marsquakes and the gentler wind-driven jiggling of the spacecraft;\nand a means of detecting microbes. The spacecraft has its own self-contained radioactive\npower source. It radios all the scientific information it acquires back to Earth. It receives\ninstructions from Earth, so human beings can ponder the significance of the Viking results\nand tell the spacecraft to do something new.\n\nBut what is the optimum way, given severe constraints on size, cost and power\nrequirements, to search for microbes on Mars? We cannot - at least as yet - send\nmicrobiologists there. I once had a friend, an extraordinary microbiologist named Wolf\nVishniac, of the University of Rochester, in New York. In the late 1950\u2019s, when we were\njust beginning to think seriously about looking for life on Mars, he found himself at a\nscientific meeting where an astronomer expressed amazement that the biologists had no\nsimple, reliable, automated instrument capable of looking for microorganisms. Vishniac\ndecided he would do something about the matter.\n\nHe developed a small device to be sent to the planets. His friends called it the Wolf\nTrap. It would carry a little vial of nutrient organic matter to Mars, arrange for a sample of\nMartian soil to be mixed in with it, and observe the changing turbidity or cloudiness of\nliquid as the Martian bugs (if there were any) grew (if they would). The Wolf Trap was\n\nselected along with three other microbiology experiments to go aboard the Viking landers.\nTwo of the other three experiments also chose to send food to the Martians. The success of\nthe Wolf Trap required that Martian bugs like liquid water. There were those who thought\nthat Vishniac would only drown the little Martians. But the advantage of the Wolf Trap was\nthat it laid no requirements on what the Martian microbes must do with their food. They\nhad only to grow. All the other experiments made specific assumptions about gases that\nwould be given off or taken in by the microbes, assumptions that were little more than\nguesses.\n\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which runs the United States\nplanetary space program, is subject to frequent and unpredictable budget cuts. Only rarely\nare there unanticipated budget increases. NASA scientific activities have very little\neffective support in the government, and so science is most often the target when money\nneeds to be taken away from NASA. In 1971 it was decided that one of the four\nmicrobiology experiments must be removed, and the Wolf Trap was offloaded. It was a\ncrushing disappointment for Vishniac, who had invested twelve years in its development.\n\nMany others in his place might have stalked off the Viking Biology Team. But\nVishniac was a gentle and dedicated man. He decided instead that he could best serve the\nsearch for life on Mars by voyaging to the most Mars-like environment on Earth - the dry\nvalleys of Antarctica. Some previous investigators had examined Antarctic soil and decided\nthat the few microbes they were able to find were not really natives of the dry valleys, but\nhad been blown there from other, more clement environments. Recalling the Mars Jars\nexperiments, Vishniac believed that life was tenacious and that Antarctica was perfectly\nconsistent with microbiology. If terrestrial bugs could live on Mars, he thought, why not in\nAntarctica - which was by and large warmer, wetter, and had more oxygen and much less\nultraviolet light. Conversely, finding life in Antarctic dry valleys would correspondingly\nimprove, he thought, the chances of life on Mars. Vishniac believed that the experimental\ntechniques previously used to deduce no indigenous microbes in Antarctica were flawed.\nThe nutrients, while suitable for the comfortable environment of a university microbiology\nlaboratory, were not designed for the arid polar wasteland.\n\nSo on November 8, 1973, Vishniac, his new microbiology equipment and a\ngeologist companion were transported by helicopter from McMurdo Station to an area near\nMount Balder, a dry valley in the Asgard range. His practice was to implant the little\nmicrobiology stations in the Antarctic soil and return about a month later to retrieve them.\nOn December 10, 1973, he left to gather samples on Mount Balder; his departure was\nphotographed from about three kilometers away. It was the last time anyone saw him alive.\nEighteen hours later, his body was discovered at the base of a cliff of ice. He had wandered\ninto an area not previously explored, had apparently slipped on the ice and tumbled and\nbounced for a distance of 150 meters. Perhaps something had caught his eye, a likely\nhabitat for microbes, say, or a patch of green where none should be. We will never know.\nIn the small brown notebook he was carrying that day, the last entry reads; \u2018Station 202\nretrieved. 10 December, 1973. 2230 hours. Soil temperature, -10\u00b0. Air temperature -16\u00b0.\u2019 It\nhad been a typical summer temperature for Mars.\n\nMany of Vishniac\u2019s microbiology stations are still sitting in Antarctica. But the\nsamples that were returned were examined, using his methods, by his professional\ncolleagues and friends. A wide variety of microbes, which would have been indetectable\nwith conventional scoring techniques, was found in essentially every site examined. A new\nspecies of yeast, apparently unique to Antarctica, was discovered in his samples by his\n\nwidow, Helen Simpson Vishniac. Large rocks returned from Antarctica in that expedition,\nexamined by Imre Friedmann, turn out to have a fascinating microbiology - one or two\nmillimeters inside the rock, algae have colonized a tiny world in which small quantities of\nwater are trapped and made liquid. On Mars such a place would be even more interesting,\nbecause while the visible light necessary for photosynthesis would penetrate to that depth,\nthe germicidal ultraviolet light would be at least partially attenuated.\n\nBecause the design of space missions is finalized many years before launch, and\nbecause of Vishniac\u2019s death, the results of his Antarctic experiments did not influence the\nViking design for seeking Martian life. In general, the microbiology experiments were not\ncarried out at the low ambient Martian temperatures, and most did not provide long\nincubation times. They all made fairly strong assumptions about what Martian metabolism\nhad to be like. There was no way to look for life inside the rocks.\n\nEach Viking lander was equipped with a sample arm to acquire material from the\nsurface and then slowly withdraw it into the innards of the spacecraft, transporting the\nparticles on little hoppers like an electric train to five different experiments: one on the\ninorganic chemistry of the soil, another to look for organic molecules in the sand and dust,\nand three to look for microbial life. When we look for life on a planet, we are making\ncertain assumptions. We try, as well as we can, not to assume that life elsewhere will be\njust like life here. But there are limits to what we can do. We know in detail only about life\nhere. While the Viking biology experiments are a pioneering first effort, they hardly\nrepresent a definitive search for life on Mars. The results have been tantalizing, annoying,\nprovocative, stimulating, and, at least until recently, substantially inconclusive.\n\nEach of the three microbiology experiments asked a different kind of question, but\nin all cases a question about Martian metabolism. If there are microorganisms in the\nMartian soil, they must take in food and give off waste gases; or they must take in gases\nfrom the atmosphere and, perhaps with the aid of sunlight, convert them into useful\nmaterials. So we bring food to Mars and hope that the Martians, if there are any, will find it\ntasty. Then we see if any interesting new gases come out of the soil. Or we provide our own\nradioactively labeled gases and see if they are converted into organic matter, in which case\nsmall Martians are inferred.\n\nBy criteria established before launch, two of the three Viking microbiology\nexperiments seem to have yielded positive results. First, when Martian soil was mixed with\na sterile organic soup from Earth, something in the soil chemically broke down the soup -\nalmost as if there were respiring microbes metabolizing a food package from Earth.\nSecond, when gases from Earth were introduced into the Martian soil sample, the gases\nbecame chemically combined with the soil - almost as if there were photosynthesizing\nmicrobes, generating organic matter from atmospheric gases. Positive results in Martian\nmicrobiology were achieved in seven different samplings- in two locales on Mars separated\nby 5,000 kilometers.\n\nBut the situation is complex, and the criteria of experimental success may have been\ninadequate. Enormous efforts were made to build the Viking microbiology experiments and\ntest them with a variety of microbes. Very little effort was made to calibrate the\nexperiments with plausible inorganic Martian surface materials. Mars is not the Earth. As\nthe legacy of Percival Lowell reminds us, we can be fooled. Perhaps there is an exotic\ninorganic chemistry in the Martian soil that is able by itself, in the absence of Martian\nmicrobes, to oxidize foodstuffs. Perhaps there is some special inorganic, nonliving catalyst\nin the soil that is able to fix atmospheric gases and convert them into organic molecules.\n\nRecent experiments suggest that this may indeed be the case. In the great Martian\ndust storm of 1971, spectral features of the dust were obtained by the Mariner 9 infrared\nspectrometer. In analyzing these spectra, O. B. Toon, J. B. Pollack and I found that certain\nfeatures seem best accounted for by montmorillonite and other kinds of clay. Subsequent\nobservations by the Viking lander support the identification of windblown clays on Mars.\nNow, A. Banin and J. Rishpon have found that they can reproduce some of the key features\n- those resembling photosynthesis as well as those resembling respiration of the\n\u2018successful\u2019 Viking microbiology experiments if in laboratory experiments they substitute\nsuch clays for the Martian soil. The clays have a complex active surface, given to absorbing\nand releasing gases and to catalyzing chemical reactions. It is too soon to say that all the\nViking microbiology results can be explained by inorganic chemistry, but such a result\nwould no longer be surprising. The clay hypothesis hardly excludes life on Mars, but it\ncertainly carries us far enough to say that there is no compelling evidence for microbiology\non Mars.\n\nEven so, the results of Banin and Rishpon are of great biological importance\nbecause they show that in the absence of life there can be a kind of soil chemistry that does\nsome of the same things life does. On the Earth before life, there may already have been\nchemical processes resembling respiration and photosynthesis cycling in the soil, perhaps\nto be incorporated by life once it arose. In addition, we know that montmorillonite clays are\na potent catalyst for combining amino acids into longer chain molecules resembling\nproteins. The clays of the primitive Earth may have been the forge of life, and the\nchemistry of contemporary Mars may provide essential clues to the origin and early history\nof life on our planet.\n\nThe Martian surface exhibits many impact craters, each named after a person,\nusually a scientist. Crater Vishniac lies appropriately in the Antarctic region of Mars.\nVishniac did not claim that there had to be life on Mars, merely that it was possible, and\nthat it was extraordinarily important to know if it was there. If life on Mars exists, we will\nhave a unique opportunity to test the generality of our form of fife. And if there is no life on\nMars, a planet rather like the Earth, we must understand why - because in that case, as\nVishniac stressed, we have the classic scientific confrontation of the experiment and the\ncontrol.\n\nThe finding that the Viking microbiology results can be explained by clays, that\nthey need not imply life, helps to resolve another mystery: the Viking organic chemistry\nexperiment showed not a hint of organic matter in the Martian soil. If there is life on Mars,\nwhere are the dead bodies? No organic molecules could be found - no building blocks of\nproteins and nucleic acids, no simple hydrocarbons, nothing of the stuff of life on Earth.\nThis is not necessarily a contradiction, because the Viking microbiology experiments are a\nthousand times more sensitive (per equivalent carbon atom) than the Viking chemistry\nexperiments, and seem to detect organic matter synthesized in the Martian soil. But this\ndoes not leave much margin. Terrestrial soil is loaded with the organic remains of once-\nliving organisms; Martian soil has less organic matter than the surface of the Moon. If we\nheld to the life hypothesis, we might suppose that the dead bodies have been destroyed by\nthe chemically reactive, oxidizing surface of Mars - like a germ in a bottle of hydrogen\nperoxide; or that there is life, but of a kind in which organic chemistry plays a less central\nrole than it does in life on Earth.\n\nBut this last alternative seems to me to be special pleading: I am, reluctantly, a self-\nconfessed carbon chauvinist. Carbon is abundant in the Cosmos. It makes marvelously\n\ncomplex molecules, good for life. I am also a water chauvinist. Water makes an ideal\nsolvent system for organic chemistry to work in and stays liquid over a wide range of\ntemperatures. But sometimes I wonder. Could my fondness for these materials have\nsomething to do with the fact that I am made chiefly of them? Are we carbon- and water-\nbased because those materials were abundant on the Earth at the time of the origin of life?\nCould life elsewhere - on Mars, say - be built of different stuff?\n\nIam a collection of water, calcium and organic molecules called Carl Sagan. You\nare a collection of almost identical molecules with a different collective label. But is that\nall? Is there nothing in here but molecules? Some people find this idea somehow\ndemeaning to human dignity. For myself, I find it elevating that our universe permits the\nevolution of molecular machines as intricate and subtle as we.\n\nBut the essence of life is not so much the atoms and simple molecules that make us\nup as the way in which they are put together. Every now and then we read that the\nchemicals which constitute the human body cost ninety-seven cents or ten dollars or some\nsuch figure; it is a little depressing to find our bodies valued so little. However, these\nestimates are for human beings reduced to our simplest possible components. We are made\nmostly of water, which costs almost nothing; the carbon is costed in the form of coal; the\ncalcium in our bones as chalk; the nitrogen in our proteins as air (cheap also); the iron in\nour blood as rusty nails. If we did not know better, we might be tempted to take all the\natoms that make us up, mix them together in a big container and stir. We can do this as\nmuch as we want. But in the end all we have is a tedious mixture of atoms. How could we\nhave expected anything else?\n\nHarold Morowitz has calculated what it would cost to put together the correct\nmolecular constituents that make up a human being by buying the molecules from chemical\nsupply houses. The answer turns out to be about ten million dollars, which should make us\nall feel a little better. But even then we could not mix those chemicals together and have a\nhuman being emerge from the jar. That is far beyond our capability and will probably be so\nfor a very long period of time. Fortunately, there are other less expensive but still highly\nreliable methods of making human beings.\n\nI think the lifeforms on many worlds will consist, by and large, of the same atoms\nwe have here, perhaps even many of the same basic molecules, such as proteins and nucleic\nacids - but put together in unfamiliar ways. Perhaps organisms that float in dense planetary\natmospheres will be very much like us in their atomic composition, except they might not\nhave bones and therefore not need much calcium. Perhaps elsewhere some solvent other\nthan water is used. Hydrofluoric acid might serve rather well, although there is not a great\ndeal of fluorine in the Cosmos; hydrofluoric acid would do a great deal of damage to the\nkind of molecules that make us up, but other organic molecules, paraffin waxes, for\nexample, are perfectly stable in its presence. Liquid ammonia would make an even better\nsolvent system, because ammonia is very abundant in the Cosmos. But it is liquid only on\nworlds much colder than the Earth or Mars. Ammonia is ordinarily a gas on Earth, as water\nis on Venus. Or perhaps there are living things that do not have a solvent system at all -\nsolid-state life, where there are electrical signals propagating rather than molecules floating\nabout.\n\nBut these ideas do not rescue the notion that the Viking lander experiments indicate\nlife on Mars. On that rather Earth-like world, with abundant carbon and water, life, if it\nexists, should be based on organic chemistry. The organic chemistry results, like the\nimaging and microbiology results, are all consistent with no life in the fine particles of\n\nChryse and Utopia in the late 1970\u2019s. Perhaps some millimeters beneath the rocks (as in the\nAntarctic dry valleys), or elsewhere on the planet, or in some earlier, more clement time.\nBut not where and when we looked.\n\nThe Viking exploration of Mars is a mission of major historical importance, the first\nserious search for what other kinds of life may be, the first survival of a functioning\nspacecraft for more than an hour or so on any other planet (Viking 1 has survived for\nyears), the source of a rich harvest of data on the geology, seismology, mineralogy,\nmeteorology and half a dozen other sciences of another world. How should we follow up\non these spectacular advances? Some scientists want to send an automatic device that\nwould land, acquire soil samples, and return them to Earth, where they could be examined\nin great detail in the large sophisticated laboratories of Earth rather than in the limited\nmicrominiaturized laboratories that we are able to send to Mars. In this way most of the\nambiguities of the Viking microbiology experiments could be resolved. The chemistry and\nmineralogy of the soil could be determined; rocks could be broken open to search for\nsubsurface life; hundreds of tests for organic chemistry and life could be performed,\nincluding direct microscopic examination, under a wide range of conditions. We could even\nuse Vishniac\u2019s scoring techniques. Although it would be fairly expensive, such a mission is\nprobably within our technological capability.\n\nHowever, it carries with it a novel danger: back-contamination. If we wish on Earth\nto examine samples of Martian soil for microbes, we must, of course, not sterilize the\nsamples beforehand. The point of the expedition is to bring them back alive. But what then?\nMight Martian microorganisms returned to Earth pose a public health hazard? The Martians\nof H. G. Wells and Orson Welles, preoccupied with the suppression of Bournemouth and\nJersey City, never noticed until too late that their immunological defenses were unavailing\nagainst the microbes of Earth. Is the converse possible? This is a serious and difficult issue.\nThere may be no micromartians. If they exist, perhaps we can eat a kilogram of them with\nno ill effects. But we are not sure, and the stakes are high. If we wish to return unsterilized\nMartian samples to Earth, we must have a containment procedure that is stupefyingly\nreliable. There are nations that develop and stockpile bacteriological weapons. They seem\nto have an occasional accident, but they have not yet, so far as I know, produced global\npandemics. Perhaps Martian samples can be safely returned to Earth. But I would want to\nbe very sure before considering a returned-sample mission.\n\nThere is another way to investigate Mars and the full range of delights and\ndiscoveries this heterogeneous planet holds for us. My most persistent emotion in working\nwith the Viking lander pictures was frustration at our immobility. I found myself\nunconsciously urging the spacecraft at least to stand on its tiptoes, as if this laboratory,\ndesigned for immobility, were perversely refusing to manage even a little hop. How we\nlonged to poke that dune with the sample arm, look for life beneath that rock, see if that\ndistant ridge was a crater rampart. And not so very far to the southeast, I knew, were the\nfour sinuous channels of Chryse. For all the tantalizing and provocative character of the\nViking results, I know a hundred places on Mars which are far more interesting than our\nlanding sites. The ideal tool is a roving vehicle carrying on advanced experiments,\nparticularly in imaging, chemistry and biology. Prototypes of such rovers are under\ndevelopment by NASA. They know on their own how to go over rocks, how not to fall\ndown ravines, how to get out of tight spots. It is within our capability to land a rover on\nMars that could scan its surroundings, see the most interesting place in its field of view and,\nby the same time tomorrow, be there. Every day a new place, a complex, winding traverse\n\nover the varied topography of this appealing planet.\n\nSuch a mission would reap enormous scientific benefits, even if there is no life on\nMars. We could wander down the ancient river valleys, up the slopes of one of the great\nvolcanic mountains, along the strange stepped terrain of the icy polar terraces, or muster a\nclose approach to the beckoning pyramids of Mars.* Public interest in such a mission\nwould be sizable. Every day a new set of vistas would arrive on our home television\nscreens. We could trace the route, ponder the findings, suggest new destinations. The\njourney would be long, the rover obedient to radio commands from Earth. There would be\nplenty of time for good new ideas to be incorporated into the mission plan. A billion people\ncould participate in the exploration of another world.\n\n* The largest are 3 kilometers across at the base, and 1 kilometer high - much larger than the\npyramids of Sumer, Egypt or Mexico on Earth. They seem eroded and ancient, and are, perhaps, only small\nmountains, sandblasted for ages. But they warrant, I think, a careful look.\n\nThe surface area of Mars is exactly as large as the land area of the Earth. A\nthorough reconnaissance will clearly occupy us for centuries. But there will be a time when\nMars is all explored; a time after robot aircraft have mapped it from aloft, a time after\nrovers have combed the surface, a time after samples have been returned safely to Earth, a\ntime after human beings have walked the sands of Mars. What then? What shall we do with\nMars?\n\nThere are so many examples of human misuse of the Earth that even phrasing this\nquestion chills me. If there is life on Mars, I believe we should do nothing with Mars. Mars\nthen belongs to the Martians, even if the Martians are only microbes. The existence of an\nindependent biology on a nearby planet is a treasure beyond assessing, and the preservation\nof that life must, I think, supersede any other possible use of Mars. However, suppose Mars\nis lifeless. It is not a plausible source of raw materials: the freightage from Mars to Earth\nwould be too expensive for many centuries to come. But might we be able to live on Mars?\nCould we in some sense make Mars habitable?\n\nA lovely world, surely, but there is - from our parochial point of view - much wrong\nwith Mars, chiefly the low oxygen abundance, the absence of liquid water, and the high\nultraviolet flux. (The low temperatures do not pose an insuperable obstacle, as the year-\nround scientific stations in Antarctica demonstrate.) All of these problems could be solved\nif we could make more air. With higher atmospheric pressures, liquid water would be\npossible. With more oxygen we might breathe the atmosphere, and ozone would form to\nshield the surface from solar ultraviolet radiation. The sinuous channels, stacked polar\nplates and other evidence suggest that Mars once had such a denser atmosphere. Those\ngases are unlikely to have escaped from Mars. They are, therefore, on the planet\nsomewhere. Some are chemically combined with the surface rocks. Some are in subsurface\nice. But most may be in the present polar ice caps.\n\nTo vaporize the caps, we must heat them; perhaps we could dust them with a dark\npowder, heating them by absorbing more sunlight, the opposite of what we do to the Earth\nwhen we destroy forests and grasslands. But the surface area of the caps is very large. The\nnecessary dust would require 1,200 Saturn 5 rocket boosters to be transported from Earth to\nMars; even then, the winds might blow the dust off the polar caps. A better way would be\nto devise some dark material able to make copies of itself, a little dusky machine which we\ndeliver to Mars and which then goes about reproducing itself from indigenous materials all\n\nover the polar caps. There is a category of such machines. We call them plants. Some are\nvery hardy and resilient. We know that at least some terrestrial microbes can survive on.\nMars. What is necessary is a program of artificial selection and genetic engineering of dark\nplants - perhaps lichens - that could survive the much more severe Martian environment. If\nsuch plants could be bred, we might imagine them being seeded on the vast expanse of the\nMartian polar ice caps, taking root, spreading, blackening the ice caps, absorbing sunlight,\nheating the ice, and releasing the ancient Martian atmosphere from its long captivity. We\nmight even imagine a kind of Martian Johnny Appleseed, robot or human, roaming the\nfrozen polar wastes in an endeavor that benefits only the generations of humans to come.\n\nThe general concept is called terraforming: the changing of an alien landscape into\none more suitable for human beings. In thousands of years humans have managed to\nperturb the global temperature of the Earth by only about one degree through greenhouse\nand albedo changes, although at the present rate of burning fossil fuels and destroying\nforests and grasslands we can now change the global temperature by another degree in only\na century or two. These and other considerations suggest that a time scale for a significant\nterraforming of Mars is probably hundreds to thousands of years. In a future time of greatly\nadvanced technology we might wish not only to increase the total atmospheric pressure and\nmake liquid water possible but also to carry liquid water from the melting polar caps to the\nwarmer equatorial regions. There is, of course, a way to do it. We would build canals.\n\nThe melting surface and subsurface ice would be transported by a great canal\nnetwork. But this is precisely what Percival Lowell, not a hundred years ago, mistakenly\nproposed was in fact happening on Mars. Lowell and Wallace both understood that the\ncomparative inhospitability of Mars was due to the scarcity of water. If only a network of\ncanals existed, the lack would be remedied, the habitability of Mars would become\nplausible. Lowell\u2019s observations were made under extremely difficult seeing conditions.\nOthers, like Schiaparelli, had already observed something like the canals; they were called\ncanali before Lowell began his lifelong love affair with Mars. Human beings have a\ndemonstrated talent for self-deception when their emotions are stirred, and there are few\nnotions more stirring than the idea of a neighboring planet inhabited by intelligent beings.\n\nThe power of Lowell\u2019s idea may, just possibly, make it a kind of premonition. His\ncanal network was built by Martians. Even this may be an accurate prophecy: If the planet\never is terraformed, it will be done by human beings whose permanent residence and\nplanetary affiliation is Mars. The Martians will be us.\n",

This is one of the most\nnoble and exalted questions in the study of Nature.\n- Albertus Magnus, thirteenth century\n\nIn the first ages of the world, the islanders either thought themselves to be the only\ndwellers upon the earth, or else if there were any other, yet they could not possibly\nconceive how they might have any commerce with them, being severed by the deep\nand broad sea, but the aftertimes found out the invention of ships . . . So, perhaps,\nthere may be some other means invented for a conveyance to the Moone... We\nhave not now any Drake or Columbus to undertake this voyage, or any Daedalus to\ninvent a conveyance through the aire. However I doubt not but that time who is still\nthe father of new truths, and hath revealed unto us many things which our ancestors\nwere ignorant of, will also manifest to our posterity that which we now desire but\ncannot know.\n\n- John Wilkins, The Discovery of a World in the Moone, 1638\n\nWe may mount from this dull Earth; and viewing it from on high, consider whether\nNature has laid out all her cost and finery upon this small speck of Dirt. So, like\nTravellers into other distant countries, we shall be better able to judge of what\u2019s\ndone at home, know how to make a true estimate of, and set its own value upon\nevery thing. We shall be less apt to admire what this World calls great, shall nobly\ndespise those Trifles the generality of Men set their Affections on, when we know\nthat there are a multitude of such Earths inhabited and adomn\u2019d as well as our own.\n- Christiaan Huygens, The Celestial Worlds Discovered, c. 1690\n\nThis is the time when humans have begun to sail the sea of space. The modern ships that\nply the Keplerian trajectories to the planets are unmanned. They are beautifully constructed,\nsemi-intelligent robots exploring unknown worlds. Voyages to the outer solar system are\ncontrolled from a single place on the planet Earth, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) of\nthe National Aeronautics and Space Administration in Pasadena, California.\n\nOn July 9, 1979, a spacecraft called Voyager 2 encountered the Jupiter system. It\nhad been almost two years sailing through interplanetary space. The ship is made of\nmillions of separate parts assembled redundantly, so that if some component fails, others\nwill take over its responsibilities. The spacecraft weighs 0.9 tons and would fill a large\nliving room. Its mission takes it so far from the Sun that it cannot be powered by solar\nenergy, as other spacecraft are. Instead, Voyager relies on a small nuclear power plant,\ndrawing hundreds of watts from the radioactive decay of a pellet of plutonium. Its three\nintegrated computers and most of its housekeeping functions - for example, its temperature-\ncontrol system - are localized in its middle. It receives commands from Earth and radios its\nfindings back to Earth through a large antenna, 3.7 meters in diameter. Most of its scientific\ninstruments are on a scan platform, which tracks Jupiter or one of its moons as the\nspacecraft hurtles past. There are many scientific instruments - ultraviolet and infrared\n\nspectrometers, devices to measure charged particles and magnetic fields and the radio\nemission from Jupiter - but the most productive have been the two television cameras,\ndesigned to take tens of thousands of pictures of the planetary islands in the outer solar\nsystem.\n\nJupiter is surrounded by a shell of invisible but extremely dangerous high-energy\ncharged particles. The spacecraft must pass through the outer edge of this radiation belt to\nexamine Jupiter and its moons close up, and to continue its mission to Saturn and beyond.\nBut the charged particles can damage the delicate instruments and fry the electronics.\nJupiter is also surrounded by a ring of solid debris, discovered four months earlier by\nVoyager 1, which Voyager 2 had to traverse. A collision with a small boulder could have\nsent the spacecraft tumbling wildly out of control, its antenna unable to lock on the Earth,\nits data lost forever. Just before Encounter, the mission controllers were restive. There were\nsome alarms and emergencies, but the combined intelligence of the humans on Earth and\nthe robot in space circumvented disaster.\n\nLaunched on August 20, 1977, it moved on an arcing trajectory past the orbit of\nMars, through the asteroid belt, to approach the Jupiter system and thread its way past the\nplanet and among its fourteen or so moons. Voyager\u2019s passage by Jupiter accelerated it\ntowards a close encounter with Saturn. Saturn\u2019s gravity will propel it on to Uranus. After\nUranus it will plunge on past Neptune, leaving the solar system, becoming an interstellar\nspacecraft, fated to roam forever the great ocean between the stars.\n\nThese voyages of exploration and discovery are the latest in a long series that have\ncharacterized and distinguished human history. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries you\ncould travel from Spain to the Azores in a few days, the same time it takes us now to cross\nthe channel from the Earth to the Moon. It took then a few months to traverse the Atlantic\nOcean and reach what was called the New World, the Americas. Today it takes a few\nmonths to cross the ocean of the inner solar system and make planet-fall on Mars or Venus,\nwhich are truly and literally now worlds awaiting us. In the seventeenth and eighteenth\ncenturies you could travel from Holland to China in a year or two, the time it has taken\nVoyager to travel from Earth to Jupiter.* The annual costs were, relatively, more then than\nnow, but in both cases less than 1 percent of the appropriate Gross National Product. Our\npresent spaceships, with their robot crews, are the harbingers, the vanguards of future\nhuman expeditions to the planets. We have traveled this way before.\n\n* Or, to make a different comparison, a fertilized egg takes as long to wander from the Fallopian\ntubes and implant itself in the uterus as Apollo 11 took to journey to the Moon; and as long to develop into a\nfull-term infant as Viking took on its trip to Mars. The normal human lifetime is longer than Voyager will\ntake to venture beyond the orbit of Pluto.\n\nThe fifteenth through seventeenth centuries represent a major turning point in our\nhistory. It then became clear that we could venture to all parts of our planet. Plucky sailing\nvessels from half a dozen European nations dispersed to every ocean. There were many\nmotivations for these journeys: ambition, greed, national pride, religious fanaticism, prison\npardons, scientific curiosity, the thirst for adventure and the unavailability of suitable\nemployment in Estremadura. These voyages worked much evil as well as much good. But\nthe net result has been to bind the Earth together, to decrease provincialism, to unify the\nhuman species and to advance powerfully our knowledge of our planet and ourselves.\n\nEmblematic of the epoch of sailing-ship exploration and discovery is the\n\nrevolutionary Dutch Republic of the seventeenth century. Having recently declared its\nindependence from the powerful Spanish Empire, it embraced more fully than any other\nnation of its time the European Enlightenment. It was a rational, orderly, creative society.\nBut because Spanish ports and vessels were closed to Dutch shipping, the economic\nsurvival of the tiny republic depended on its ability to construct, man and deploy a great\nfleet of commercial sailing vessels.\n\nThe Dutch East India Company, a joint governmental and private enterprise, sent\nships to the far corners of the world to acquire rare commodities and resell them at a profit\nin Europe. Such voyages were the life blood of the Republic. Navigational charts and maps\nwere classified as state secrets. Ships often embarked with sealed orders. Suddenly the\nDutch were present all over the planet. The Barents Sea in the Arctic Ocean and Tasmania\nin Australia are named after Dutch sea captains. These expeditions were not merely\ncommercial exploitations, although there was plenty of that. There were powerful elements\nof scientific adventure and the zest for discovery of new lands, new plants and animals,\nnew people; the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake.\n\nThe Amsterdam Town Hall reflects the confident and secular self-image of\nseventeenth-century Holland. It took shiploads of marble to build. Constantijn Huygens, a\npoet and diplomat of the time, remarked that the Town Hall dispelled \u2018the Gothic squint\nand squalor.\u2019 In the Town Hall to this day, there is a statue of Atlas supporting the heavens,\nfestooned with constellations. Beneath is Justice, brandishing a golden sword and scales,\nstanding between Death and Punishment, and treading underfoot Avarice and Envy, the\ngods of the merchants. The Dutch, whose economy was based on private profit,\nnevertheless understood that the unrestrained pursuit of profit posed a threat to the nation\u2019s\nsoul.\n\nA less allegorical symbol may be found under Atlas and Justice, on the floor of the\nTown Hall. It is a great inlaid map, dating from the late seventeenth or early eighteenth\ncenturies, reaching from West Africa to the Pacific Ocean. The whole world was Holland\u2019s\narena. And on this map, with disarming modesty the Dutch omitted themselves, using only\nthe old Latin name Belgium for their part of Europe.\n\nIna typical year many ships set sail halfway around the world. Down the west coast\nof Africa, through what they called the Ethiopian Sea, around the south coast of Africa,\nwithin the Straits of Madagascar, and on past the southern tip of India they sailed, to one\nmajor focus of their interests, the Spice Islands, present-day Indonesia. Some expeditions\njourneyed from there to a land named New Holland, and today called Australia. A few\nventured through the Straits of Malacca, past the Philippines, to China. We know from a\nmid-seventeenth-century account of an \u2018Embassy from the East India Company of the\nUnited Provinces of the Netherlands, to the Grand Tartar, Cham, Emperor of China.\u2019 The\nDutch burgers, ambassadors and sea captains stood wide-eyed in amazement, face to face\nwith another civilization in the Imperial City of Peking.*\n\n* We even know what gifts they brought the Court. The Empress was presented with \u2018six little chests\nof divers pictures.\u2019 And the Emperor received \u2018two fardels of cinnamon.\u201d\n\nNever before or since has Holland been the world power it was then. A small\ncountry, forced to live by its wits, its foreign policy contained a strong pacifist element.\nBecause of its tolerance for unorthodox opinions, it was a haven for intellectuals who were\nrefugees from censorship and through control elsewhere in Europe - much as the United\n\nStates benefited enormously in the 1930\u2019s by the exodus of intellectuals from Nazi-\ndominated Europe. So seventeenth-century Holland was the home of the great Jewish\nphilosopher Spinoza, whom Einstein admired; of Descartes, a pivotal figure in the history\nof mathematics and philosophy; and of John Locke, a political scientist who influenced a\ngroup of philosophically inclined revolutionaries named Paine, Hamilton, Adams, Franklin\nand Jefferson. Never before or since has Holland been graced by such a galaxy of artists\nand scientists, philosophers and mathematicians. This was the time of the master painters\nRembrandt and Vermeer and Frans Hals; of Leeuwenhoek, the inventor of the microscope;\nof Grotius, the founder of international law; of Willebrord Snellius, who discovered the law\nof the refraction of light.\n\nIn the Dutch tradition of encouraging freedom of thought, the University of Leiden\noffered a professorship to an Italian scientist named Galileo, who had been forced by the\nCatholic Church under threat of torture to recant his heretical view that the Earth moved\nabout the Sun and not vice versa.* Galileo had close ties with Holland, and his first\nastronomical telescope was an improvement of a spyglass of Dutch design. With it he\ndiscovered sunspots, the phases of Venus, the craters of the Moon, and the four large\nmoons of Jupiter now called, after him, the Galilean satellites. Galileo\u2019s own description of\nhis ecclesiastical travails is contained in a letter he wrote in the year 1615 to the Grand\nDuchess Christina:\n\nSome years ago as Your Serene Highness well knows, I discovered in the heavens\nmany things that had not been seen before our own age. The novelty of these things,\nas well as some consequences which followed from them in contradiction to the\nphysical notions commonly held among academic philosophers, stirred up against\nme no small number of professors [many of them ecclesiastics] - as if I had placed\nthese things in the sky with my own hands in order to upset Nature and overturn the\nsciences. They seemed to forget that the increase of known truths stimulates the\ninvestigation, establishment, and growth of the arts.**\n\n* In 1979 Pope John Paul II cautiously proposed reversing the condemnation of Galileo done 346\nyears earlier by the \u201cHoly Inquisition.\u201d\n\n** The courage of Galileo (and Kepler) in promoting the heliocentric hypothesis was not evident in\nthe actions of others, even those residing in less fanatically doctrinal parts of Europe. For example, in a letter\ndated April 1634, Ren\u00e9 Descartes, then living in Holland, wrote:\n\nDoubtless you know that Galileo was recently censured by the Inquisitors of the Faith, and that his\nviews about the movement of the Earth were condemned as heretical. I must tell you that all the\nthings I explained in my treatise, which included the doctrine of the movement of the Earth, were so\ninterdependent that it is enough to discover that one of them is false to know that all the arguments I\nwas using are unsound. Though I thought they were based on very certain and evident proofs, I\nwould not wish, for anything in the world, to maintain them against the authority of the Church . . . I\ndesire to live in peace and to continue the life I have begun under the motto to live well you must live\nunseen.\n\nThe connection between Holland as an exploratory power and Holland as an intellectual\nand cultural center was very strong. The improvement of sailing ships encouraged\ntechnology of all kinds. People enjoyed working with their hands. Inventions were prized.\nTechnological advance required the freest possible pursuit of knowledge, so Holland\n\nbecame the leading publisher and bookseller in Europe, translating works written in other\nlanguages and permitting the publication of works proscribed elsewhere. Adventures into\nexotic lands and encounters with strange societies shook complacency, challenged thinkers\nto reconsider the prevailing wisdom and showed that ideas that had been accepted for\nthousands of years - for example, on geography - were fundamentally in error. In a time\nwhen kings and emperors ruled much of the world, the Dutch Republic was governed, more\nthan any other nation, by the people. The openness of the society and its encouragement of\nthe life of the mind, its material well-being and its commitment to the exploration and\nutilization of new worlds generated a joyful confidence in the human enterprise.*\n\n* This exploratory tradition may account for the fact that Holland has, to this day, produced far more\nthan its per capita share of distinguished astronomers, among them Gerard Peter Kuiper, who in the 1940\u2019s\nand 1950\u2019s was the world\u2019s only full-time planetary astrophysicist. The subject was then considered by most\nprofessional astronomers to be at least slightly disreputable, tainted with Lowellian excesses. I am grateful to\nhave been Kuiper\u2019s student.\n\nIn Italy, Galileo had announced other worlds, and Giordano Bruno had speculated\non other lifeforms. For this they had been made to suffer brutally. But in Holland, the\nastronomer Christiaan Huygens, who believed in both, was showered with honors. His\nfather was Constantijn Huygens, a master diplomat of the age, a litterateur, poet, composer,\nmusician, close friend and translator of the English poet John Donne, and the head of an\narchetypical great family. Constantijn admired the painter Rubens, and \u2018discovered\u2019 a\nyoung artist named Rembrandt van Rijn, in several of whose works he subsequently\nappears. After their first meeting, Descartes wrote of him: \u2018I could not believe that a single\nmind could occupy itself with so many things, and equip itself so well in all of them.\u2019 The\nHuygens home was filled with goods from all over the world. Distinguished thinkers from\nother nations were frequent guests. Growing up in this environment, the young Christiaan\nHuygens became simultaneously adept in languages, drawing, law, science, engineering,\nmathematics and music. His interests and allegiances were broad. \u201cThe world is my\ncountry,\u2019 he said, \u2018science my religion.\u2019\n\nLight was a motif of the age: the symbolic enlightenment of freedom of thought and\nreligion, of geographical discovery; the light that permeated the paintings of the time,\nparticularly the exquisite work of Vermeer; and light as an object of scientific inquiry, as in\nSnell\u2019s study of refraction, Leeuwenhoek\u2019s invention of the microscope and Huygens\u2019 own\nwave theory of light.* These were all connected activities, and their practitioners mingled\nfreely. Vermeer\u2019s interiors are characteristically filled with nautical artifacts and wall maps.\nMicroscopes were drawing-room curiosities. Leeuwenhoek was the executor of Vermeer\u2019s\nestate and a frequent visitor at the Huygens home in Hofwijck.\n\n* Isaac Newton admired Christiaan Huygens and thought him \u2018the most elegant mathematician\u2019 of\ntheir time, and the truest follower of the mathematical tradition of the ancient Greeks - then, as now, a great\ncompliment. Newton believed, in part because shadows had sharp edges, that light behaved as if it were a\nstream of tiny particles. He thought that red light was composed of the largest particles and violet the\nsmallest. Huygens argued that instead light behaved as if it were a wave propagating in a vacuum, as an ocean\nwave does in the sea - which is why we talk about the wavelength and frequency of light. Many properties of\nlight, including diffraction, are naturally explained by the wave theory, and in subsequent years Huygens\u2019\nview carried the day. But in 1905, Einstein showed that the particle theory of light could explain the\nphotoelectric effect, the ejection of electrons from a metal upon exposure to a beam of light. Modern quantum\nmechanics combines both ideas, and it is customary today to think of light as behaving in some circumstances\n\nas a beam of particles and in others as a wave. This wave-particle dualism may not correspond readily to our\ncommon-sense notions, but it is in excellent accord with what experiments have shown light really does.\nThere is something mysterious and stirring in this marriage of opposites, and it is fitting that Newton and\nHuygens, bachelors both, were the parents of our modern understanding of the nature of light.\n\nLeeuwenhoek\u2019s microscope evolved from the magnifying glasses employed by\ndrapers to examine the quality of cloth. With it he discovered a universe in a drop of water:\nthe microbes, which he described as \u2018animalcules\u2019 and thought \u2018cute\u2019. Huygens had\ncontributed to the design of the first microscopes and himself made many discoveries with\nthem. Leeuwenhoek and Huygens were among the first people ever to see human sperm\ncells, a prerequisite for understanding human reproduction. To explain how\nmicroorganisms slowly develop in water previously sterilized by boiling, Huygens\nproposed that they were small enough to float through the air and reproduced on alighting\nin water. Thus he established an alternative to spontaneous generation - the notion that life\ncould arise, in fermenting grape juice or rotting meat, entirely independent of preexisting\nlife. It was not until the time of Louis Pasteur, two centuries later, that Huygens\u2019\nspeculation was proved correct. The Viking search for life on Mars can be traced in more\nways than one back to Leeuwenhoek and Huygens. They are also the grandfathers of the\ngerm theory of disease, and therefore of much of modern medicine. But they had no\npractical motives in mind. They were merely tinkering in a technological society.\n\nThe microscope and telescope, both developed in early seventeenth-century\nHolland, represent an extension of human vision to the realms of the very small and the\nvery large. Our observations of atoms and galaxies were launched in this time and place.\nChristiaan Huygens loved to grind and polish lenses for astronomical telescopes and\nconstructed one five meters long. His discoveries with the telescope would by themselves\nhave ensured his place in the history of human accomplishment. In the footsteps of\nEratosthenes, he was the first person to measure the size of another planet. He was also the\nfirst to speculate that Venus is completely covered with clouds; the first to draw a surface\nfeature on the planet Mars (a vast dark windswept slope called Syrtis Major); and by\nobserving the appearance and disappearance of such features as the planet rotated, the first\nto determine that the Martian day was, like ours, roughly twenty-four hours long. He was\nthe first to recognize that Saturn was surrounded by a system of rings which nowhere\ntouches the planet.* And he was the discoverer of Titan, the largest moon of Saturn and, as\nwe now know, the largest moon in the solar system - a world of extraordinary interest and\npromise. Most of these discoveries he made in his twenties. He also thought astrology was\nnonsense.\n\n* Galileo discovered the rings, but had no idea what to make of them. Through his early\nastronomical telescope, they seemed to be two projections symmetrically attached to Saturn, resembling, he\nsaid in some bafflement, ears.\n\nHuygens did much more. A key problem for marine navigation in this age was the\ndetermination of longitude. Latitude could easily be determined by the stars - the farther\nsouth you were, the more southern constellations you could see. But longitude required\nprecise timekeeping. An accurate shipboard clock would tell the time in your home port;\nthe rising and setting of the Sun and stars would specify the local shipboard time; and the\ndifference between the two would yield your longitude. Huygens invented the pendulum\nclock (its principle had been discovered earlier by Galileo), which was then employed,\n\nalthough not fully successfully, to calculate position in the midst of the great ocean. His\nefforts introduced an unprecedented accuracy in astronomical and other scientific\nobservations and stimulated further advances in nautical clocks. He invented the spiral\nbalance spring still used in some watches today; made fundamental contributions to\nmechanics - e.g., the calculation of centrifugal force - and, from a study of the game of\ndice, to the theory of probability. He improved the air pump, which was later to\nrevolutionize the mining industry, and the \u2018magic lantern,\u2019 the ancestor of the slide\nprojector. He also invented something called the \u2018gunpowder engine,\u2019 which influenced the\ndevelopment of another machine, the steam engine.\n\nHuygens was delighted that the Copernican view of the Earth as a planet in motion\naround the Sun was widely accepted even by the ordinary people in Holland. Indeed, he\nsaid, Copernicus was acknowledged by all astronomers except those who \u2018were a bit slow-\nwitted or under the superstitions imposed by merely human authority.\u2019 In the Middle Ages,\nChristian philosophers were fond of arguing that, since the heavens circle the Earth once\nevery day, they can hardly be infinite in extent; and therefore an infinite number of worlds,\nor even a large number of them (or even one other of them), is impossible. The discovery\nthat the Earth is turning rather than the sky moving had important implications for the\nuniqueness of the Earth and the possibility of life elsewhere. Copernicus held that not just\nthe solar system but the entire universe was heliocentric, and Kepler denied that the stars\nhave planetary systems. The first person to make explicit the idea of a large - indeed, an\ninfinite - number of other worlds in orbit about other suns seems to have been Giordano\nBruno. But others thought that the plurality of worlds followed immediately from the ideas\nof Copernicus and Kepler and found themselves aghast. In the early seventeenth century,\nRobert Merton contended that the heliocentric hypothesis implied a multitude of other\nplanetary systems, and that this was an argument of the sort called reductio ad absurdum\n(Appendix 1), demonstrating the error of the initial assumption. He wrote, in an argument\nwhich may once have seemed withering,\n\nFor if the firmament be of such an incomparable bigness, as these Copernical giants\nwill have it... , so vast and full of innumerable stars, as being infinite in extent . . .\nwhy may we not suppose . . . those infinite stars visible in the firmament to be so\nmany suns, with particular fixed centers; to have likewise their subordinate planets,\nas the sun hath his dancing still around him? . . . And so, in consequence, there are\ninfinite habitable worlds; what hinders? . . . these and suchlike insolent and bold\nattempts, prodigious paradoxes, inferences must needs follow, if it once be granted\nwhich . .. Kepler. . . and others maintain of the Earth\u2019s motion.\n\nBut the Earth does move. Merton, if he lived today, would be obliged to deduce \u2018infinite,\nhabitable worlds.\u2019 Huygens did not shrink from this conclusion; he embraced it gladly:\nAcross the sea of space the stars are other suns. By analogy with our solar system, Huygens\nreasoned that those stars should have their own planetary systems and that many of these\nplanets might be inhabited: \u2018Should we allow the planets nothing but vast deserts .. . and\ndeprive them of all those creatures that more plainly bespeak their divine architect, we\nshould sink them below the Earth in beauty and dignity, a thing very unreasonable.\u2019*\n\n* A few others had held similar opinions. In his Harmonice Mundi Kepler remarked \u2018it was Tycho\nBrahe\u2019s opinion concerning that bare wilderness of globes that it does not exist fruitlessly but is filled with\n\nThese ideas were set forth in an extraordinary book bearing the triumphant title The\nCelestial Worlds Discover\u2019d: Conjectures Concerning the Inhabitants, Plants and\nProductions of the Worlds in the Planets. Composed shortly before Huygens died in 1690,\nthe work was admired by many, including Czar Peter the Great, who made it the first\nproduct of Western science to be published in Russia. The book is in large part about the\nnature or environments of the planets. Among the figures in the finely rendered first edition\nis one in which we see, to scale, the Sun and the giant planets Jupiter and Saturn. They are,\ncomparatively, rather small. There is also an etching of Saturn next to the Earth: Our planet\nis a tiny circle.\n\nBy and large Huygens imagined the environments and inhabitants of other planets\nto be rather like those of seventeenth-century Earth. He conceived of \u2018planetarians\u2019 whose\n\u2018whole Bodies, and every part of them, may be quite distinct and different from ours . . . \u2018tis\na very ridiculous opinion .. . that it is impossible a rational Soul should dwell in any other\nshape than ours.\u2019 You could be smart, he was saying, even if you looked peculiar. But he\nthen went on to argue that they would not look very peculiar - that they must have hands\nand feet and walk upright, that they would have writing and geometry, and that Jupiter has\nits four Galilean satellites to provide a navigational aid for the sailors in the Jovian oceans.\nHuygens was, of course, a citizen of his time. Who of us is not? He claimed science as his\nreligion and then argued that the planets must be inhabited because otherwise God had\nmade worlds for nothing. Because he lived before Darwin, his speculations about\nextraterrestrial life are innocent of the evolutionary perspective. But he was able to develop\non observational grounds something akin to the modern cosmic perspective:\n\nWhat a wonderful and Amazing scheme have we here of the magnificent vastness\nof the universe . .. So many Suns, so many Earths . . . and every one of them\nstock\u2019d with so many Herbs, Trees, and Animals, adorn\u2019d with so many Seas and\nMountains! . .. And how must our Wonder and Admiration be increased when we\nconsider the prodigious Distance and Multitude of the Stars.\n\nThe Voyager spacecraft are the lineal descendants of those sailing-ship voyages of\nexploration, and of the scientific and speculative tradition of Christiaan Huygens. The\nVoyagers are caravels bound for the stars, and on the way exploring those worlds that\nHuygens knew and loved so well.\n\nOne of the main commodities returned on those voyages of centuries ago were\ntravelers\u2019 tales,* stories of alien lands and exotic creatures that evoked our sense of wonder\nand stimulated future exploration. There had been accounts of mountains that reached the\nsky; of dragons and sea monsters; of everyday eating utensils made of gold; of a beast with\nan arm for a nose; of people who thought the doctrinal disputes among Protestants,\nCatholics, Jews and Muslims to be silly; of a black stone that burned; of headless humans\nwith mouths in their chests; of sheep that grew on trees. Some of these stories were true;\nsome were lies. Others had a kernel of truth, misunderstood or exaggerated by the explorers\nor their informants. In the hands of Voltaire, say, or Jonathan Swift, these accounts\nstimulated a new perspective on European society, forcing a reconsideration of that insular\nworld.\n\n* Such tales are an ancient human tradition; many of them have had, from the beginning of\nexploration, a cosmic motif. For example, the fifteenth-century explorations of Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India,\nArabia and Africa by the Ming Dynasty Chinese were described by Fei Hsin, one of the participants, in a\npicture book prepared for the Emperor, as \u2018The Triumphant Visions of the Starry Raft.\u2019 Unfortunately, the\npictures - although not the text - have been lost.\n\nModern Voyagers also return travelers\u2019 tales, tales of a world shattered like a crystal\nsphere; a globe where the ground is covered, pole to pole, with what looks like a network of\ncobwebs; tiny moons shaped like potatoes; a world with an underground ocean; a land that\nsmells of rotten eggs and looks like a pizza pie, with lakes of molten sulfur and volcanic\neruptions ejecting smoke directly into space; a planet called Jupiter that dwarfs our own -\nso large that 1,000 Earths would fit within it.\n\nThe Galilean satellites of Jupiter are each almost as big as the planet Mercury. We\ncan measure their sizes and masses and so calculate their density, which tells us something\nabout the composition of their interiors. We find that the inner two, lo and Europa, have a\ndensity as high as rock. The outer two, Ganymede and Callisto, have a much lower density,\nhalfway between rock and ice. But the mixture of ice and rocks within these outer moons\nmust contain, as do rocks on Earth, traces of radioactive minerals, which heat their\nsurroundings. There is no effective way for this heat, accumulated over billions of years, to\nreach the surface and be lost to space, and the radioactivity inside Ganymede and Callisto\nmust therefore melt their icy interiors. We anticipate underground oceans of slush and\nwater in these moons, a hint, before we have ever seen the surfaces of the Galilean satellites\nclose up, that they may be very different one from another. When we do look closely,\nthrough the eyes of Voyager, this prediction is confirmed. They do not resemble each other.\nThey are different from any worlds we have ever seen before.\n\nThe Voyager 2 spacecraft will never return to Earth. But its scientific findings, its\nepic discoveries, its travelers\u2019 tales, do return. Take July 9, 1979, for instance. At 8:04\nPacific Standard Time on this morning, the first pictures of a new world, called Europa\nafter an old one, were received on Earth.\n\nHow does a picture from the outer solar system get to us? Sunlight shines on Europa\nin its orbit around Jupiter and is reflected back to space, where some of it strikes the\nphosphors of the Voyager television cameras, generating an image. The image is read by\nthe Voyager computers, radioed back across the immense intervening distance of half a\nbillion kilometers to a radio telescope, a ground station on the Earth. There is one in Spain,\none in the Mojave Desert of Southern California and one in Australia. (On that July\nmorning in 1979 it was the one in Australia that was pointed toward Jupiter and Europa.) It\nthen passes the information via a communications satellite in Earth orbit to Southern\nCalifornia, where it is transmitted by a set of microwave relay towers to a computer at the\nJet Propulsion Laboratory, where it is processed. The picture is fundamentally like a\nnewspaper wirephoto, made of perhaps a million individual dots, each a different shade of\ngray, so fine and close together that at a distance the constituent dots are invisible. We see\nonly their cumulative effect. The information from the spacecraft specifies how bright or\ndark each dot is to be. After processing, the dots are then stored on a magnetic disc,\nsomething like a phonograph record. There are some eighteen thousand photographs taken\nin the Jupiter system by Voyager | that are stored on such magnetic discs, and an\nequivalent number for Voyager 2. Finally, the end product of this remarkable set of links\nand relays is a thin piece of glossy paper, in this case showing the wonders of Europa,\n\nrecorded, processed and examined for the first time in human history on July 9, 1979.\n\nWhat we saw on such pictures was absolutely astonishing. Voyager 1 obtained\nexcellent imagery of the other three Galilean satellites of Jupiter. But not Europa. It was left\nfor Voyager 2 to acquire the first close-up pictures of Europa, where we see things that are\nonly a few kilometers across. At first glance, the place looks like nothing so much as the\ncanal network that Percival Lowell imagined to adorn Mars, and that, we now know from\nspace vehicle exploration, does not exist at all. We see on Europa an amazing, intricate\nnetwork of intersecting straight and curved lines. Are they ridges - that is, raised? Are they\ntroughs - that is, depressed? How are they made? Are they part of a global tectonic system,\nproduced perhaps by fracturing of an expanding or contracting planet? Are they connected\nwith plate tectonics on the Earth? What light do they shed on the other satellites of the\nJovian system? At the moment of discovery, the vaunted technology has produced\nsomething astonishing. But it remains for another device, the human brain, to figure it out.\nEuropa turns out to be as smooth as a billiard ball despite the network of lineations. The\nabsence of impact craters may be due to the heating and flow of surface ice upon impact.\nThe lines are grooves or cracks, their origin still being debated long after the mission.\n\nIf the Voyager missions were manned, the captain would keep a ship\u2019s log, and the\nlog, a combination of the events of Voyagers 1 and 2, might read something like this:\n\nDay 1 After much concern about provisions and instruments, which seemed to be\nmalfunctioning, we successfully lifted off from Cape Canaveral on our long journey\nto the planets and the stars.\n\nDay 2 A problem in the deployment of the boom that supports the science scan\nplatform. If the problem is not solved, we will lose most of our pictures and other\n\nscientific data.\n\nDay 13 We have looked back and taken the first photograph ever obtained of the\nEarth and Moon as worlds together in space. A pretty pair.\n\nDay 150 Engines fired nominally for a mid-course trajectory correction.\n\nDay 170 Routine housekeeping functions. An uneventful few months.\n\nDay 185 Successful calibration images taken of Jupiter.\n\nDay 207 Boom problem solved, but failure of main radio transmitter. We have\nmoved to back-up transmitter. If it fails, no one on Earth will ever hear from us\nagain.\n\nDay 215 We cross the orbit of Mars. The planet itself is on the other side of the Sun.\nDay 295 We enter the asteroid belt. There are many large, tumbling boulders here,\nthe shoals and reefs of space. Most of them are uncharted. Lookouts posted. We\n\nhope to avoid a collision.\n\nDay 475 We safely emerge from the main asteroid belt, happy to have survived.\n\nDay 570 Jupiter is becoming prominent in the sky. We can now make out finer\ndetail on it than the largest telescopes on Earth have ever obtained.\n\nDay 615 The colossal weather systems and changing clouds of Jupiter, spinning in\nspace before us, have us hypnotized. The planet is immense. It is more than twice as\nmassive as all the other planets put together. There are no mountains, valleys,\nvolcanoes, rivers; no boundaries between land and air; just a vast ocean of dense gas\nand floating clouds - a world without a surface. Everything we can see on Jupiter is\nfloating in its sky.\n\nDay 630 The weather on Jupiter continues to be spectacular. This ponderous world\nspins on its axis in less than ten hours. Its atmospheric motions are driven by the\nrapid rotation, by sunlight and by the heat bubbling and welling up from its interior.\n\nDay 640 The cloud patterns are distinctive and gorgeous. They remind us a little of\nVan Gogh\u2019s Starry Night, or works by William Blake or Edvard Munch. But only a\nlittle. No artist ever painted like this because none of them ever left our planet. No\npainter trapped on Earth ever imagined a world so strange and lovely.\n\nWe observe the multicolored belts and bands of Jupiter close up. The white\nbands are thought to be high clouds, probably ammonia crystals; the brownish-\ncolored belts, deeper and hotter places where the atmosphere is sinking. The blue\nplaces are apparently deep holes in the overlying clouds through which we see clear\nsky.\n\nWe do not know the reason for the reddish-brown color of Jupiter. Perhaps it\nis due to the chemistry of phosphorus or sulfur. Perhaps it is due to complex\nbrightly colored organic molecules produced when ultraviolet light from the Sun\nbreaks down the methane, ammonia, and water in the Jovian atmosphere and the\nmolecular fragments recombine. In that case, the colors of Jupiter speak to us of\nchemical events that four billion years ago back on Earth led to the origin of life.\n\nDay 647 The Great Red Spot. A great column of gas reaching high above the\nadjacent clouds, so large that it could hold half a dozen Earths. Perhaps it is red\nbecause it is carrying up to view the complex molecules produced or concentrated at\ngreater depth. It may be a great storm system a million years old.\n\nDay 650 Encounter. A day of wonders. We successfully negotiate the treacherous\nradiation belts of Jupiter with only one instrument, the photopolarimeter, damaged.\nWe accomplish the ring plane crossing and suffer no collisions with the particles\nand boulders of the newly discovered rings of Jupiter. And wonderful images of\nAmalthea, a tiny, red, oblong world that lives in the heart of the radiation belt; of\nmulticolored Io; of the linear markings on Europa; the cobwebby features of\nGanymede; the great multi-ringed basin on Callisto. We round Callisto and pass the\norbit of Jupiter 13, the outermost of the planet\u2019s known moons. We are outward\nbound.\n\nDay 662 Our particle and field detectors indicate that we have left the Jovian\n\nradiation belts. The planet\u2019s gravity has boosted our speed. We are free of Jupiter at\nlast and sail again the sea of space.\n\nDay 874 A loss of the ship\u2019s lock on the star Canopus - in the lore of constellations\nthe rudder of a sailing vessel. It is our rudder too, essential for the ship\u2019s orientation\nin the dark of space, to find our way through this unexplored part of the cosmic\nocean. Canopus lock reacquired. The optical sensors seem to have mistaken Alpha\nand Beta Centauri for Canopus. Next port of call, two years hence: the Saturn\nsystem.\n\nOf all the travelers\u2019 tales returned by Voyager, my favorites concern the discoveries\nmade on the innermost Galilean satellite, Io.* Before Voyager, we were aware of\nsomething strange about Io. We could resolve few features on its surface, but we knew it\nwas red - extremely red, redder than Mars, perhaps the reddest object in the solar system.\nOver a period of years something seemed to be changing on it, in infrared light and perhaps\nin its radar reflection properties. We also know that partially surrounding Jupiter in the\norbital position of Io was a great doughnut-shaped tube of atoms, sulfur and sodium and\npotassium, material somehow lost from Io.\n\n* Frequently pronounced \u2018eye-oh\u2019 by Americans, because this is the preferred enunciation in the\nOxford English Dictionary. But the British have no special wisdom here. The word is of Eastern\nMediterranean origin and is pronounced throughout the rest of Europe, correctly, as \u2018ee-oh.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen Voyager approached this giant moon we found a strange multicolored surface\nunlike any other in the solar system. Io is near the asteroid belt. It must have been\nthoroughly pummeled throughout its history by falling boulders. Impact craters must have\nbeen made. Yet there were none to be seen. Accordingly, there had to be some process on\nJo that was extremely efficient in rubbing craters out or filling them in. The process could\nnot be atmospheric, since Io\u2019s atmosphere has mostly escaped to space because of its low\ngravity. It could not be running water; Io\u2019s surface is far too cold. There were a few places\nthat resembled the summits of volcanoes. But it was hard to be sure.\n\nLinda Morabito, a member of the Voyager Navigation Team responsible for\nkeeping Voyager precisely on its trajectory, was routinely ordering a computer to enhance\nan image of the edge of Io, to bring out the stars behind it. To her astonishment, she saw a\nbright plume standing off in the darkness from the satellite\u2019s surface and soon determined\nthat the plume was in exactly the position of one of the suspected volcanoes. Voyager had\ndiscovered the first active volcano beyond the Earth. We know now of nine large\nvolcanoes, spewing out gas and debris, and hundreds - perhaps thousands - of extinct\nvolcanoes on Io. The debris, rolling and flowing down the sides of the volcanic mountains,\narching in great jets over the polychrome landscape, is more than enough to cover the\nimpact craters. We are looking at a fresh planetary landscape, a surface newly hatched.\nHow Galileo and Huygens would have marveled.\n\nThe volcanoes of Io were predicted, before they were discovered, by Stanton Peale\nand his co-workers, who calculated the tides that would be raised in the solid interior of Io\nby the combined pulls of the nearby moon Europa and the giant planet Jupiter. They found\nthat the rocks inside Io should have been melted, not by radioactivity but by tides; that\nmuch of the interior of Io should be liquid. It now seems likely that the volcanoes of Io are\n\ntapping an underground ocean of liquid sulfur, melted and concentrated near the surface.\nWhen solid sulfur is heated a little past the normal boiling point of water, to about 115\u00b0C, it\nmelts and changes color. The higher the temperature, the deeper the color. If the molten\nsulfur is quickly cooled, it retains its color. The pattern of colors that we see on Io\nresembles closely what we would expect if rivers and torrents and sheets of molten sulfur\nwere pouring out of the mouths of the volcanoes: black sulfur, the hottest, near the top of\nthe volcano; red and orange, including the rivers, nearby; and great plains covered by\nyellow sulfur at a greater remove. The surface of Io is changing on a time scale of months.\nMaps will have to be issued regularly, like weather reports on Earth. Those future explorers\non Io will have to keep their wits about them.\n\nThe very thin and tenuous atmosphere of Io was found by Voyager to be composed\nmainly of sulfur dioxide. But this thin atmosphere can serve a useful purpose, because it\nmay be just thick enough to protect the surface from the intense charged particles in the\nJupiter radiation belt in which Io is embedded. At night the temperature drops so low that\nthe sulfur dioxide should condense out as a kind of white frost; the charged particles would\nthen immolate the surface, and it would probably be wise to spend the nights just slightly\nunderground.\n\nThe great volcanic plumes of Io reach so high that they are close to injecting their\natoms directly into the space around Jupiter. The volcanoes are the probable source of the\ngreat doughnut-shaped ring of atoms that surrounds Jupiter in the position of Io\u2019s orbit.\nThese atoms, gradually spiraling in toward Jupiter, should coat the inner moon Amalthea\nand may be responsible for its reddish coloration. It is even possible that the material\noutgassed from Io contributes, after many collisions and condensations, to the ring system\nof Jupiter.\n\nA substantial human presence on Jupiter itself is much more difficult to imagine -\nalthough I suppose great balloon cities permanently floating in its atmosphere are a\ntechnological possibility for the remote future. As seen from the near sides of Io or Europa,\nthat immense and variable world fills much of the sky, hanging aloft, never to rise or set,\nbecause almost every satellite in the solar system keeps a constant face to its planet, as the\nMoon does to the Earth. Jupiter will be a source of continuing provocation and excitement\nfor the future human explorers of the Jovian moons.\n\nAs the solar system condensed out of interstellar gas and dust, Jupiter acquired most\nof the matter that was not ejected into interstellar space and did not fall inward to form the\nSun. Had Jupiter been several dozen times more massive, the matter in its interior would\nhave undergone thermonuclear reactions, and Jupiter would have begun to shine by its own\nlight. The largest planet is a star that failed. Even so, its interior temperatures are\nsufficiently high that it gives off about twice as much energy as it receives from the Sun. In\nthe infrared part of the spectrum, it might even be correct to consider Jupiter a star. Had it\nbecome a star in visible light, we would today inhabit a binary or double-star system, with\ntwo suns in our sky, and the nights would come more rarely - a commonplace, I believe, in\ncountless solar systems throughout the Milky Way Galaxy. We would doubtless think the\ncircumstances natural and lovely.\n\nDeep below the clouds of Jupiter the weight of the overlying layers of atmosphere\nproduces pressures much higher than any found on Earth, pressures so great that electrons\nare squeezed off hydrogen atoms, producing a remarkable substance, liquid metallic\nhydrogen - a physical state that has never been observed in terrestrial laboratories, because\nthe requisite pressures have never been achieved on Earth. (There is some hope that\n\nmetallic hydrogen is a superconductor at moderate temperatures. If it could be\nmanufactured on Earth, it would work a revolution in electronics.) In the interior of Jupiter,\nwhere the pressures are about three million times the atmospheric pressure at the surface of\nthe Earth, there is almost nothing but a great dark sloshing ocean of metallic hydrogen. But\nat the very core of Jupiter there may be a lump of rock and iron, an Earth-like world in a\npressure vise, hidden forever at the center of the largest planet.\n\nThe electrical currents in the liquid metal interior of Jupiter may be the source of the\nplanet\u2019s enormous magnetic field, the largest in the solar system, and of its associated belt\nof trapped electrons and protons. These charged particles are ejected from the Sun in the\nsolar wind and captured and accelerated by Jupiter\u2019s magnetic field. Vast numbers of them\nare trapped far above the clouds and are condemned to bounce from pole to pole until by\nchance they encounter some high-altitude atmospheric molecule and are removed from the\nradiation belt. Io moves in an orbit so close to Jupiter that it plows through the midst of this\nintense radiation, creating cascades of charged particles, which in turn generate violent\nbursts of radio energy. (They may also influence eruptive processes on the surface of Io.) It\nis possible to predict radio bursts from Jupiter with better reliability than weather forecasts\non Earth, by computing the position of Io.\n\nThat Jupiter is a source of radio emission was discovered accidentally in the 1950\u2019s,\nthe early days of radio astronomy. Two young Americans, Bernard Burke and Kenneth\nFranklin, were examining the sky with a newly constructed and for that time very sensitive\nradio telescope. They were searching the cosmic radio background - that is, radio sources\nfar beyond our solar system. To their surprise, they found an intense and previously\nunreported source that seemed to correspond to no prominent star, nebula or galaxy. What\nis more, it gradually moved, with respect to the distant stars, much faster than any remote\nobject could.* After finding no likely explanation of all this in their charts of the distant\nCosmos, they one day stepped outside the observatory and looked up at the sky with the\nnaked eye to see if anything interesting happened to be there. Bemusedly they noted an\nexceptionally bright object in the right place, which they soon identified as the planet\nJupiter. This accidental discovery is, incidentally, entirely typical of the history of science.\n\n* Because the speed of light is finite (see Chapter 8).\n\nEvery evening before Voyager 1\u2019s encounter with Jupiter, I could see that giant\nplanet twinkling in the sky, a sight our ancestors have enjoyed and wondered at for a\nmillion years. And on the evening of Encounter, on my way to study the Voyager data\narriving at JPL, I thought that Jupiter would never be the same, never again just a point of\nlight in the night sky, but would forever after be a place to be explored and known. Jupiter\nand its moons are a kind of miniature solar system of diverse and exquisite worlds with\nmuch to teach us.\n\nIn composition and in many other respects Saturn is similar to Jupiter, although\nsmaller. Rotating once every ten hours, it exhibits colorful equatorial banding, which is,\nhowever, not so prominent as Jupiter\u2019s. It has a weaker magnetic field and radiation belt\nthan Jupiter and a more spectacular set of circumplanetary rings. And it also is surrounded\nby a dozen or more satellites.\n\nThe most interesting of the moons of Saturn seems to be Titan, the largest moon in\nthe solar system and the only one with a substantial atmosphere. Prior to the encounter of\nVoyager 1 with Titan in November 1980, our information about Titan was scanty and\n\ntantalizing. The only gas known unambiguously to be present was methane, CHa,\ndiscovered by G. P. Kuiper. Ultraviolet light from the sun converts methane to more\ncomplex hydrocarbon molecules and hydrogen gas. The hydrocarbons should remain on\nTitan, covering the surface with a brownish tarry organic sludge, something like that\nproduced in experiments on the origin of life on Earth. The lightweight hydrogen gas\nshould, because of Titan\u2019s low gravity, rapidly escape to space by a violent process known\nas \u2018blowoff,\u2019 which should carry the methane and other atmospheric constituents with it.\nBut Titan has an atmospheric pressure at least as great as that of the planet Mars. Blowoff\ndoes not seem to be happening. Perhaps there is some major and as yet undiscovered\natmospheric constituent - nitrogen, for example - which keeps the average molecular\nweight of the atmosphere high and prevents blowoff. Or perhaps blowoff is happening, but\nthe gases lost to space are being replenished by others released from the satellite\u2019s interior.\nThe bulk density of Titan is so low that there must be a vast supply of water and other ices,\nprobably including methane, which are at unknown rates being released to the surface by\ninternal heating.\n\nWhen we examine Titan through the telescope we see a barely perceptible reddish\ndisc. Some observers have reported variable white clouds above that disc - most likely,\nclouds of methane crystals. But what is responsible for the reddish coloration? Most\nstudents of Titan agree that complex organic molecules are the most likely explanation. The\nsurface temperature and atmospheric thickness are still under debate. There have been some\nhints of an enhanced surface temperature due to an atmospheric greenhouse effect. With\nabundant organic molecules on its surface and in its atmosphere, Titan is a remarkable and\nunique denizen of the solar system. The history of our past voyages of discovery suggests\nthat Voyager and other spacecraft reconnaissance missions will revolutionize our\nknowledge of this place.\n\nThrough a break in the clouds of Titan, you might glimpse Saturn and its rings, their\npale yellow color diffused by the intervening atmosphere. Because the Saturn system is ten\ntimes farther from the Sun than is the Earth, the sunshine on Titan is only 1 percent as\nintense as we are accustomed to, and the temperatures should be far below the freezing\npoint of water even with a sizable atmospheric greenhouse effect. But with abundant\norganic matter, sunlight and perhaps volcanic hot spots, the possibility of life on Titan*\ncannot be readily dismissed. In that very different environment, it would, of course, have to\nbe very different from life on Earth. There is no strong evidence either for or against life on\nTitan. It is merely possible. We are unlikely to determine the answer to this question\nwithout landing instrumented space vehicles on the Titanian surface.\n\n* The view of Huygens, who discovered Titan in 1655, was: \u2018Now can any one look upon, and\ncompare these Systems [of Jupiter and Saturn] together, without being amazed at the vast Magnitude and\nnoble Attendants of these two Planets, in respect of this little pitiful Earth of ours? Or can they force\nthemselves to think, that the wise Creator has disposed of all his Animals and Plants here, has furnished and\nadorn\u2019d this Spot only, and has left all those Worlds bare and destitute of Inhabitants, who might adore and\nworship Him; or that all those prodigious Bodies were made only to twinkle to, and be studied by some few\nperhaps of us poor Fellows?\u2019 Since Saturn moves around the Sun once every thirty years, the length of the\nseasons on Saturn and its moons is much longer than on Earth. Of the presumed inhabitants of the moons of\nSaturn, Huygens therefore wrote: \u2018It is impossible but that their way of living must be very different from\nours, having such tedious Winters.\u201d\n\nTo examine the individual particles composing the rings of Saturn, we must\n\napproach them closely, for the particles are small - snowballs and ice chips and tiny\ntumbling bonsai glaciers, a meter or so across. We know they are composed of water ice,\nbecause the spectral properties of sunlight reflected off the rings match those of ice in the\nlaboratory measurements. To approach the particles in a space vehicle, we must slow down,\nso that we move along with them as they circle Saturn at some 45,000 miles per hour; that\nis, we must be in orbit around Saturn ourselves, moving at the same speed as the particles.\nOnly then will we be able to see them individually and not as smears or streaks.\n\nWhy is there not a single large satellite instead of a ring system around Saturn? The\ncloser a ring particle is to Saturn, the faster its orbital speed (the faster it is \u2018falling\u2019 around\nthe planet - Kepler\u2019s third law); the inner particles are streaming past the outer ones (the\n\u2018passing lane\u2019 as we see it is always to the left). Although the whole assemblage is tearing\naround the planet itself at some 20 kilometers per second, the relative speed of two adjacent\nparticles is very low, only some few centimeters per minute. Because of this relative\nmotion, the particles can never stick together by their mutual gravity. As soon as they try,\ntheir slightly different orbital speeds pull them apart. If the rings were not so close to\nSaturn, this effect would not be so strong, and the particles could accrete, making small\nsnowballs and eventually growing into satellites. So it is probably no coincidence that\noutside the rings of Saturn there is a system of satellites varying in size from a few hundred\nkilometers across to Titan, a giant moon nearly as large as the planet Mars. The matter in\nall the satellites and the planets themselves may have been originally distributed in the form\nof rings, which condensed and accumulated to form the present moons and planets.\n\nFor Saturn as for Jupiter, the magnetic field captures and accelerates the charged\nparticles of the solar wind. When a charged particle bounces from one magnetic pole to the\nother, it must cross the equatorial plane of Saturn. If there is a ring particle in the way, the\nproton or electron is absorbed by this small snowball. As a result, for both planets, the rings\nclear out the radiation belts, which exist only interior and exterior to the particle rings. A\nclose moon of Jupiter or Saturn will likewise gobble up radiation belt particles, and in fact\none of the new moons of Saturn was discovered in just this way: Pioneer 11 found an\nunexpected gap in the radiation belts, caused by the sweeping up of charged particles by a\npreviously unknown moon.\n\nThe solar wind trickles into the outer solar system far beyond the orbit of Saturn.\nWhen Voyager reaches Uranus and the orbits of Neptune and Pluto, if the instruments are\nstill functioning, they will almost certainly sense its presence, the wind between the worlds,\nthe top of the Sun\u2019s atmosphere blown outward toward the realm of the stars. Some two or\nthree times farther from the Sun than Pluto is, the pressure of the interstellar protons and\nelectrons becomes greater than the minuscule pressure there exerted by the solar wind. That\nplace, called the heliopause, is one definition of the outer boundary of the Empire of the\nSun. But the Voyager spacecraft will plunge on, penetrating the heliopause sometime in the\nmiddle of the twenty-first century, skimming through the ocean of space, never to enter\nanother solar system, destined to wander through eternity far from the stellar islands and to\ncomplete its first circumnavigation of the massive center of the Milky Way a few hundred\nmillion years from now. We have embarked on epic voyages.\n",

I\nknew my immediate neighborhood intimately, every apartment building, pigeon coop,\nbackyard, front stoop, empty lot, elm tree, ornamental railing, coal chute and wall for\nplaying Chinese handball, among which the brick exterior of a theater called the Loew\u2019s\nStillwell was of superior quality. I knew where many people lived: Bruno and Dino, Ronald\nand Harvey, Sandy, Bernie, Danny, Jackie and Myra. But more than a few blocks away,\nnorth of the raucous automobile traffic and elevated railway on 86th Street, was a strange\nunknown territory, off-limits to my wanderings. It could have been Mars for all I knew.\nEven with an early bedtime, in winter you could sometimes see the stars. I would\nlook at them, twinkling and remote, and wonder what they were. I would ask older children\nand adults, who would only reply, \u2018They\u2019re lights in the sky, kid.\u2019 I could see they were\nlights in the sky. But what were they? Just small hovering lamps? Whatever for? I felt a\nkind of sorrow for them: a commonplace whose strangeness remained somehow hidden\n\nfrom my incurious fellows. There had to be some deeper answer.\n\nAs soon as I was old enough, my parents gave me my first library card. | think the\nlibrary was on 85th Street, an alien land. Immediately, I asked the librarian for something\non stars. She returned with a picture book displaying portraits of men and women with\nnames like Clark Gable and Jean Harlow. I complained, and for some reason then obscure\nto me, she smiled and found another book - the right kind of book. I opened it breathlessly\nand read until I found it. The book said something astonishing, a very big thought. It said\nthat the stars were suns, only very far away. The Sun was a star, but close up.\n\nImagine that you took the Sun and moved it so far away that it was just a tiny\ntwinkling point of light. How far away would you have to move it? I was innocent of the\nnotion of angular size. I was ignorant of the inverse square law for light propagation. I had\nnot a ghost of a chance of calculating the distance to the stars. But I could tell that if the\nstars were suns, they had to be very far away - farther away than 85th Street, farther away\nthan Manhattan, farther away, probably, than New Jersey. The Cosmos was much bigger\nthan I had guessed.\n\nLater I read another astonishing fact. The Earth, which includes Brooklyn, is a\nplanet, and it goes around the Sun. There are other planets. They also go around the Sun;\nsome are closer to it and some are farther away. But the planets do not shine by their own\nlight, as the Sun does. They merely reflect light from the Sun. If you were a great distance\naway, you would not see the Earth and the other planets at all; they would be only faint\nluminous points, lost in the glare of the Sun. Well, then, I thought, it stood to reason that\nthe other stars must have planets too, ones we have not yet detected, and some of those\nother planets should have life (why not?), a kind of life probably different from life as we\nknow it, life in Brooklyn. So I decided I would be an astronomer, learn about the stars and\nplanets and, if I could, go and visit them.\n\nIt has been my immense good fortune to have parents and some teachers who\nencouraged this odd ambition and to live in this time, the first moment in human history\nwhen we are, in fact, visiting other worlds and engaging in a deep reconnaissance of the\nCosmos. If I had been born in a much earlier age, no matter how great my dedication, I\nwould not have understood what the stars and planets are. I would not have known that\nthere were other suns and other worlds. This is one of the great secrets, wrested from\nNature through a million years of patient observation and courageous thinking by our\nancestors.\n\nWhat are the stars? Such questions are as natural as an infant\u2019s smile. We have\nalways asked them. What is different about our time is that at last we know some of the\nanswers. Books and libraries provide a ready means for finding out what those answers are.\nIn biology there is a principle of powerful if imperfect applicability called recapitulation: in\nour individual embryonic development we retrace the evolutionary history of the species.\nThere is, I think, a kind of recapitulation that occurs in our individual intellectual\ndevelopments as well. We unconsciously retrace the thoughts of our remote ancestors.\nImagine a time before science, a time before libraries. Imagine a time hundreds of\nthousands of years ago. We were then just about as smart, just as curious, just as involved\nin things social and sexual. But the experiments had not yet been done, the inventions had\nnot yet been made. It was the childhood of genus Homo. Imagine the time when fire was\nfirst discovered. What were human lives like then? What did out ancestors believe the stars\nwere? Sometimes, in my fantasies, I imagine there was someone who thought like this:\n\nWe eat berries and roots. Nuts and leaves. And dead animals. Some animals we\n\nfind. Some we kill. We know which foods are good and which are dangerous. If we taste\nsome foods we are struck down, in punishment for eating them. We did not mean to do\nsomething bad. But foxglove or hemlock can kill you. We love our children and our friends.\nWe warn them of such foods.\n\nWhen we hunt animals, then also can we be killed. We can be gored. Or trampled.\nOr eaten. What animals do means life and death for us: how they behave, what tracks they\nleave, their times for mating and giving birth, their times for wandering. We must know\nthese things. We tell our children. They will tell their children.\n\nWe depend on animals. We follow them - especially in winter when there are few\nplants to eat. We are wandering hunters and gatherers. We call ourselves the hunterfolk.\n\nMost of us fall asleep under the sky or under a tree or in its branches. We use\nanimal skins for clothing: to keep us warm, to cover our nakedness and sometimes as a\nhammock. When we wear the animal skins we feel the animal\u2019s power. We leap with the\ngazelle. We hunt with the bear. There is a bond between us and the animals. We hunt and\neat the animals. They hunt and eat us. We are part of one another.\n\nWe make tools and stay alive. Some of us are experts at splitting, flaking,\nsharpening and polishing, as well as finding, rocks. Some rocks we tie with animal sinew to\na wooden handle and make an ax. With the ax we strike plants and animals. Other rocks\nare tied to long sticks. If we are quiet and watchful, we can sometimes come close to an\nanimal and stick it with the spear.\n\nMeat spoils. Sometimes we are hungry and try not to notice. Sometimes we mix\nherbs with the bad meat to hide the taste. We fold foods that will not spoil into pieces of\nanimal skin. Or big leaves. Or the shell of a large nut. It is wise to put food aside and carry\nit. If we eat this food too early, some of us will starve later. So we must help one another.\nFor this and many other reasons we have rules. Everyone must obey the rules. We have\nalways had rules. Rules are sacred.\n\nOne day there was a storm, with much lightning and thunder and rain. The little\nones are afraid of storms. And sometimes so am I. The secret of the storm is hidden. The\nthunder is deep and loud; the lightning is brief and bright. Maybe someone very powerful is\nvery angry. It must be someone in the sky, I think.\n\nAfter the storm there was a flickering and crackling in the forest nearby. We went to\nsee. There was a bright, hot, leaping thing, yellow and red. We had never seen such a thing\nbefore. We now call it \u2018flame\u2019. It has a special smell. In a way it is alive: It eats food. It eats\nplants and tree limbs and even whole trees, if you let it. It is strong. But it is not very smart.\nIf all the food is gone, it dies. It will not walk a spear\u2019s throw from one tree to another if\nthere ano food along the way. It cannot walk without eating. But where there is much food,\nit grows and makes many flame children.\n\nOne of us had a brave and fearful thought: to capture the flame, feed it a little, and\nmake it our friend. We found some long branches of hard wood. The flame was eating them,\nbut slowly. We could pick them up by the end that had no flame. If you run fast with a small\nflame, it dies. Their children are weak. We did not run. We walked, shouting good wishes.\n\u2018Do not die,\u2019 we said to the flame. The other hunterfolk looked with wide eyes.\n\nEver after, we have carried it with us. We have a flame mother to feed the flame\nslowly so it does not die of hunger.* Flame is a wonder, and useful too; surely a gift from\npowerful beings. Are they the same as the angry beings in the storm?\n\n* This sense of fire as a living thing, to be protected and cared for, should not be dismissed as a\n\n\u2018primitive\u2019 notion. It is to be found near the root of many modern civilizations. Every home in ancient Greece\nand Rome and among the Brahmans of ancient India had a hearth and a set of prescribed rules for caring for\nthe flame. At night the coals were covered with ashes for insulation; in the morning twigs were added to\nrevive the flame. The death of the flame in the hearth was considered synonymous with the death of the\nfamily. In all three cultures, the hearth ritual was connected with the worship of ancestors. This is the origin\nof the eternal flame, a symbol still widely employed in religious, memorial, political and athletic ceremonials\nthroughout the world.\n\nThe flame keeps us warm on cold nights. It gives us light. It makes holes in the\ndarkness when the Moon is new. We can fix spears at night for tomorrow\u2019s hunt. And if we\nare not tired, even in the darkness we can see each other and talk. Also - a good thing! -\nfire keeps animals away. We can be hurt at night. Sometimes we have been eaten, even by\nsmall animals, hyenas and wolves. Now it is different. Now the flame keeps the animals\nback. We see them baying sofily in the dark, prowling, their eyes glowing in the light of the\nflame. They are frightened of the flame. But we are not frightened. The flame is ours. We\ntake care of the flame. The flame takes care of us.\n\nThe sky is important. It covers us. It speaks to us. Before the time we found the\nflame, we would lie back in the dark and look up at all the points of light. Some points\nwould come together to make a picture in the sky. One of us could see the pictures better\nthan the rest. She taught us the star pictures and what names to call them. We would sit\naround late at night and make up stories about the pictures in the sky: lions, dogs, bears,\nhunterfolk. Other, stranger things. Could they be the pictures of the powerful beings in the\nsky, the ones who make the storms when angry?\n\nMostly, the sky does not change. The same star pictures are there year after year.\nThe Moon grows from nothing to a thin sliver to a round ball, and then back again to\nnothing. When the Moon changes, the women bleed. Some tribes have rules against sex at\ncertain times in the growing and shrinking of the Moon. Some tribes scratch the days of the\nMoon or the days that the women bleed on antler bones. They can plan ahead and obey\ntheir rules. Rules are sacred.\n\nThe stars are very far away. When we climb a hill or a tree they are no closer. And\nclouds come between us and the stars: the stars must be behind the clouds. The Moon, as it\nslowly moves, passes in front of stars. Later you can see that the stars are not harmed. The\nMoon does not eat stars. The stars must be behind the Moon. They flicker. A strange, cold,\nwhite, faraway light. Many of them. All over the sky. But only at night. I wonder what they\nare.\n\nAfter we found the flame, I was sitting near the campfire wondering about the stars.\nSlowly a thought came: The stars are flame, I thought. Then I had another thought: The\nstars are campfires that other hunterfolk light at night. The stars give a smaller light than\ncampfires. So the stars must be campfires very far away. \u2018But,\u2019 they ask me, \u2018how can there\nbe campfires in the sky? Why do the campfires and the hunter people around those flames\nnot fall down at our feet? Why don\u2019t strange tribes drop from the sky?\u2019\n\nThose are good questions. They trouble me. Sometimes I think the sky is half of a\nbig eggshell or a big nutshell. I think the people around those faraway campfires look down\nat us - except for them it seems up - and say that we are in their sky, and wonder why we do\nnot fall up to them, if you see what I mean. But hunterfolk say, \u2018Down is down and up is\nup.\u2019 That is a good answer, too.\n\nThere is another thought that one of us had. His thought is that night is a great\nblack animal skin, thrown up over the sky. There are holes in the skin. We look through the\n\nholes. And we see flame. His thought is not just that there is flame in a few places where we\nsee stars. He thinks there is flame everywhere. He thinks flame covers the whole sky. But\nthe skin hides the flame. Except where there are holes.\n\nSome stars wander. Like the animals we hunt. Like us. If you watch with care over\nmany months, you find they move. There are only five of them, like the fingers on a hand.\nThey wander slowly among the stars. If the campfire thought is true, those stars must be\ntribes of wandering hunterfolk, carrying big fires. But I don\u2019t see how wandering stars can\nbe holes in a skin. When you make a hole, there it is. A hole is a hole. Holes do not wander.\nAlso, I don\u2019t want to be surrounded by a sky of flame. If the skin fell, the night sky would be\nbright - too bright - like seeing flame everywhere. I think a sky of flame would eat us all.\nMaybe there are two kinds of powerful beings in the sky. Bad ones, who wish the flame to\neat us. And good ones who put up the skin to keep the flame away. We must find some way\nto thank the good ones.\n\nI don\u2019t know if the stars are campfires in the sky. Or holes in a skin through which\nthe flame of power looks down on us. Sometimes I think one way. Sometimes 1 think a\ndifferent way. Once I thought there are no campfires and no holes but something else, too\nhard for me to understand.\n\nRest your neck on a log. Your head goes back. Then you can see only the sky. No\nhills, no trees, no hunterfolk, no campfire. Just sky. Sometimes I feel I may fall up into the\nsky. If the stars are campfires, I would like to visit those other hunterfolk - the ones who\nwander. Then I feel good about falling up. But if the stars are holes in a skin, I become\nafraid. 1 don\u2019t want to fall up through a hole and into the flame of power.\n\nI wish I knew which was true. I don\u2019t like not knowing.\n\nIdo not imagine that many members of a hunter/gatherer group had thoughts like\nthese about the stars. Perhaps, over the ages, a few did, but never all these thoughts in the\nsame person. Yet, sophisticated ideas are common in such communities. For example, the\n!Kung* Bushmen of the Kalahari Desert in Botswana have an explanation for the Milky\nWay, which at their latitude is often overhead. They call it \u2018the backbone of night,\u2019 as if the\nsky were some great beast inside which we live. Their explanation makes the Milky Way\nuseful as well as understandable. The !Kung believe the Milky Way holds up the night; that\nif it were not for the Milky Way, fragments of darkness would come crashing down at our\nfeet. It is an elegant idea.\n\n* The exclamation point is a click, made by touching the tongue against the inside of the incisors,\nand simultaneously pronouncing the K.\n\nMetaphors like those about celestial campfires or galactic backbones were\neventually replaced in most human cultures by another idea: The powerful beings in the sky\nwere promoted to gods. They were given names and relatives, and special responsibilities\nfor the cosmic services they were expected to perform. There was a god or goddess for\nevery human concern. Gods ran Nature. Nothing could happen without their direct\nintervention. If they were happy, there was plenty of food, and humans were happy. But if\nsomething displeased the gods - and sometimes it took very little - the consequences were\nawesome: droughts, storms, wars, earthquakes, volcanoes, epidemics. The gods had to be\npropitiated, and a vast industry of priests and oracles arose to make the gods less angry. But\nbecause the gods were capricious, you could not be sure what they would do. Nature was a\nmystery. It was hard to understand the world.\n\nLittle remains of the Heraion on the Aegean isle of Samos, one of the wonders of\nthe ancient world, a great temple dedicated to Hera, who began her career as goddess of the\nsky. She was the patron deity of Samos, playing the same role there as Athena did in\nAthens. Much later she married Zeus, the chief of the Olympian gods. They honeymooned\non Samos, the old stories tell us. The Greek religion explained that diffuse band of light in\nthe night sky as the milk of Hera, squirted from her breast across the heavens, a legend that\nis the origin of the phrase Westerners still use - the Milky Way. Perhaps it originally\nrepresented the important insight that the sky nurtures the Earth; if so, that meaning seems\nto have been forgotten millennia ago.\n\nWeare, almost all of us, descended from people who responded to the dangers of\nexistence by inventing stories about unpredictable or disgruntled deities. For a long time\nthe human instinct to understand was thwarted by facile religious explanations, as in\nancient Greece in the time of Homer, where there were gods of the sky and the Earth, the\nthunderstorm, the oceans and the underworld, fire and time and love and war; where every\ntree and meadow had its dryad and maenad.\n\nFor thousands of years humans were oppressed - as some of us still are - by the\nnotion that the universe is a marionette whose strings are pulled by a god or gods, unseen\nand inscrutable. Then, 2,500 years ago, there was a glorious awakening in Ionia: on Samos\nand the other nearby Greek colonies that grew up among the islands and inlets of the busy\neastern Aegean Sea.* Suddenly there were people who believed that everything was made\nof atoms; that human beings and other animals had sprung from simpler forms; that\ndiseases were not caused by demons or the gods; that the Earth was only a planet going\naround the Sun. And that the stars were very far away.\n\n* As an aid to confusion, Ionia is not in the Ionian Sea; it was named by colonists from the coast of\nthe Ionian Sea.\n\nThis revolution made Cosmos and Chaos. The early Greeks had believed that the\nfirst being was Chaos, corresponding to the phrase in Genesis in the same context, \u2018without\nform\u2019. Chaos created and then mated with a goddess called Night, and their offspring\neventually produced all the gods and men. A universe created from Chaos was in perfect\nkeeping with the Greek belief in an unpredictable Nature run by capricious gods. But in the\nsixth century B.C., in Ionia, a new concept developed, one of the great ideas of the human\nspecies. The universe is knowable, the ancient Ionians argued, because it exhibits an\ninternal order: there are regularities in Nature that permit its secrets to be uncovered. Nature\nis not entirely unpredictable; there are rules even she must obey. This ordered and\nadmirable character of the universe was called Cosmos.\n\nBut why Ionia, why in these unassuming and pastoral landscapes, these remote\nislands and inlets of the Eastern Mediterranean? Why not in the great cities of India or\nEgypt, Babylonia, China or Mesoamerica? China had an astronomical tradition millennia\nold; it invented paper and printing, rockets, clocks, silk, porcelain, and ocean-going navies.\nSome historians argue it was nevertheless too traditionalist a society, too unwilling to adopt\ninnovations. Why not India, an extremely rich, mathematically gifted culture? Because,\nsome historians maintain, of a rigid fascination with the idea of an infinitely old universe\ncondemned to an endless cycle of deaths and rebirths, of souls and universes, in which\nnothing fundamentally new could ever happen. Why not Mayan and Aztec societies, which\nwere accomplished in astronomy and captivated, as the Indians were, by large numbers?\n\nBecause, some historians declare, they lacked the aptitude or impetus for mechanical\ninvention. The Mayans and the Aztecs did not even - except for children\u2019s toys - invent the\nwheel.\n\nThe Ionians had several advantages. Ionia is an island realm. Isolation, even if\nincomplete, breeds diversity. With many different islands, there was a variety of political\nsystems. No single concentration of power could enforce social and intellectual conformity\nin all the islands. Free inquiry became possible. The promotion of superstition was not\nconsidered a political necessity. Unlike many other cultures, the Ionians were at the\ncrossroads of civilizations, not at one of the centers. In Ionia, the Phoenician alphabet was\nfirst adapted to Greek usage and widespread literacy became possible. Writing was no\nlonger a monopoly of the priests and scribes. The thoughts of many were available for\nconsideration and debate. Political power was in the hands of the merchants, who actively\npromoted the technology on which their prosperity depended. It was in the Eastern\nMediterranean that African, Asian, and European civilizations, including the great cultures\nof Egypt and Mesopotamia, met and cross-fertilized in a vigorous and heady confrontation\nof prejudices, languages, ideas and gods. What do you do when you are faced with several\ndifferent gods each claiming the same territory? The Babylonian Marduk and the Greek\nZeus was each considered master of the sky and king of the gods. You might decide that\nMarduk and Zeus were really the same. You might also decide, since they had quite\ndifferent attributes, that one of them was merely invented by the priests. But if one, why not\nboth?\n\nAnd so it was that the great idea arose, the realization that there might be a way to\nknow the world without the god hypothesis; that there might be principles, forces, laws of\nnature, through which the world could be understood without attributing the fall of every\nsparrow to the direct intervention of Zeus.\n\nChina and India and Mesoamerica would, I think, have tumbled to science too, if\nonly they had been given a little more time. Cultures do not develop with identical rhythms\nor evolve in lockstep. They arise at different times and progress at different rates. The\nscientific world view works so well, explains so much and resonates so harmoniously with\nthe most advanced parts of our brains that in time, I think, virtually every culture on the\nEarth, left to its own devices, would have discovered science. Some culture had to be first.\nAs it turned out, Ionia was the place where science was born.\n\nBetween 600 and 400 B.C., this great revolution in human thought began. The key\nto the revolution was the hand. Some of the brilliant Ionian thinkers were the sons of sailors\nand farmers and weavers. They were accustomed to poking and fixing, unlike the priests\nand scribes of other nations, who, raised in luxury, were reluctant to dirty their hands. They\nrejected superstition, and they worked wonders. In many cases we have only fragmentary\nor secondhand accounts of what happened. The metaphors used then may be obscure to us\nnow. There was almost certainly a conscious effort a few centuries later to suppress the new\ninsights. The leading figures in this revolution were men with Greek names, largely\nunfamiliar to us today, but the truest pioneers in the development of our civilization and our\nhumanity.\n\nThe first Ionian scientist was Thales of Miletus, a city in Asia across a narrow\nchannel of water from the island of Samos. He had traveled in Egypt and was conversant\nwith the knowledge of Babylon. It is said that he predicted a solar eclipse. He learned how\nto measure the height of a pyramid from the length of its shadow and the angle of the Sun\nabove the horizon, a method employed today to determine the heights of the mountains of\n\nthe Moon. He was the first to prove geometric theorems of the sort codified by Euclid three\ncenturies later - for example, the proposition that the angles at the base of an isosceles\ntriangle are equal. There is a clear continuity of intellectual effort from Thales to Euclid to\nIsaac Newton\u2019s purchase of the Elements of Geometry at Stourbridge Fair in 1663 (Chapter\n3), the event that precipitated modern science and technology.\n\nThales attempted to understand the world without invoking the intervention of the\ngods. Like the Babylonians, he believed the world to have once been water. To explain the\ndry land, the Babylonians added that Marduk had placed a mat on the face of the waters and\npiled dirt upon it.* Thales held a similar view, but, as Benjamin Farrington said, \u2018left\nMarduk out.\u2019 Yes, everything was once water, but the Earth formed out of the oceans by a\nnatural process - similar, he thought, to the silting he had observed at the delta of the Nile.\nIndeed, he thought that water was a common principle underlying all of matter, just as\ntoday we might say the same of electrons, protons and neutrons, or of quarks. Whether\nThales\u2019 conclusion was correct is not as important as his approach: The world was not\nmade by the gods, but instead was the work of material forces interacting in Nature. Thales\nbrought back from Babylon and Egypt the seeds of the new sciences of astronomy and\ngeometry, sciences that would sprout and grow in the fertile soil of Ionia.\n\n* There is some evidence that the antecedent, early Sumerian creation myths were largely naturalistic\nexplanations, later codified around 1000 B.C. in the Enuma elish (\u2018When on high,\u2019 the first words of the\npoem); but by then the gods had replaced Nature, and the myth offers a theogony, not a cosmogony. The\nEnuma elish is reminiscent of the Japanese and Ainu myths in which an originally muddy cosmos is beaten by\nthe wings of a bird, separating the land from the water. A Fijian creation myth says: \u2018Rokomautu created the\nland. He scooped it up out of the bottom of the ocean in great handfuls and accumulated it in piles here and\nthere. These are the Fiji Islands.\u2019 The distillation of land from water is a natural enough idea for island and\nseafaring peoples.\n\nVery little is known about the personal life of Thales, but one revealing anecdote is\ntold by Aristotle in his Politics:\n\n[Thales] was reproached for his poverty, which was supposed to show that\nphilosophy is of no use. According to the story, he knew by his skill [in interpreting\nthe heavens] while it was yet winter that there would be a great harvest of olives in\nthe coming year; so, having a little money, he gave deposits for the use of all the\nolive-presses in Chios and Miletus, which he hired at a low price because no one\nbid against him. When the harvest time came, and many were wanted all at once, he\nlet them out at any rate which he pleased and made a quantity of money. Thus he\nshowed the world philosophers can easily be rich if they like, but that their ambition\nis of another sort.\n\nHe was also famous as a political sage, successfully urging the Milesians to resist\nassimilation by Croesus, King of Lydia, and unsuccessfully urging a federation of all the\nisland states of Ionia to oppose the Lydians.\n\nAnaximander of Miletus was a friend and colleague of Thales, one of the first\npeople we know of to do an experiment. By examining the moving shadow cast by a\nvertical stick he determined accurately the length of the year and the seasons. For ages men\nhad used sticks to club and spear one another. Anaximander used one to measure time. He\nwas the first person in Greece to make a sundial, a map of the known world and a celestial\n\nglobe that showed the patterns of the constellations. He believed the Sun, the Moon and the\nstars to be made of fire seen through moving holes in the dome of the sky, probably a much\nolder idea. He held the remarkable view that the Earth is not suspended or supported from\nthe heavens, but that it remains by itself at the center of the universe; since it was\nequidistant from all places on the \u2018celestial sphere,\u2019 there was no force that could move it.\n\nHe argued that we are so helpless at birth that, if the first human infants had been\nput into the world on their own, they would immediately have died. From this\nAnaximander concluded that human beings arose from other animals with more self-reliant\nnewborns: He proposed the spontaneous origin of life in mud, the first animals being fish\ncovered with spines. Some descendants of these fishes eventually abandoned the water and\nmoved to dry land, where they evolved into other animals by the transmutation of one form\ninto another. He believed in an infinite number of worlds, all inhabited, and all subject to\ncycles of dissolution and regeneration. \u2018Nor\u2019, as Saint Augustine ruefully complained, \u2018did\nhe, any more than Thales, attribute the cause of all this ceaseless activity to a divine mind.\u2019\n\nIn the year 540 B.C. or thereabouts, on the island of Samos, there came to power a\ntyrant named Polycrates. He seems to have started as a caterer and then gone on to\ninternational piracy. Polycrates was a generous patron of the arts, sciences and engineering.\nBut he oppressed his own people; he made war on his neighbors; he quite rightly feared\ninvasion. So he surrounded his capital city with a massive wall, about six kilometers long,\nwhose remains stand to this day. To carry water from a distant spring through the\nfortifications, he ordered a great tunnel built. A kilometer long, it pierces a mountain. Two\ncuttings were dug from either end which met almost perfectly in the middle. The project\ntook about fifteen years to complete, a testament to the civil engineering of the day and an\nindication of the extraordinary practical capability of the Ionians. But there is another and\nmore ominous side to the enterprise: it was built in part by slaves in chains, many captured\nby the pirate ships of Polycrates.\n\nThis was the time of Theodorus, the master engineer of the age, credited among the\nGreeks with the invention of the key, the ruler, the carpenter\u2019s square, the level, the lathe,\nbronze casting and central heating. Why are there no monuments to this man? Those who\ndreamed and speculated about the laws of Nature talked with the technologists and the\nengineers. They were often the same people. The theoretical and the practical were one.\n\nAbout the same time, on the nearby island of Cos, Hippocrates was establishing his\nfamous medical tradition, now barely remembered because of the Hippocratic oath. It was a\npractical and effective school of medicine, which Hippocrates insisted had to be based on\nthe contemporary equivalent of physics and chemistry.* But it also had its theoretical side.\nIn his book On Ancient Medicine, Hippocrates wrote: \u2018Men think epilepsy divine, merely\nbecause they do not understand it. But if they called everything divine which they do not\nunderstand, why, there would be no end of divine things.\u2019\n\n* And astrology, which was then widely regarded as a science. In a typical passage, Hippocrates\nwrites: \u2018One must also guard against the risings of the stars, especially of the Dog Star [Sirius], then of\nArcturus, and also of the setting of the Pleiades.\u201d\n\nIn time, the Ionian influence and the experimental method spread to the mainland of\nGreece, to Italy, to Sicily. There was once a time when hardly anyone believed in air. They\nknew about breathing, of course, and they thought the wind was the breath of the gods. But\nthe idea of air as a static, material but invisible substance was unimagined. The first\n\nrecorded experiment on air was performed by a physician* named Empedocles, who\nflourished around 450 B.C. Some accounts claim he identified himself as a god. But\nperhaps it was only that he was so clever that others thought him a god. He believed that\nlight travels very fast, but not infinitely fast. He taught that there was once a much greater\nvariety of living things on the Earth, but that many races of beings \u2018must have been unable\nto beget and continue their kind. For in the case of every species that exists, either craft or\ncourage or speed has from the beginning of its existence protected and preserved it.\u2019 In this\nattempt to explain the lovely adaptation of organisms to their environments, Empedocles,\nlike Anaximander and Democritus (see below), clearly anticipated some aspects of\nDarwin\u2019s great idea of evolution by natural selection.\n\n* The experiment was performed in support of a totally erroneous theory of the circulation of the\nblood, but the idea of performing any experiment to probe Nature is the important innovation.\n\nEmpedocles performed his experiment with a household implement people had used\nfor centuries, the so-called clepsydra or \u2018water thief\u2019, which was used as a kitchen ladle. A\nbrazen sphere with an open neck and small holes in the bottom, it is filled by immersing it\nin water. If you pull it out with the neck uncovered, the water pours out of the holes,\nmaking a little shower. But if you pull it out properly, with your thumb covering the neck,\nthe water is retained within the sphere until you lift your thumb. If you try to fill it with the\nneck covered, nothing happens. Some material substance must be in the way of the water.\nWe cannot see such a substance. What could it be? Empedocles argued that it could only be\nair. A thing we cannot see can exert pressure, can frustrate my wish to fill a vessel with\nwater if I were dumb enough to leave my finger on the neck. Empedocles had discovered\nthe invisible. Air, he thought, must be matter in a form so finely divided that it could not be\nseen.\n\nEmpedocles is said to have died in an apotheotic fit by leaping into the hot lava at\nthe summit caldera of the great volcano of Aetna. But I sometimes imagine that he merely\nslipped during a courageous and pioneering venture in observational geophysics.\n\nThis hint, this whiff, of the existence of atoms was carried much further by a man\nnamed Democritus, who came from the Ionian colony of Abdera in northern Greece.\nAbdera was a kind of joke town. If in 430 B.C. you told a story about someone from\nAbdera, you were guaranteed a laugh. It was in a way the Brooklyn of its time. For\nDemocritus all of life was to be enjoyed and understood; understanding and enjoyment\nwere the same thing. He said that \u2018a life without festivity is a long road without an inn.\u2019\nDemocritus may have come from Abdera, but he was no dummy. He believed that a large\nnumber of worlds had formed spontaneously out of diffuse matter in space, evolved and\nthen decayed. At a time when no one knew about impact craters, Democritus thought that\nworlds on occasion collide; he believed that some worlds wandered alone through the\ndarkness of space, while others were accompanied by several suns and moons; that some\nworlds were inhabited, while others had no plants or animals or even water; that the\nsimplest forms of life arose from a kind of primeval ooze. He taught that perception - the\nreason, say, I think there is a pen in my hand - was a purely physical and mechanistic\nprocess; that thinking and feeling were attributes of matter put together in a sufficiently fine\nand complex way and not due to some spirit infused into matter by the gods.\n\nDemocritus invented the word atom, Greek for \u2018unable to be cut.\u2019 Atoms were the\nultimate particles, forever frustrating our attempts to break them into smaller pieces.\n\nEverything, he said, is a collection of atoms, intricately assembled. Even we. \u2018Nothing\nexists,\u2019 he said, \u2018but atoms and the void.\u2019\n\nWhen we cut an apple, the knife must pass through empty spaces between the\natoms, Democritus argued. If there were no such empty spaces, no void, the knife would\nencounter the impenetrable atoms, and the apple could not be cut. Having cut a slice from a\ncone, say, let us compare the cross sections of the two pieces. Are the exposed areas equal?\nNo, said Democritus. The slope of the cone forces one side of the slice to have a slightly\nsmaller cross section than the other. If the two areas were exactly equal, we would have a\ncylinder, not a cone. No matter how sharp the knife, the two pieces have unequal cross\nsections. Why? Because, on the scale of the very small, matter exhibits some irreducible\nroughness. This fine scale of roughness Democritus identified with the world of the atoms.\nHis arguments were not those we use today, but they were subtle and elegant, derived from\neveryday life. And his conclusions were fundamentally correct.\n\nIn related exercise. Democritus imagined calculating the volume of a cone or a\npyramid by a very large number of extremely small stacked plates tapering in size from the\nbase to the apex. He had stated the problem that, in mathematics, is called the theory of\nlimits. He was knocking at the door of the differential and integral calculus, that\nfundamental tool for understanding the world that was not, so far as we know from written\nrecords, in fact discovered until the time of Isaac Newton. Perhaps if Democritus\u2019 work had\nnot been almost completely destroyed, there would have been calculus by the time of\nChrist.*\n\n* The frontiers of the calculus were also later breached by Eudoxus and Archimedes.\n\nThomas Wright marveled in 1750 that Democritus had believed the Milky Way to\nbe composed mainly of unresolved stars: \u2018long before astronomy reaped any benefit from\nthe improved sciences of optics; [he] saw, as we may say, through the eye of reason, full as\nfar into infinity as the most able astronomers in more advantageous times have done since.\u201d\nBeyond the Milk of Hera, past the Backbone of Night, the mind of Democritus soared.\n\nAs a person, Democritus seems to have been somewhat unusual. Women, children\nand sex discomfited him, in part because they took time away from thinking. But he valued\nfriendship, held cheerfulness to be the goal of life and devoted a major philosophical\ninquiry to the origin and nature of enthusiasm. He journeyed to Athens to visit Socrates and\nthen found himself too shy to introduce himself. He was a close friend of Hippocrates. He\nwas awed by the beauty and elegance of the physical world. He felt that poverty ina\ndemocracy was preferable to wealth in a tyranny. He believed that the prevailing religions\nof his time were evil and that neither immortal souls nor immortal gods exist: \u2018Nothing\nexists, but atoms and the void.\u201d\n\nThere is no record of Democritus having been persecuted for his opinions - but then,\nhe came from Abdera. However, in his time the brief tradition of tolerance for\nunconventional views began to erode and then to shatter. People came to be punished for\nhaving unusual ideas. A portrait of Democritus is now on the Greek hundred-drachma bill.\nBut his insights were suppressed, his influence on history made minor. The mystics were\nbeginning to win.\n\nAnaxagoras was an Jonian experimentalist who flourished around 450 B.C. and\nlived in Athens. He was a rich man, indifferent to his wealth but passionate about science.\nAsked what was the purpose of life, he replied, \u2018the investigation of the Sun, the Moon, and\n\nthe heavens,\u2019 the reply of a true astronomer. He performed a clever experiment in which a\nsingle drop of white liquid, like cream, was shown not to lighten perceptibly the contents of\na great pitcher of dark liquid, like wine. There must, he concluded, be changes deducible by\nexperiment that are too subtle to be perceived directly by the senses.\n\nAnaxagoras was not nearly so radical as Democritus. Both were thoroughgoing\nmaterialists, not in prizing possessions but in holding that matter alone provided the\nunderpinnings of the world. Anaxagoras believed in a special mind substance and\ndisbelieved in the existence of atoms. He thought humans were more intelligent than other\nanimals because of our hands, a very Ionian idea.\n\nHe was the first person to state clearly that the Moon shines by reflected light, and\nhe accordingly devised a theory of the phases of the Moon. This doctrine was so dangerous\nthat the manuscript describing it had to be circulated in secret, an Athenian samizdat. It was\nnot in keeping with the prejudices of the time to explain the phases or eclipses of the Moon\nby the relative geometry of the Earth, the Moon and the self-luminous Sun. Aristotle, two\ngenerations later, was content to argue that those things happened because it was the nature\nof the Moon to have phases and eclipses - mere verbal juggling, an explanation that\nexplains nothing.\n\nThe prevailing belief was that the Sun and Moon were gods. Anaxagoras held that\nthe Sun and stars are fiery stones. We do not feel the heat of the stars because they are too\nfar away. He also thought that the Moon has mountains (right) and inhabitants (wrong). He\nheld that the Sun was so huge that it was probably larger than the Peloponnesus, roughly\nthe southern third of Greece. His critics thought this estimate excessive and absurd.\n\nAnaxagoras was brought to Athens by Pericles, its leader in its time of greatest\nglory, but also the man whose actions led to the Peloponnesian War, which destroyed\nAthenian democracy. Pericles delighted in philosophy and science, and Anaxagoras was\none of his principal confidants. There are those who think that in this role Anaxagoras\ncontributed significantly to the greatness of Athens. But Pericles had political problems. He\nwas too powerful to be attacked directly, so his enemies attacked those close to him.\nAnaxagoras was convicted and imprisoned for the religious crime of impiety - because he\nhad taught that the Moon was made of ordinary matter, that it was a place, and that the Sun\nwas a red-hot stone in the sky. Bishop John Wilkins commented in 1638 on these\nAthenians: \u2018Those zealous idolators [counted] it a great blasphemy to make their God a\nstone, whereas notwithstanding they were so senseless in their adoration of idols as to make\na stone their God.\u2019 Pericles seems to have engineered Anaxagoras\u2019 release from prison, but\nit was too late. In Greece the tide was turning, although the Ionian tradition continued in\nAlexandrian Egypt two hundred years later.\n\nThe great scientists from Thales to Democritus and Anaxagoras have usually been\ndescribed in history or philosophy books as \u2018Presocratics\u2019, as if their main function was to\nhold the philosophical fort until the advent of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle and perhaps\ninfluence them a little. Instead, the old Ionians represent a different and largely\ncontradictory tradition, one in much better accord with modem science. That their influence\nwas felt powerfully for only two or three centuries is an irreparable loss for all those human\nbeings who lived between the Ionian Awakening and the Italian Renaissance.\n\nPerhaps the most influential person ever associated with Samos was Pythagoras,* a\ncontemporary of Polycrates in the sixth century B.C. According to local tradition, he lived\nfor a time in a cave on the Samian Mount Kerkis, and was the first person in the history of\nthe world to deduce that the Earth is a sphere. Perhaps he argued by analogy with the Moon\n\nand the Sun, or noticed the curved shadow of the Earth on the Moon during a lunar eclipse,\nor recognized that when ships leave Samos and recede over the horizon, their masts\ndisappear last.\n\n* The sixth century B.C. was a time of remarkable intellectual and spiritual ferment across the\nplanet. Not only was it the time of Thales, Anaximander, Pythagoras and others in Ionia, but also the time of\nthe Egyptian Pharaoh Necho who caused Africa to be circumnavigated, of Zoroaster in Persia, Confucius and\nLao-tse in China, the Jewish prophets in Israel, Egypt and Babylon, and Gautama Buddha in India. It is hard\nto think these activities altogether unrelated.\n\nHe or his disciples discovered the Pythagorean theorem: the sum of the squares of\nthe shorter sides of a right triangle equals the square of the longer side. Pythagoras did not\nsimply enumerate examples of this theorem; he developed a method of mathematical\ndeduction to prove the thing generally. The modern tradition of mathematical argument,\nessential to all of science, owes much to Pythagoras. It was he who first used the word\nCosmos to denote a well-ordered and harmonious universe, a world amenable to human\nunderstanding.\n\nMany Ionians believed the underlying harmony of the universe to be accessible\nthrough observation and experiment, the method that dominates science today. However,\nPythagoras employed a very different method. He taught that the laws of Nature could be\ndeduced by pure thoughts. He and his followers were not fundamentally experimentalists.*\nThey were mathematicians. And they were thoroughgoing mystics. According to Bertrand\nRussell, in a perhaps uncharitable passage, Pythagoras \u2018founded a religion, of which the\nmain tenets were the transmigration of souls and the sinfulness of eating beans. His religion\nwas embodied in a religious order, which, here and there, acquired control of the State and\nestablished a rule of the saints. But the unregenerate hankered after beans, and sooner or\nlater rebelled.\u201d\n\n* Although there were a few welcome exceptions. The Pythagorean fascination with whole-number\nratios in musical harmonies seems clearly to be based on observation, or even experiment on the sounds\nissued from plucked strings. Empedocles was, at least in part, a Pythagorean. One of Pythagoras\u2019 students,\nAlcmaeon, is the first person known to have dissected a human body; he distinguished between arteries and\nveins, was the first to discover the optic nerve and the eustachian tubes, and identified the brain as the seat of\nthe intellect (a contention later denied by Aristotle, who placed intelligence in the heart, and then revived by\nHerophilus of Chalcedon). He also founded the science of embryology. But Alcmaeon\u2019s zest for the impure\nwas not shared by most of his Pythagorean colleagues in later times.\n\nThe Pythagoreans delighted in the certainty of mathematical demonstration, the\nsense of a pure and unsullied world accessible to the human intellect, a Cosmos in which\nthe sides of right triangles perfectly obey simple mathematical relationships. It was in\nstriking contrast to the messy reality of the workaday world. They believed that in their\nmathematics they had glimpsed a perfect reality, a realm of the gods, of which our familiar\nworld is but an imperfect reflection. In Plato\u2019s famous parable of the cave, prisoners were\nimagined tied in such a way that they saw only the shadows of passersby and believed the\nshadows to be real - never guessing the complex reality that was accessible if they would\nbut turn their heads. The Pythagoreans would powerfully influence Plato and, later,\nChristianity.\n\nThey did not advocate the free confrontation of conflicting points of view. Instead,\nlike all orthodox religions, they practiced a rigidity that prevented them from correcting\n\ntheir errors. Cicero wrote:\n\nIn discussion it is not so much weight of authority as force of argument that should\nbe demanded. Indeed, the authority of those who profess to teach is often a positive\nhindrance to those who desire to learn; they cease to employ their own judgment,\nand take what they perceive to be the verdict of their chosen master as settling the\nquestion. In fact I am not disposed to approve the practice traditionally ascribed to\nthe Pythagoreans, who, when questioned as to the grounds of any assertion that they\nadvanced in debate, are said to have been accustomed to reply \u2018The Master said so,\u2019\n\u2018the Master\u2019 being Pythagoras. So potent was an opinion already decided, making\nauthority prevail unsupported by reason.\n\nThe Pythagoreans were fascinated by the regular solids, symmetrical three-dimensional\nobjects all of whose sides are the same regular polygon. The cube is the simplest example,\nhaving six squares as sides. There are an infinite number of regular polygons, but only five\nregular solids. (The proof of this statement, a famous example of mathematical reasoning,\nis given in Appendix 2.) For some reason, knowledge of a solid called the dodecahedron\nhaving twelve pentagons as sides seemed to them dangerous. It was mystically associated\nwith the Cosmos. The other four regular solids were identified, somehow, with the four\n\u2018elements\u2019 then imagined to constitute the world: earth, fire, air and water. The fifth regular\nsolid must then, they thought, correspond to some fifth element that could only be the\nsubstance of the heavenly bodies. (This notion of a fifth essence is the origin of our word\nquintessence.) Ordinary people were to be kept ignorant of the dodecahedron.\n\nIn love with whole numbers, the Pythagoreans believed all things could be derived\nfrom them, certainly all other numbers. A crisis in doctrine arose when they discovered that\nthe square root of two (the ratio of the diagonal to the side of a square) was irrational, that it\ncannot be expressed accurately as the ratio of any two whole numbers, no matter how big\nthese numbers are. Ironically this discovery (reproduced in Appendix 1) was made with the\nPythagorean theorem as a tool. \u2018Irrational\u2019 originally meant only that a number could not be\nexpressed as a ratio. But for the Pythagoreans it came to mean something threatening, a hint\nthat their world view might not make sense, which is today the other meaning of\n\u2018irrational.\u2019 Instead of sharing these important mathematical discoveries, the Pythagoreans\nsuppressed knowledge of the square root of two and the dodecahedron. The outside world\nwas not to know.* Even today there are scientists opposed to the popularization of science:\nthe sacred knowledge is to be kept within the cult, unsullied by public understanding.\n\n* A Pythagorean named Hippasus published the secret of the \u2018sphere with twelve pentagons\u2019, the\ndodecahedron. When he later died in a shipwreck, we are told, his fellow Pythagoreans remarked on the\njustice of the punishment. His book has not survived.\n\nThe Pythagoreans believed the sphere to be \u2018perfect\u2019, all points on its surface being\nat the same distance from its center. Circles were also perfect. And the Pythagoreans\ninsisted that planets moved in circular paths at constant speeds. They seemed to believe that\nmoving slower or faster at different places in the orbit would be unseemly; noncircular\nmotion was somehow flawed, unsuitable for the planets, which, being free of the Earth,\nwere also deemed \u2018perfect.\u2019\n\nThe pros and cons of the Pythagorean tradition can be seen clearly in the life\u2019s work\n\nof Johannes Kepler (Chapter 3). The Pythagorean idea of a perfect and mystical world,\nunseen by the senses, was readily accepted by the early Christians and was an integral\ncomponent of Kepler\u2019s early training. On the one hand, Kepler was convinced that\nmathematical harmonies exist in nature (he wrote that \u2018the universe was stamped with the\nadornment of harmonic proportions\u2019); that simple numerical relationships must determine\nthe motion of the planets. On the other hand, again following the Pythagoreans, he long\nbelieved that only uniform circular motion was admissible. He repeatedly found the\nobserved planetary motions could not be explained in this way, and repeatedly tried again.\nBut unlike many Pythagoreans, he believed in observations and experiment in the real\nworld. Eventually the detailed observations of the apparent motion of the planets forced\nhim to abandon the idea of circular paths and to realize that planets travel in ellipses.\nKepler was both inspired in his search for the harmony of planetary motion and delayed for\nmore than a decade by the attractions of Pythagorean doctrine.\n\nA disdain for the practical swept the ancient world. Plato urged astronomers to think\nabout the heavens, but not to waste their time observing them. Aristotle believed that: \u2018The\nlower sort are by nature slaves, and it is better for them as for all inferiors that they should\nbe under the rule of a master .... The slave shares in his master\u2019s life; the artisan is less\nclosely connected with him, and only attains excellence in proportion as he becomes a\nslave. The meaner sort of mechanic has a special and separate slavery.\u2019 Plutarch wrote: \u2018It\ndoes not of necessity follow that, if the work delight you with its grace, the one who\nwrought it is worthy of esteem.\u2019 Xenophon\u2019s opinion was: \u2018What are called the mechanical\narts carry a social stigma and are rightly dishonoured in our cities.\u2019 As a result of such\nattitudes, the brilliant and promising Ionian experimental method was largely abandoned\nfor two thousand years. Without experiment, there is no way to choose among contending\nhypotheses, no way for science to advance. The antiempirical taint of the Pythagoreans\nsurvives to this day. But why? Where did this distaste for experiment come from?\n\nAn explanation for the decline of ancient science has been put forward by the\nhistorian of science, Benjamin Farrington: The mercantile tradition, which led to Ionian\nscience, also led to a slave economy. The owning of slaves was the road to wealth and\npower. Polycrates\u2019 fortifications were built by slaves. Athens in the time of Pericles, Plato\nand Aristotle had a vast slave population. All the brave Athenian talk about democracy\napplied only to a privileged few. What slaves characteristically perform is manual labor.\nBut scientific experimentation is manual labor, from which the slaveholders are\npreferentially distanced; while it is only the slaveholders - politely called \u2018gentle-men\u2019 in\nsome societies - who have the leisure to do science. Accordingly, almost no one did\nscience. The Ionians were perfectly able to make machines of some elegance. But the\navailability of slaves undermined the economic motive for the development of technology.\nThus the mercantile tradition contributed to the great Ionian awakening around 600 B.C.,\nand, through slavery, may have been the cause of its decline some two centuries later.\nThere are great ironies here.\n\nSimilar trends are apparent throughout the world. The high point in indigenous\nChinese astronomy occurred around 1280, with the work of Kuo Shou-ching, who used an\nobservational baseline of 1,500 years and improved both astronomical instruments and\nmathematical techniques for computation. It is generally thought that Chinese astronomy\nthereafter underwent a steep decline. Nathan Sivin believes that the reason lies at least\npartly \u2018in increasing rigidity of elite attitudes, so that the educated were less inclined to be\ncurious about techniques and less willing to value science as an appropriate pursuit for a\n\ngentleman.\u2019 The occupation of astronomer became a hereditary office, a practice\ninconsistent with the advance of the subject. Additionally, \u2018the responsibility for the\nevolution of astronomy remained centered in the Imperial Court and was largely abandoned\nto foreign technicians,\u2019 chiefly the Jesuits, who had introduced Euclid and Copernicus to\nthe astonished Chinese, but who, after the censorship of the latter\u2019s book, had a vested\ninterest in disguising and suppressing heliocentric cosmology. Perhaps science was\nstillborn in Indian, Mayan and Aztec civilizations for the same reason it declined in Ionia,\nthe pervasiveness of the slave economy. A major problem in the contemporary (political)\nThird World is that the educated classes tend to be the children of the wealthy, with a\nvested interest in the status quo, and are unaccustomed either to working with their hands\nor to challenging conventional wisdom. Science has been very slow to take root.\n\nPlato and Aristotle were comfortable in a slave society. They offered justifications\nfor oppression. They served tyrants. They taught the alienation of the body from the mind\n(a natural enough ideal in a slave society); they separated matter from thought; they\ndivorced the Earth from the heavens - divisions that were to dominate Western thinking for\nmore than twenty centuries. Plato, who believed that \u2018all things are full of gods,\u2019 actually\nused the metaphor of slavery to connect his politics with his cosmology. He is said to have\nurged the burning of all the books of Democritus (he had a similar recommendation for the\nbooks of Homer), perhaps because Democritus did not acknowledge immortal souls or\nimmortal gods or Pythagorean mysticism, or because he believed in an infinite number of\nworlds. Of the seventy-three books Democritus is said to have written, covering all of\nhuman knowledge, not a single work survives. All we know is from fragments, chiefly on\nethics, and secondhand accounts. The same is true of almost all the other ancient Ionian\nscientists.\n\nIn the recognition by Pythagoras and Plato that the Cosmos is knowable, that there\nis a mathematical underpinning to nature, they greatly advanced the cause of science. But\nin the suppression of disquieting facts, the sense that science should be kept for a small\nelite, the distaste for experiment, the embrace of mysticism and the easy acceptance of\nslave societies, they set back the human enterprise. After a long mystical sleep in which the\ntools of scientific inquiry lay moldering, the Ionian approach, in some cases transmitted\nthrough scholars at the Alexandrian Library, was finally rediscovered. The Western world\nreawakened. Experiment and open inquiry became once more respectable. Forgotten books\nand fragments were again read. Leonardo and Columbus and Copernicus were inspired by\nor independently retraced parts of this ancient Greek tradition. There is in our time much\nIonian science, although not in politics and religion, and a fair amount of courageous free\ninquiry. But there are also appalling superstitions and deadly ethical ambiguities. We are\nflawed by ancient contradictions.\n\nThe Platonists and their Christian successors held the peculiar notion that the Earth\nwas tainted and somehow nasty, while the heavens were perfect and divine. The\nfundamental idea that the Earth is a planet, that we are citizens of the Universe, was\nrejected and forgotten. This idea was first argued by Aristarchus, born on Samos three\ncenturies after Pythagoras. Aristarchus was one of the last of the Ionian scientists. By this\ntime, the center of intellectual enlightenment had moved to the great Library of Alexandria.\nAristarchus was the first person to hold that the Sun rather than the Earth is at the center of\nthe planetary system, that all the planets go around the Sun rather than the Earth. Typically,\nhis writings on this matter are lost. From the size of the Earth\u2019s shadow on the Moon during\na lunar eclipse, he deduced that the Sun had to be much larger than the Earth, as well as\n\nvery far away. He may then have reasoned that it is absurd for so large a body as the Sun to\nrevolve around so small a body as the Earth. He put the Sun at the center, made the Earth\nrotate on its axis once a day and orbit the Sun once a year.\n\nIt is the same idea we associate with the name of Copernicus, whom Galileo\ndescribed as the \u2018restorer and confirmer\u2019, not the inventor, of the heliocentric hypothesis.*\nFor most of the 1,800 years between Aristarchus and Copernicus nobody knew the correct\ndisposition of the planets, even though it had been laid out perfectly clearly around 280\nB.C. The idea outraged some of Aristarchus\u2019 contemporaries. There were cries, like those\nvoiced about Anaxagoras and Bruno and Galileo, that he be condemned for impiety. The\nresistance to Aristarchus and Copernicus, a kind of geocentrism in everyday life, remains\nwith us: we still talk about the Sun \u2018rising\u2019 and the Sun \u2018setting\u2019. It is 2,200 years since\nAristarchus, and our language still pretends that the Earth does not turn.\n\n* Copernicus may have gotten the idea from reading about Aristarchus. Recently discovered\nclassical texts were a source of great excitement in Italian universities when Copernicus went to medical\nschool there. In the manuscript of his book, Copernicus mentioned Aristarchus\u2019 priority, but he omitted the\ncitation before the book saw print. Copernicus wrote in a letter to Pope Paul III: \u2018According to Cicero, Nicetas\nhad thought the Earth was moved . . . According to Plutarch [who discusses Aristarchusl... certain others had\nheld the same opinion. When from this, therefore, I had conceived its possibility, I myself also began to\nmeditate upon the mobility of the Earth.\u201d\n\nThe separation of the planets from one another - forty million kilometers from Earth\nto Venus at closest approach, six billion kilometers to Pluto - would have stunned those\nGreeks who were outraged by the contention that the Sun might be as large as the\nPeloponnesus. It was natural to think of the solar system as much more compact and local.\nIf I hold my finger before my eyes and examine it first with my left and then with my right\neye, it seems to move against the distant background. The closer my finger is, the more it\nseems to move. I can estimate the distance to my finger from the amount of this apparent\nmotion, or parallax. If my eyes were farther apart, my finger would seem to move\nsubstantially more. The longer the baseline from which we make our two observations, the\ngreater the parallax and the better we can measure the distance to remote objects. But we\nlive on a moving platform, the Earth, which every six months has progressed from one end\nof its orbit to the other, a distance of 300,000,000 kilometers. If we look at the same\nunmoving celestial object six months apart, we should be able to measure very great\ndistances. Aristarchus suspected the stars to be distant suns. He placed the Sun \u2018among\u2019 the\nfixed stars. The absence of detectable stellar parallax as the Earth moved suggested that the\nstars were much farther away than the Sun. Before the invention of the telescope, the\nparallax of even the nearest stars was too small to detect. Not until the nineteenth century\nwas the parallax of a star first measured. It then became clear, from straightforward Greek\ngeometry, that the stars were light-years away.\n\nThere is another way to measure the distance to the stars which the Ionians were\nfully capable of discovering, although, so far as we know, they did not employ it. Everyone\nknows that the farther away an object is, the smaller it seems. This inverse proportionality\nbetween apparent size and distance is the basis of perspective in art and photography. So\nthe farther away we are from the Sun, the smaller and dimmer it appears. How far would\nwe have to be from the Sun for it to appear as small and as dim as a star? Or, equivalently,\nhow small a piece of the Sun would be as bright as a star?\n\nAn early experiment to answer this question was performed by Christiaan Huygens,\n\nvery much in the Ionian tradition. Huygens drilled small holes in a brass plate, held the\nplate up to the Sun and asked himself which hole seemed as bright as he remembered the\nbright star Sirius to have been the night before. The hole was effectively* 1/28,000 the\napparent size of the Sun. So Sirius, he reasoned, must be 28,000 times farther from us than\nthe Sun, or about half a light-year away. It is hard to remember just how bright a star is\nmany hours after you look at it, but Huygens remembered very well. If he had known that\nSirius was intrinsically brighter than the Sun, he would have come up with almost exactly\nthe right answer: Sirius is 8.8 light-years away. The fact that Aristarchus and Huygens used\nimprecise data and derived imperfect answers hardly matters. They explained their methods\nso clearly that, when better observations were available, more accurate answers could be\nderived.\n\n* Huygens actually used a glass bead to reduce the amount of light passed by the hole.\n\nBetween the times of Aristarchus and Huygens, humans answered the question that\nhad so excited me as a boy growing up in Brooklyn: What are the stars? The answer is that\nthe stars are mighty suns, light-years away in the vastness of interstellar space.\n\nThe great legacy of Aristarchus is this: neither we nor our planet enjoys a privileged\nposition in Nature. This insight has since been applied upward to the stars, and sideways to\nmany subsets of the human family, with great success and invariable opposition. It has been\nresponsible for major advances in astronomy, physics, biology, anthropology, economics\nand politics. I wonder if its social extrapolation is a major reason for attempts at its\nsuppression.\n\nThe legacy of Aristarchus has been extended far beyond the realm of the stars. At\nthe end of the eighteenth century, William Herschel, musician and astronomer to George III\nof England, completed a project to map the starry skies and found apparently equal\nnumbers of stars in all directions in the plane or band of the Milky Way; from this,\nreasonably enough, he deduced that we were at the center of the Galaxy.* Just before\nWorld War I, Harlow Shapley of Missouri devised a technique for measuring the distances\nto the globular clusters, those lovely spherical arrays of stars which resemble a swarm of\nbees. Shapley had found a stellar standard candle, a star noticeable because of its\nvariability, but which had always the same average intrinsic brightness. By comparing the\nfaintness of such stars when found in globular clusters with their real brightness, as\ndetermined from nearby representatives, Shapley could calculate how far away they are -\njust as, in a field, we can estimate the distance of a lantern of known intrinsic brightness\nfrom the feeble light that reaches us - essentially, the method of Huygens. Shapley\ndiscovered that the globular clusters were not centered around the solar neighborhood but\nrather about a distant region of the Milky Way, in the direction of the constellation\nSagittarius, the Archer. It seemed to him very likely that the globular clusters used in this\ninvestigation, nearly a hundred of them, would be orbiting about, paying homage to, the\nmassive center of the Milky Way.\n\n* This supposed privileged position of the Earth, at the center of what was then considered the\nknown universe, led A. R. Wallace to the anti-Aristarchian position, in his book Man's Place in the Universe\n(1903), that ours may be the only inhabited planet.\n\nShapley had in 1915 the courage to propose that the solar system was in the\n\noutskirts and not near the core of our galaxy. Herschel had been misled because of the\ncopious amount of obscuring dust in the direction of Sagittarius; he had no way to know of\nthe enormous numbers of stars beyond. It is now very clear that we live some 30,000 light-\nyears from the galactic core, on the fringes of a spiral arm, where the local density of stars\nis relatively sparse. There may be those who live on a planet that orbits a central star in one\nof Shapley\u2019s globular clusters, or one located in the core. Such beings may pity us for our\nhandful of naked-eye stars, because their skies will be ablaze with them. Near the center of\nthe Milky Way, millions of brilliant stars would be visible to the naked eye, compared to\nour paltry few thousand. Our Sun or suns might set, but the night would never come.\n\nWell into the twentieth century, astronomers believed that there was only one\ngalaxy in the Cosmos, the Milky Way - although in the eighteenth century Thomas Wright\nof Durban and Immanuel Kant of K\u00e9nigsberg each had a premonition that the exquisite\nluminous spiral forms, viewed through the telescope, were other galaxies. Kant suggested\nexplicitly that M31 in the constellation Andromeda was another Milky Way, composed of\nenormous numbers of stars, and proposed calling such objects by the evocative and\nhaunting phrase \u2018island universes.\u2019 Some scientists toyed with the idea that the spiral\nnebulae were not distant island universes but rather nearby condensing clouds of interstellar\ngas, perhaps on their way to make solar systems. To test the distance of the spiral nebula a\nclass of intrinsically much brighter variable stars was needed to furnish a new standard\ncandle. Such stars, identified in M31 by Edwin Hubble in 1924, were discovered to be\nalarmingly dim, and it became apparent that M31 was a prodigious distance away, a\nnumber now estimated at a little more than two million light-years. But if M31 were at such\na distance, it could not be a cloud of mere interstellar dimensions; it had to be much larger -\nan immense galaxy in its own right. And the other, fainter galaxies must be more distant\nstill, a hundred billion of them, sprinkled through the dark to the frontiers of the known\nCosmos.\n\nAs long as there have been humans, we have searched for our place in the Cosmos. In the\nchildhood of our species (when our ancestors gazed a little idly at the stars), among the\nJonian scientists of ancient Greece, and in our own age, we have been transfixed by this\nquestion: Where are we? Who are we? We find that we live on an insignificant planet of a\nhumdrum star lost between two spiral arms in the outskirts of a galaxy which is a member\nof a sparse cluster of galaxies, tucked away in some forgotten corner of a universe in which\nthere are far more galaxies than people. This perspective is a courageous continuation of\nour penchant for constructing and testing mental models of the skies; the Sun as a red-hot\nstone, the stars as celestial flame, the Galaxy as the backbone of night.\n\nSince Aristarchus, every step in our quest has moved us farther from center stage in\nthe cosmic drama. There has not been much time to assimilate these new findings. The\ndiscoveries of Shapley and Hubble were made within the lifetimes of many people still\nalive today. There are those who secretly deplore these great discoveries, who consider\nevery step a demotion, who in their heart of hearts still pine for a universe whose center,\nfocus and fulcrum is the Earth. But if we are to deal with the Cosmos we must first\nunderstand it, even if our hopes for some unearned preferential status are, in the process,\ncontravened. Understanding where we live is an essential precondition for improving the\nneighborhood. Knowing what other neighborhoods are like also helps. If we long for our\nplanet to be important, there is something we can do about it. We make our world\nsignificant by the courage of our questions and by the depth of our answers.\n\nWe embarked on our cosmic voyage with a question first framed in the childhood of\nour species and in each generation asked anew with undiminished wonder: What are the\nstars? Exploration is in our nature. We began as wanderers, and we are wanderers still. We\nhave lingered long enough on the shores of the cosmic ocean. We are ready at last to set\nsail for the stars.\n",

Heaven and\nEarth are as old as I, and the ten thousand things are one.\n- Chuang Tzu, about 300 B.C., China\n\n* Actually, P\u2019eng Tsu, the Chinese equivalent.\n\nWe have loved the stars too fondly to be fearful of the night.\n- Tombstone epitaph of two amateur astronomers\n\nStars scribble in our eyes the frosty sagas, The gleaming cantos of unvanquished\nspace.\n- Hart Crane, The Bridge\n\nThe rising and falling of the surf is produced in part by tides. The Moon and the Sun are far\naway. But their gravitational influence is very real and noticeable back here on Earth. The\nbeach reminds us of space. Fine sand grains, all more or less uniform in size, have been\nproduced from larger rocks through ages of jostling and rubbing, abrasion and erosion,\nagain driven through waves and weather by the distant Moon and Sun. The beach also\nreminds us of time. The world is much older than the human species.\n\nA handful of sand contains about 10,000 grains, more than the number of stars we\ncan see with the naked eye on a clear night. But the number of stars we can see is only the\ntiniest fraction of the number of stars that are. What we see at night is the merest\nsmattering of the nearest stars. Meanwhile the Cosmos is rich beyond measure: the total\nnumber of stars in the universe is greater than all the grains of sand on all the beaches of the\nplanet Earth.\n\nDespite the efforts of ancient astronomers and astrologers to put pictures in the\nskies, a constellation is nothing more than an arbitrary grouping of stars composed of\nintrinsically dim stars that seem to us bright because they are nearby, and intrinsically\nbrighter stars that are somewhat more distant. All places on Earth are, to high precision, the\nsame distance from any star. This is why the star patterns in a given constellation do not\nchange as we go from, say, Soviet Central Asia to the American Midwest. Astronomically,\nthe U.S.S.R. and the United States are the same place. The stars in any constellation are all\nso far away that we cannot recognize them as a three-dimensional configuration as long as\nwe are tied to Earth. The average distance between the stars is a few light-years, a light-\nyear being, we remember, about ten trillion kilometers. For the patterns of the\nconstellations to change, we must travel over distances comparable to those that separate\nthe stars; we must venture across the light-years. Then some nearby stars will seem to move\nout of the constellation, others will enter it, and its configuration will alter dramatically.\n\nOur technology is, so far, utterly incapable of such grand interstellar voyages, at\nleast in reasonable transit times. But our computers can be taught the three-dimensional\npositions of all the nearby stars, and we can ask to be taken on a little trip - a\ncircumnavigation of the collection of bright stars that constitute the Big Dipper, say - and\n\nwatch the constellations change. We connect the stars in typical constellations, in the usual\ncelestial follow-the-dots drawings. As we change our perspective, we see their apparent\nshapes distort severely. The inhabitants of the planets of distant stars witness quite different\nconstellations in their night skies than we do in ours - other Rorschach tests for other\nminds. Perhaps sometime in the next few centuries a spaceship from Earth will actually\ntravel such distances at some remarkable speed and see new constellations that no human\nhas ever viewed before - except with such a computer.\n\nThe appearance of the constellations changes not only in space but also in time; not\nonly if we alter our position but also if we merely wait sufficiently long. Sometimes stars\nmove together in a group or cluster; other times a single star may move very rapidly with\nrespect to its fellows. Eventually such stars leave an old constellation and enter a new one.\nOccasionally, one member of a double-star system explodes, breaking the gravitational\nshackles that bound its companion, which then leaps into space at its former orbital\nvelocity, a slingshot in the sky. In addition, stars are born, stars evolve, and stars die. If we\nwait long enough, new stars appear and old stars vanish. The patterns in the sky slowly\nmelt and alter.\n\nEven over the lifetime of the human species - a few million years - constellations\nhave been changing. Consider the present configuration of the Big Dipper, or Great Bear.\nOur computer can carry us in time as well as in space. As we run the Big Dipper backwards\ninto the past, allowing for the motion of its stars, we find quite a different appearance a\nmillion years ago. The Big Dipper then looked quite a bit like a spear. If a time machine\ndropped you precipitously in some unknown age in the distant past, you could in principle\ndetermine the epoch by the configuration of the stars: If the Big Dipper is a spear, this must\nbe the Middle Pleistocene.\n\nWe can also ask the computer to run a constellation forward into time. Consider Leo\nthe Lion. The zodiac is a band of twelve constellations seemingly wrapped around the sky\nin the apparent annual path of the Sun through the heavens. The root of the word is that for\nzoo, because the zodiacal constellations, like Leo, are mainly fancied to be animals. A\nmillion years from now, Leo will look still less like a lion than it does today. Perhaps our\nremote descendants will call it the constellation of the radio telescope - although I suspect a\nmillion years from now the radio telescope will have become more obsolete than the stone\nspear is now.\n\nThe (nonzodiacal) constellation of Orion, the hunter, is outlined by four bright stars\nand bisected by a diagonal line of- three stars, which represent the belt of the hunter. Three\ndimmer stars hanging from the belt are, according to the conventional astronomical\nprojective test, Orion\u2019s sword. The middle star in the sword is not actually a star but a great\ncloud of gas called the Orion Nebula, in which stars are being born. Many of the stars in\nOrion are hot and young, evolving rapidly and ending their lives in colossal cosmic\nexplosions called supernovae. They are born and die in periods of tens of millions of years.\nIf, on our computer, we were to run Orion rapidly into the far future, we would see a\nstartling effect, the births and spectacular deaths of many of its stars, flashing on and\nwinking off like fireflies in the night.\n\nThe solar neighborhood, the immediate environs of the Sun in space, includes the\nnearest star system, Alpha Centauri. It is really a triple system, two stars revolving around\neach other, and a third, Proxima Centauri, orbiting the pair at a discreet distance. At some\npositions in its orbit, Proxima is the closest known star to the Sun - hence its name. Most\nstars in the sky are members of double or multiple star systems. Our solitary Sun is\n\nsomething of an anomaly.\n\nThe second brightest star in the constellation Andromeda, called Beta Andromedae,\nis seventy-five light-years away. The light by which we see it now has spent seventy-five\nyears traversing the dark of interstellar space on its long journey to Earth. In the unlikely\nevent that Beta Andromedae blew itself up last Tuesday, we would not know it for another\nseventy-five years, as this interesting information, traveling at the speed of light, would\nrequire seventy-five years to cross the enormous interstellar distances. When the light by\nwhich we now see this star set out on its long voyage, the young Albert Einstein, working\nas a Swiss patent clerk, had just published his epochal special theory of relativity here on\nEarth.\n\nSpace and time are interwoven. We cannot look out into space without looking back\ninto time. Light travels very fast. But space is very empty, and the stars are far apart.\nDistances of seventy-five light-years or less are very small compared to other distances in\nastronomy. From the Sun to the center of the Milky Way Galaxy is 30,000 light-years.\nFrom our galaxy to the nearest spiral galaxy, M31, also in the constellation Andromeda, is\n2,000,000 light-years. When the light we see today from M31 left for Earth, there were no\nhumans on our planet, although our ancestors were evolving rapidly to our present form.\nThe distance from the Earth to the most remote quasars is eight or ten billion light-years.\nWe see them today as they were before the Earth accumulated, before the Milky Way was\nformed.\n\nThis is not a situation restricted to astronomical objects, but only astronomical\nobjects are so far away that the finite speed of light becomes important. If you are looking\nat a friend three meters (ten feet) away, at the other end of the room, you are not seeing her\nas she is \u2018now\u2019; but rather as she \u2018was\u2019 a hundred millionth of a second ago. [(3 m) / (3 x\n10\u00b0 m/sec) = 1/(10*/sec) =10\" sec, or a hundredth of a microsecond. In this calculation we\nhave merely divided the distance by the speed to get the travel time.] But the difference\nbetween your friend \u2018now\u2019 and now minus a hundred-millionth of a second is too small to\nnotice. On the other hand, when we look at a quasar eight billion light-years away, the fact\nthat we are seeing it as it was eight billion years ago may be very important. (For example,\nthere are those who think that quasars are explosive events likely to happen only in the\nearly history of galaxies. In that case, the more distant the galaxy, the earlier in its history\nwe are observing it, and the more likely it is that we should see it as a quasar. Indeed, the\nnumber of quasars increases as we look to distances of more than about five billion light-\nyears).\n\nThe two Voyager interstellar spacecraft, the fastest machines ever launched from\nEarth, are now traveling at one ten-thousandth the speed of light. They would need 40,000\nyears to go the distance to the nearest star. Do we have any hope of leaving Earth and\ntraversing the immense distances even to Proxima Centauri in convenient periods of time?\nCan we do something to approach the speed of light? What is magic about the speed of\nlight? Might we someday be able to go faster than that?\n\nIf you had walked through the pleasant Tuscan countryside in the 1890\u2019s, you might\nhave come upon a somewhat long-haired teenage high school dropout on the road to Pavia.\nHis teachers in Germany had told him that he would never amount to anything, that his\nquestions destroyed classroom discipline, that he would be better off out of school. So he\nleft and wandered, delighting in the freedom of Northern Italy, where he could ruminate on\nmatters remote from the subjects he had been force-fed in his highly disciplined Prussian\nschoolroom. His name was Albert Einstein, and his ruminations changed the world.\n\nEinstein had been fascinated by Bernstein\u2019s People\u2019s Book of Natural Science, a\npopularization of science that described on its very first page the astonishing speed of\nelectricity through wires and light through space. He wondered what the world would look\nlike if you could travel on a wave of light. To travel at the speed of light! What an engaging\nand magical thought for a boy on the road in a countryside dappled and rippling in sunlight.\nYou could not tell you were on a light wave if you traveled with it. If you started on a wave\ncrest, you would stay on the crest and lose all notion of it being a wave. Something strange\nhappens at the speed of light. The more Einstein thought about such questions, the more\ntroubling they became. Paradoxes seemed to emerge everywhere if you could travel at the\nspeed of light. Certain ideas had been accepted as true without sufficiently careful thought.\nEinstein posed simple questions that could have been asked centuries earlier. For example,\nwhat do we mean when we say that two events are simultaneous?\n\nImagine that I am riding a bicycle toward you. As I approach an intersection I\nnearly collide, so it seems to me, with a horse-drawn cart. I swerve and barely avoid being\nrun over. Now think of the event again, and imagine that the cart and the bicycle are both\ntraveling close to the speed of light. If you are standing down the road, the cart is traveling\nat right angles to your line of sight. You see me, by reflected sunlight, traveling toward\nyou. Would not my speed be added to the speed of light, so that my image would get to you\nconsiderably before the image of the cart? Should you not see me swerve before you see the\ncart arrive? Can the cart and I approach the intersection simultaneously from my point of\nview, but not from yours? Could I experience a near collision with the cart while you\nperhaps see me swerve around nothing and pedal cheerfully on toward the town of Vinci?\nThese are curious and subtle questions. They challenge the obvious. There is a reason that\nno one thought of them before Einstein. From such elementary questions, Einstein\nproduced a fundamental rethinking of the world, a revolution in physics.\n\nIf the world is to be understood, if we are to avoid such logical paradoxes when\ntraveling at high speeds, there are some rules, commandments of Nature, that must be\nobeyed. Einstein codified these rules in the special theory of relativity. Light (reflected or\nemitted) from an object travels at the same velocity whether the object is moving or\nstationary: Thou shalt not add thy speed to the speed of light. Also, no material object may\nmove faster than light: Thou shalt not travel at or beyond the speed of light. Nothing in\nphysics prevents you from traveling as close to the speed of light as you like; 99.9 percent\nof the speed of light would be just fine. But no matter how hard you try, you can never gain\nthat last decimal point. For the world to be logically consistent, there must be a cosmic\nspeed limit. Otherwise, you could get to any speed you wanted by adding velocities on a\nmoving platform.\n\nEuropeans around the turn of the century generally believed in privileged frames of\nreference: that German, or French, or British culture and political organization were better\nthan those of other countries; that Europeans were superior to other peoples who were\nfortunate enough to be colonized. The social and political application of the ideas of\nAristarchus and Copernicus was rejected or ignored. The young Einstein rebelled against\nthe notion of privileged frames of reference in physics as much as he did in politics. In a\nuniverse filled with stars rushing helter-skelter in all directions, there was no place that was\n\u2018at rest,\u2019 no framework from which to view the universe that was superior to any other\nframework. This is what the word relativity means. The idea is very simple, despite its\nmagical trappings: in viewing the universe, every place is as good as every other place. The\nlaws of Nature must be identical no matter who is describing them. If this is to be true - and\n\nit would be stunning if there were something special about our insignificant location in the\nCosmos - then it follows that no one may travel faster than light.\n\nWe hear the crack of a bullwhip because its tip is moving faster than the speed of\nsound, creating a shock wave, a small sonic boom. A thunderclap has a similar origin. It\nwas once thought that airplanes could not travel faster than sound. Today supersonic flight\nis commonplace. But the light barrier is different from the sound barrier. It is not merely an\nengineering problem like the one the supersonic airplane solves. It is a fundamental law of\nNature, as basic as gravity. And there are no phenomena in our experience - like the crack\nof the bullwhips or the clap of thunder for sound - to suggest the possibility of traveling in a\nvacuum faster than light. On the contrary, there is an extremely wide range of experience -\nwith nuclear accelerators and atomic clocks, for example - in precise quantitative\nagreement with special relativity.\n\nThe problems of simultaneity do not apply to sound as they do to light because\nsound is propagated through some material medium, usually air. The sound wave that\nreaches you when a friend is talking is the motion of molecules in the air. Light, however,\ntravels in a vacuum. There are restrictions on how molecules of air can move which do not\napply to a vacuum. Light from the Sun reaches us across the intervening empty space, but\nno matter how carefully we listen, we do not hear the crackle of sunspots or the thunder of\nthe solar flares. It was once thought, in the days before relativity, that light did propagate\nthrough a special medium that permeated all of space, called \u2018the luminiferous aether.\u2019 But\nthe famous Michelson-Morley experiment demonstrated that such an aether does not exist.\n\nWe sometimes hear of things that can travel faster than light. Something called \u2018the\nspeed of thought\u2019 is occasionally proffered. This is an exceptionally silly notion especially\nsince the speed of impulses through the neurons in our brains is about the same as the speed\nof a donkey cart. That human beings have been clever enough to devise relativity shows\nthat we think well, but I do not think we can boast about thinking fast. The electrical\nimpulses in modern computers do, however, travel nearly at the speed of light.\n\nSpecial relativity, fully worked out by Einstein in his middle twenties, is supported\nby every experiment performed to check it. Perhaps tomorrow someone will invent a theory\nconsistent with everything else we know that circumvents paradoxes on such matters as\nsimultaneity, avoids privileged reference frames and still permits travel faster than light.\nBut I doubt it very much. Einstein\u2019s prohibition against traveling faster than light may clash\nwith our common sense. But on this question, why should we trust common sense? Why\nshould our experience at 10 kilometers an hour constrain the laws of nature at 300,000\nkilometers per second? Relativity does set limits on what humans can ultimately do. But the\nuniverse is not required to be in perfect harmony with human ambition. Special relativity\nremoves from our grasp one way of reaching the stars, the ship that can go faster than light.\nTantalizingly, it suggests another and quite unexpected method.\n\nFollowing George Gamow, let us imagine a place where the speed of light is not its\ntrue value of 300,000 kilometers per second, but something very modest: 40 kilometers per\nhour, say - and strictly enforced. (There are no penalties for breaking laws of Nature,\nbecause there are no crimes: Nature is self-regulating and merely arranges things so that its\nprohibitions are impossible to transgress.) Imagine that you are approaching the speed of\nlight on a motor scooter. (Relativity is rich in sentences beginning \u2018Imagine . . .\u2019 Einstein\ncalled such an exercise a Gedankenexperiment, a thought experiment.) As your speed\nincreases, you begin to see around the corners of passing objects. While you are rigidly\nfacing forward, things that are behind you appear within your forward field of vision. Close\n\nto the speed of light, from your point of view, the world looks very odd - ultimately\neverything is squeezed into a tiny circular window, which stays just ahead of you. From the\nstandpoint of a stationary observer, light reflected off you is reddened as you depart and\nblued as you return. If you travel toward the observer at almost the speed of light, you will\nbecome enveloped in an eerie chromatic radiance: your usually invisible infrared emission\nwill be shifted to the shorter visible wavelengths. You become compressed in the direction\nof motion, your mass increases, and time, as you experience it, slows down, a breathtaking\nconsequence of traveling close to the speed of light called time dilation. But from the\nstandpoint of an observer moving with you - perhaps the scooter has a second seat - none of\nthese effects occur.\n\nThese peculiar and at first perplexing predictions of special relativity are true in the\ndeepest sense that anything in science is true. They depend on your relative motion. But\nthey are real, not optical illusions. They can be demonstrated by simple mathematics,\nmainly first-year algebra and therefore understandable to any educated person. They are\nalso consistent with many experiments. Very accurate clocks carried in airplanes slow\ndown a little compared to stationary clocks. Nuclear accelerators are designed to allow for\nthe increase of mass with increasing speed; if they were not designed in this way,\naccelerated particles would all smash into the walls of the apparatus, and there would be\nlittle to do in experimental nuclear physics. A speed is a distance divided by a time. Since\nnear the velocity of light we cannot simply add speeds, as we are used to doing in the\nworkaday world, the familiar notions of absolute space and absolute time - independent of\nyour relative motion - must give way. That is why you shrink. That is the reason for time\ndilation.\n\nTraveling close to the speed of light you would hardly age at all, but your friends\nand your relatives back home would be aging at the usual rate. When you returned from\nyour relativistic journey, what a difference there would be between your friends and you,\nthey having aged decades, say, and you having aged hardly at all! Traveling close to the\nspeed of light is a kind of elixir of life. Because time slows down close to the speed of light,\nspecial relativity provides us with a means of going to the stars. But is it possible, in terms\nof practical engineering, to travel close to the speed of light? Is a starship feasible?\n\nTuscany was not only the caldron of some of the thinking of the young Albert\nEinstein; it was also the home of another great genius who lived 400 years earlier,\nLeonardo da Vinci, who delighted in climbing the Tuscan hills and viewing the ground\nfrom a great height, as if he were soaring like a bird. He drew the first aerial perspectives of\nlandscapes, towns and fortifications. Among Leonardo\u2019s many interests and\naccomplishments - in painting, sculpture, anatomy, geology, natural history, military and\ncivil engineering - he had a great passion: to devise and fabricate a machine that could fly.\nHe drew pictures, constructed models, built full-size prototypes and not one of them\nworked. No sufficiently powerful and lightweight engine then existed. The designs,\nhowever, were brilliant and encouraged the engineers of future times. Leonardo himself\nwas depressed by these failures. But it was hardly his fault. He was trapped in the fifteenth\ncentury.\n\nA similar case occurred in 1939 when a group of engineers calling themselves the\nBritish Interplanetary Society designed a ship to take people to the Moon - using 1939\ntechnology. It was by no means identical to the design of the Apollo spacecraft, which\naccomplished exactly this mission three decades later, but it suggested that a mission to the\nmoon might one day be a practical engineering possibility.\n\nToday we have preliminary designs for ships to take people to the stars. None of\nthese spacecraft is imagined to leave the Earth directly. Rather, they are constructed in\nEarth orbit from where they are launched on their long interstellar journeys. One of them\nwas called Project Orion after the constellation, a reminder that the ship\u2019s ultimate\nobjective was the stars. Orion was designed to utilize explosions of hydrogen bombs,\nnuclear weapons, against an inertial plate, each explosion providing a kind of \u2018putt-putt,\u2019 a\nvast nuclear motorboat in space. Orion seems entirely practical from an engineering point\nof view. By its very nature it would have produced vast quantities of radioactive debris, but\nfor conscientious mission profiles only in the emptiness of interplanetary or interstellar\nspace. Orion was under serious development in the United States until the signing of the\ninternational treaty that forbids the detonation of nuclear weapons in space. This seems to\nme a great pity. The Orion starship is the best use of nuclear weapons I can think of.\n\nProject Daedalus is a recent design of the British Interplanetary Society. It assumes\nthe existence of a nuclear fusion reactor - something much safer as well as more efficient\nthan existing fission power plants. We do not have fusion reactors yet, but they are\nconfidently expected in the next few decades. Orion and Daedalus might travel at 10\npercent the speed of light. A trip to Alpha Centauri, 4.3 light-years away, would then take\nforty-three years, less than a human lifetime. Such ships could not travel close enough to\nthe speed of light for special relativistic time dilation to become important. Even with\noptimistic projections on the development of our technology, it does not seem likely that\nOrion, Daedalus or their ilk will be built before the middle of the twenty-first century,\nalthough if we wished we could build Orion now.\n\nFor voyages beyond the nearest stars, something else must be done. Perhaps Orion\nand Daedalus could be used as multigeneration ships, so those arriving at a planet of\nanother star would be the remote descendants of those who had set out some centuries\nbefore. Or perhaps a safe means of hibernation for humans will be found, so that the space\ntravelers could be frozen and then reawakened centuries later. These nonrelativistic\nstarships, enormously expensive as they would be, look relatively easy to design and build\nand use compared to starships that travel close to the speed of light. Other star systems are\naccessible to the human species, but only after great effort.\n\nFast interstellar spaceflight - with the ship velocity approaching the speed of light -\nis an objective not for a hundred years but for a thousand or ten thousand. But it is in\nprinciple possible. A kind of interstellar ramjet has been proposed by R. W. Bussard which\nscoops up the diffuse matter, mostly hydrogen atoms, that floats between the stars,\naccelerates it into a fusion engine and ejects it out the back. The hydrogen would be used\nboth as fuel and as reaction mass. But in deep space there is only about one atom in every\nten cubic centimeters, a volume the size of a grape. For the ramjet to work, it needs a\nfrontal scoop hundreds of kilometers across. When the ship reaches relativistic velocities,\nthe hydrogen atoms will be moving with respect to the spaceship at close to the speed of\nlight. If adequate precautions are not taken, the spaceship and its passengers will be fried by\nthese induced cosmic rays. One proposed solution uses a laser to strip the electrons off the\ninterstellar atoms and make them electrically charged while they are still some distance\naway, and an extremely strong magnetic field to deflect the charged atoms into the scoop\nand away from the rest of the spacecraft. This is engineering on a scale so far\nunprecedented on Earth. We are talking of engines the size of small worlds.\n\nBut let us spend a moment thinking about such a ship. The Earth gravitationally\nattracts us with a certain force, which if we are falling we experience as an acceleration.\n\nWere we to fall out of a tree - and many of our proto-human ancestors must have done so -\nwe would plummet faster and faster, increasing our fall speed by ten meters (or thirty-two\nfeet) per second, every second. This acceleration, which characterizes the force of gravity\nholding us to the Earth\u2019s surface, is called 1 g, g for Earth gravity. We are comfortable with\naccelerations of 1 g; we have grown up with 1 g. If we lived in an interstellar spacecraft\nthat could accelerate at 1 g, we would find ourselves in a perfectly natural environment. In\nfact, the equivalence between gravitational forces and the forces we would feel in an\naccelerating spaceship is a major feature of Einstein\u2019s later general theory of relativity.\nWith a continuous 1 g acceleration, after one year in space we would be traveling very\nclose to the speed of light [(0.01 km/sec\u2019) x(3x 10\u2019 sec)=3x 10\u00b0 km/sec].\n\nSuppose that such a spacecraft accelerates at 1 g, approaching more and more\nclosely to the speed of light until the midpoint of the journey; and then is turned around and\ndecelerates at 1 g until arriving at its destination. For most of the trip the velocity would be\nvery close to the speed of light and time would slow down enormously. A nearby mission\nobjective, a sun that may have planets, is Barnard\u2019s Star, about six light-years away. It\ncould be reached in about eight years as measured by clocks aboard the ship; the center of\nthe Milky Way, in twenty-one years; M31, the Andromeda galaxy, in twenty-eight years.\nOf course, people left behind on Earth would see things differently. Instead of twenty-one\nyears to the center of the Galaxy, they would measure an elapsed time of 30,000 years.\nWhen we got home, few of our friends would be left to greet us. In principle, such a\njourney, mounting the decimal points ever closer to the speed of light, would even permit\nus to circumnavigate the known universe in some fifty-six years ship time. We would\nreturn tens of billions of years in our future - to find the Earth a charred cinder and the Sun\ndead. Relativistic spaceflight makes the universe accessible to advanced civilizations, but\nonly to those who go on the journey. There seems to be no way for information to travel\nback to those left behind any faster than the speed of light.\n\nThe designs for Orion, Daedalus and the Bussard Ramjet are probably farther from\nthe actual interstellar spacecraft we will one day build than Leonardo\u2019s models are from\ntoday\u2019s supersonic transports. But if we do not destroy ourselves, I believe that we will one\nday venture to the stars. When our solar system is all explored, the planets of other stars\nwill beckon.\n\nSpace travel and time travel are connected. We can travel fast into space only by\ntraveling fast into the future. But what of the past? Could we return to the past and change\nit? Could we make events turn out differently from what the history books assert? We\ntravel slowly into the future all the time, at the rate of one day every day. With relativistic\nspaceflight we could travel fast into the future. But many physicists believe that a voyage\ninto the past is impossible. Even if you had a device that could travel backwards in time,\nthey say, you would be unable to do anything that would make any difference. If you\njourneyed into the past and prevented your parents from meeting, then you would never\nhave been born - which is something of a contradiction, since you clearly exist. Like the\nproof of the irrationality of the square root of two, like the discussion of simultaneity in\nspecial relativity, this is an argument in which the premise is challenged because the\nconclusion seems absurd.\n\nBut other physicists propose that two alternative histories, two equally valid\nrealities, could exist side by side - the one you know and the one in which you were never\nborn. Perhaps time itself has many potential dimensions, despite the fact that we are\ncondemned to experience only one of them. Suppose you could go back into the past and\n\nchange it - by persuading Queen Isabella not to support Christopher Columbus, for\nexample. Then, it is argued, you would have set into motion a different sequence of\nhistorical events, which those you left behind in our time line would never know about. If\nthat kind of time travel were possible, then every imaginable alternative history might in\nsome sense really exist.\n\nHistory consists for the most part of a complex bundle of deeply interwoven\nthreads, social, cultural and economic forces that are not easily unraveled. The countless\nsmall, unpredictable and random events that flow on continually often have no long-range\nconsequences. But some, those occurring at critical junctures or branch points, may change\nthe pattern of history. There may be cases where profound changes can be made by\nrelatively trivial adjustments. The farther in the past such an event is, the more powerful\nmay be its influence - because the longer the lever arm of time becomes.\n\nA polio virus is a tiny microorganmism. We encounter many of them every day. But\nonly rarely, fortunately, does one of them infect one of us and cause this dread disease.\nFranklin D. Roosevelt, the thirty-second President of the United States, had polio. Because\nthe disease was crippling, it may have provided Roosevelt with a greater compassion for\nthe underdog; or perhaps it improved his striving for success. If Roosevelt\u2019s personality had\nbeen different, or if he had never had the ambition to be President of the United States, the\ngreat depression of the 1930\u2019s, World War II and the development of nuclear weapons\nmight just possibly have turned out differently. The future of the world might have been\naltered. But a virus is an insignificant thing, only a millionth of a centimeter across. It is\nhardly anything at all.\n\nOn the other hand, suppose our time traveler had persuaded Queen Isabella that\nColumbus\u2019 geography was faulty, that from Eratosthenes\u2019 estimate of the circumference of\nthe Earth, Columbus could never reach Asia. Almost certainly some other European would\nhave come along within a few decades and sailed west to the New World. Improvements in\nnavigation, the lure of the spice trade and competition among rival European powers made\nthe discovery of America around 1500 more or less inevitable. Of course, there would\ntoday be no nation of Colombia, or District of Columbia or Columbus, Ohio, or Columbia\nUniversity in the Americas. But the overall course of history might have turned out more or\nless the same. In order to affect the future profoundly, a time traveler would probably have\nto intervene in a number of carefully chosen events, to change the weave of history.\n\nIt is a lovely fantasy, to explore those worlds that never were. By visiting them we\ncould truly understand how history works; history could become an experimental science.\nIf an apparently pivotal person had never lived - Plato, say, or Paul, or Peter the Great -\nhow different would the world be? What if the scientific tradition of the ancient Ionian\nGreeks had survived and flourished? That would have required many of the social forces of\nthe time to have been different - including the prevailing belief that slavery was natural and\nright. But what if that light that dawned in the eastern Mediterranean 2,500 years ago had\nnot flickered out? What if science and the experimental method and the dignity of crafts\nand mechanical arts had been vigorously pursued 2,000 years before the Industrial\nRevolution? What if the power of this new mode of thought had been more generally\nappreciated? I sometimes think we might then have saved ten or twenty centuries. Perhaps\nthe contributions of Leonardo would have been made a thousand years ago and those of\nAlbert Einstein five hundred years ago. In such an alternate Earth, Leonardo and Einstein\nwould, of course, never have been born. Too many things would have been different. In\nevery ejaculation there are hundreds of millions of sperm cells, only one of which can\n\nfertilize an egg and produce a member of the next generation of human beings. But which\nsperm succeeds in fertilizing an egg must depend on the most minor and insignificant of\nfactors, both internal and external. If even a little thing had gone differently 2,500 years\nago, none of us would be here today. There would be billions of others living in our place.\n\nIf the Ionian spirit had won, I think we - a different \u2018we,\u2019 of course - might by now\nbe venturing to the stars. Our first survey ships to Alpha Centauri and Barnard\u2019s Star, Sirius\nand Tau Ceti would have returned long ago. Great fleets of interstellar transports would be\nunder construction in Earth orbit - unmanned survey ships, liners for immigrants, immense\ntrading ships to plow the seas of space. On all these ships there would be symbols and\nwriting. If we looked closely, we might see that the language was Greek. And perhaps the\nsymbol on the bow of one of the first starships would be a dodecahedron, with the\ninscription \u2018Starship Theodorus of the Planet Earth.\u2019\n\nIn the time line of our world, things have gone somewhat more slowly. We are not\nyet ready for the stars. But perhaps in another century or two, when the solar system is all\nexplored, we will also have put our planet in order. We will have the will and the resources\nand the technical knowledge to go to the stars. We will have examined from great distances\nthe diversity of other planetary systems, some very much like our own and some extremely\ndifferent. We will know which stars to visit. Our machines and our descendants will then\nskim the light years, the children of Thales and Aristarchus, Leonardo and Einstein.\n\nWe are not yet certain how many planetary systems there are, but there seem to be a\ngreat abundance. In our immediate vicinity, there is not just one, but in a sense four:\nJupiter, Saturn and Uranus each has a satellite system that, in the relative sizes and spacings\nof the moons, resembles closely the planets about the Sun. Extrapolation of the statistics of\ndouble stars which are greatly disparate in mass suggests that almost all single stars like the\nSun should have planetary companions.\n\nWe cannot yet directly see the planets of other stars, tiny points of light swamped in\nthe brilliance of their local suns. But we are becoming able to detect the gravitational\ninfluence of an unseen planet on an observed star. Imagine such a star with a large \u2018proper\nmotion,\u201d moving over decades against the backdrop of more distant constellations; and with\na large planet, the mass of Jupiter, say, whose orbital plane is by chance aligned at right\nangles to our line of sight. When the dark planet is, from our perspective, to the right of the\nstar, the star will be pulled a little to the right, and conversely when the planet is to the left.\nConsequently, the path of the star will be altered, or perturbed, from a straight line to a\nwavy one. The nearest star for which this gravitational perturbation method can be applied\nis Barnard\u2019s Star, the nearest single star. The complex interactions of the three stars in the\nAlpha Centauri system would make the search for a low-mass companion there very\ndifficult. Even for Barnard\u2019s Star, the investigation must be painstaking, a search for\nmicroscopic displacements of position on photographic plates exposed at the telescope over\na period of decades. Two such quests have been performed for planets around Barnard\u2019s\nStar, and both have been by some criteria successful, implying the presence of two or more\nplanets of Jovian mass moving in an orbit (calculated by Kepler\u2019s third law) somewhat\ncloser to their star than Jupiter and Saturn are to the Sun. But unfortunately the two sets of\nobservations seem mutually incompatible. A planetary system around Barnard\u2019s Star may\nwell have been discovered, but an unambiguous demonstration awaits further study.\n\nOther methods of detecting planets around the stars are under development,\nincluding one where the obscuring light from the star is artificially occulted - with a disk in\nfront of a space telescope, or by using the dark edge of the moon as such a disk - and the\n\nreflected light from the planet, no longer hidden by the brightness of the nearby star,\nemerges. In the next few decades we should have definitive answers to which of the\nhundred nearest stars have large planetary companions.\n\nIn recent years, infrared observations have revealed a number of likely preplanetary\ndisk-shaped clouds of gas and dust around some of the nearby stars. Meanwhile, some\nprovocative theoretical studies have suggested that planetary systems are a galactic\ncommonplace. A set of computer investigations has examined the evolution of a flat,\ncondensing disk of gas and dust of the sort that is thought to lead to stars and planets. Small\nlumps of matter - the first condensations in the disk - are injected at random times into the\ncloud. The lumps accrete dust particles as they move. When they become sizable, they also\ngravitationally attract gas, mainly hydrogen, in the cloud. When two moving lumps collide,\nthe computer program makes them stick. The process continues until all the gas and dust\nhas been in this way used up. The results depend on the initial conditions, particularly on\nthe distribution of gas and dust density with distance from the center of the cloud. But for a\nrange of plausible initial conditions, planetary systems - about ten planets, terrestrials close\nto the star, Jovians on the exterior - recognizably like ours are generated. Under other\ncircumstances, there are no planets - just a smattering of asteroids; or there may be Jovian\nplanets near the star; or a Jovian planet may accrete so much gas and dust as to become a\nstar, the origin of a binary star system. It is still too early to be sure, but it seems that a\nsplendid variety of planetary systems is to be found throughout the Galaxy, and with high\nfrequency - all stars must come, we think, from such clouds of gas and dust. There may be\na hundred billion planetary systems in the Galaxy awaiting exploration.\n\nNot one of those worlds will be identical to Earth. A few will be hospitable; most\nwill appear hostile. Many will be achingly beautiful. In some worlds there will be many\nsuns in the daytime sky, many moons in the heavens at night, or great particle ring systems\nsoaring from horizon to horizon. Some moons will be so close that their planet will loom\nhigh in the heavens, covering half the sky. And some worlds will look out onto a vast\ngaseous nebula, the remains of an ordinary star that once was and is no longer. In all those\nskies, rich in distant and exotic constellations, there will be a faint yellow star - perhaps\nbarely seen by the naked eye, perhaps visible only through the telescope - the home star of\nthe fleet of interstellar transports exploring this tiny region of the great Milky Way Galaxy.\n\nThe themes of space and time are, as we have seen, intertwined. Worlds and stars,\nlike people, are born, live and die. The lifetime of a human being is measured in decades;\nthe lifetime of the Sun is a hundred million times longer. Compared to a star, we are like\nmayflies, fleeting ephemeral creatures who live out their whole lives in the course of a\nsingle day. From the point of view of a mayfly, human beings are stolid, boring, almost\nentirely immovable, offering hardly a hint that they ever do anything. From the point of\nview of a star, a human being is a tiny flash, one of billions of brief lives flickering\ntenuously on the surface of a strangely cold, anomalously solid, exotically remote sphere of\nsilicate and iron.\n\nIn all those other worlds in space there are events in progress, occurrences that will\ndetermine their futures. And on our small planet, this moment in history is a historical\nbranch point as profound as the confrontation of the Ionian scientists with the mystics 2,500\nyears ago. What we do with our world in this time will propagate down through the\ncenturies and powerfully determine the destiny of our descendants and their fate, if any,\namong the stars.\n",

All\nthings took their birth from him, the child who shines in the lotus and whose rays\ncause all beings to live.\n\n- An incantation from Ptolemaic Egypt\n\nGod is able to create particles of matter of several sizes and figures .. . and perhaps\nof different densities and forces, and thereby to vary the laws of Nature, and make\nworlds of several sorts in several parts of the Universe. At least, I see nothing of\ncontradiction in all this.\n\n- Isaac Newton, Optics\n\nWe had the sky, up there, all speckled with stars, and we used to lay on our backs\nand look up at them, and discuss about whether they was made, or only just\nhappened.\n\n- Mark Twain, Huckleberry Finn\n\nIhave . . . a terrible need . . . shall I say the word? . . . of religion. Then I go out at\nnight and paint the stars.\n- Vincent van Gogh\n\nTo make an apple pie, you need wheat, apples, a pinch of this and that, and the heat of the\noven. The ingredients are made of molecules - sugar, say, or water. The molecules, in turn,\nare made of atoms - carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and a few others. Where do these atoms\ncome from? Except for hydrogen, they are all made in stars. A star is a kind of cosmic\nkitchen inside which atoms of hydrogen are cooked into heavier atoms. Stars condense\nfrom interstellar gas and dust, which are composed mostly of hydrogen. But the hydrogen\nwas made in the Big Bang, the explosion that began the Cosmos. If you wish to make an\napple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe.\n\nSuppose you take an apple pie and cut it in half; take one of the two pieces, cut it in\nhalf; and, in the spirit of Democritus, continue. How many cuts before you are down to a\nsingle atom? The answer is about ninety successive cuts. Of course, no knife could be sharp\nenough, the pie is too crumbly, and the atom would in any case be too small to see unaided.\nBut there is a way to do it.\n\nAt Cambridge University in England, in the forty-five years centered on 1910, the\nnature of the atom was first understood - partly by shooting pieces of atoms at atoms and\nwatching how they bounce off. A typical atom has a kind of cloud of electrons on the\noutside. Electrons are electrically charged, as their name suggests. The charge is arbitrarily\ncalled negative. Electrons determine the chemical properties of the atom - the glitter of\ngold, the cold feel of iron, the crystal structure of the carbon diamond. Deep inside the\natom, hidden far beneath the electron cloud, is the nucleus, generally composed of\npositively charged protons and electrically neutral neutrons. Atoms are very small - one\n\nhundred million of them end to end would be as large as the tip of your little finger. But the\nnucleus is a hundred thousand times smaller still, which is part of the reason it took so long\nto be discovered.* Nevertheless, most of the mass of an atom is in its nucleus; the electrons\nare by comparison just clouds of moving fluff. Atoms are mainly empty space. Matter is\ncomposed chiefly of nothing.\n\n* It had previously been thought that the protons were uniformly distributed throughout the electron\ncloud, rather than being concentrated in a nucleus of positive charge at the center. The nucleus was discovered\nby Ernest Rutherford at Cambridge when some of the bombarding particles were bounced back in the\ndirection from which they had come. Rutherford commented: \u2018It was quite the most incredible event that has\never happened to me in my life. It was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch [cannon] shell at a piece\nof tissue paper and it came back and hit you.\u2019\n\nIam made of atoms. My elbow, which is resting on the table before me, is made of\natoms. The table is made of atoms. But if atoms are so small and empty and the nuclei\nsmaller still, why does the table hold me up? Why, as Arthur Eddington liked to ask, do the\nnuclei that comprise my elbow not slide effortlessly through the nuclei that comprise the\ntable? Why don\u2019t I wind up on the floor? Or fall straight through the Earth?\n\nThe answer is the electron cloud. The outside of an atom in my elbow has a\nnegative electrical charge. So does every atom in the table. But negative charges repel each\nother. My elbow does not slither through the table because atoms have electrons around\ntheir nuclei and because electrical forces are strong. Everyday life depends on the structure\nof the atom. Turn off the electrical charges and everything crumbles to an invisible fine\ndust. Without electrical forces, there would no longer be things in the universe - merely\ndiffuse clouds of electrons, protons and neutrons, and gravitating spheres of elementary\nparticles, the featureless remnants of worlds.\n\nWhen we consider cutting an apple pie, continuing down beyond a single atom, we\nconfront an infinity of the very small. And when we look up at the night sky, we confront\nan infinity of the very large. These infinities represent an unending regress that goes on not\njust very far, but forever. If you stand between two mirrors - in a barber shop, say - you see\na large number of images of yourself, each the reflection of another. You cannot see an\ninfinity of images because the mirrors are not perfectly flat and aligned, because light does\nnot travel infinitely fast, and because you are in the way. When we talk about infinity we\nare talking about a quantity greater than any number, no matter how large.\n\nThe American mathematician Edward Kasner once asked his nine-year-old nephew\nto invent a name for an extremely large number - ten to the power one hundred (10'), a\none followed by a hundred zeroes. The boy called it a googol. Here it is: 10, 000, 000, 000,\n000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000,\n000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000. You, too, can make up your\nown very large numbers and give them strange names. Try it. It has a certain charm,\nespecially if you happen to be nine.\n\nIf a googol seems large, consider a googolplex. It is ten to the power of a googol -\nthat is, a one followed by a googol zeros. By comparison, the total number of atoms in your\nbody is about 10**, and the total number of elementary particles - protons and neutrons and\nelectrons - in the observable universe is about 10\u00b0\u201d. If the universe were packed solid* with\nneutrons, say, so there was no empty space anywhere, there would still be only about 10'7\nparticles in it, quite a bit more than a googol but trivially small compared to a googolplex.\nAnd yet these numbers, the googol and the googolplex, do not approach, they come\n\nnowhere near, the idea of infinity. A googolplex is precisely as far from infinity as is the\nnumber one. We could try to write out a googolplex, but it is a forlorn ambition. A piece of\npaper large enough to have all the zeroes in a googolplex written out explicitly could not be\nstuffed into the known universe. Happily, there is a simpler and very concise way of\nwriting a googolplex: 10'\"'\u00b0; and even infinity: o (pronounced \u2018infinity\u2019).\n\n* The spirit of this calculation is very old. The opening sentences of Archimedes\u2019 The Sand\nReckoner are: \u2018There are some, King Gelon, who think that the number of the sand is infinite in multitude:\nand I mean by the sand not only that which exists about Syracuse and the rest of Sicily, but also that which is\nfound in every region, whether inhabited or uninhabited. And again, there are some who, without regarding it\nas infinite, yet think that no number has been named which is great enough to exceed its multitude.\u2019\nArchimedes then went on not only to name the number but to calculate it. Later he asked how many grains of\nsand would fit, side by side, into the universe that he knew. His estimate; 10\u00b0, which corresponds, by a\ncurious coincidence, to 10* or so atoms.\n\nIn a burnt apple pie, the char is mostly carbon. Ninety cuts and you come to a\ncarbon atom, with six protons and six neutrons in its nucleus and six electrons in the\nexterior cloud. If we were to pull a chunk out of the nucleus - say, one with two protons and\ntwo neutrons - it would be not the nucleus of a carbon atom, but the nucleus of a helium\natom. Such a cutting or fission of atomic nuclei occurs in nuclear weapons and\nconventional nuclear power plants, although it is not carbon that is split. If you make the\nninety-first cut of the apple pie, if you slice a carbon nucleus, you make not a smaller piece\nof carbon, but something else - an atom with completely different chemical properties. If\nyou cut an atom, you transmute the elements.\n\nBut suppose we go farther. Atoms are made of protons, neutrons and electrons. Can\nwe cut a proton? If we bombard protons at high energies with other elementary particles -\nother protons, say - we begin to glimpse more fundamental units hiding inside the proton.\nPhysicists now propose that so-called elementary particles such as protons and neutrons are\nin fact made of still more elementary particles called quarks, which come in a variety of\n\u2018colors\u2019 and \u2018flavors\u2019, as their properties have been termed in a poignant attempt to make\nthe subnuclear world a little more like home. Are quarks the ultimate constituents of matter,\nor are they too composed of still smaller and more elementary particles? Will we ever come\nto an end in our understanding of the nature of matter, or is there an infinite regression into\nmore and more fundamental particles? This is one of the great unsolved problems in\nscience.\n\nThe transmutation of the elements was pursued in medieval laboratories in a quest\ncalled alchemy. Many alchemists believed that all matter was a mixture of four elementary\nsubstances: water, air, earth and fire, an ancient Ionian speculation. By altering the relative\nproportions of earth and fire, say, you would be able, they thought, to change copper into\ngold. The field swarmed with charming frauds and con men, such as Cagliostro and the\nCount of Saint-Germain, who pretended not only to transmute the elements but also to hold\nthe secret of immortality. Sometimes gold was hidden in a wand with a false bottom, to\nappear miraculously in a crucible at the end of some arduous experimental demonstration.\nWith wealth and immortality the bait, the European nobility found itself transferring large\nsums to the practitioners of this dubious art. But there were more serious alchemists such as\nParacelsus and even Isaac Newton. The money was not altogether wasted - new chemical\nelements, such as phosphorous, antimony and mercury, were discovered. In fact, the origin\nof modern chemistry can be traced directly to these experiments.\n\nThere are ninety-two chemically distinct kinds of naturally occurring atoms. They\nare called the chemical elements and until recently constituted everything on our planet,\nalthough they are mainly found combined into molecules. Water is a molecule made of\nhydrogen and oxygen atoms. Air is made mostly of the atoms nitrogen (N), oxygen (O),\ncarbon (C), hydrogen (H) and argon (Ar), in the molecular forms N2, 02, CO2, H2O and Ar.\nThe Earth itself is a very rich mixture of atoms, mostly silicon,* oxygen, aluminum,\nmagnesium and iron. Fire is not made of chemical elements at all. It is a radiating plasma in\nwhich the high temperature has stripped some of the electrons from their nuclei. Not one of\nthe four ancient Ionian and alchemical \u2018elements\u2019 is in the moder sense an element at all:\none is a molecule, two are mixtures of molecules, and the last is a plasma.\n\n* Silicon is an atom. Silicone is a molecule, one of billions of different varieties containing silicon.\nSilicon and silicone have different properties and applications.\n\nSince the time of the alchemists, more and more elements have been discovered, the\nlatest to be found tending to be the rarest. Many are familiar - those that primarily make up\nthe Earth; or those fundamental to life. Some are solids, some gases, and two (bromine and\nmercury) are liquids at room temperature. Scientists conventionally arrange them in order\nof complexity. The simplest, hydrogen, is element 1; the most complex, uranium is element\n92. Other elements are less familiar - hafnium, erbium, dysprosium and praseodymium,\nsay, which we do not much bump into in everyday life. By and large, the more familiar an\nelement is, the more abundant it is. The Earth contains a great deal of iron and rather little\nyttrium. There are, of course, exceptions to this rule, such as gold or uranium, elements\nprized because of arbitrary economic conventions or aesthetic judgments, or because they\nhave remarkable practical applications.\n\nThe fact that atoms are composed of three kinds of elementary particles - protons,\nneutrons and electrons is a comparatively recent finding. The neutron was not discovered\nuntil 1932. Modern physics and chemistry have reduced the complexity of the sensible\nworld to an astonishing simplicity: three units put together in various patterns make,\nessentially, everything.\n\nThe neutrons, as we have said and as their name suggests, carry no electrical charge.\nThe protons have a positive charge and the electrons an equal negative charge. The\nattraction between the unlike charges of electrons and protons is what holds the atom.\ntogether. Since each atom is electrically neutral, the number of protons in the nucleus must\nexactly equal the number of electrons in the electron cloud. The chemistry of an atom\ndepends only on the number of electrons, which equals the number of protons, and which is\ncalled the atomic number. Chemistry is simply numbers, an idea Pythagoras would have\nliked. If you are an atom with one proton, you are hydrogen; two, helium; three, lithium;\nfour, beryllium; five, boron; six, carbon; seven, nitrogen; eight, oxygen; and so on, up to 92\nprotons, in which case your name is uranium.\n\nLike charges, charges of the same sign, strongly repel one another. We can think of\nit as a dedicated mutual aversion to their own kind, a little as if the world were densely\npopulated by anchorites and misanthropes. Electrons repel electrons. Protons repel protons.\nSo how can a nucleus stick together? Why does it not instantly fly apart? Because there is\nanother force of nature: not gravity, not electricity, but the short-range nuclear force, which,\nlike a set of hooks that engage only when protons and neutrons come very close together,\nthereby overcomes the electrical repulsion among the protons. The neutrons, which\n\ncontribute nuclear forces of attraction and no electrical forces of repulsion, provide a kind\nof glue that helps to hold the nucleus together. Longing for solitude, the hermits have been\nchained to their grumpy fellows and set among others given to indiscriminate and voluble\namiability.\n\nTwo protons and two neutrons are the nucleus of a helium atom, which turns out to\nbe very stable. Three helium nuclei make a carbon nucleus; four, oxygen; five, neon; six,\nmagnesium; seven, silicon; eight, sulfur; and so on. Every time we add one or more protons\nand enough neutrons to keep the nucleus together, we make a new chemical element. If we\nsubtract one proton and three neutrons from mercury, we make gold, the dream of the\nancient alchemists. Beyond uranium there are other elements that do not naturally occur on\nEarth. They are synthesized by human beings and in most cases promptly fall to pieces.\nOne of them, Element 94, is called plutonium and is one of the most toxic substances\nknown. Unfortunately, it falls to pieces rather slowly.\n\nWhere do the naturally occurring elements come from? We might contemplate a\nseparate creation of each atomic species. But the universe, all of it, almost everywhere, is\n99 percent hydrogen and helium,* the two simplest elements. Helium, in fact, was detected\non the Sun before it was found on the Earth - hence its name (from Helios, one of the Greek\nsun gods). Might the other chemical elements have somehow evolved from hydrogen and\nhelium? To balance the electrical repulsion, pieces of nuclear matter would have to be\nbrought very close together so that the short-range nuclear forces are engaged. This can\nhappen only at very high temperatures where the particles are moving so fast that the\nrepulsive force does not have time to act - temperatures of tens of millions of degrees. In\nnature, such high temperatures and attendant high pressures are common only in the insides\nof the stars.\n\n* The Earth is an exception, because our primordial hydrogen, only weakly bound by our planet\u2019s\ncomparatively feeble gravitational attraction, has by now largely escaped to space. Jupiter, with its more\nmassive gravity, has retained at least much of its original complement of the lightest element.\n\nWe have examined our Sun, the nearest star, in various wavelengths from radio\nwaves to ordinary visible light to X-rays, all of which arise only from its outermost layers.\nIt is not exactly a red-hot stone, as Anaxagoras thought, but rather a great ball of hydrogen\nand helium gas, glowing because of its high temperatures, in the same way that a poker\nglows when it is brought to red heat. Anaxagoras was at least partly right. Violent solar\nstorms produce brilliant flares that disrupt radio communications on Earth; and immense\narching plumes of hot gas, guided by the Sun\u2019s magnetic field, the solar prominences,\nwhich dwarf the Earth. The sunspots, sometimes visible to the naked eye at sunset, are\ncooler regions of enhanced magnetic field strength. All this incessant, roiling, turbulent\nactivity is in the comparatively cool visible surface. We see only to temperatures of about\n6,000 degrees. But the hidden interior of the Sun, where sunlight is being generated, is at\n40 million degrees.\n\nStars and their accompanying planets are born in the gravitational collapse of a\ncloud of interstellar gas and dust. The collision of the gas molecules in the interior of the\ncloud heats it, eventually to the point where hydrogen begins to fuse into helium: four\nhydrogen nuclei combine to form a helium nucleus, with an attendant release of a gamma-\nray photon. Suffering alternate absorption and emission by the overlying matter, gradually\nworking its way toward the surface of the star, losing energy at every step, the photon\u2019s\n\nepic journey takes a million years until, as visible light, it reaches the surface and is\nradiated to space. The star has turned on. The gravitational collapse of the prestellar cloud\nhas been halted. The weight of the outer layers of the star is now supported by the high\ntemperatures and pressures generated in the interior nuclear reactions. The Sun has been in\nsuch a stable situation for the past five billion years. Thermonuclear reactions like those in\na hydrogen bomb are powering the Sun in a contained and continuous explosion,\nconverting some four hundred million tons (4 x 10'* grams) of hydrogen into helium every\nsecond. When we look up at night and view the stars, everything we see is shining because\nof distant nuclear fusion.\n\nIn the direction of the star Deneb, in the constellation of Cygnus the Swan, is an\nenormous glowing superbubble of extremely hot gas, probably produced by supernova\nexplosions, the deaths of stars, near the center of the bubble. At the periphery, interstellar\nmatter is compressed by the supernova shock wave, triggering new generations of cloud\ncollapse and star formation. In this sense, stars have parents; and, as is sometimes also true\nfor humans, a parent may die in the birth of the child.\n\nStars like the Sun are born in batches, in great compressed cloud complexes such as\nthe Orion Nebula. Seen from the outside, such clouds seem dark and gloomy. But inside,\nthey are brilliantly illuminated by the hot newborn stars. Later, the stars wander out of their\nnursery to seek their fortunes in the Milky Way, stellar adolescents still surrounded by tufts\nof glowing nebulosity, residues still gravitationally attached of their amniotic gas. The\nPleiades are a nearby example. As in the families of humans, the maturing stars journey far\nfrom home, and the siblings see little of each other. Somewhere in the Galaxy there are\nstars - perhaps dozens of them - that are the brothers and sisters of the Sun, formed from the\nsame cloud complex, some 5 billion years ago. But we do not know which stars they are.\nThey may, for all we know, be on the other side of the Milky Way.\n\nThe conversion of hydrogen into helium in the center of the Sun not only accounts\nfor the Sun\u2019s brightness in photons of visible light; it also produces a radiance of a more\nmysterious and ghostly kind: The Sun glows faintly in neutrinos, which, like photons,\nweigh nothing and travel at the speed of light. But neutrinos are not photons. They are not a\nkind of light. Neutrinos, like protons, electrons and neutrons, carry an intrinsic angular\nmomentum, or spin, while photons have no spin at all. Matter is transparent to neutrinos,\nwhich pass almost effortlessly through the Earth and through the Sun. Only a tiny fraction\nof them is stopped by the intervening matter. As I look up at the Sun for a second, a billion\nneutrinos pass through my eyeball. Of course, they are not stopped at the retina as ordinary\nphotons are but continue unmolested through the back of my head. The curious part is that\nif at night I look down at the ground, toward the place where the Sun would be (if the Earth\nwere not in the way), almost exactly the same number of solar neutrinos pass through my\neyeball, pouring through an interposed Earth which is as transparent to neutrinos as a pane\nof clear glass is to visible light.\n\nIf our knowledge of the solar interior is as complete as we think, and if we also\nunderstand the nuclear physics that makes neutrinos, then we should be able to calculate\nwith fair accuracy how many solar neutrinos we should receive in a given area - such as my\neyeball - in a given unit of time, such as a second. Experimental confirmation of the\ncalculation is much more difficult. Since neutrinos pass directly through the Earth, we\ncannot catch a given one. But for a vast number of neutrinos, a small fraction will interact\nwith matter and in the appropriate circumstances might be detected. Neutrinos can on rare\noccasion convert chlorine atoms into argon atoms, with the same total number of protons\n\nand neutrons. To detect the predicted solar neutrino flux, you need an immense amount of\nchlorine, so American physicists have poured a huge quantity of cleaning fluid into the\nHomestake Mine in Lead, South Dakota. The chlorine is microchemically swept for the\nnewly produced argon. The more argon found, the more neutrinos inferred. These\nexperiments imply that the Sun is dimmer in neutrinos than the calculations predict.\n\nThere is a real and unsolved mystery here. The low solar neutrino flux probably\ndoes not put our view of stellar nucleosynthesis in jeopardy, but it surely means something\nimportant. Proposed explanations range from the hypothesis that neutrinos fall to pieces\nduring their passage between the Sun and the Earth to the idea that the nuclear fires in the\nsolar interior are temporarily banked, sunlight being generated in our time partly by slow\ngravitational contraction. But neutrino astronomy is very new. For the moment we stand\namazed at having created a tool that can peer directly into the blazing heart of the Sun. As\nthe sensitivity of the neutrino telescope improves, it may become possible to probe nuclear\nfusion in the deep interiors of the nearby stars.\n\nBut hydrogen fusion cannot continue forever: in the Sun or any other star, there is\nonly so much hydrogen fuel in its hot interior. The fate of a star, the end of its life cycle,\ndepends very much on its initial mass. If, after whatever matter it has lost to space, a star\nretains two or three times the mass of the Sun, it ends its life cycle in a startlingly different\nmode than the Sun. But the Sun\u2019s fate is spectacular enough. When the central hydrogen\nhas all reacted to form helium, five or six billion years from now, the zone of hydrogen\nfusion will slowly migrate outward, an expanding shell of thermonuclear reactions, until it\nreaches the place where the temperatures are less than about ten million degrees. Then\nhydrogen fusion will shut itself off. Meanwhile the self-gravity of the Sun will force a\nrenewed contraction of its helium-rich core and a further increase in its interior\ntemperatures and pressures. The helium nuclei will be jammed together still more tightly,\nso much so that they begin to stick together, the hooks of their short-range nuclear forces\nbecoming engaged despite the mutual electrical repulsion. The ash will become fuel, and\nthe Sun will be triggered into a second round of fusion reactions.\n\nThis process will generate the elements carbon and oxygen and provide additional\nenergy for the Sun to continue shining for a limited time. A star is a phoenix, destined to\nrise for a time from its own ashes.* Under the combined influence of hydrogen fusion in a\nthin shell far from the solar interior and the high temperature helium fusion in the core, the\nSun will undergo a major change: its exterior will expand and cool. The Sun will become a\nred giant star, its visible surface so far from its interior that the gravity at its surface grows\nfeeble, its atmosphere expanding into space in a kind of stellar gale. When the Sun, ruddy\nand bloated, becomes a red giant, it will envelop and devour the planets Mercury and\nVenus - and probably the Earth as well. The inner solar system will then reside within the\nSun.\n\n* Stars more massive than the Sun achieve higher central temperatures and pressures in their late\nevolutionary stages. They are able to rise more than once from their ashes, using carbon and oxygen as fuel\nfor synthesizing still heavier elements.\n\nBillions of years from now, there will be a last perfect day on Earth. Thereafter the\nSun will slowly become red and distended, presiding over an Earth sweltering even at the\npoles. The Arctic and Antarctic icecaps will melt, flooding the coasts of the world. The\nhigh oceanic temperatures will release more water vapor into the air, increasing cloudiness,\n\nshielding the Earth from sunlight and delaying the end a little. But solar evolution is\ninexorable. Eventually the oceans will boil, the atmosphere will evaporate away to space\nand a catastrophe of the most immense proportions imaginable will overtake our planet.* In\nthe meantime, human beings will almost certainly have evolved into something quite\ndifferent. Perhaps our descendants will be able to control or moderate stellar evolution. Or\nperhaps they will merely pick up and leave for Mars or Europa or Titan or, at last, as\nRobert Goddard envisioned, seek out an uninhabited planet in some young and promising\nplanetary system.\n\n* The Aztecs foretold a time \u2018when the Earth has become tired. . ., when the seed of Earth has\nended.\u2019 On that day, they believed, the Sun will fall from the sky and the stars will be shaken from the\nheavens.\n\nThe Sun\u2019s stellar ash can be reused for fuel only up to a point. Eventually the time\nwill come when the solar interior is all carbon and oxygen, when at the prevailing\ntemperatures and pressures no further nuclear reactions can occur. After the central helium\nis almost all used up, the interior of the Sun will continue its postponed collapse, the\ntemperatures will rise again, triggering a last round of nuclear reactions and expanding the\nsolar atmosphere a little. In its death throes, the Sun will slowly pulsate, expanding and\ncontracting once every few millennia, eventually spewing its atmosphere into space in one\nor more concentric shells of gas. The hot exposed solar interior will flood the shell with\nultraviolet light, inducing a lovely red and blue fluorescence extending beyond the orbit of\nPluto. Perhaps half the mass of the Sun will be lost in this way. The solar system will then\nbe filled with an eerie radiance, the ghost of the Sun, outward bound.\n\nWhen we look around us in our little corner of the Milky Way, we see many stars\nsurrounded by spherical shells of glowing gas, the planetary nebulae. (They have nothing to\ndo with planets, but some of them seemed reminiscent in inferior telescopes of the blue-\ngreen discs of Uranus and Neptune.) They appear as rings, but only because, as with soap\nbubbles, we see more of them at the periphery than at the center. Every planetary nebula is\na token of a star in extremis. Near the central star there may be a retinue of dead worlds, the\nremnants of planets once full of life and now airless and ocean-free, bathed in a wraithlike\nluminance. The remains of the Sun, the exposed solar core at first enveloped in its planetary\nnebula, will be a small hot star, cooling to space, collapsed to a density unheard of on\nEarth, more than a ton per teaspoonful. Billions of years hence, the Sun will become a\ndegenerate white dwarf, cooling like all those points of light we see at the centers of\nplanetary nebulae from high surface temperatures to its ultimate state, a dark and dead\nblack dwarf.\n\nTwo stars of roughly the same mass will evolve roughly in parallel. But a more\nmassive star will spend its nuclear fuel faster, become a red giant sooner, and be first to\nenter the final white dwarf decline. There should therefore be, as there are, many cases of\nbinary stars, one component a red giant, the other a white dwarf. Some such pairs are so\nclose together that they touch, and the glowing stellar atmosphere flows from the distended\nred giant to the compact white dwarf, tending to fall on a particular province of the surface\nof the white dwarf. The hydrogen accumulates, compressed to higher and higher pressures\nand temperatures by the intense gravity of the white dwarf, until the stolen atmosphere of\nthe red giant undergoes thermonuclear reactions, and the white dwarf briefly flares into\nbrilliance. Such a binary is called a nova and has quite a different origin from a supernova.\n\nNovae occur only in binary systems and are powered by hydrogen fusion; supernovae occur\nin single stars and are powered by silicon fusion.\n\nAtoms synthesized in the interiors of stars are commonly returned to the interstellar\ngas. Red giants find their outer atmospheres blowing away into space; planetary nebulae\nare the final stages of Sunlike stars blowing their tops. Supernovae violently eject much of\ntheir stellar mass into space. The atoms returned are, naturally, those most readily made in\nthe thermonuclear reactions in stellar interiors: Hydrogen fuses into helium, helium into\ncarbon, carbon into oxygen and thereafter, in massive stars, by the successive addition of\nfurther helium nuclei, neon, magnesium, silicon, sulfur, and so on are built additions by\nstages, two protons and two neutrons per stage, all the way to iron. Direct fusion of silicon\nalso generates iron, a pair of silicon atoms, each with twenty-eight protons and neutrons,\njoining, at a temperature of billions of degrees, to make an atom of iron with fifty-six\nprotons and neutrons.\n\nThese are all familiar chemical elements. We recognize their names. Such stellar\nnuclear reactions do not readily generate erbium, hafnium, dysprosium, praseodymium or\nyttrium, but rather the elements we know in everyday life, elements returned to the\ninterstellar gas, where they are swept up in a subsequent generation of cloud collapse and\nstar and planet formation. All the elements of the Earth except hydrogen and some helium\nhave been cooked by a kind of stellar alchemy billions of years ago in stars, some of which\nare today inconspicuous white dwarfs on the other side of the Milky Way Galaxy. The\nnitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple\npies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.\n\nSome of the rarer elements are generated in the supernova explosion itself. We have\nrelatively abundant gold and uranium on Earth only because many supernova explosions\nhad occurred just before the solar system formed. Other planetary systems may have\nsomewhat different amounts of our rare elements. Are there planets where the inhabitants\nproudly display pendants of niobium and bracelets of protactinium, while gold is a\nlaboratory curiosity? Would our lives be improved if gold and uranium were as obscure and\nunimportant on Earth as praseodymium?\n\nThe origin and evolution of life are connected in the most intimate way with the\norigin and evolution of the stars. First: The very matter of which we are composed, the\natoms that make life possible, were generated long ago and far away in giant red stars. The\nrelative abundance of the chemical elements found in the Cosmos matches the relative\nabundance of atoms generated in stars so well as to leave little doubt that red giants and\nsupernovae are the ovens and crucibles in which matter has been forged. The Sun is a\nsecond- or third-generation star. All the matter in it, all the matter you see around you, has\nbeen through one or two previous cycles of stellar alchemy. Second: The existence of\ncertain varieties of heavy atoms on the Earth suggests that there was a nearby supernova\nexplosion shortly before the solar system was formed. But this is unlikely to be a mere\ncoincidence; more likely, the shock wave produced by the supernova compressed\ninterstellar gas and dust and triggered the condensation of the solar system. Third: When\nthe Sun turned on, its ultraviolet radiation poured into the atmosphere of the Earth; its\nwarmth generated lightning; and these energy sources sparked the complex organic\nmolecules that led to the origin of life. Fourth: Life on Earth runs almost exclusively on\nsunlight. Plants gather the photons and convert solar to chemical energy. Animals parasitize\nthe plants. Farming is simply the methodical harvesting of sunlight, using plants as\ngrudging intermediaries. We are, almost all of us, solar-powered. Finally, the hereditary\n\nchanges called mutations provide the raw material for evolution. Mutations, from which\nnature selects its new inventory of life forms, are produced in part by cosmic rays - high-\nenergy particles ejected almost at the speed of light in supernova explosions. The evolution\nof life on Earth is driven in part by the spectacular deaths of distant, massive suns.\n\nImagine carrying a Geiger counter and a piece of uranium ore to some place deep\nbeneath the Earth - a gold mine, say, or a lava tube, a cave carved through the Earth by a\nriver of molten rock. The sensitive counter clicks when exposed to gamma rays or to such\nhigh-energy charged particles as protons and helium nuclei. If we bring it close to the\nuranium ore, which is emitting helium nuclei in a spontaneous. nuclear decay, the count\nrate, the number of clicks per minute, increases dramatically. If we drop the uranium ore\ninto a heavy lead canister, the count rate declines substantially; the lead has absorbed the\nuranium radiation. But some clicks can still be heard. Of the remaining counts, a fraction\ncome from natural radioactivity in the walls of the cave. But there are more clicks than can\nbe accounted for by radioactivity. Some of them are caused by high-energy charged\nparticles penetrating the roof. We are listening to cosmic rays, produced in another age in\nthe depths of space. Cosmic rays, mainly electrons and protons, have bombarded the Earth\nfor the entire history of life on our planet. A star destroys itself thousands of light-years\naway and produces cosmic rays that spiral through the Milky Way Galaxy for millions of\nyears until, quite by accident, some of them strike the Earth, and our hereditary material.\nPerhaps some key steps in the development of the genetic code, or the Cambrian explosion,\nor bipedal stature among our ancestors were initiated by cosmic rays.\n\nOn July 4, in the year 1054, Chinese astronomers recorded what they called a \u2018guest\nstar\u2019 in the constellation of Taurus, the Bull. A star never before seen became brighter than\nany star in the sky. Halfway around the world, in the American Southwest, there was then a\nhigh culture, rich in astronomical tradition, that also witnessed this brilliant new star.*\nFrom carbon 14 dating of the remains of a charcoal fire, we know that in the middle\neleventh century some Anasazi, the antecedents of the Hopi of today, were living under an\noverhanging ledge in what is today New Mexico. One of them seems to have drawn on the\ncliff overhang, protected from the weather, a picture of the new star. Its position relative to\nthe crescent moon would have been just as was depicted. There is also a handprint, perhaps\nthe artist\u2019s signature.\n\n* Moslem observers noted it as well. But there is not a word about it in all the chronicles of Europe.\n\nThis remarkable star, 5,000 light-years distant, is now called the Crab Supernova,\nbecause an astronomer centuries later was unaccountably reminded of a crab when looking\nat the explosion remnant through his telescope. The Crab Nebula is the remains of a\nmassive star that blew itself up. The explosion was seen on Earth with the naked eye for\nthree months. Easily visible in broad daylight, you could read by it at night. On the average,\na supernova occurs in a given galaxy about once every century. During the lifetime of a\ntypical galaxy, about ten billion years, a hundred million stars will have exploded - a great\nmany, but still only about one star in a thousand. In the Milky Way, after the event of 1054,\nthere was a supernova observed in 1572, and described by Tycho Brahe, and another, just\nafter, in 1604, described by Johannes Kepler.* Unhappily, no supernova explosions have\nbeen observed in our Galaxy since the invention of the telescope, and astronomers have\nbeen chafing at the bit for some centuries.\n\n* Kepler published in 1606 a book called De Stella Nova, \u2018On the New Star,\u2019 in which he wonders if\na supernova is the result of some random concatenation of atoms in the heavens. He presents what he says is\n\u2018,.. mot my own opinion, but my wife\u2019s: Yesterday, when weary with writing, I was called to supper, and a\nsalad I had asked for was set before me. \u201cIt seems then,\u201d I said, \u201cif pewter dishes, leaves of lettuce, grains of\nsalt, drops of water, vinegar, oil and slices of eggs had been flying about in the air for all eternity, it might at\nlast happen by chance that there would come a salad.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d responded my lovely, \u201cbut not so nice as this\none of mine.\u201d \u2019\n\nSupernovae are now routinely observed in other galaxies. Among my candidates for\nthe sentence that would most thoroughly astonish an astronomer of the early 1900\u2019s is the\nfollowing, from a paper by David Helfand and Knox Long in the December 6, 1979, issue\nof the British journal Nature: \u2018On 5 March, 1979, an extremely intense burst of hard x-rays\nand gamma rays was recorded by the nine interplanetary spacecraft of the burst sensor\nnetwork, and localized by time-of-flight determinations to a position coincident with the\nsupernova remnant N49 in the Large Magellanic Cloud.\u2019 (The Large Magellanic Cloud, so-\ncalled because the first inhabitant of the Northern Hemisphere to notice it was Magellan, is\na small satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, 180,000 light-years distant. There is also, as you\nmight expect, a Small Magellanic Cloud.) However, in the same issue of Nature, E. P.\nMazets and colleagues of the Joffe Institute, Leningrad - who observed this source with the\ngamma-ray burst detector aboard the Venera 11 and 12 spacecraft on their way to land on\nVenus - argue that what is being seen is a flaring pulsar only a few hundred light-years\naway. But despite the close agreement in position Helfand and Long do not insist that the\ngamma-ray outburst is associated with the supernova remnant. They charitably consider\nmany alternatives, including the surprising possibility that the source lies within the solar\nsystem. Perhaps it is the exhaust of an alien starship on its long voyage home. But a rousing\nof the stellar fires in N49 is a simpler hypothesis: we are sure there are such things as\nsupernovae.\n\nThe fate of the inner solar system as the Sun becomes a red giant is grim enough.\nBut at least the planets will never be melted and frizzled by an erupting supernova. That is\na fate reserved for planets near stars more massive than the Sun. Since such stars with\nhigher temperatures and pressures run rapidly through their store of nuclear fuel, their\nlifetimes are much shorter than the Sun\u2019s. A star tens of times more massive than the Sun\ncan stably convert hydrogen to helium for only a few million years before moving briefly\non to more exotic nuclear reactions. Thus there is almost certainly not enough time for the\nevolution of advanced forms of life on any accompanying planets; and it will be rare that\nbeings elsewhere can ever know that their star will become a supernova: if they live long\nenough to understand supernovae, their star is unlikely to become one.\n\nThe essential preliminary to a supernova explosion is the generation by silicon\nfusion of a massive iron core. Under enormous pressure, the free electrons in the stellar\ninterior are forceably melded with the protons of the iron nuclei, the equal and opposite\nelectrical charges canceling each other out; the inside of the star is turned into a single giant\natomic nucleus, occupying a much smaller volume than the precursor electrons and iron\nnuclei. The core implodes violently, the exterior rebounds and a supernova explosion\nresults. A supernova can be brighter than the combined radiance of all the other stars in the\ngalaxy within which it is embedded. All those recently hatched massive blue-white\nsupergiant stars in Orion are destined in the next few million years to become supernovae, a\ncontinuing cosmic fireworks in the constellation of the hunter.\n\nThe awesome supernova explosion ejects into space most of the matter of the\n\nprecursor star - a little residual hydrogen and helium and significant amounts of other\natoms, carbon and silicon, iron and uranium. Remaining is a core of hot neutrons, bound\ntogether by nuclear forces, a single, massive atomic nucleus with an atomic weight about\n10\u00b0, a sun thirty kilometers across; a tiny, shrunken, dense, withered stellar fragment, a\nrapidly rotating neutron star. As the core of a massive red giant collapses to form such a\nneutron star, it spins faster. The neutron star at the center of the Crab Nebula is an immense\natomic nucleus, about the size of Manhattan, spinning thirty times a second. Its powerful\nmagnetic field, amplified during the collapse, traps charged particles rather as the much\ntinier magnetic field of Jupiter does. Electrons in the rotating magnetic field emit beamed\nradiation not only at radio frequencies but in visible light as well. If the Earth happens to lie\nin the beam of this cosmic lighthouse, we see it flash once each rotation. This is the reason\nit is called a pulsar. Blinking and ticking like a cosmic metronome, pulsars keep far better\ntime than the most accurate ordinary clock. Long-term timing of the radio pulse rate of\nsome pulsars, for instance, one called PSR 0329+54, suggests that these objects may have\none or more small planetary companions. It is perhaps conceivable that a planet could\nsurvive the evolution of a star into a pulsar; or a planet could be captured at a later time. I\nwonder how the sky would look from the surface of such a planet.\n\nNeutron star matter weighs -about the same as an ordinary mountain per\nteaspoonful - so much that if you had a piece of it and let it go (you could hardly do\notherwise), it might pass effortlessly through the Earth like a falling stone through air,\ncarving a hole for itself completely through our planet and emerging out the other side -\nperhaps in China. People there might be out for a stroll, minding their own business, when\na tiny lump of neutron star plummets out of the ground, hovers for a moment, and then\nreturns beneath the Earth, providing at least a diversion from the routine of the day. Ifa\npiece of neutron star matter were dropped from nearby space, with the Earth rotating\nbeneath it as it fell, it would plunge repeatedly through the rotating Earth, punching\nhundreds of thousands of holes before friction with the interior of our planet stopped the\nmotion. Before it comes to rest at the center of the Earth, the inside of our planet might\nlook briefly like a Swiss cheese until the subterranean flow of rock and metal healed the\nwounds. It is just as well that large lumps of neutron star matter are unknown on Earth. But\nsmall lumps are everywhere. The awesome power of the neutron star is lurking in the\nnucleus of every atom, hidden in every teacup and dormouse, every breath of air, every\napple pie. The neutron star teaches us respect for the commonplace.\n\nA star like the Sun will end its days, as we have seen, as a red giant and then a white\ndwarf. A collapsing star twice as massive as the Sun will become a supernova and then a\nneutron star. But a more massive star, left, after its supernova phase, with, say, five times\nthe Sun\u2019s mass, has an even more remarkable fate reserved for it - its gravity will turn it\ninto a black hole. Suppose we had a magic gravity machine - a device with which we could\ncontrol the Earth\u2019s gravity, perhaps by turning a dial. Initially the dial is set at 1 g* and\neverything behaves as we have grown up to expect. The animals and plants on Earth and\nthe structures of our buildings are all evolved or designed for 1 g. If the gravity were much\nless, there might be tall, spindly shapes that would not be tumbled or crushed by their own\nweight. If the gravity were much more, plants and animals and architecture would have to\nbe short and squat and sturdy in order not to collapse. But even in a fairly strong gravity\nfield, light would travel in a straight line, as it does, of course, in everyday life.\n\n* 1 gis the acceleration experienced by falling objects on the Earth, almost 10 meters per second\n\nevery second. A falling rock will reach a speed of 10 meters per second after one second of fall, 20 meters per\nsecond after two seconds, and so on until it strikes the ground or is slowed by friction with the air. On a world\nwhere the gravitational acceleration was much greater, falling bodies would increase their speed by\ncorrespondingly greater amounts. On a world with 10 g acceleration, a rock would travel 10 x 10 m/sec or\nalmost 100 m/sec after the first second, 200 m/sec after the next second, and so on. A slight stumble could be\nfatal. The acceleration due to gravity should always be written with a lowercase g, to distinguish it from the\nNewtonian gravitational constant, G, which is a measure of the strength of gravity everywhere in the universe,\nnot merely on whatever world or sun we are discussing. (The Newtonian relationship of the two quantities is\nF = mg = GMm/r; g = GM/r\u2019, where F is the gravitational force, M is the mass of the planet or star, m is the\nmass of the falling object, and r is the distance from the falling object to the center of the planet or star.)\n\nConsider a possibly typical group of Earth beings, Alice and her friends from Alice\nin Wonderland at the Mad Hatter\u2019s tea party. As we lower the gravity, things weigh less.\nNear 0 g the slightest motion sends our friends floating and tumbling up in the air. Spilled\ntea - or any other liquid - forms throbbing spherical globs in the air: the surface tension of\nthe liquid overwhelms gravity. Balls of tea are everywhere. If now we dial 1 g again, we\nmake a rain of tea. When we increase the gravity a little - from 1 g to, say, 3 or 4 g\u2019s -\neveryone becomes immobilized: even moving a paw requires enormous effort. As a\nkindness we remove our friends from the domain of the gravity machine before we dial\nhigher gravities still. The beam from a lantern travels in a perfectly straight line (as nearly\nas we can see) at a few g\u2019s, as it does at 0 g. At 1000 g\u2019s, the beam is still straight, but trees\nhave become squashed and flattened; at 100,000 g\u2019s, rocks are crushed by their own\nweight. Eventually, nothing at all survives except, through a special dispensation, the\nCheshire cat. When the gravity approaches a billion g\u2019s, something still more strange\nhappens. The beam of light, which has until now been heading straight up into the sky, is\nbeginning to bend. Under extremely strong gravitational accelerations, even light is\naffected. If we increase the gravity still more, the light is pulled back to the ground near us.\nNow the cosmic Cheshire cat has vanished; only its gravitational grin remains.\n\nWhen the gravity is sufficiently high, nothing, not even light, can get out. Such a\nplace is called a black hole. Enigmatically indifferent to its surroundings, it is a kind of\ncosmic Cheshire cat. When the density and gravity become sufficiently high, the black hole\nwinks out and disappears from our universe. That is why it is called black: no light can\nescape from it. On the inside, because the light is trapped down there, things may be\nattractively well-lit. Even if a black hole is invisible from the outside, its gravitational\npresence can be palpable. If, on an interstellar voyage, you are not paying attention, you\ncan find yourself drawn into it irrevocably, your body stretched unpleasantly into a long,\nthin thread. But the matter accreting into a disk surrounding the black hole would be a sight\nworth remembering, in the unlikely case that you survived the trip.\n\nThermonuclear reactions in the solar interior support the outer layers of the Sun and\npostpone for billions of years a catastrophic gravitational collapse. For white dwarfs, the\npressure of the electrons, stripped from their nuclei, holds the star up. For neutron stars, the\npressure of the neutrons staves off gravity. But for an elderly star left after supernova\nexplosions and other impetuosities with more than several times the Sun\u2019s mass, there are\nno forces known that can prevent collapse. The star shrinks incredibly, spins, reddens and\ndisappears. A star twenty times the mass of the Sun will shrink until it is the size of Greater\nLos Angeles; the crushing gravity becomes 10'\u00b0 g\u2019s, and the star slips through a self-\ngenerated crack in the space-time continuum and vanishes from our universe.\n\nBlack holes were first thought of by the English astronomer John Michell in 1783.\n\nBut the idea seemed so bizarre that it was generally ignored until quite recently. Then, to\nthe astonishment of many, including many astronomers, evidence was actually found for\nthe existence of black holes in space. The Earth\u2019s atmosphere is opaque to X-rays. To\ndetermine whether astronomical objects emit such short wavelengths of light, an X-ray\ntelescope must be carried aloft. The first X-ray observatory was an admirably international\neffort, orbited by the United States from an Italian launch platform in the Indian Ocean off\nthe coast of Kenya and named Uhuru, the Swahili word for \u2018freedom\u2019. In 1971, Uhuru\ndiscovered a remarkably bright X-ray source in the constellation of Cygnus, the Swan,\nflickering on and off a thousand times a second. The source, called Cygnus X-1, must\ntherefore be very small. Whatever the reason for the flicker, information on when to turn on\nand off can cross Cyg X-1 no faster than the speed of light, 300,000 km/sec. Thus Cyg X-1\ncan be no larger than [300,000 km/sec] x [(1/ 1000) sec] = 300 kilometers across.\nSomething the size of an asteroid is a brilliant, blinking source of X-rays, visible over\ninterstellar distances. What could it possibly be? Cyg X-1 is in precisely the same place in\nthe sky as a hot blue supergiant star, which reveals itself in visible light to have a massive\nclose but unseen companion that gravitationally tugs it first in one direction and then in\nanother. The companion\u2019s mass is about ten times that of the Sun. The supergiant is an\nunlikely source of X-rays, and it is tempting to identify the companion inferred in visible\nlight with the source detected in X-ray light. But an invisible object weighing ten times\nmore than the Sun and collapsed into a volume the size of an asteroid can only be a black\nhole. The X-rays are plausibly generated by friction in the disk of gas and dust accreted\naround Cyg X-1 from its supergiant companion. Other stars called V861 Scorpii, GX339-4,\nSS433, and Circinus X-2 are also candidate black holes. Cassiopeia A is the remnant of a\nsupernova whose light should have reached the Earth in the seventeenth century, when\nthere were a fair number of astronomers. Yet no one reported the explosion. Perhaps, as I.\nS. Shklovskii has suggested, there is a black hole hiding there, which ate the exploding\nstellar core and damped the fires of the supernova. Telescopes in space are the means for\nchecking these shards and fragments of data that may be the spoor, the trail, of the\nlegendary black hole.\n\nA helpful way to understand black holes is to think about the curvature of space.\nConsider a flat, flexible, lined two-dimensional surface, like a piece of graph paper made of\nrubber. If we drop a small mass, the surface is deformed or puckered. A marble rolls around\nthe pucker in an orbit like that of a planet around the Sun. In this interpretation, which we\nowe to Einstein, gravity is a distortion in the fabric of space. In our example, we see two-\ndimensional space warped by mass into a third physical dimension. Imagine we live in a\nthree-dimensional universe, locally distorted by matter into a fourth physical dimension\nthat we cannot perceive directly. The greater the local mass, the more intense the local\ngravity, and the more severe the pucker, distortion or warp of space. In this analogy, a black\nhole is a kind of bottomless pit. What happens if you fall in? As seen from the outside, you\nwould take an infinite amount of time to fall in, because all your clocks - mechanical and\nbiological would be perceived as having stopped. But from your point of view, all your\nclocks would be ticking away normally. If you could somehow survive the gravitational\ntides and radiation flux, and (a likely assumption) if the black hole were rotating, it is just\npossible that you might emerge in another part of space-time - somewhere else in space,\nsomewhere else in time. Such worm holes in space, a little like those in an apple, have been\nseriously suggested, although they have by no means been proved to exist. Might gravity\ntunnels provide a kind of interstellar or intergalactic subway, permitting us to travel to\n\ninaccessible places much more rapidly than we could in the ordinary way? Can black holes\nserve as time machines, carrying us to the remote past or the distant future? The fact that\nsuch ideas are being discussed even semi-seriously shows how surreal the universe may be.\n\nWeare, in the most profound sense, children of the Cosmos. Think of the Sun\u2019s\nheat on your upturned face on a cloudless summer\u2019s day; think how dangerous it is to gaze\nat the Sun directly. From 150 million kilometers away, we recognize its power. What\nwould we feel on its seething self-luminous surface, or immersed in its heart of nuclear\nfire? The Sun warms us and feeds us and permits us to see. It fecundated the Earth. It is\npowerful beyond human experience. Birds greet the sunrise with an audible ecstasy. Even\nsome one-celled organisms know to swim to the light. Our ancestors worshiped the Sun,*\nand they were far from foolish. And yet the Sun is an ordinary, even a mediocre star. If we\nmust worship a power greater than ourselves, does it not make sense to revere the Sun and\nstars? Hidden within every astronomical investigation, sometimes so deeply buried that the\nresearcher himself is unaware of its presence, lies a kernel of awe.\n\n* The early Sumerian pictograph for god was an asterisk, the symbol of the stars. The Aztec word for\ngod was Teotl, and its glyph was a representation of the Sun. The heavens were called the Teoatl, the godsea,\nthe cosmic ocean.\n\nThe Galaxy is an unexplored continent filled with exotic beings of stellar\ndimensions. We have made a preliminary reconnaissance and have encountered some of the\ninhabitants. A few of them resemble beings we know. Others are bizarre beyond our most\nunconstrained fantasies. But we are at the very beginning of our exploration. Past voyages\nof discovery suggest that many of the most interesting inhabitants of the galactic continent\nremain as yet unknown and unanticipated. Not far outside the Galaxy there are almost\ncertainly planets, orbiting stars in the Magellanic Clouds and in the globular clusters that\nsurround the Milky Way. Such worlds would offer a breathtaking view of the Galaxy rising\n- an enormous spiral form comprising 400 billion stellar inhabitants, with collapsing gas\nclouds, condensing planetary systems, luminous supergiants, stable middle-aged stars, red\ngiants, white dwarfs, planetary nebulae, novae, supernovae, neutron stars and black holes. It\nwould be clear from such a world, as it is beginning to be clear from ours, how our matter,\nour form and much of our character is determined by the deep connection between life and\nthe Cosmos.\n",

By it the gods go to the dwelling of the great\nThunderer and his royal abode . . . Here the famous and mighty inhabitants of\nheaven have their homes. This is the region which I might make bold to call the\nPalatine [Way] of the Great Sky.\n\n- Ovid, Metamorphoses (Rome, first century)\n\nSome foolish men declare that a Creator made the world.

And it is based on the principles . . .\n\n- The Mahapurana (The Great Legend), Jinasena (India, ninth century)\n\nTen or twenty billion years ago, something happened - the Big Bang, the event that began\nour universe. Why it happened is the greatest mystery we know. That it happened is\nreasonably clear. All the matter and energy now in the universe was concentrated at\nextremely high density - a kind of cosmic egg, reminiscent of the creation myths of many\ncultures - perhaps into a mathematical point with no dimensions at all. It was not that all the\nmatter and energy were squeezed into a minor corner of the present universe; rather, the\nentire universe, matter and energy and the space they fill, occupied a very small volume.\nThere was not much room for events to happen in.\n\nIn that titanic cosmic explosion, the universe began an expansion which has never\nceased. It is misleading to describe the expansion of the universe as a sort of distending\nbubble viewed from the outside. By definition, nothing we can ever know about was\noutside. It is better to think of it from the inside, perhaps with grid lines imagined to adhere\nto the moving fabric of space expanding uniformly in all directions. As space stretched, the\n\nmatter and energy in the universe expanded with it and rapidly cooled. The radiation of the\ncosmic fireball, which, then as now, filled the universe, moved through the spectrum - from\ngamma rays to X-rays to ultraviolet light; through the rainbow colors of the visible\nspectrum; into the infrared and radio regions. The remnants of that fireball, the cosmic\nbackground radiation, emanating from all parts of the sky can be detected by radio\ntelescopes today. In the early universe, space was brilliantly illuminated. As time passed,\nthe fabric of space continued to expand, the radiation cooled and, in ordinary visible light,\nfor the first time space became dark, as it is today.\n\nThe early universe was filled with radiation and a plenum of matter, originally\nhydrogen and helium, formed from elementary particles in the dense primeval fireball.\nThere was very little to see, if there had been anyone around to do the seeing. Then little\npockets of gas, small nonuniformities, began to grow. Tendrils of vast gossamer gas clouds\nformed, colonies of great lumbering, slowly spinning things, steadily brightening, each a\nkind of beast eventually to contain a hundred billion shining points. The largest\nrecognizable structures in the universe had formed. We see them today. We ourselves\ninhabit some lost comer of one. We call them galaxies.\n\nAbout a billion years after the Big Bang, the distribution of matter in the universe\nhad become a little lumpy, perhaps because the Big Bang itself had not been perfectly\nuniform. Matter was more densely compacted in these lumps than elsewhere. Their gravity\ndrew to them substantial quantities of nearby gas, growing clouds of hydrogen and helium\nthat were destined to become clusters of galaxies. A very small initial nonuniformity\nsuffices to produce substantial condensations of matter later on.\n\nAs the gravitational collapse continued, the primordial galaxies spun increasingly\nfaster, because of the conservation of angular momentum. Some flattened, squashing\nthemselves along the axis of rotation where gravity is not balanced by centrifugal force.\nThese became the first spiral galaxies, great rotating pin-wheels of matter in open space.\nOther protogalaxies with weaker gravity or less initial rotation flattened very little and\nbecame the first elliptical galaxies. There are similar galaxies, as if stamped from the same\nmold, all over the Cosmos because these simple laws of nature - gravity and the\nconservation of angular momentum - are the same all over the universe. The physics that\nworks for falling bodies and pirouetting ice skaters down here in the microcosm of the\nEarth makes galaxies up there in the macrocosm of the universe.\n\nWithin the nascent galaxies, much smaller clouds were also experiencing\ngravitational collapse; interior temperatures became very high, thermonuclear reactions\nwere initiated, and the first stars turned on. The hot, massive young stars evolved rapidly,\nprofligates carelessly spending their capital of hydrogen fuel, soon ending their lives in\nbrilliant supernova explosions, returning thermonuclear ash - helium, carbon, oxygen and\nheavier elements - to the interstellar gas for subsequent generations of star formation.\nSupermova explosions of massive early stars produced successive overlapping shock waves\nin the adjacent gas, compressing the intergalactic medium and accelerating the generation\nof clusters of galaxies. Gravity is opportunistic, amplifying even small condensations of\nmatter. Supernova shock waves may have contributed to accretions of matter at every scale.\nThe epic of cosmic evolution had begun, a hierarchy in the condensation of matter from the\ngas of the Big Bang - clusters of galaxies, galaxies, stars, planets, and, eventually, life and\nan intelligence able to understand a little of the elegant process responsible for its origin.\n\nClusters of galaxies fill the universe today. Some are insignificant, paltry collections\nof a few dozen galaxies. The affectionately titled \u2018Local Group\u2019 contains only two large\n\ngalaxies of any size, both spirals: the Milky Way and M31. Other clusters run to immense\nhordes of thousands of galaxies in mutual gravitational embrace. There is some hint that the\nVirgo cluster contains tens of thousands of galaxies.\n\nOn the largest scale, we inhabit a universe of galaxies, perhaps a hundred billion\nexquisite examples of cosmic architecture and decay, with order and disorder equally\nevident: normal spirals, turned at various angles to our earthly line of sight (face-on we see\nthe spiral arms, edge-on, the central lanes of gas and dust in which the arms are formed);\nbarred spirals with a river of gas and dust and stars running through the center, connecting\nthe spiral arms on opposite sides; stately giant elliptical galaxies containing more than a\ntrillion stars which have grown so large because they have swallowed and merged with\nother galaxies; a plethora of dwarf ellipticals, the galactic midges, each containing some\npaltry millions of suns; an immense variety of mysterious irregulars, indications that in the\nworld of galaxies there are places where something has gone ominously wrong; and\ngalaxies orbiting each other so closely that their edges are bent by the gravity of their\ncompanions and in some cases streamers of gas and stars are drawn out gravitationally, a\nbridge between the galaxies.\n\nSome clusters have their galaxies arranged in an unambiguously spherical\ngeometry; they are composed chiefly of ellipticals, often dominated by one giant elliptical,\nthe presumptive galactic cannibal. Other clusters with a far more disordered geometry have,\ncomparatively, many more spirals and irregulars. Galactic collisions distort the shape of an\noriginally spherical cluster and may also contribute to the genesis of spirals and irregulars\nfrom ellipticals. The form and abundance of the galaxies have a story to tell us of ancient\nevents on the largest possible scale, a story we are just beginning to read.\n\nThe development of high-speed computers make possible numerical experiments on\nthe collective motion of thousands or tens of thousands of points, each representing a star,\neach under the gravitational influence of all the other points. In some cases, spiral arms\nform all by themselves in a galaxy that has already flattened to a disk. Occasionally a spiral\narm may be produced by the close gravitational encounter of two galaxies, each of course\ncomposed of billions of stars. The gas and dust diffusely spread through such galaxies will\ncollide and become warmed. But when two galaxies collide, the stars pass effortlessly by\none another, like bullets through a swarm of bees, because a galaxy is made mostly of\nnothing and the spaces between the stars are vast. Nevertheless, the configuration of the\ngalaxies can be distorted severely. A direct impact on one galaxy by another can send the\nconstituent stars pouring and careening through intergalactic space, a galaxy wasted. When\na small galaxy runs into a larger one face-on it can produce one of the loveliest of the rare\nirregulars, a ring galaxy thousands of light-years across, set against the velvet of\nintergalactic space. It is a splash in the galactic pond, a temporary configuration of\ndisrupted stars, a galaxy with a central piece torn out.\n\nThe unstructured blobs of irregular galaxies, the arms of spiral galaxies and the\ntorus of ring galaxies exist for only a few frames in the cosmic motion picture, then\ndissipate, often to be reformed again. Our sense of galaxies as ponderous rigid bodies is\nmistaken. They are fluid structures with 100 billion stellar components. Just as a human.\nbeing, a collection of 100 trillion cells, is typically in a steady state between synthesis and\ndecay and is more than the sum of its parts, so also is a galaxy.\n\nThe suicide rate among galaxies is high. Some nearby examples, tens or hundreds of\nmillions of light-years away, are powerful sources of X-rays, infrared radiation and radio\nwaves, have extremely luminous cores and fluctuate in brightness on time scales of weeks.\n\nSome display jets of radiation, thousand-light-year-long plumes, and disks of dust in\nsubstantial disarray. These galaxies are blowing themselves up. Black holes ranging from\nmillions to billions of times more massive than the Sun are suspected in the cores of giant\nelliptical galaxies such as NGC 6251 and M87. There is something very massive, very\ndense, and very small ticking and purring inside M87 - from a region smaller than the solar\nsystem. A black hole is implicated. Billions of light-years away are still more tumultuous\nobjects, the quasars, which may be the colossal explosions of young galaxies, the mightiest\nevents in the history of the universe since the Big Bang itself.\n\nThe word \u2018quasar\u2019 is an acronym for \u2018quasi-stellar radio source.\u2019 After it became\nclear that not all of them were powerful radio sources, they were called QSO\u2019s (\u2018quasi-\nstellar objects\u2019). Because they are starlike in appearance, they were naturally thought to be\nstars within our own galaxy. But spectroscopic observations of their red shift (see below)\nshow them likely to be immense distances away. They seem to partake vigorously in the\nexpansion of the universe, some receding from us at more than 90 percent the speed of\nlight. If they are very far, they must be intrinsically extremely bright to be visible over such\ndistances; some are as bright as a thousand supernovae exploding at once. Just as for Cyg\nX-1, their rapid fluctuations show their enormous brightness to be confined to a very small\nvolume, in this case less than the size of the solar system. Some remarkable process must\nbe responsible for the vast outpouring of energy in a quasar. Among the proposed\nexplanations are: (1) quasars are monster versions of pulsars, with a rapidly rotating,\nsupermassive core connected to a strong magnetic field; (2) quasars are due to multiple\ncollisions of millions of stars densely packed into the galactic core, tearing away the outer\nlayers and exposing to full view the billion-degree temperatures of the interiors of massive\nstars; (3), a related idea, quasars are galaxies in which the stars are so densely packed that a\nsupernova explosion in one will rip away the outer layers of another and make it a\nsupernova, producing a stellar chain reaction; (4) quasars are powered by the violent mutual\nannihilation of matter and antimatter, somehow preserved in the quasar until now; (5) a\nquasar is the energy released when gas and dust and stars fall into an immense black hole in\nthe core of such a galaxy, perhaps itself the product of ages of collision and coalescence of\nsmaller black holes; and (6) quasars are \u2018white holes,\u2019 the other side of black holes, a\nfunneling and eventual emergence into view of matter pouring into a multitude of black\nholes in other parts of the universe, or even in other universes.\n\nIn considering the quasars, we confront profound mysteries. Whatever the cause of\na quasar explosion, one thing seems clear: such a violent event must produce untold havoc.\nIn every quasar explosion millions of worlds - some with life and the intelligence to\nunderstand what is happening - may be utterly destroyed. The study of the galaxies reveals\na universal order and beauty. It also shows us chaotic violence on a scale hitherto\nundreamed of. That we live in a universe which permits life is remarkable. That we live in\none which destroys galaxies and stars and worlds is also remarkable. The universe seems\nneither benign nor hostile, merely indifferent to the concerns of such puny creatures as we.\n\nEven a galaxy so seemingly well-mannered as the Milky Way has its stirrings and\nits dances. Radio observations show two enormous clouds of hydrogen gas, enough to\nmake millions of suns, plummeting out from the galactic core, as if a mild explosion\nhappened there every now and then. A high-energy astronomical observatory in Earth orbit\nhas found the galactic core to be a strong source of a particular gamma ray spectral line,\nconsistent with the idea that a massive black hole is hidden there. Galaxies like the Milky\nWay may represent the staid middle age in a continuous evolutionary sequence, which\n\nencompasses, in their violent adolescence, quasars, and exploding galaxies: because the\nquasars are so distant, we see them in their youth, as they were billions of years ago.\n\nThe stars of the Milky Way move with systematic grace. Globular clusters plunge\nthrough the galactic plane and out the other side, where they slow, reverse and hurtle back\nagain. If we could follow the motion of individual stars bobbing about the galactic plane,\nthey would resemble a froth of popcorn. We have never seen a galaxy change its form\nsignificantly only because it takes so long to move. The Milky Way rotates once every\nquarter billion years. If we were to speed the rotation, we would see that the Galaxy is a\ndynamic, almost organic entity, in some ways resembling a multi-cellular organism. Any\nastronomical photograph of a galaxy is merely a snapshot of one stage in its ponderous\nmotion and evolution.* The inner region of a galaxy rotates as a solid body. But, beyond\nthat, like the planets around the Sun following Kepler\u2019s third law, the outer provinces rotate\nprogressively more slowly. The arms have a tendency to wind up around the core in an\never-tightening spiral, and gas and dust accumulate in spiral patterns of greater density,\nwhich are in turn the locales for the formation of young, hot, bright stars, the stars that\noutline the spiral arms. These stars shine for ten million years or so, a period corresponding\nto only 5 percent of a galactic rotation. But as the stars that outline a spiral arm burn out,\nnew stars and their associated nebulae are formed just behind them, and the spiral pattern\npersists. The stars that outline the arms do not survive even a single galactic rotation; only\nthe spiral pattern remains.\n\n* This is not quite true. The near side of a galaxy is tens of thousands of light-years closer to us than\nthe far side; thus we see the front as it was tens of thousands of years before the back. But typical events in\ngalactic dynamics occupy tens of millions of years, so the error in thinking of an image of a galaxy as frozen\nin one moment of time is small.\n\nThe speed of any given star around the center of the Galaxy is generally not the\nsame as that of the spiral pattern. The Sun has been in and out of spiral arms often in the\ntwenty times it has gone around the Milky Way at 200 kilometers per second (roughly half\na million miles per hour). On the average, the Sun and the planets spend forty million years\nin a spiral arm, eighty million outside, another forty million in, and so on. Spiral arms\noutline the region where the latest crop of newly hatched stars is being formed, but not\nnecessarily where such middle-aged stars as the Sun happen to be. In this epoch, we live\nbetween spiral arms.\n\nThe periodic passage of the solar system through spiral arms may conceivably have\nhad important consequences for us. About ten million years ago, the Sun emerged from the\nGould Belt complex of the Orion Spiral Arm, which is now a little less than a thousand\nlight-years away. (Interior to the Orion arm is the Sagittarius arm; beyond the Orion arm is\nthe Perseus arm.) When the Sun passes through a spiral arm it is more likely than it is at\npresent to enter into gaseous nebulae and interstellar dust clouds and to encounter objects\nof substellar mass. It has been suggested that the major ice ages on our planet, which recur\nevery hundred million years or so, may be due to the interposition of interstellar matter\nbetween the Sun and the Earth. W. Napier and S. Clube have proposed that a number of the\nmoons, asteroids, comets and circumplanetary rings in the solar system once freely\nwandered in interstellar space until they were captured as the Sun plunged through the\nOrion spiral arm. This is an intriguing idea, although perhaps not very likely. But it is\ntestable. All we need do is procure a sample of, say, Phobos or a comet and examine its\n\nmagnesium isotopes. The relative abundance of magnesium isotopes (all sharing the same\nnumber of protons, but having differing numbers of neutrons) depends on the precise\nsequence of stellar nucleosynthetic events, including the timing of nearby supernova\nexplosions, that produced any particular sample of magnesium. In a different corner of the\nGalaxy, a different sequence of events should have occurred and a different ratio of\nmagnesium isotopes should prevail.\n\nThe discovery of the Big Bang and the recession of the galaxies came from a\ncommonplace of nature called the Doppler effect. We are used to it in the physics of sound.\nAn automobile driver speeding by us blows his horn. Inside the car, the driver hears a\nsteady blare at a fixed pitch. But outside the car, we hear a characteristic change in pitch.\nTo us, the sound of the hom elides from high frequencies to low. A racing car traveling at\n200 kilometers per hour (120 miles her hour) is going almost one-fifth the speed of sound.\nSound is a succession of waves in air, a crest and a trough, a crest and a trough. The closer\ntogether the waves are, the higher the frequency or pitch; the farther apart the waves are,\nthe lower the pitch. If the car is racing away from us, it stretches out the sound waves,\nmoving them, from our point of view, to a lower pitch and producing the characteristic\nsound with which we are all familiar. If the car were racing toward us, the sound waves\nwould be squashed together, the frequency would be increased, and we would hear a high-\npitched wail. If we knew what the ordinary pitch of the horn was when the car was at rest,\nwe could deduce its speed blindfolded, from the change in pitch.\n\nLight is also a wave. Unlike sound, it travels perfectly well through a vacuum. The\nDoppler effect works here as well. If instead of sound the automobile were for some reason\nemitting, front and back, a beam of pure yellow light, the frequency of the light would\nincrease slightly as the car approached and decrease slightly as the car receded. At ordinary\nspeeds the effect would be imperceptible. If, however, the car were somehow traveling at a\ngood fraction of the speed of light, we would be able to observe the color of the light\nchanging toward higher frequency, that is, toward blue, as the car approached us; and\ntoward lower frequencies, that is, toward red, as the car receded from us. An object\napproaching us at very high velocities is perceived to have the color of its spectral lines\nblue-shifted. An object receding from us at very high velocities has its spectral lines red-\nshifted.* This red shift, observed in the spectral lines of distant galaxies and interpreted as a\nDoppler effect, is the key to cosmology.\n\n* The object itself might be any color, even blue. The red shift means only that each spectral line\nappears at longer wavelengths than when the object is at rest; the amount of the red shift is proportional both\nto the velocity and to the wavelength of the spectral line when the object is at rest.\n\nDuring the early years of this century, the world\u2019s largest telescope, destined to\ndiscover the red shift of remote galaxies, was being built on Mount Wilson, overlooking\nwhat were then the clear skies of Los Angeles. Large pieces of the telescope had to be\nhauled to the top of the mountain, a job for mule teams. A young mule skinner named\nMilton Humason helped to transport mechanical and optical equipment, scientists,\nengineers and dignitaries up the mountain. Humason would lead the column of mules on\nhorseback, his white terrier standing just behind the saddle, its front paws on Humason\u2019s\nshoulders. He was a tobacco-chewing roustabout, a superb gambler and pool player and\nwhat was then called a ladies\u2019 man. In his formal education, he had never gone beyond the\neighth grade. But he was bright and curious and naturally inquisitive about the equipment\n\nhe had laboriously carted to the heights. Humason was keeping company with the daughter\nof one of the observatory engineers, a man who harbored reservations about his daughter\nseeing a young man who had no higher ambition than to be a mule skinner. So Humason\ntook odd jobs at the observatory - electrician\u2019s assistant, janitor, swabbing the floors of the\ntelescope he had helped to build. One evening, so the story goes, the night telescope\nassistant fell ill and Humason was asked if he might fill in. He displayed such skill and care\nwith the instruments that he soon became a permanent telescope operator and observing\naide.\n\nAfter World War I, there came to Mount Wilson the soon-to-be famous Edwin\nHubble - brilliant, polished, gregarious outside the astronomical community, with an\nEnglish accent acquired during a single year as Rhodes scholar at Oxford. It was Hubble\nwho provided the final demonstration that the spiral nebulae were in fact \u2018island universes,\u2019\ndistant aggregations of enormous numbers of stars, like our own Milky Way Galaxy; he\nhad figured out the stellar standard candle required to measure the distances to the galaxies.\nHubble and Humason hit it off splendidly, a perhaps unlikely pair who worked together at\nthe telescope harmoniously. Following a lead by the astronomer V. M. Slipher at Lowell\nObservatory, they began measuring the spectra of distant galaxies. It soon became clear that\nHumason was better able to obtain high-quality spectra of distant galaxies than any\nprofessional astronomer in the world. He became a full staff member of the Mount Wilson\nObservatory, learned many of the scientific underpinnings of his work and died rich in the\nrespect of the astronomical community.\n\nThe light from a galaxy is the sum of the light emitted by the billions of stars within\nit. As the light leaves these stars, certain frequencies or colors are absorbed by the atoms in\nthe stars\u2019 outermost layers. The resulting lines permit us to tell that stars millions of light-\nyears away contain the same chemical elements as our Sun and the nearby stars. Humason\nand Hubble found, to their amazement, that the spectra of all the distant galaxies are red-\nshifted and, still more startling, that the more distant the galaxy was, the more red-shifted\nwere its spectral lines.\n\nThe most obvious explanation of the red shift was in terms of the Doppler effect:\nthe galaxies were receding from us; the more distant the galaxy the greater its speed of\nrecession. But why should the galaxies be fleeing us? Could there be something special\nabout our location in the universe, as if the Milky Way had performed some inadvertent but\noffensive act in the social life of galaxies? It seemed much more likely that the universe\nitself was expanding, carrying the galaxies with it. Humason and Hubble, it gradually\nbecame clear, had discovered the Big Bang - if not the origin of the universe then at least its\nmost recent incarnation.\n\nAlmost all of modern cosmology - and especially the idea of an expanding universe\nand a Big Bang - is based on the idea that the red shift of distant galaxies is a Doppler\neffect and arises from their speed of recession. But there are other kinds of red shifts in\nnature. There is, for example, the gravitational red shift, in which the light leaving an\nintense gravitational field has to do so much work to escape that it loses energy during the\njourney, the process perceived by a distant observer as a shift of the escaping light to longer\nwavelengths and redder colors. Since we think there may be massive black holes at the\ncenters of some galaxies, this is a conceivable explanation of their red shifts. However, the\nparticular spectral lines observed are often characteristic of very thin, diffuse gas, and not\nthe astonishingly high density that must prevail near black holes. Or the red shift might be a\nDoppler effect due not to the general expansion of the universe but rather to a more modest\n\nand local galactic explosion. But then we should expect as many explosion fragments\ntraveling toward us as away from us, as many blue shifts as red shifts. What we actually\nsee, however, is almost exclusively red shifts no matter what distant objects beyond the\nLocal Group we point our telescopes to.\n\nThere is nevertheless a nagging suspicion among some astronomers that all may not\nbe right with the deduction, from the red shifts of galaxies via the Doppler effect, that the\nuniverse is expanding. The astronomer Halton Arp has found enigmatic and disturbing\ncases where a galaxy and a quasar, or a pair of galaxies, that are in apparent physical\nassociation have very different red shifts. Occasionally there seems to be a bridge of gas\nand dust and stars connecting them. If the red shift is due to the expansion of the universe,\nvery different red shifts imply very different distances. But two galaxies that are physically\nconnected can hardly also be greatly separated from each other - in some cases by a billion\nlight-years. Skeptics say that the association is purely statistical: that, for example, a nearby\nbright galaxy and a much more distant quasar, each having very different red shifts and\nvery different speeds of recession, are merely accidentally aligned along the line of sight;\nthat they have no real physical association. Such statistical alignments must happen by\nchance every now and then. The debate centers on whether the number of coincidences is\nmore than would be expected by chance. Arp points to other cases in which a galaxy with a\nsmall red shift is flanked by two quasars of large and almost identical red shift. He believes\nthe quasars are not at cosmological distances but instead are being ejected, left and right, by\nthe \u2018foreground\u2019 galaxy; and that the red shifts are the result of some as-yet-unfathomed\nmechanism. Skeptics argue coincidental alignment and the conventional Hubble-Humason\ninterpretation of the red shift. If Arp is right, the exotic mechanisms proposed to explain the\nenergy source of distant quasars - supernova chain reactions, supermassive black holes and\nthe like - would prove unnecessary. Quasars need not then be very distant. But some other\nexotic mechanism will be required to explain the red shift. In either case, something very\nstrange is going on in the depths of space.\n\nThe apparent recession of the galaxies, with the red shift interpreted through the\nDoppler effect, is not the only evidence for the Big Bang. Independent and quite persuasive\nevidence derives from the cosmic black body background radiation, the faint static of radio\nwaves coming quite uniformly from all directions in the Cosmos at just the intensity\nexpected in our epoch from the now substantially cooled radiation of the Big Bang. But\nhere also there is something puzzling. Observations with a sensitive radio antenna carried\nnear the top of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere in a U-2 aircraft have shown that the background\nradiation is, to first approximation, just as intense in all directions - as if the fireball of the\nBig Bang expanded quite uniformly, an origin of the universe with a very precise\nsymmetry. But the background radiation, when examined to finer precision, proves to be\nimperfectly symmetrical. There is a small systematic effect that could be understood if the\nentire Milky Way Galaxy (and presumably other members of the Local Group) were\nstreaking toward the Virgo cluster of galaxies at more than a million miles an hour (600\nkilometers per second). At such a rate, we will reach it in ten billion years, and\nextragalactic astronomy will then be a great deal easier. The Virgo cluster is already the\nrichest collection of galaxies known, replete with spirals and ellipticals and irregulars, a\njewel box in the sky. But why should we be rushing toward it? George Smoot and his\ncolleagues, who made these high-altitude observations, suggest that the Milky Way is being\ngravitationally dragged toward the center of the Virgo cluster; that the cluster has many\nmore galaxies than have been detected heretofore; and, most startling, that the cluster is of\n\nimmense proportions, stretching across one or two billion light-years of space.\n\nThe observable universe itself is only a few tens of billions of light-years across\nand, if there is a vast supercluster in the Virgo group, perhaps there are other such\nsuperclusters at much greater distances, which are correspondingly more difficult to detect.\nIn the lifetime of the universe there has apparently not been enough time for an initial\ngravitational nonuniformity to collect the amount of mass that seems to reside in the Virgo\nsupercluster. Thus Smoot is tempted to conclude that the Big Bang was much less uniform\nthan his other observations suggest, that the original distribution of matter in the universe\nwas very lumpy. (Some little lumpiness is to be expected, and indeed even needed to\nunderstand the condensation of galaxies; but a lumpiness on this scale is a surprise.)\nPerhaps the paradox can be resolved by imagining two or more nearly simultaneous Big\nBangs.\n\nIf the general picture of an expanding universe and a Big Bang is correct, we must\nthen confront still more difficult questions. What were conditions like at the time of the Big\nBang? What happened before that? Was there a tiny universe, devoid of all matter, and then\nthe matter suddenly created from nothing? How does that happen? In many cultures it is\ncustomary to answer that God created the universe out of nothing. But this is mere\ntemporizing. If we wish courageously to pursue the question, we must, of course ask next\nwhere God comes from. And if we decide this to be unanswerable, why not save a step and\ndecide that the origin of the universe is an unanswerable question? Or, if we say that God\nhas always existed, why not save a step and conclude that the universe has always existed?\n\nEvery culture has a myth of the world before creation, and of the creation of the\nworld, often by the mating of the gods or the hatching of a cosmic egg. Commonly, the\nuniverse is naively imagined to follow human or animal precedent. Here, for example, are\nfive small extracts from such myths, at different levels of sophistication, from the Pacific\nBasin:\n\nIn the very beginning everything was resting in perpetual darkness: night oppressed\neverything like an impenetrable thicket.\n- The Great Father myth of the Aranda people of Central Australia\n\nAll was in suspense, all calm, all in silence; all motionless and still; and the expanse\nof the sky was empty.\n- The Popol Vuh of the Quich\u00e9 Maya\n\nNa Arean sat alone in space as a cloud that floats in nothingness. He slept not, for\nthere was no sleep; he hungered not, for as yet there was no hunger. So he remained\nfor a great while, until a thought came to his mind. He said to himself, \u2018I will make\na thing.\u2019\n\n- A myth from Maiana, Gilbert Islands\n\nFirst there was the great cosmic egg. Inside the egg was chaos, and floating in chaos\nwas Pan Ku, the Undeveloped, the divine Embryo. And Pan Ku burst out of the egg,\nfour times larger than any man today, with a hammer and chisel in his hand with\nwhich he fashioned the world.\n\n- The P\u2019an Ku Myths, China (around third century)\n\nBefore heaven and earth had taken form all was vague and amorphous. . . That\nwhich was clear and light drifted up to become heaven, while that which was heavy\nand turbid solidified to become earth. It was very easy for the pure, fine material to\ncome together, but extremely difficult for the heavy, turbid material to solidify.\nTherefore heaven was completed first and earth assumed shape after. When heaven\nand earth were joined in emptiness and all was unwrought simplicity, then without\nhaving been created things came into being. This was the Great Oneness. All things\nissued from this Oneness but all became different . . .\n\n- Huai-nan Tzu, China (around first century B.C.)\n\nThese myths are tributes to human audacity. The chief difference between them and our\nmodern scientific myth of the Big Bang is that science is self-questioning, and that we can\nperform experiments and observations to test our ideas. But those other creation stories are\nworthy of our deep respect.\n\nEvery human culture rejoices in the fact that there are cycles in nature. But how, it\nwas thought, could such cycles come about unless the gods willed them? And if there are\ncycles in the years of humans, might there not be cycles in the aeons of the gods? The\nHindu religion is the only one of the world\u2019s great faiths dedicated to the idea that the\nCosmos itself undergoes an immense, indeed an infinite, number of deaths and rebirths. It\nis the only religion in which the time scales correspond, no doubt by accident, to those of\nmodern scientific cosmology. Its cycles run from our ordinary day and night to a day and\nnight of Brahma, 8.64 billion years long, longer than the age of the Earth or the Sun and\nabout half the time since the Big Bang. And there are much longer time scales still.\n\nThere is the deep and appealing notion that the universe is but the dream of the god\nwho, after a hundred Brahma years, dissolves himself into a dreamless sleep. The universe\ndissolves with him - until, after another Brahma century, he stirs, recomposes himself and\nbegins again to dream the great cosmic dream. Meanwhile, elsewhere, there are an infinite\nnumber of other universes, each with its own god dreaming the cosmic dream. These great\nideas are tempered by another, perhaps still greater. It is said that men may not be the\ndreams of the gods, but rather that the gods are the dreams of men.\n\nIn India there are many gods, and each god has many manifestations. The Chola\nbronzes, cast in the eleventh century, include several different incarnations of the god\nShiva. The most elegant and sublime of these is a representation of the creation of the\nuniverse at the beginning of each cosmic cycle, a motif known as the cosmic dance of\nShiva. The god, called in this manifestation Nataraja, the Dance King, has four hands. In\nthe upper right hand is a drum whose sound is the sound of creation. In the upper left hand\nis a tongue of flame, a reminder that the universe, now newly created, will billions of years\nfrom now be utterly destroyed.\n\nThese profound and lovely images are, I like to imagine, a kind of premonition of\nmodern astronomical ideas.* Very likely, the universe has been expanding since the Big\nBang, but it is by no means clear that it will continue to expand forever. The expansion may\ngradually slow, stop and reverse itself. If there is less than a certain critical amount of\nmatter in the universe, the gravitation of the receding galaxies will be insufficient to stop\nthe expansion, and the universe will run away forever. But if there is more matter than we\ncan see - hidden away in black holes, say, or in hot but invisible gas between the galaxies -\n\nthen the universe will hold together gravitationally and partake of a very Indian succession\nof cycles, expansion followed by contraction, universe upon universe, Cosmos without end.\nIf we live in such an oscillating universe, then the Big Bang is not the creation of the\nCosmos but merely the end of the previous cycle, the destruction of the last incarnation of\nthe Cosmos.\n\n* The dates on Mayan inscriptions also range deep into the past and occasionally far into the future.\nOne inscription refers to a time more than a million years ago and another perhaps refers to events of 400\nmillion years ago, although this is in some dispute among Mayan scholars. The events memorialized may be\nmythical, but the time scales are prodigious. A millennium before Europeans were willing to divest\nthemselves of the Biblical idea that the world was a few thousand years old, the Mayans were thinking of\nmillions, and the Indians of billions.\n\nNeither of these modern cosmologies may be altogether to our liking. In one, the\nuniverse is created, somehow, ten or twenty billion years ago and expands forever, the\ngalaxies mutually receding until the last one disappears over our cosmic horizon. Then the\ngalactic astronomers are out of business, the stars cool and die, matter itself decays and the\nuniverse becomes a thin cold haze of elementary particles. In the other, the oscillating\nuniverse, the Cosmos has no beginning and no end, and we are in the midst of an infinite\ncycle of cosmic deaths and rebirths with no information trickling through the cusps of the\noscillation. Nothing of the galaxies, stars, planets, life forms or civilizations evolved in the\nprevious incarnation of the universe oozes into the cusp, flutters past the Big Bang, to be\nknown in our present universe. The fate of the universe in either cosmology may seem a\nlittle depressing, but we may take solace in the time scales involved. These events will\noccupy tens of billions of years, or more. Human beings and our descendants, whoever they\nmight be, can accomplish a great deal in tens of billions of years, before the Cosmos dies.\n\nIf the universe truly oscillates, still stranger questions arise. Some scientists think\nthat when expansion is followed by contraction, when the spectra of distant galaxies are all\nblue-shifted, causality will be inverted and effects will precede causes. First the ripples\nspread from a point on the water\u2019s surface, then I throw a stone into the pond. First the\ntorch bursts into flame and then I light it. We cannot pretend to understand what such\ncausality inversion means. Will people at such a time be born in the grave and die in the\nwomb? Will time flow backwards? Do these questions have any meaning?\n\nScientists wonder about what happens in an oscillating universe at the cusps, at the\ntransition from contraction to expansion. Some think that the laws of nature are then\nrandomly reshuffled, that the kind of physics and chemistry that orders this universe\nrepresent only one of an infinite range of possible natural laws. It is easy to see that only a\nvery restricted range of laws of nature are consistent with galaxies and stars, planets, life\nand intelligence. If the laws of nature are unpredictably reassorted at the cusps, then it is\nonly by the most extraordinary coincidence that the cosmic slot machine has this time come\nup with a universe consistent with us.*\n\n* The laws of nature cannot be randomly reshuffled at the cusps. If the universe has already gone\nthrough many oscillations, many possible laws of gravity would have been so weak that, for any given initial\nexpansion, the universe would not have held together. Once the universe stumbles upon such a gravitational\nlaw, it flies apart and has no further opportunity to experience another oscillation and another cusp and\nanother set of laws of nature. Thus we can deduce from the fact that the universe exists either a finite age, or a\nsevere restriction on the kinds of laws of nature permitted in each oscillation. If the laws of physics are not\nrandomly reshuffled at the cusps, there must be a regularity, a set of rules, that determines which laws are\n\npermissible and which are not. Such a set of rules would comprise a new physics standing over the existing\nphysics. Our language is impoverished; there seems to be no suitable name for such a new physics. Both\n\u2018paraphysics\u2019 and \u2018metaphysics\u2019 have been preempted by other rather different and, quite possibly, wholly\nirrelevant activities. Perhaps \u2018transphysics\u2019 would do.\n\nDo we live in a universe that expands forever or in one in which there is an infinite\nset of cycles? There are ways to find out: by making an accurate census of the total amount\nof matter in the universe, or by seeing to the edge of the Cosmos.\n\nRadio telescopes can detect very faint, very distant objects. As we look deep into\nspace we also look far back into time. The nearest quasar is perhaps half a billion light-\nyears away. The farthest may be ten or twelve or more billions. But if we see an object\ntwelve billion light-years away, we are seeing it as it was twelve billion years ago in time.\nBy looking far out into space we are also looking far back into time, back toward the\nhorizon of the universe, back toward the epoch of the Big Bang.\n\nThe Very Large Array (VLA) is a collection of twenty-seven separate radio\ntelescopes in a remote region of New Mexico. It is a phased array, the individual telescopes\nelectronically connected, as if it were a single telescope of the same size as its remotest\nelements, as if it were a radio telescope tens of kilometers across. The VLA is able to\nresolve or discriminate fine detail in the radio regions of the spectrum comparable to what\nthe largest ground-based telescopes can do in the optical region of the spectrum.\n\nSometimes such radio telescopes are connected with telescopes on the other side of\nthe Earth, forming a baseline comparable to the Earth\u2019s diameter - in a certain sense, a\ntelescope as large as the planet. In the future we may have telescopes in the Earth\u2019s orbit,\naround toward the other side of the Sun, in effect a radio telescope as large as the inner\nsolar system. Such telescopes may reveal the internal structure and nature of quasars.\nPerhaps a quasar standard candle will be found, and the distances to the quasars determined\nindependent of their red shifts. By understanding the structure and the red shift of the most\ndistant quasars it may be possible to see whether the expansion of the universe was faster\nbillions of years ago, whether the expansion is slowing down, whether the universe will one\nday collapse.\n\nModern radio telescopes are exquisitely sensitive; a distant quasar is so faint that its\ndetected radiation amounts perhaps to a quadrillionth of a watt. The total amount of energy\nfrom outside the solar system ever received by all the radio telescopes on the planet Earth is\nless than the energy of a single snowflake striking the ground. In detecting the cosmic\nbackground radiation, in counting quasars, in searching for intelligent signals from space,\nradio astronomers are dealing with amounts of energy that are barely there at all.\n\nSome matter, particularly the matter in the stars, glows in visible light and is easy to\nsee. Other matter, gas and dust in the outskirts of galaxies, for example, is not so readily\ndetected. It does not give off visible light, although it seems to give off radio waves. This is\none reason that the unlocking of the cosmological mysteries requires us to use exotic\ninstruments and frequencies different from the visible light to which our eyes are sensitive.\nObservatories in Earth orbit have found an intense X-ray glow between the galaxies. It was\nfirst thought to be hot intergalactic hydrogen, an immense amount of it never before seen,\nperhaps enough to close the Cosmos and to guarantee that we are trapped in an oscillating\nuniverse. But more recent observations by Ricardo Giacconi may have resolved the X-ray\nglow into individual points, perhaps an immense horde of distant quasars. They contribute\npreviously unknown mass to the universe as well. When the cosmic inventory is completed,\n\nand the mass of all the galaxies, quasars, black holes, intergalactic hydrogen, gravitational\nwaves and still more exotic denizens of space is summed up, we will know what kind of\nuniverse we inhabit.\n\nIn discussing the large-scale structure of the Cosmos, astronomers are fond of\nsaying that space is curved, or that there is no center to the Cosmos, or that the universe is\nfinite but unbounded. Whatever are they talking about? Let us imagine we inhabit a strange\ncountry where everyone is perfectly flat. Following Edwin Abbott, a Shakespearean scholar\nwho lived in Victorian England, we call it Flatland. Some of us are squares; some are\ntriangles; some have more complex shapes. We scurry about, in and out of our flat\nbuildings, occupied with our flat businesses and dalliances. Everyone in Flatland has width\nand length, but no height whatever. We know about left-right and forward-back, but have\nno hint, not a trace of comprehension, about up-down - except for flat mathematicians.\nThey say, \u2018Listen, it\u2019s really very easy. Imagine left-right. Imagine forward-back. Okay, so\nfar? Now imagine another dimension, at right angles to the other two.\u2019 And we say, \u2018What\nare you talking about? \u201cAt right angles to the other two!\u201d There are only two dimensions.\nPoint to that third dimension. Where is it?\u2019 So the mathematicians, disheartened, amble off.\nNobody listens to mathematicians.\n\nEvery square creature in Flatland sees another square as merely a short line\nsegment, the side of the square nearest to him. He can see the other side of the square only\nby taking a short walk. But the inside of a square is forever mysterious, unless some terrible\naccident or autopsy breaches the sides and exposes the interior parts.\n\nOne day a three-dimensional creature - shaped like an apple, say - comes upon\nFlatland, hovering above it. Observing a particularly attractive and congenial-looking\nsquare entering its flat house, the apple decides, in a gesture of interdimensional amity, to\nsay hello. \u2018How are you?\u2019 asks the visitor from the third dimension. \u2018I am a visitor from the\nthird dimension.\u2019 The wretched square looks about his closed house and sees no one. What\nis worse, to him it appears that the greeting, entering from above, is emanating from his\nown flat body, a voice from within. A little insanity, he perhaps reminds himself gamely,\nruns in the family.\n\nExasperated at being judged a psychological aberration, the apple descends into\nFlatland. Now a three-dimensional creature can exist, in Flatland, only partially; only a\ncross section can be seen, only the points of contact with the plane surface of Flatland. An\napple slithering through Flatland would appear first as a point and then as progressively\nlarger, roughly circular slices. The square sees a point appearing in a closed room in his\ntwo-dimensional world and slowly growing into a near circle. A creature of strange and\nchanging shape has appeared from nowhere.\n\nRebuffed, unhappy at the obtuseness of the very flat, the apple bumps the square\nand sends him aloft, fluttering and spinning into that mysterious third dimension. At first\nthe square can make no sense of what is happening; it is utterly outside his experience. But\neventually he realizes that he is viewing Flatland from a peculiar vantage point: \u2018above\u2019. He\ncan see into closed rooms. He can see into his flat fellows. He is viewing his universe from\na unique and devastating perspective. Traveling through another dimension provides, as an\nincidental benefit, a kind of X-ray vision. Eventually, like a falling leaf, our square slowly\ndescends to the surface. From the point of view of his fellow Flatlanders, he has\nunaccountably disappeared from a closed room and then distressingly materialized from\nnowhere. \u2018For heaven\u2019s sake,\u2019 they say, \u2018what\u2019s happened to you?\u2019 \u2018I think,\u2019 he finds\nhimself replying, \u2018I was \u201cup.\u201d \u2019 They pat him on his sides and comfort him. Delusions\n\nalways ran in his family.\n\nIn such interdimensional contemplations, we need not be restricted to two\ndimensions. We can, following Abbott, imagine a world of one dimension, where everyone\nis a line segment, or even the magical world of zero-dimensional beasts, the points. But\nperhaps more interesting is the question of higher dimensions. Could there be a fourth\nphysical dimension?*\n\n* Ifa fourth-dimensional creature existed it could, in our three-dimensional universe, appear and\ndematerialize at will, change shape remarkably, pluck us out of locked rooms and make us appear from\nnowhere. It could also turn us inside out. There are several ways in which we can be turned inside out: the\nleast pleasant would result in our viscera and internal organs being on the outside and the entire Cosmos -\nglowing intergalactic gas, galaxies, planets, everything - on the inside. I am not sure I like the idea.\n\nWe can imagine generating a cube in the following way: Take a line segment of a\ncertain length and move it an equal length at right angles to itself. That makes a square.\nMove the square an equal length at right angles to itself, and we have a cube. We\nunderstand this cube to cast a shadow, which we usually draw as two squares with their\nvertices connected. If we examine the shadow of a cube in two dimensions, we notice that\nnot all the lines appear equal, and not all the angles are right angles. The three-dimensional\nobject has not been perfectly represented in its transfiguration into two dimensions. This is\nthe cost of losing a dimension in the geometrical projection. Now let us take our three-\ndimensional cube and carry it, at right angles to itself, through a fourth physical dimension:\nnot left-right, not forward-back, not up-down, but simultaneously at right angles to all those\ndirections. I cannot show you what direction that is, but I can imagine it to exist. In such a\ncase, we would have generated a four-dimensional hypercube, also called a tesseract. I\ncannot show you a tesseract, because we are trapped in three dimensions. But what I can\nshow you is the shadow in three dimensions of a tesseract. It resembles two nested cubes,\nall the vertices connected by lines. But for a real tesseract, in four dimensions, all the lines\nwould be of equal length and all the angles would be right angles.\n\nImagine a universe just like Flatland, except that unbeknownst to the inhabitants,\ntheir two-dimensional universe is curved through a third physical dimension. When the\nFlatlanders take short excursions, their universe looks flat enough. But if one of them takes\na long enough walk along what seems to be a perfectly straight line, he uncovers a great\nmystery: although he has not reached a barrier and has never turned around, he has\nsomehow come back to the place from which he started. His two-dimensional universe\nmust have been warped, bent or curved through a mysterious third dimension. He cannot\nimagine that third dimension, but he can deduce it. Increase all dimensions in this story by\none, and you have a situation that may apply to us.\n\nWhere is the center of the Cosmos? Is there an edge to the universe? What lies\nbeyond that? In a two-dimensional universe, curved through a third dimension, there is no\ncenter - at least not on the surface of the sphere. The center of such a universe is not in that\nuniverse; it lies, inaccessible, in the third dimension, inside the sphere. While there is only\nso much area on the surface of the sphere, there is no edge to this universe - it is finite but\nunbounded. And the question of what lies beyond is meaningless. Flat creatures cannot, on\ntheir own, escape their two dimensions.\n\nIncrease all dimensions by one, and you have the situation that may apply to us: the\nuniverse as a four-dimensional hypersphere with no center and no edge, and nothing\n\nbeyond. Why do all the galaxies seem to be running away from us? The hypersphere is\nexpanding from a point, like a four-dimensional balloon being inflated, creating in every\ninstant more space in the universe. Sometime after the expansion begins, galaxies condense\nand are carried outward on the surface of the hypersphere. There are astronomers in each\ngalaxy, and the light they see is also trapped on the curved surface of the hypersphere. As\nthe sphere expands, an astronomer in any galaxy will think all the other galaxies are\nrunning away from him. There are no privileged reference frames.* The farther away the\ngalaxy, the faster its recession. The galaxies are embedded in, attached to space, and the\nfabric of space is expanding. And to the question, Where in the present universe did the Big\nBang occur? the answer is clearly, everywhere.\n\n* The view that the universe looks by and large the same no matter from where we happen to view it\nwas first proposed, so far as we know, by Giordano Bruno.\n\nIf there is insufficient matter to prevent the universe from expanding forever, it\nmust have an open shape, curved like a saddle with a surface extending to infinity in our\nthree-dimensional analogy. If there is enough matter, then it has a closed shape, curved like\na sphere in our three-dimensional analogy. If the universe is closed, light is trapped within\nit. In the 1920\u2019s, in a direction opposite to M31, observers found a distant pair of spiral\ngalaxies. Was it possible, they wondered, that they were seeing the Milky Way and M31\nfrom the other direction - like seeing the back of your head with light that has\ncircumnavigated the universe? We now know that the universe is much larger than they\nimagined in the 1920\u2019s. It would take more than the age of the universe for light to\ncircumnavigate it. And the galaxies are younger than the universe. But if the Cosmos is\nclosed and light cannot escape from it, then it may be perfectly correct to describe the\nuniverse as a black hole. If you wish to know what it is like inside a black hole, look around\nyou.\n\nWe have previously mentioned the possibility of wormholes to get from one place\nin the universe to another without covering the intervening distance - through a black hole.\nWe can imagine these wormholes as tubes running through a fourth physical dimension.\nWe do not know that such wormholes exist. But if they do, must they always hook up with\nanother place in our universe? Or is it just possible that wormholes connect with other\nuniverses, places that would otherwise be forever inaccessible to us? For all we know, there\nmay be many other universes. Perhaps they are, in some sense, nested within one another.\n\nThere is an idea - strange, haunting, evocative - one of the most exquisite\nconjectures in science or religion. It is entirely undemonstrated; it may never be proved.\nBut it stirs the blood. There is, we are told, an infinite hierarchy of universes, so that an\nelementary particle, such as an electron, in our universe would, if penetrated, reveal itself to\nbe an entire closed universe. Within it, organized into the local equivalent of galaxies and\nsmaller structures, are an immense number of other, much tinier elementary particles,\nwhich are themselves universe at the next level, and so on forever - an infinite downward\nregression, universes within universes, endlessly. And upward as well. Our familiar\nuniverse of galaxies and stars, planets and people, would be a single elementary particle in\nthe next universe up, the first step of another infinite regress.\n\nThis is the only religious idea I know that surpasses the endless number of infinitely\nold cycling universes in Hindu cosmology. What would those other universes be like?\nWould they be built on different laws of physics? Would they have stars and galaxies and\n\nworlds, or something quite different? Might they be compatible with some unimaginably\ndifferent form of life? To enter them, we would somehow have to penetrate a fourth\nphysical dimension - not an easy undertaking, surely but perhaps a black hole would\nprovide a way. There may be small black holes in the solar neighborhood. Poised at the\nedge of forever, we would jump off.\n",

Although we cannot yet be certain, the same processes that led on Earth\nto the evolution of life and intelligence should have been operating throughout the Cosmos.\nThere may be a million worlds in the Milky Way Galaxy alone that at this moment are\ninhabited by beings who are very different from us, and far more advanced. Knowing a\ngreat deal is not the same as being smart; intelligence is not information alone but also\njudgment, the manner in which information is coordinated and used. Still, the amount of\ninformation to which we have access is one index of our intelligence. The measuring rod,\nthe unit of information, is something called a bit (for binary digit). It is an answer - either\nyes or no - to an unambiguous question. To specify whether a lamp is on or off requires a\nsingle bit of information. To designate one letter out of the twenty-six in the Latin alphabet\ntakes five bits (2 =2x2x2x2x2=32, which is more than 26). The verbal information\ncontent of this book is a little less than ten million bits, 10\u201d. The total number of bits that\ncharacterizes an hour-long television program is about 10\u2019. The information in the words\nand pictures of different books in all the libraries on the Earth is something like 10'\u00b0 or 10'\u201d\nbits.* Of course much of it is redundant. Such a number calibrates crudely what humans\nknow. But elsewhere, on older worlds, where life has evolved billions of years earlier than\non Earth, perhaps they know 10\u201d bits or 10*\u00b0 - not just more information but significantly\ndifferent information.\n\n* Thus all of the books in the world contain no more information than is broadcast as video in a\nsingle large American city in a single year, Not all bits have equal value.\n\nOf those million worlds inhabited by advanced intelligencies, consider a rare planet,\n\nthe only one in its system with a surface ocean of liquid water. In this rich aquatic\nenvironment, many relatively intelligent creatures live - some with eight appendages for\ngrasping; others that communicate among themselves by changing an intricate pattern of\nbright and dark mottling on their bodies; even clever little creatures from the land who\nmake brief forays into the ocean in vessels of wood or metal. But we seek the dominant\nintelligences, the grandest creatures on the planet, the sentient and graceful masters of the\ndeep ocean, the great whales.\n\nThey are the largest animals* ever to evolve on the planet Earth, larger by far than\nthe dinosaurs. An adult blue whale can be thirty meters long and weigh 150 tons. Many,\nespecially the baleen whales, are placid browsers, straining through vast volumes of ocean\nfor the small animals on which they graze; others eat fish and krill. The whales are recent\narrivals in the ocean. Only seventy million years ago their ancestors were carnivorous\nmammals who migrated in slow steps from the land into the ocean. Among the whales,\nmothers suckle and care tenderly for their offspring. There is a long childhood in which the\nadults teach the young. Play is a typical pastime. These are all mammalian characteristics,\nall important for the development of intelligent beings.\n\n* Some sequoia trees are both larger and more massive than any whale.\n\nThe sea is murky. Sight and smell, which work well for mammals on the land, are\nnot of much use in the depths of the ocean. Those ancestors of the whales who relied on\nthese senses to locate a mate or a baby or a predator did not leave many offspring. So\nanother method was perfected by evolution; it works superbly well and is central to any\nunderstanding of the whales: the sense of sound. Some whale sounds are called songs, but\nwe are still ignorant of their true nature and meaning. They range over a broad band of\nfrequencies, down to well below the lowest sound the human ear can detect. A typical\nwhale song lasts for perhaps fifteen minutes; the longest, about an hour. Often it is\nrepeated, identically, beat for beat, measure for measure, note for note. Occasionally a\ngroup of whales will leave their winter waters in the midst of a song and six months later\nreturn to continue at precisely the right note, as if there had been no interruption. Whales\nare very good at remembering. More often, on their return, the vocalizations have changed.\nNew songs appear on the cetacean hit parade.\n\nVery often the members of the group will sing the same song together. By some\nmutual consensus, some collaborative songwriting, the piece changes month by month,\nslowly and predictably. These vocalizations are complex. If the songs of the humpback\nwhale are enunciated as a tonal language, the total information content, the number of bits\nof information in such songs, is some 10\u00b0 bits, about the same as the information content of\nthe Jliad or the Odyssey. We do not know what whales or their cousins the dolphins have to\ntalk or sing about. They have no manipulative organs, they make no engineering constructs,\nbut they are social creatures. They hunt, swim, fish, browse, frolic, mate, play, run from\npredators. There may be a great deal to talk about.\n\nThe primary danger to the whales is a newcomer, an upstart animal, only recently,\nthrough technology, become competent in the oceans, a creature that calls itself human. For\n99.99 percent of the history of the whales, there were no humans in or on the deep oceans.\nDuring this period the whales evolved their extraordinary audio communication system.\nThe finbacks, for example, emit extremely loud sounds at a frequency of twenty Hertz,\ndown near the lowest octave on the piano keyboard.. (A Hertz is a unit of sound frequency\n\nthat represents one sound wave, one crest and one trough, entering your ear every second.)\nSuch low-frequency sounds are scarcely absorbed in the ocean. The American biologist\nRoger Payne has calculated that using the deep ocean sound channel, two whales could\ncommunicate with each other at twenty Hertz essentially anywhere in the world. One might\nbe off the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica and communicate with another in the Aleutians. For\nmost of their history, the whales may have established a global communications network.\nPerhaps when separated by 15,000 kilometers, their vocalizations are love songs, cast\nhopefully into the vastness of the deep.\n\nFor tens of millions of years these enormous, intelligent, communicative creatures\nevolved with essentially no natural enemies. Then the development of the steamship in the\nnineteenth century introduced an ominous source of noise pollution. As commercial and\nmilitary vessels became more abundant, the noise background in the oceans, especially at a\nfrequency of twenty Hertz, became noticeable. Whales communicating across the oceans\nmust have experienced increasingly greater difficulties. The distance over which they could\ncommunicate must have decreased steadily. Two hundred years ago, a typical distance\nacross which finbacks could communicate was perhaps 10,000 kilometers. Today, the\ncorresponding number is perhaps a few hundred kilometers. Do whales know each other's\nnames? Can they recognize each other as individuals by sounds alone? We have cut the\nwhales off from themselves. Creatures that communicated for tens of millions of years have\nnow effectively been silenced.*\n\n* There is a curious counterpoint to this story. The preferred radio channel for interstellar\ncommunication with other technical civilizations is near a frequency of 1.42 billion Hertz, marked by a radio\nspectral line of hydrogen, the most abundant atom in the Universe. We are just beginning to listen here for\nsignals of intelligent origin. But the frequency band is being increasingly encroached upon by civilian and\nmilitary communications traffic on Earth, and not only by the major powers. We are jamming the interstellar\nchannel. Uncontrolled growth of terrestrial radio technology may prevent us from ready communication with\nintelligent beings on distant worlds. Their songs may go unanswered because we have not the will to control\nour radio-frequency pollution and listen.\n\nAnd we have done worse than that, because there persists to this day a traffic in the\ndead bodies of whales. There are humans who hunt and slaughter whales and market the\nproducts for lipstick or industrial lubricant. Many nations understand that the systematic\nmurder of such intelligent creatures is monstrous, but the traffic continues, promoted\nchiefly by Japan, Norway and the Soviet Union. We humans, as a species, are interested in\ncommunication with extraterrestrial intelligence. Would not a good beginning be improved\ncommunication with terrestrial intelligence, with other human beings of different cultures\nand languages, with the great apes, with the dolphins, but particularly with those intelligent\nmasters of the deep, the, great whales?\n\nFor a whale to live there are many things it must know how to do. This knowledge\nis stored in its genes and in its brain. The genetic information includes how to convert\nplankton into blubber; or how to hold your breath on a dive one kilometer below the\nsurface. The information in the brain, the learned information, includes such things as who\nyour mother is, or the meaning of the song you are hearing just now. The whale, like all the\nother animals on the Earth, has a gene library and a brain library.\n\nThe genetic material of the whale, like the genetic material of human beings, is\nmade of nucleic acids, those extraordinary molecules capable of reproducing themselves\nfrom the chemical building blocks that surround them, and of turning hereditary\n\ninformation into action. For example, one whale enzyme, identical to one you have in every\ncell of your body, is called hexokinase, the first of more than two dozen enzyme-mediated\nsteps required to convert a molecule of sugar obtained from the plankton in the whale's diet\ninto a little energy - perhaps a contribution to a single low-frequency note in the music of\nthe whale.\n\nThe information stored in the DNA double helix of a whale or a human or any other\nbeast or vegetable on Earth is written in a language of four letters - the four different kinds\nof nucleotides, the molecular components that make up DNA. How many bits of\ninformation are contained in the hereditary material of various life forms? How many\nyes/no answers to the various biological questions are written in the language of life? A\nvirus needs about 10,000 bits - roughly equivalent to the amount of information on this\npage. But the viral information is simple, exceedingly compact, extraordinarily efficient.\nReading it requires very close attention. These are the instructions it needs to infect some\nother organism and to reproduce itself - the only things that viruses are any good at. A\nbacterium uses roughly a million bits of information - which is about 100 printed pages.\nBacteria have a lot more to do than viruses. Unlike the viruses, they are not thoroughgoing\nparasites. Bacteria have to make a living. And a free-swimming one-celled amoeba is much\nmore sophisticated; with about four hundred million bits in its DNA, it would require some\neighty 500-page volumes to make another amoeba.\n\nA whale or a human being needs something like five billion bits. The 5 x 10\u00b0 bits of\ninformation in our encyclopaedia of life - in the nucleus of each of our cells - if written out\nin, say, English, would fill a thousand volumes. Every one of your hundred trillion cells\ncontains a complete library of instructions on how to make every part of you. Every cell in\nyour body arises by successive cell divisions from a single cell, a fertilized egg generated\nby your parents. Every time that cell divided, in the many embryological steps that went\ninto making you, the original set of genetic instructions was duplicated with great fidelity.\nSo your liver cells have some unemployed knowledge about how to make your bone cells,\nand vice versa. The genetic library contains everything your body knows how to do on its\nown. The ancient information is written in exhaustive, careful, redundant detail - how to\nlaugh, how to sneeze, how to walk, how to recognize patterns, how to reproduce, how to\ndigest an apple.\n\nEating an apple is an immensely complicated process. In fact, if I had to synthesize\nmy own enzymes, if I consciously had to remember and direct all the chemical steps\nrequired to get energy out of food, I would probably starve. But even bacteria do anaerobic\nglycolysis, which is why apples rot: lunchtime for the microbes. They and we and all\ncreatures in between possess many similar genetic instructions. Our separate gene libraries\nhave many pages in common, another reminder of our common evolutionary heritage. Our\ntechnology can duplicate only a tiny fraction of the intricate biochemistry that our bodies\neffortlessly perform: we have only just begun to study these processes. Evolution, however,\nhas had billions of years of practice. DNA knows.\n\nBut suppose what you had to do was so complicated that even several billion bits\nwas insufficient. Suppose the environment was changing so fast that the precoded genetic\nencyclopaedia, which served perfectly well before, was no longer entirely adequate. Then\neven a gene library of 1,000 volumes would not be enough. That is why we have brains.\n\nLike all our organs, the brain has evolved, increasing in complexity and information\ncontent, over millions of years. Its structure reflects all the stages through which it has\npassed. The brain evolved from the inside out. Deep inside is the oldest part, the brainstem,\n\nwhich conducts the basic biological functions, including the rhythms of life - heartbeat and\nrespiration. According to a provocative insight by Paul MacLean, the higher functions of\nthe brain evolved in three successive stages. Capping the brainstem is the R-complex, the\nseat of aggression, ritual, territoriality and social hierarchy, which evolved hundreds of\nmillions of years ago in our reptilian ancestors. Deep inside the skull of every one of us\nthere is something like the brain of a crocodile. Surrounding the R-complex is the limbic\nsystem or mammalian brain, which evolved tens of millions of years ago in ancestors who\nwere mammals but not yet primates. It is a major source of our moods and emotions, of our\nconcern and care for the young.\n\nAnd finally, on the outside, living in uneasy truce with the more primitive brains\nbeneath, is the cerebral cortex, which evolved millions of years ago in our primate\nancestors. The cerebral cortex, where matter is transformed into consciousness, is the point\nof embarkation for all our cosmic voyages. Comprising more than two-thirds of the brain\nmass, it is the realm of both intuition and critical analysis. It is here that we have ideas and\ninspirations, here that we read and write, here that we do mathematics and compose music.\nThe cortex regulates our conscious lives. It is the distinction of our species, the seat of our\nhumanity. Civilization is a product of the cerebral cortex.\n\nThe language of the brain is not the DNA language of the genes. Rather, what we\nknow is encoded in cells called neurons - microscopic electrochemical switching elements,\ntypically a few hundredths of a millimeter across. Each of us has perhaps a hundred billion\nneurons, comparable to the number of stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. Many neurons have\nthousands of connections with their neighbors. There are something like a hundred trillion,\n10\", such connections in the human cerebral cortex.\n\nCharles Sherrington imagined the activities in the cerebral cortex upon awakening:\n\n[The cortex] becomes now a sparkling field of rhythmic flashing points with trains\nof traveling sparks hurrying hither and thither. The brain is waking and with it the\nmind is returning. It is as if the Milky Way entered upon some cosmic dance.\nSwiftly the [cortex] becomes an enchanted loom where millions of flashing shuttles\nweave a dissolving pattern, always a meaningful pattern though never an abiding\none; a shifting harmony of sub-patterns. Now as the waking body rouses, sub-\npatterns of this great harmony of activity stretch down into the unlit tracks of the\n[lower brain]. Strings of flashing and traveling sparks engage the links of it. This\nmeans that the body is up and rises to meet its waking day.\n\nEven in sleep, the brain is pulsing, throbbing and flashing with the complex business of\nhuman life - dreaming, remembering, figuring things out. Our thoughts, visions and\nfantasies have a physical reality. A thought is made of hundreds of electrochemical\nimpulses. If we were shrunk to the level of the neurons, we might witness elaborate,\nintricate, evanescent patterns. One might be the spark of a memory of the smell of lilacs on\na country road in childhood. Another might be part of an anxious all-points bulletin:\n\u201cWhere did I leave the keys?\u2019\n\nThere are many valleys in the mountains of the mind, convolutions that greatly\nincrease the surface area available in the cerebral cortex for information storage in a skull\nof limited size. The neurochemistry of the brain is astonishingly busy, the circuitry of a\nmachine more wonderful than any devised by humans. But there is no evidence that its\nfunctioning is due to anything more than the 10\u2019* neural connections that build an elegant\n\narchitecture of consciousness. The world of thought is divided roughly into two\nhemispheres. The right hemisphere of the cerebral cortex is mainly responsible for pattern\nrecognition, intuition, sensitivity, creative insights. The left hemisphere presides over\nrational, analytical and critical thinking. These are the dual strengths, the essential\nopposites, that characterize human thinking. Together, they provide the means both for\ngenerating ideas and for testing their validity. A continuous dialogue is going on between\nthe two hemispheres, channeled through an immense bundle of nerves, the corpus\ncallosum, the bridge between creativity and analysis, both of which are necessary to\nunderstand the world.\n\nThe information content of the human brain expressed in bits is probably\ncomparable to the total number of connections among the neurons - about a hundred\ntrillion, 104, bits. If written out in English, say, that information would fill some twenty\nmillion volumes, as many as in the world's largest libraries. The equivalent of twenty\nmillion books is inside the heads of every one us. The brain is a very big place in a very\nsmall space. Most of the books in the brain are in the cerebral cortex. Down in the\nbasement are the functions our remote ancestors mainly depended on - aggression, child-\nrearing, fear, sex, the willingness to follow leaders blindly. Of the higher brain functions,\nsome - reading, writing, speaking - seem to be localized in particular places in the cerebral\ncortex. Memories, on the other hand, are stored redundantly in many locales. If such a thing\nas telepathy existed, one of its glories would be the opportunity for each of us to read the\nbooks in the cerebral cortices of our loved ones. But there is no compelling evidence for\ntelepathy, and the communication of such information remains the task of artists and\nwriters.\n\nThe brain does much more than recollect. It compares, synthesizes, analyzes,\ngenerates abstractions. We must figure out much more than our genes can know. That is\nwhy the brain library is some ten thousand times larger than the gene library. Our passion\nfor learning, evident in the behavior of every toddler, is the tool for our survival. Emotions\nand ritualized behavior patterns are built deeply into us. They are part of our humanity. But\nthey are not characteristically human. Many other animals have feelings. What\ndistinguishes our species is thought. The cerebral cortex is a liberation. We need no longer\nbe trapped in the genetically inherited behavior patterns of lizards and baboons. We are,\neach of us, largely responsible for what gets put into our brains, for what, as adults, we\nwind up caring for and knowing about. No longer at the mercy of the reptile brain, we can\nchange ourselves.\n\nMost of the world's great cities have grown haphazardly, little by little, in response\nto the needs of the moment; very rarely is a city planned for the remote future. The\nevolution of a city is like the evolution of the brain: it develops from a small center and\nslowly grows and changes, leaving many old parts still functioning. There is no way for\nevolution to rip out the ancient interior of the brain because of its imperfections and replace\nit with something of more modern manufacture. The brain must function during the\nrenovation. That is why the brainstem is surrounded by the R-complex, then the limbic\nsystem and finally the cerebral cortex. The old parts are in charge of too many fundamental\nfunctions for them to be replaced altogether. So they wheeze along, out-of-date and\nsometimes counterproductive, but a necessary consequence of our evolution.\n\nIn New York City, the arrangement of many of the major streets dates to the\nseventeenth century, the stock exchange to the eighteenth century, the waterworks to the\nnineteenth, the electrical power system to the twentieth. The arrangement might be more\n\nefficient if all civic systems were constructed in parallel and replaced periodically (which is\nwhy disastrous fires - the great conflagrations of London and Chicago, for example - are\nsometimes an aid in city planning). But the slow accretion of new functions permits the city\nto work more or less continuously through the centuries. In the seventeenth century you\ntraveled between Brooklyn and Manhattan across the East River by ferry. In the nineteenth\ncentury, the technology became available to construct a suspension bridge across the river.\nIt was built precisely at the site of the ferry terminal, both because the city owned the land\nand because major thoroughfares were already converging on the pre-existing ferry service.\nLater when it was possible to construct a tunnel under the river, it too was built in the same\nplace for the same reasons, and also because small abandoned precursors of tunnels, called\ncaissons, had already been emplaced during the construction of the bridge. This use and\nrestructuring of previous systems for new purposes is very much like the pattern of\nbiological evolution.\n\nWhen our genes could not store all the information necessary for survival, we\nslowly invented brains. But then the time came, perhaps ten thousand years ago, when we\nneeded to know more than could conveniently be contained in brains. So we learned to\nstockpile enormous quantities of information outside our bodies. We are the only species\non the planet, so far as we know, to have invented a communal memory stored neither in\nour genes nor in our brains. The warehouse of that memory is called the library.\n\nA book is made from a tree. It is an assemblage of flat, flexible parts (still called\n\u2018leaves\u2019) imprinted with dark pigmented squiggles. One glance at it and you hear the voice\nof another person - perhaps someone dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, the\nauthor is speaking, clearly and silently, inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps\nthe greatest of human inventions, binding together people, citizens of distant epochs, who\nnever knew one another. Books break the shackles of time, proof that humans can work\nmagic.\n\nSome of the earliest authors wrote on clay. Cuneiform writing, the remote ancestor\nof the Western alphabet, was invented in the Near East about 5,000 years ago. Its purpose\nwas to keep records: the purchase of grain, the sale of land, the triumphs of the king, the\nstatutes of the priests, the positions of the stars, the prayers to the gods. For thousands of\nyears, writing was chiseled into clay and stone, scratched onto wax or bark or leather;\npainted on bamboo or papyrus or silk - but always one copy at a time and, except for the\ninscriptions on monuments, always for a tiny readership. Then in China between the second\nand sixth centuries, paper, ink and printing with carved wooden blocks were all invented,\npermitting many copies of a work to be made and distributed. It took a thousand years for\nthe idea to catch on in remote and backward Europe. Then, suddenly, books were being\nprinted all over the world. Just before the invention of movable type, around 1450, there\nwere no more than a few tens of thousands of books in all of Europe, all handwritten; about\nas many as in China in 100 B.C., and a tenth as many as in the Great Library of Alexandria.\nFifty years later, around 1500, there were ten million printed books. Learning had become\navailable to anyone who could read. Magic was everywhere.\n\nMore recently, books, especially paperbacks, have been printed in massive and\ninexpensive editions. For the price of a modest meal you can ponder the decline and fall of\nthe Roman Empire, the origin of species, the interpretation of dreams, the nature of things.\nBooks are like seeds. They can lie dormant for centuries and then flower in the most\nunpromising soil.\n\nThe great libraries of the world contain millions of volumes, the equivalent of about\n\n10\" bits of information in words, and perhaps 10\u2019\u00b0 bits in pictures. This is ten thousand\ntimes more information than in our genes, and about ten times more than in our brains. If I\nfinish a book a week, I will read only a few thousand books in my lifetime, about a tenth of\na percent of the contents of the greatest libraries of our time. The trick is to know which\nbooks to read. The information in books is not preprogrammed at birth but constantly\nchanged, amended by events, adapted to the world. It is now twenty-three centuries since\nthe founding of the Alexandrian Library. If there were no books, no written records, think\nhow prodigious a time twenty-three centuries would be. With four generations per century,\ntwenty-three centuries occupies almost a hundred generations of human beings. If\ninformation could be passed on merely by word of mouth, how little we should know of our\npast, how slow would be our progress! Everything would depend on what ancient findings\nwe had accidentally been told about, and how accurate the account was. Past information\nmight be revered, but in successive retellings it would become progressively more muddled\nand eventually lost. Books permit us to voyage through time, to tap the wisdom of our\nancestors. The library connects us with the insights and knowledge, painfully extracted\nfrom Nature, of the greatest minds that ever were, with the best teachers, drawn from the\nentire planet and from all of our history, to instruct us without tiring, and to inspire us to\nmake our own contribution to the collective knowledge of the human species. Public\nlibraries depend on voluntary contributions. I think the health of our civilization, the depth\nof our awareness about the underpinnings of our culture and our concern for the future can\nall be tested by how well we support our libraries.\n\nWere the Earth to be started over again with all its physical features identical, it is\nextremely unlikely that anything closely resembling a human being would ever again\nemerge. There is a powerful random character to the evolutionary process. A cosmic ray\nstriking a different gene, producing a different mutation, can have small consequences early\nbut profound consequences late. Happenstance may play a powerful role in biology, as it\ndoes in history. The farther back the critical events occur, the more powerfully can they\ninfluence the present.\n\nFor example, consider our hands. We have five fingers, including one opposable\nthumb. They serve us quite well. But I think we would be served equally well with six\nfingers including a thumb, or four fingers including a thumb, or maybe five fingers and two\nthumbs. There is nothing intrinsically best about our particular configuration of fingers,\nwhich we ordinarily think of as so natural and inevitable. We have five fingers because we\nhave descended from a Devonian fish that had five phalanges or bones in its fins. Had we\ndescended from a fish with four or six phalanges, we would have four or six fingers on each\nhand and would think them perfectly natural. We use base ten arithmetic only because we\nhave ten fingers on our hands.* Had the arrangement been otherwise, we would use base\neight or base twelve arithmetic and relegate base ten to the New Math. The same point\napplies, I believe, to many more essential aspects of our being - our hereditary material, our\ninternal biochemistry, our form, stature, organ systems, loves and hates, passions and\ndespairs, tenderness and aggression, even our analytical processes - all of these are, at least\nin part, the result of apparently minor accidents in our immensely long evolutionary history.\nPerhaps if one less dragonfly had drowned in the Carboniferous swamps, the intelligent\norganisms on our planet today would have feathers and teach their young in rookeries. The\npattern of evolutionary causality is a web of astonishing complexity; the incompleteness of\nour understanding humbles us.\n\n* The arithmetic based on the number 5 or 10 seems so obvious that the ancient Greek equivalent of\n\u2018to count\u2019 literally means \u2018to five.\u201d\n\nJust sixty-five million years ago our ancestors were the most unprepossessing of\nmammals - creatures with the size and intelligence of moles or tree shrews. It would have\ntake a very audacious biologist to guess that such animals would eventually produce the\nline that dominates the Earth today. The Earth then was full of awesome, nightmarish\nlizards - the dinosaurs, immensely successful creatures, which filled virtually every\necological niche. There were swimming reptiles, flying reptiles, and reptiles - some as tall\nas a six-story building - thundering across the face of the Earth. Some of them had rather\nlarge brains, an upright posture and two little front legs very much like hands, which they\nused to catch small, speedy mammals - probably including our distant ancestors - for\ndinner. If such dinosaurs had survived, perhaps the dominant intelligent species on our\nplanet today would be four meters tall with green skin and sharp teeth, and the human form\nwould be considered a lurid fantasy of saurian science fiction. But the dinosaurs did not\nsurvive. In one catastrophic event all of them and many, perhaps most, of the other species\non the Earth, were destroyed.* But not the tree shrews. Not the mammals. They survived.\n\n* A recent analysis suggests that 96 per cent of all the species in the oceans may have died at this\ntime. With such an enormous extinction rate, the organisms of today can have evolved from only a small and\nunrepresentative sampling of the organisms that lived in late Mesozoic times.\n\nNo one knows what wiped out the dinosaurs. One evocative idea is that it was a\ncosmic catastrophe, the explosion of a nearby star - a supernova like the one that produced\nthe Crab Nebula. If there were by chance a supernova within ten or twenty light-years of\nthe solar system some sixty-five million years ago, it would have sprayed an intense flux of\ncosmic rays into space, and some of these, entering the Earth's envelope of air, would have\nburned the atmospheric nitrogen. The oxides of nitrogen thus generated would have\nremoved the protective layer of ozone from the atmosphere, increasing the flux of solar\nultraviolet radiation at the surface and frying and mutating the many organisms imperfectly\nprotected against intense ultraviolet light. Some of those organisms may have been staples\nof the dinosaur diet.\n\nThe disaster, whatever it was, that cleared the dinosaurs from the world stage\nremoved the pressure on the mammals. Our ancestors no longer had to live in the shadow\nof voracious reptiles. We diversified exuberantly and flourished. Twenty million years ago,\nour immediate ancestors probably still lived in the trees, later descending because the\nforests receded during a major ice age and were replaced by grassy savannahs. It is not\nmuch good to be supremely adapted to life in the trees if there are very few trees. Many\narboreal primates must have vanished with the forests. A few eked out a precarious\nexistence on the ground and survived. And one of those lines evolved to become us. No one\nknows the cause of that climatic change. It may have been a small variation in the intrinsic\nluminosity of the Sun or in the orbit of the Earth; or massive volcanic eruptions injecting\nfine dust into the stratosphere, reflecting more sunlight back into space and cooling the\nEarth. It may have been due to changes in the general circulation of the oceans. Or perhaps\nthe passage of the Sun through a galactic dust cloud. Whatever the cause, we see again how\ntied our existence is to random astronomical and geological events.\n\nAfter we came down from the trees, we evolved an upright posture; our hands were\nfree; we possessed excellent binocular vision - we had acquired many of the preconditions\nfor making tools. There was now a real advantage in possessing a large brain and in\ncommunicating complex thoughts. Other things being equal, it is better to be smart than to\nbe stupid. Intelligent beings can solve problems better, live longer and leave more\noffspring; until the invention of nuclear weapons, intelligence powerfully aided survival. In\nour history it was some horde of furry little mammals who hid from the dinosaurs,\ncolonized the treetops and later scampered down to domesticate fire, invent writing,\nconstruct observatories and launch space vehicles. If things had been a little different, it\nmight have been some other creature whose intelligence and manipulative ability would\nhave led to comparable accomplishments. Perhaps the smart bipedal dinosaurs, or the\nraccoons, or the otters, or the squid. It would be nice to know how different other\nintelligences can be; so we study the whales and the great apes. To learn a little about what\nother kinds of civilizations are possible, we can study history and cultural anthropology.\nBut we are all of us - us whales, us apes, us people - too closely related. As long as our\ninquiries are limited to one or two evolutionary lines on a single planet, we will remain\nforever ignorant of the possible range and brilliance of other intelligences and other\ncivilizations.\n\nOn another planet, with a different sequence of random processes to make\nhereditary diversity and a different environment to select particular combinations of genes,\nthe chances of finding beings who are physically very similar to us is, I believe, near zero.\nThe chances of finding another form of intelligence is not. Their brains may well have\nevolved from the inside out. They may have switching elements analogous to our neurons.\nBut the neurons may be very different; perhaps superconductors that work at very low\ntemperatures rather than organic devices that work at room temperature, in which case their\nspeed of thought will be 10\u00b0 times faster than ours. Or perhaps the equivalent of neurons\nelsewhere would not be in direct physical contact but in radio communication so that a\nsingle intelligent being could be distributed among many different organisms, or even many\ndifferent planets, each with a part of the intelligence of the whole, each contributing by\nradio to an intelligence much greater than itself.* There may be planets where the\nintelligent beings have about 10\"* neural connections, as we do. But there may be places\nwhere the number is 10\u201d or 10\u00b0. I wonder what they would know. Because we inhabit the\nsame universe as they, we and they must share some substantial information in common. If\nwe could make contact, there is much in their brains that would be of great interest to ours.\nBut the opposite is also true. I think extraterrestrial intelligence - even beings substantially\nfurther evolved than we - will be interested in us, in what we know, how we think, what our\nbrains are like, the course of our evolution, the prospects for our future.\n\n* In some sense such a radio integration of separate individuals is already beginning to happen on the\nplanet Earth.\n\nIf there are intelligent beings on the planets of fairly nearby stars, could they know\nabout us? Might they somehow have an inkling of the long evolutionary progression from\ngenes to brains to libraries that has occurred on the obscure planet Earth? If the\nextraterrestrials stay at home, there are at least two ways in which they might find out about\nus. One way would be to listen with large radio telescopes. For billions of years they would\nhave heard only weak and intermittent radio static caused by lightning and the trapped\n\nelectrons and protons whistling within the Earth's magnetic field. Then, less than a century\nago, the radio waves leaving the Earth would become stronger, louder, less like noise and\nmore like signals. The inhabitants of Earth had finally stumbled upon radio communication.\nToday there is a vast international radio, television and radar communications traffic. At\nsome radio frequencies the Earth has become by far the brightest object, the most powerful\nradio source, in the solar system - brighter than Jupiter, brighter than the Sun. An\nextraterrestrial civilization monitoring the radio emission from Earth and receiving such\nsignals could not fail to conclude that something interesting had been happening here\nlately.\n\nAs the Earth rotates, our more powerful radio transmitters slowly sweep the sky. A\nradio astronomer on a planet of another star would be able to calculate the length of the day\non Earth from the times of appearance and disappearance of our signals. Some of our most\npowerful sources are radar transmitters; a few are used for radar astronomy, to probe with\nradio fingers the surfaces of the nearby planets. The size of the radar beam projected\nagainst the sky is much larger than the size of the planets, and much of the signal wafts on,\nout of the solar system into the depths of interstellar space to any sensitive receivers that\nmay be listening. Most radar transmissions are for military purposes; they scan the skies in\nconstant fear of a massive launch of missiles with nuclear warheads, an augury fifteen\nminutes early of the end of human civilization. The information content of these pulses is\nnegligible: a succession of simple numerical patterns coded into beeps.\n\nOverall, the most pervasive and noticeable source of radio transmissions from the\nEarth is our television programming. Because the Earth is turning, some television stations\nwill appear at one horizon of the Earth while others disappear over the other. There will be\na confused jumble of programs. Even these might be sorted out and pieced together by an\nadvanced civilization on a planet of a nearby star. The most frequently repeated messages\nwill be station call signals and appeals to purchase detergents, deodorants, headache tablets,\nand automobile and petroleum products. The most noticeable messages will be those\nbroadcast simultaneously by many transmitters in many time zones - for example, speeches\nin times of international crisis by the President of the United States or the Premier of the\nSoviet Union. The mindless contents of commercial television and the integuments of\ninternational crisis and internecine warfare within the human family are the principal\nmessages about life on Earth that we choose to broadcast to the Cosmos. What must they\nthink of us?\n\nThere is no calling those television programs back. There is no way of sending a\nfaster message to overtake them and revise the previous transmission. Nothing can travel\nfaster than light. Large-scale television transmission on the planet Earth began only in the\nlate 1940\u2019s. Thus, there is a spherical wave front centered on the Earth expanding at the\nspeed of light and containing Howdy Doody, the \u2018Checkers\u2019 speech of then Vice-President\nRichard M. Nixon and the televised inquisitions by Senator Joseph McCarthy. Because\nthese transmissions were broadcast a few decades ago, they are only a few tens of light-\nyears away from the Earth. If the nearest civilization is farther away than that, then we can\ncontinue to breathe easy for a while. In any case, we can hope that they will find these\nprograms incomprehensible.\n\nThe two Voyager spacecraft are bound for the stars. Affixed to each is a gold-plated\ncopper phonograph record with a cartridge and stylus and, on the aluminum record jacket,\ninstructions for use. We sent something about our genes, something about our brains, and\nsomething about our libraries to other beings who might sail the sea of interstellar space.\n\nBut we did not want to send primarily scientific information. Any civilization able to\nintercept Voyager in the depths of interstellar space, its transmitters long dead, would know\nfar more science than we do. Instead, we wanted to tell those other beings something about\nwhat seems unique about ourselves. The interests of the cerebral cortex and limbic system\nare well represented; the R-complex less so. Although the recipients may not know any\nlanguages of the Earth, we included greetings in sixty human tongues, as well as the hellos\nof the humpback whales. We sent photographs of humans from all over the world caring\nfor one another, learning, fabricating tools and art and responding to challenges. There is an\nhour and a half of exquisite music from many cultures, some of it expressing our sense of\ncosmic loneliness, our wish to end our isolation, our longing to make contact with other\nbeings in the Cosmos. And we have sent recordings of the sounds that would have been\nheard on our planet from the earliest days before the origin of life to the evolution of the\nhuman species and our most recent burgeoning technology. It is, as much as the sounds of\nany baleen whale, a love song cast upon the vastness of the deep. Many, perhaps most, of\nour messages will be indecipherable. But we have sent them because it is important to try.\n\nIn this spirit we included on the Voyager spacecraft the thoughts and feelings of one\nperson, the electrical activity of her brain, heart, eyes and muscles, which were recorded for\nan hour, transcribed into sound, compressed in time and incorporated into the record. In one\nsense we have launched into the Cosmos a direct transcription of the thoughts and feelings\nof a single human being in the month of June in the year 1977 on the planet Earth. Perhaps\nthe recipients will make nothing of it, or think it is a recording of a pulsar, which in some\nsuperficial sense it resembles. Or perhaps a civilization unimaginably more advanced than\nours will be able to decipher such recorded thoughts and feelings and appreciate our efforts\nto share ourselves with them.\n\nThe information in our genes is very old - most of it more than millions of years\nold, some of it billions of years old. In contrast, the information in our books is at most\nthousands of years old, and that in our brains is only decades old. The long-lived\ninformation is not the characteristically human information. Because of erosion on the\nEarth, our monuments and artifacts will not, in the natural course of things, survive to the\ndistant future. But the Voyager record is on its way out of the solar system. The erosion in\ninterstellar space - chiefly cosmic rays and impacting dust grains - is so slow that the\ninformation on the record will last a billion years. Genes and brains and books encode\ninformation differently and persist through time at different rates. But the persistence of the\nmemory of the human species will be far longer in the impressed metal grooves on the\nVoyager interstellar record.\n\nThe Voyager message is traveling with agonizing slowness. The fastest object ever\nlaunched by the human species, it will still take tens of thousands of years to go the\ndistance to the nearest star. Any television program will traverse in hours the distance that\nVoyager has covered in years. A television transmission that has just finished being aired\nwill, in only a few hours, overtake the Voyager spacecraft in the region of Saturn and\nbeyond and speed outward to the stars. If it is headed that way, the signal will reach Alpha\nCentauri in a little more than four years. If, some decades or centuries hence, anyone out\nthere in space hears our television broadcasts, I hope they will think well of us, a product of\nfifteen billion years of cosmic evolution, the local transmogrification of matter into\nconsciousness. Our intelligence has recently provided us with awesome powers. It is not yet\nclear that we have the wisdom to avoid our own self-destruction. But many of us are trying\nvery hard. We hope that very soon in the perspective of cosmic time we will have unified\n\nour planet peacefully into an organization cherishing the life of every living creature on it\nand will be ready to take that next great step, to become part of a galactic society of\ncommunicating civilizations.\n",

Our ships will\ntravel faster. There will be designated interstellar objectives, and sooner or later our\nspacecraft will have human crews. In the Milky Way Galaxy there must be many planets\nmillions of years older than Earth, and some that are billions of years older. Should we not\nhave been visited? In all the billions of years since the origin of our planet, has there not\nbeen even once a strange craft from a distant civilization surveying our world from above,\nand slowly settling down to the surface to be observed by iridescent dragonflies, incurious\nreptiles, screeching primates or wondering humans? The idea is natural enough. It has\noccurred to everyone who has contemplated, even casually, the question of intelligent life\nin the universe. But has it happened in fact? The critical issue is the quality of the purported\nevidence, rigorously and skeptically scrutinized - not what sounds plausible, not the\nunsubstantiated testimony of one or two self-professed eyewitnesses. By this standard there\nare no compelling cases of extraterrestrial visitation, despite all the claims about UFOs and\nancient astronauts which sometimes make it seem that our planet is awash in uninvited\nguests. I wish it were otherwise. There is something irresistible about the discovery of even\na token, perhaps a complex inscription, but, best by far, a key to the understanding of an\nalien and exotic civilization. It is an appeal we humans have felt before.\n\nIn 1801 a physicist named Joseph Fourier* was the prefect of a departement of\nFrance called Is\u00e9re. While inspecting the schools in his province, Fourier discovered an\neleven-year-old boy whose remarkable intellect and flair for oriental languages had already\nearned him the admiring attention of scholars. Fourier invited him home for a chat. The boy\nwas fascinated by Fourier\u2019s collection of Egyptian artifacts, collected during the\nNapoleonic expedition where he had been responsible for cataloging the astronomical\nmonuments of that ancient civilization. The hieroglyphic inscriptions roused the boy\u2019s\nsense of wonder. \u2018But what do they mean?\u2019 he asked. \u2018Nobody knows,\u2019 was the reply. The\nboy\u2019s name was Jean Frangois Champollion. Fired by the mystery of language no one could\nread, he became a superb linguist and passionately immersed himself in ancient Egyptian\nwriting. France at that time was flooded with Egyptian artifacts, stolen by Napoleon and\nlater made available to Western scholars. The description of the expedition was published,\nand devoured by the young Champollion. As an adult, Champollion succeeded; fulfilling\nhis childhood ambition, he provided a brilliant decipherment of the ancient Egyptian\nhieroglyphics. But it was not until 1828, twenty-seven years after his meeting with Fourier,\nthat Champollion first set foot in Egypt, the land of his dreams, and sailed upstream from\nCairo, following the course of the Nile, paying homage to the culture he had worked so\nhard to understand. It was an expedition in time, a visit to an alien civilization:\n\nThe evening of the 16th we finally arrived at Dendera. There was magnificent\nmoonlight and we were only an hour away from the Temples: Could we resist the\ntemptation? I ask the coldest of you mortals! To dine and leave immediately were\nthe orders of the moment: alone and without guides, but armed to the teeth we\ncrossed the fields . . . the Temple appeared to us at last . . . One could well measure\nit but to give an idea of it would be impossible. It is the union of grace and majesty\nin the highest degree. We stayed there two hours in ecstasy, running through the\nhuge rooms .. . and trying to read the exterior inscriptions in the moonlight. We did\nnot return to the boat until three in the morning, only to return to the Temple at\nseven. . . What had been magnificent in the moonlight was still so when the\nsunlight revealed to us all the details .. . We in Europe are only dwarfs and no\n\nnation, ancient or modern, has conceived the art of architecture on such a sublime,\ngreat, and imposing style, as the ancient Egyptians. They ordered everything to be\ndone for people who are a hundred feet high.\n\n* Fourier is now famous for his study of the propagation of heat in solids, used today to understand\nthe surface properties of the planets, and for his investigation of waves and other periodic motion - a branch\nof mathematics known as Fourier analysis.\n\nOn the walls and columns of Karnak, at Dendera, everywhere in Egypt, Champollion\ndelighted to find that he could read the inscriptions almost effortlessly. Many before him\nhad tried and failed to decipher the lovely hieroglyphics, a word that means \u2018sacred\ncarvings.\u2019 Some scholars had believed them to be a kind of picture code, rich in murky\nmetaphor, mostly about eyeballs and wavy lines, beetles, bumblebees and birds - especially\nbirds. Confusion was rampant. There were those who deduced that the Egyptians were\ncolonists from ancient China. There were those who concluded the opposite. Enormous\nfolio volumes of spurious translations were published. One interpreter glanced at the\nRosetta stone, whose hieroglyphic inscription was then still undeciphered, and instantly\nannounced its meaning. He said that the quick decipherment enabled him \u2018to avoid the\nsystematic errors which invariably arise from prolonged reflection.\u2019 You get better results,\nhe argued, by not thinking too much. As with the search for extraterrestrial life today, the\nunbridled speculation of amateurs had frightened many professionals out of the field.\n\nChampollion resisted the idea of hieroglyphs as pictorial metaphors. Instead, with\nthe aid of a brilliant insight by the English physicist Thomas Young, he proceeded\nsomething like this: The Rosetta stone had been uncovered in 1799 by a French soldier\nworking on the fortifications of the Nile Delta town of Rashid, which the Europeans,\nlargely ignorant of Arabic, called Rosetta. It was a slab from an ancient temple, displaying\nwhat seemed clearly to be the same message in three different writings: in hieroglyphics at\ntop, in a kind of cursive hieroglyphic called demotic in the middle, and, the key to the\nenterprise, in Greek at the bottom. Champollion, who was fluent in ancient Greek, read that\nthe stone had been inscribed to commemorate the coronation of Ptolemy V Epiphanes, in\nthe spring of the year 196 B.C. On this occasion the king released political prisoners,\nremitted taxes, endowed temples, forgave rebels, increased military preparedness and, in\nshort, did all the things that modern rulers do when they wish to stay in office.\n\nThe Greek text mentions Ptolemy many times. In roughly the same positions in the\nhieroglyphic text is a set of symbols surrounded by an oval or cartouche. This,\nChampollion reasoned, very probably also denotes Ptolemy. If so, the writing could not be\nfundamentally pictographic or metaphorical; rather, most of the symbols must stand for\nletters or syllables. Champollion also had the presence of mind to count up the number of\nGreek words and the number of individual hieroglyphs in what were presumably equivalent\ntexts. There were many fewer of the former, again suggesting that the hieroglyphs were\nmainly letters and syllables. But which hieroglyphs correspond to which letters?\nFortunately, Champollion had available to him an obelisk, which had been excavated at\nPhilae, that included the hieroglyphic equivalent of the Greek name Cleopatra. Ptolemy\nbegins with P; the first symbol in the cartouche is a square. Cleopatra has for its fifth letter\na P, and in the Cleopatra cartouche in the fifth position is the same square. P it is. The\nfourth letter in Ptolemy is an L. It is represented by the lion. The second letter of Cleopatra\nis an L and, in hieroglyphics, here is a lion again. The eagle is an A, appearing twice in\n\nCleopatra, as it should. A clear pattern is emerging. Egyptian hieroglyphics are, in\nsignificant part, a simple substitution cipher. But not every hieroglyph is a letter or syllable.\nSome are pictographs. The end of the Ptolemy cartouche means \u2018Ever-living, beloved of\nthe god Ptah.\u2019 The semicircle and egg at the end of Cleopatra are a conventional ideogram\nfor \u2018daughter of Isis.\u2019 This mix of letters and pictographs caused some grief for earlier\ninterpreters.\n\nIn retrospect it sounds almost easy. But it had taken many centuries to figure out,\nand there was a great deal more to do, especially in the decipherment of the hieroglyphs of\nmuch earlier times. The cartouches were the key within the key, almost as if the pharaohs\nof Egypt had circled their own names to make the going easier for the Egyptologists two\nthousand years in the future. Champollion walked the Great Hypostyle Hall at Karnak and\ncasually read the inscriptions, which had mystified everyone else, answering the question\nhe had posed as a child to Fourier. What a joy it must have been to open this one-way\ncommunication channel with another civilization, to permit a culture that had been mute for\nmillennia to speak of its history, magic, medicine, religion, politics and philosophy.\n\nToday we are again seeking messages from an ancient and exotic civilization, this\ntime hidden from us not only in time but also in space. If we should receive a radio\nmessage from an extraterrestrial civilization, how could it possibly be understood?\nExtraterrestrial intelligence will be elegant, complex, internally consistent and utterly alien.\nExtraterrestrials would, of course, wish to make a message sent to us as comprehensible as\npossible. But how could they? Is there in any sense an interstellar Rosetta stone? We\nbelieve there is. We believe there is a common language that all technical civilizations, no\nmatter how different, must have. That common language is science and mathematics. The\nlaws of Nature are the same everywhere. The patterns in the spectra of distant stars and\ngalaxies are the same as those for the Sun or for appropriate laboratory experiments: not\nonly do the same chemical elements exist everywhere in the universe, but also the same\nlaws of quantum mechanics that govern the absorption and emission of radiation by atoms\napply everywhere as well. Distant galaxies revolving about one another follow the same\nlaws of gravitational physics as govern the motion of an apple falling to Earth, or Voyager\non its way to the stars. The patterns of Nature are everywhere the same. An interstellar\nmessage, intended to be understood by an emerging civilization; should be easy to decode.\n\nWe do not expect an advanced technical civilization on any other planet in our solar\nsystem. If one were only a little behind us - 10,000 years, say - it would have no advanced\ntechnology at all. If it were only a little ahead of us - we who are already exploring the solar\nsystem - its representatives should by now be here. To communicate with other\ncivilizations, we require a method adequate not merely for interplanetary distances but for\ninterstellar distances. Ideally, the method should be inexpensive, so that a huge amount of\ninformation could be sent and received at very little cost; fast, so an interstellar dialogue is\nrendered possible; and obvious, so any technological civilization, no matter what its\nevolutionary path, will discover it early. Surprisingly, there is such a method. It is called\nradio astronomy.\n\nThe largest semi-steerable radio/radar observatory on the planet Earth is the Arecibo\nfacility, which Cornell University operates for the National Science Foundation. In the\nremote hinterland of the island of Puerto Rico, it is 305 meters (a thousand feet) across, its\nreflecting surface a section of a sphere laid down in a pre-existing bowl-shaped valley. It\nreceives radio waves from the depths of space, focusing them onto the feed arm antenna\nhigh above the dish, which is in turn electronically connected to the control room, where\n\nthe signal is analyzed. Alternatively, when the telescope is used as a radar transmitter, the\nfeed arm can broadcast a signal into the dish, which reflects it into space. The Arecibo\nObservatory has been used both to search for intelligent signals from civilizations in space\nand, just once, to broadcast a message - to M13, a distant globular cluster of stars, so that\nour technical capability to engage in both sides of an interstellar dialogue would be clear, at\nleast to us.\n\nIna period of a few weeks, the Arecibo Observatory could transmit to a comparable\nobservatory on a planet of a nearby star all of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. Radio waves\ntravel at the speed of light, 10,000 times faster than a message attached to our fastest\ninterstellar spaceship. Radio telescopes generate, in narrow frequency ranges, signals so\nintense they can be detected over immense interstellar distances. The Arecibo Observatory\ncould communicate with an identical radio telescope on a planet 15,000 light-years away,\nhalfway to the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, if we knew precisely where to point it. And\nradio astronomy is a natural technology. Virtually any planetary atmosphere, no matter\nwhat its composition, should be partially transparent to radio waves. Radio messages are\nnot much absorbed or scattered by the gas between the stars, just as a San Francisco radio\nstation can be heard easily in Los Angeles even when smog there has reduced the visibility\nat optical wavelengths to a few kilometers. There are many natural cosmic radio sources\nhaving nothing to do with intelligent life - pulsars and quasars, the radiation belts of planets\nand the outer atmospheres of stars; from almost any planet there are bright radio sources to\ndiscover early in the local development of radio astronomy. Moreover, radio represents a\nlarge fraction of the electromagnetic spectrum. Any technology able to detect radiation of\nany wavelength would fairly soon stumble on the radio part of the spectrum.\n\nThere may be other effective methods of communication that have substantial merit:\ninterstellar spacecraft; optical or infrared lasers; pulsed neutrinos; modulated gravity\nwaves; or some other kind of transmission that we will not discover for a thousand years.\nAdvanced civilizations may have graduated far beyond radio for their own\ncommunications. But radio is powerful, cheap, fast and simple. They will know that a\nbackward civilization like ours,, wishing to receive messages from the skies, is likely to\nturn first to radio technology. Perhaps they will have to wheel the radio telescopes out of\nthe Museum of Ancient Technology. If we were to receive a radio message we would know\nthat there would be at the very least one thing we could talk about: radio astronomy.\n\nBut is there anyone out there to talk to? With a third or half a trillion stars in our\nMilky Way Galaxy alone, could ours be the only one accompanied by an inhabited planet?\nHow much more likely it is that technical civilizations are a cosmic commonplace, that the\nGalaxy is pulsing and humming with advanced societies, and, therefore, that the nearest\nsuch culture is not so very far away - perhaps transmitting from antennas established on a\nplanet of a naked-eye star just next door. Perhaps when we look up at the sky at night, near\none of those faint pinpoints of light is a world on which someone quite different from us is\nthen glancing idly at a star we call the Sun and entertaining, for just a moment, an\noutrageous speculation.\n\nIt is very hard to be sure. There may be severe impediments to the evolution of a\ntechnical civilization. Planets may be rarer than we think. Perhaps the origin of life is not so\neasy as our laboratory experiments suggest. Perhaps the evolution of advanced life forms is\nimprobable. Or it may be that complex life forms evolve readily, but intelligence and\ntechnical societies require an unlikely set of coincidences - just as the evolution of the\nhuman species depended on the demise of the dinosaurs and the ice-age recession of the\n\nforests in whose trees our ancestors screeched and dimly wondered. Or perhaps\ncivilizations arise repeatedly, inexorably, on innumerable planets in the Milky Way, but are\ngenerally unstable; so all but a tiny fraction are unable to survive their technology and\nsuccumb to greed and ignorance, pollution and nuclear war.\n\nIt is possible to explore this great issue further and make a crude estimate of N, the\nnumber of advanced technical civilizations in the Galaxy. We define an advanced\ncivilization as one capable of radio astronomy. This is, of course, a parochial if essential\ndefinition. There may be countless worlds on which the inhabitants are accomplished\nlinguists or superb poets but indifferent radio astronomers. We will not hear from them. N\ncan be written as the product or multiplication of a number of factors, each a kind of filter,\nevery one of which must be sizable for there to be large number of civilizations:\n\nNs, the number of stars in the Milky Way Galaxy;\n\nf,, the fraction of stars that have planetary systems;\n\nne, the number of planets in a given system that are ecologically suitable for life;\n\nfi, the fraction of otherwise suitable planets on which life actually arises;\n\nfi, the fraction of inhabited planets on which an intelligent form of life evolves;\n\nf,, the fraction of planets inhabited by intelligent beings on which a communicative\ntechnical civilization develops; and\n\nf,, the fraction of a planetary lifetime graced by a technical civilization.\n\nWritten out, the equation reads N = Nefngfififefy. All the fs are fractions, having values\nbetween 0 and 1; they will pare down the large value of N-.\n\nTo derive N we must estimate each of these quantities. We know a fair amount about the\nearly factors in the equation, the numbers of stars and planetary systems. We know very\nlittle about the later factors, concerning the evolution of intelligence or the lifetime of\ntechnical societies. In these cases our estimates will be little better than guesses. I invite\nyou, if you disagree with my estimates below, to make your own choices and see what\nimplications your alternative suggestions have for the number of advanced civilizations in\nthe Galaxy. One of the great virtues of this equation, due originally to Frank Drake of\nCornell, is that it involves subjects ranging from stellar and planetary astronomy to organic\nchemistry, evolutionary biology, history, politics and abnormal psychology. Much of the\nCosmos is in the span of the Drake equation.\n\nWe know N+, the number of stars in the Milky Way Galaxy, fairly well, by careful\ncounts of stars in small but representative regions of the sky. It is a few hundred billion;\nsome recent estimates place it at 4x 10''. Very few of these stars are of the massive short-\nlived variety that squander their reserves of thermonuclear fuel. The great majority have\nlifetimes of billions or more years in which they are shining stably, providing a suitable\nenergy source for the origin and evolution of life on nearby planets.\n\nThere is evidence that planets are a frequent accompaniment of star formation: in\nthe satellite systems of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus, which are like miniature solar systems;\nin theories of the origin of the planets; in studies of double stars; in observations of\naccretion disks around stars; and in some preliminary investigations of gravitational\nperturbations of nearby stars. Many, perhaps even most, stars may have planets. We take\nthe fraction of stars that have planets, f, as roughly equal to 1/3 . Then the total number of\n\nplanetary systems in the Galaxy would be Nef, = 1.3 x 10'! (the symbol ~ means\n\u2018approximately equal to\u2019). If each system were to have about ten planets, as ours does, the\ntotal number of worlds in the Galaxy would be more than a trillion, a vast arena for the\ncosmic drama.\n\nIn our own solar system there are several bodies that may be suitable for life of\nsome sort: the Earth certainly, and perhaps Mars, Titan and Jupiter. Once life originates, it\ntends to be very adaptable and tenacious. There must be many different environments\nsuitable for life in a given planetary system. But conservatively we choose n- = 2. Then the\nnumber of planets in the Galaxy suitable for life becomes N\u00abf,n, ~ 3 x 10\",\n\nExperiments show that under the most common cosmic conditions the molecular\nbasis of life is readily made, the building blocks of molecules able to make copies of\nthemselves. We are now on less certain ground; there may, for example, be impediments in\nthe evolution of the genetic code, although I think this unlikely over billions of years of\nprimeval chemistry. We choose fj ~ 1/3, implying a total number of planets in the Milky\nWay on which life has arisen at least once as Nefpnefi = 1 x 10', a hundred billion inhabited\nworlds. That in itself is a remarkable conclusion. But we are not yet finished.\n\nThe choices of fj and f, are more difficult. On the one hand, many individually\nunlikely steps had to occur in biological evolution and human history for our present\nintelligence and technology to develop. On the other hand, there must be many quite\ndifferent pathways to an advanced civilization of specified capabilities. Considering the\napparent difficulty in the evolution of large organisms represented by the Cambrian\nexplosion, let us choose f,x f, = 1/100, meaning that only 1 percent of planets on which life\narises eventually produce a technical civilization. This estimate represents some middle\nground among the varying scientific opinions. Some think that the equivalent of the step\nfrom the emergence of trilobites to the domestication of fire goes like a shot in all planetary\nsystems; others think that, even given ten or fifteen billion years, the evolution of technical\ncivilizations is unlikely. This is not a subject on which we can do much experimentation as\nlong as our investigations are limited to a single planet. Multiplying these factors together,\nwe find Nefpnefifif. ~ 1 x 10\u00b0, a billion planets on which technical civilizations have arisen\nat least once. But that is very different from saying that there are a billion planets on which\ntechnical civilizations now exist. For this, we must also estimate fy.\n\nWhat percentage of the lifetime of a planet is marked by a technical civilization?\nThe Earth has harbored a technical civilization characterized by radio astronomy for only a\nfew decades out of a lifetime of a few billion years. So far, then, for our planet fy, is less\nthan 1/10\u00b0, a millionth of a percent. And it is hardly out of the question that we might\ndestroy ourselves tomorrow. Suppose this were to be a typical case, and the destruction so\ncomplete that no other technical civilization - of the human or any other species - were able\nto emerge in the five or so billion years remaining before the Sun dies. Then N =\nNefpnefififef. ~ 10, and at any given time there would be only a tiny smattering, a handful, a\npitiful few technical civilizations in the Galaxy, the steady state number maintained as\nemerging societies replace those recently self-immolated. The number N might even be as\nsmall as 1. If civilizations tend to destroy themselves soon after reaching a technological\nphase, there might be no one for us to talk with but ourselves. And that we do but poorly.\nCivilizations would take billions of years of tortuous evolution to arise, and then snuff\nthemselves out in an instant of unforgivable neglect.\n\nBut consider the alternative, the prospect that at least some civilizations learn to live\n\n\nwith high technology; that the contradictions posed by the vagaries of past brain evolution\nare consciously resolved and do not lead to self-destruction; or that, even if major\ndisturbances do occur, they are reversed in the subsequent billions of years of biological\nevolution. Such societies might live to a prosperous old age, their lifetimes measured\nperhaps on geological or stellar evolutionary time scales. If 1 percent of civilizations can\nsurvive technological adolescence, take the proper fork at this critical historical branch\npoint and achieve maturity, then f, = 1/100, N = 10\u2019, and the number of extant civilizations\nin the Galaxy is in the millions. Thus, for all our concern about the possible unreliability of\nour estimates of the early factors in the Drake equation, which involved astronomy, organic\nchemistry and evolutionary biology, the principal uncertainty comes down to economics\nand politics and what, on Earth, we call human nature. It seems fairly clear that if self-\ndestruction is not the overwhelmingly preponderant fate of galactic civilizations, then the\nsky is softly humming with messages from the stars.\n\nThese estimates are stirring. They suggest that the receipt of a message from space\nis, even before we decode it, a profoundly hopeful sign. It means that someone has learned\nto live with high technology; that it is possible to survive technological adolescence. This\nalone, quite apart from the contents of the message, provides a powerful justification for the\nsearch for other civilizations.\n\nIf there are millions of civilizations distributed more or less randomly through the\nGalaxy, the distance to the nearest is about two hundred light-years. Even at the speed of\nlight it would take two centuries for a radio message to get from there to here. If we had\ninitiated the dialogue, it would be as if the question had been asked by Johannes Kepler and\nthe answer received by us. Especially because we, new to radio astronomy, must be\ncomparatively backward, and the transmitting civilization advanced, it makes more sense\nfor us to listen than to send. For a more advanced civilization, the positions are, of course,\nreversed.\n\nWeare at the earliest stages of our radio search for other civilizations in space. In an\noptical photograph of a dense star field, there are hundreds of thousands of stars. By our\nmore optimistic estimates, one of them is the site of an advanced civilization. But which\none? Toward which stars should we point our radio telescopes? Of the millions of stars that\nmay mark the location of advanced civilizations, we have so far examined by radio no more\nthan thousands. We have made about one-tenth of one percent of the required effort. But a\nserious, rigorous, systematic search will come soon. The preparatory steps are now\nunderway, both in the United States and in the Soviet Union. It is comparatively\ninexpensive: the cost of a single naval vessel of intermediate size - a modern destroyer, say\n- would pay for a decade-long program in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.\n\nBenevolent encounters have not been the rule in human history, where transcultural\ncontacts have been direct and physical, quite different from the receipt of a radio signal, a\ncontact as light as a kiss. Still, it is instructive to examine one or two cases from our past, if\nonly to calibrate our expectations: Between the times of the American and the French\nRevolutions, Louis XVI of France outfitted an expedition to the Pacific Ocean, a voyage\nwith scientific, geographic, economic and nationalistic objectives. The commander was the\nCount of La P\u00e9rouse, a noted explorer who had fought for the United States in its War of\nIndependence. In July 1786, almost a year after setting sail, he reached the coast of Alaska,\na place now called Lituya Bay. He was delighted with the harbor and wrote: \u2018Not a port in\nthe universe could afford more conveniences.\u2019 In this exemplary location, La P\u00e9rouse\n\nperceived some savages, who made signs of friendship, by displaying and waving\nwhite mantles, and different skins. Several of the canoes of these Indians were\nfishing in the Bay . . . [We were] continually surrounded by the canoes of the\nsavages, who offered us fish, skins of otters and other animals, and different little\narticles of their dress in exchange for our iron. To our great surprise, they appeared\nwell accustomed to traffic, and bargained with us with as much skill as any\ntradesman of Europe.\n\nThe Native Americans drove increasingly harder bargains. To La P\u00e9rouse\u2019s annoyance,\nthey also resorted to pilferage, largely of iron objects, but once of the uniforms of French\nnaval officers hidden under their pillows as they were sleeping one night surrounded by\narmed guards - a feat worthy of Harry Houdini. La P\u00e9rouse followed his royal orders to\nbehave peaceably but complained that the natives \u2018believed our forbearance inexhaustible.\u201d\nHe was disdainful of their society. But no serious damage was done by either culture to the\nother. After reprovisioning his two ships La P\u00e9rouse sailed out of Lituya Bay, never to\nreturn. The expedition was lost in the South Pacific in 1788; La P\u00e9rouse and all but one of\nthe members of his crew perished.*\n\n* When La P\u00e9rouse was mustering the ship\u2019s company in France, there were many bright and eager\nyoung men who applied but were turned down. One of them was a Corsican artillery officer named Napoleon\nBonaparte. It was an interesting branch point in the history of the world. If La P\u00e9rouse had accepted\nBonaparte, the Rosetta stone might never have been found, Champollion might never have decrypted\nEgyptian hieroglyphics, and in many more important respects our recent history might have been changed\nsignificantly.\n\nExactly a century later Cowee, a chief of the Tlingit, related to the Canadian\nanthropologist G. T. Emmons a story of the first meeting of his ancestors with the white\nman, a narrative handed down by word of mouth only. The Tlingit possessed no written\nrecords, nor had Cowee ever heard of La P\u00e9rouse. This is a paraphrase of Cowee\u2019s story:\n\nLate one spring a large party of Tlingit ventured North to Yakutat to trade for\ncopper. Iron was even more precious, but it was unobtainable. In entering Lituya\nBay four canoes were swallowed by the waves. As the survivors made camp and\nmourned for their lost companions two strange objects entered the Bay. No one\nknew what they were. They seemed to be great black birds with immense white\nwings. The Tlingit believed the world had been created by a great bird which often\nassumed the form of a raven, a bird which had freed the Sun, the Moon, and the\nstars from boxes in which they had been imprisoned. To look upon the Raven was\nto be turned to stone. In their fright, the Tlingit fled into the forest and hid. But after\na while, finding that no harm had come to them, a few more enterprising souls crept\nout and rolled leaves of the skunk cabbage into crude telescopes, believing that this\nwould prevent being turned to stone. Through the skunk cabbage, it seemed that the\ngreat birds were folding their wings and that flocks of small black messengers arose\nfrom their bodies and crawled upon their feathers.\n\nNow one nearly blind old warrior gathered the people together and\nannounced that his life was far behind him; for the common good he would\ndetermine whether the Raven would turn his children into stone. Putting on his robe\n\nof sea otter fur, he entered his canoe and was paddled seaward to the Raven. He\nclimbed upon it and heard strange voices. With his impaired vision he could barely\nmake out the many black forms moving before him. Perhaps they were crows.\nWhen he returned safely to his people they crowded about him, surprised to see him\nalive. They touched him and smelled him to see if it was really he. After much\nthought the old man convinced himself that it was not the god-raven that he had\nvisited, but rather a giant Canoe made by men. The black figures were not crows but\npeople of a different sort. He convinced the Tlingit, who then visited the ships and\nexchanged their furs for many strange articles, chiefly iron.\n\nThe Tlingit had preserved in oral tradition an entirely recognizable and accurate account of\ntheir first, almost fully peaceable encounter with an alien culture.*\n\n* The account of Cowee, the Tlingit chief, shows that even in a preliterate culture a recognizable\naccount of contact with an advanced civilization can be preserved for generations. If the Earth had been\nvisited hundreds or thousands of years ago by an advanced extraterrestrial civilization, even if the contacted\nculture was preliterate, we might well expect to have some recognizable form of the encounter preserved. But\nthere is not a single case in which a legend reliably dated from earlier pretechnological times can be\nunderstood only in terms of contact with an extraterrestrial civilization.\n\nIf someday we make contact with a more advanced extraterrestrial civilization, will\nthe encounter be largely peaceable, even if lacking a certain rapport, like that of the French\namong the Tlingit, or will it follow some more ghastly prototype, where the society that\nwas a little more advanced utterly destroyed the society that was technically more\nbackward? In the early sixteenth century a high civilization flourished in central Mexico.\nThe Aztecs had monumental architecture, elaborate record-keeping, exquisite art and an\nastronomical calendar superior to that of any in Europe. Upon viewing the Aztec artifacts\nreturned by the first Mexican treasure ships, the artist Albrecht Diirer wrote in August\n1520: \u2018I have never seen anything heretofore that has so rejoiced my heart. I have seen. . .\na sun entirely of gold a whole fathom broad [in fact, the Aztec astronomical calendar];\nlikewise a moon entirely of silver, equally large . . . also two chambers full of all sorts of\nweapons, armor, and other wonderous arms, all of which is fairer to see than marvels.\u2019\nIntellectuals were stunned at the Aztec books, \u2018which,\u2019 one of them said, \u2018almost resemble\nthose of the Egyptians.\u2019 Hernan Cort\u00e9s described their capital Tenochtitlan as \u2018one of the\nmost beautiful cities in the world . .. The people\u2019s activities and behavior are on almost as\nhigh a level as in Spain, and as well-organized and orderly. Considering that these people\nare barbarous, lacking knowledge of God and communication with other civilized nations,\nit is remarkable to see all that they have.\u2019 Two years after writing these words, Cort\u00e9s\nutterly destroyed Tenochtitlan along with the rest of the Aztec civilization. Here is an Aztec\naccount:\n\nMoctezuma [the Aztec Emperor] was shocked, terrified by what he heard. He was\nmuch puzzled by their food, but what made him almost faint away was the telling of\nhow the great Lombard gun, at the Spaniards\u2019 command, expelled the shot which\nthundered as it went off. The noise weakened one, dizzied one. Something like a\nstone came out of it in a shower of fire and sparks. The smoke was foul; it had a\nsickening, fetid smell. And the shot, which struck a mountain, knocked it to bits -\n\ndissolved it. It reduced a tree to sawdust - the tree disappeared as if they had blown\nit away . .. When Moctezuma was told all this, he was terror-struck. He felt faint.\nHis heart failed him.\n\nReports continued to arrive: \u2018We, are not as strong as they,\u2019 Moctezuma was told.\n\u201cWe are nothing compared to them: The Spaniards began to be called \u2018the Gods come from\nthe Heavens.\u2019 Nevertheless, the Aztecs had no illusions about the Spaniards, whom they\ndescribed in these words:\n\nThey seized upon the gold as if they were monkeys, their faces gleaming. For\nclearly their thirst for gold was insatiable; they starved for it; they lusted for it; they\nwanted to stuff themselves with it as if they were pigs. So they went about\nfingering, taking up the streamers of gold, moving them back and forth, grabbing\nthem to themselves, babbling, talking gibberish among themselves.\n\nBut their insight into the Spanish character did not help them defend themselves. In 1517 a\ngreat comet had been seen in Mexico. Moctezuma, captured by the legend of the return of\nthe Aztec god Quetzalcoatl as a white-skinned man arriving across the Eastern sea,\npromptly executed his astrologers. They had not predicted the comet, and they had not\nexplained it. Certain of forthcoming disaster, Moctezuma became distant and gloomy.\nAided by the superstition of the Aztecs and their own superior technology, an armed party\nof 400 Europeans and their native allies in the year 1521 entirely vanquished and utterly\ndestroyed a high civilization of a million people. The Aztecs had never seen a horse; there\nwere none in the New World. They had not applied iron metallurgy to warfare. They had\nnot invented firearms. Yet the technological gap between them and the Spaniards was not\nvery great, perhaps a few centuries.\n\nWe must be the most backward technical society in the Galaxy. Any society still\nmore backward would not have radio astronomy at all. If the doleful experience of cultural\nconflict on Earth were the galactic standard, it seems we would already have been\ndestroyed, perhaps with some passing admiration expressed for Shakespeare, Bach and\nVermeer. But this has not happened. Perhaps alien intentions are uncompromisingly\nbenign, more like La P\u00e9rouse than Cort\u00e9s. Or might it be, despite all the pretensions about\nUFOs and ancient astronauts, that our civilization has not yet been discovered?\n\nOn the one hand, we have argued that if even a small fraction of technical\ncivilizations learn to live with themselves and with weapons of mass destruction, there\nshould now be an enormous number of advanced civilizations in the Galaxy. We already\nhave slow interstellar flight, and think fast interstellar flight a possible goal for the human\nspecies. On the other hand, we maintain that there is no credible evidence for the Earth\nbeing visited, now or ever. Is this not a contradiction? If the nearest civilization is, say, 200\nlight-years away, it takes only 200 years to get from there to here at close to the speed of\nlight. Even at 1 percent or a tenth of a percent of the speed of light, beings from nearby\ncivilizations could have come during the tenure of humanity on Earth. Why are they not\nhere? There are many possible answers. Although it runs contrary to the heritage of\nAristarchus and Copernicus, perhaps we are the first. Some technical civilization must be\nthe first to emerge in the history of the Galaxy. Perhaps we are mistaken in our belief that at\nleast occasional civilizations avoid self-destruction. Perhaps there is some unforeseen\n\nproblem to interstellar spaceflight - although, at speeds much less than the velocity of light\nit is difficult to see what such an impediment might be. Or perhaps they are here, but in\nhiding because of some Lex Galactica, some ethic of noninterference with emerging\ncivilizations. We can imagine them, curious and dispassionate, observing us, as we would\nwatch a bacterial culture in a dish of agar, to determine whether, this year again, we\nmanage to avoid self-destruction.\n\nBut there is another explanation that is consistent with everything we know. Ifa\ngreat many years ago an advanced interstellar spacefaring civilization emerged 200 light-\nyears away, it would have no reason to think there was something special about the Earth\nunless it had been here already. No artifact of human technology, not even our radio\ntransmissions, has had time, even traveling at the speed of light, to go 200 light-years. From\ntheir point of view, all nearby star systems are more or less equally attractive for\nexploration or colonization.*\n\n* There may be many motivations to go to the stars. If our Sun or a nearby star were about to go\nsupernova, a major program of interstellar spaceflight might suddenly become attractive. If we were very\nadvanced, the discovery that the galactic core was imminently to explode might even generate serious interest\nin transgalactic or intergalactic spaceflight. Such cosmic violence occurs sufficiently often that nomadic\nspacefaring civilizations may not be uncommon. Even so, their arrival here remains unlikely.\n\nAn emerging technical civilization, after exploring its home planetary system and\ndeveloping interstellar spaceflight, would slowly and tentatively begin exploring the nearby\nstars. Some stars would have no suitable planets - perhaps they would all be giant gas\nworlds, or tiny asteroids. Others would carry an entourage of suitable planets, but some\nwould be already inhabited, or the atmosphere would be poisonous or the climate\nuncomfortable. In many cases the colonists might have to change - or as we would\nparochially say, terraform - a world to make it adequately clement. The reengineering of a\nplanet will take time. Occasionally, an already suitable world would be found and\ncolonized. The utilization of planetary resources so that new interstellar spacecraft could be\nconstructed locally would be a slow process. Eventually a second-generation mission of\nexploration and colonization would take off toward stars where no one had yet been. And\nin this way a civilization might slowly wend its way like a vine among the worlds.\n\nIt is possible that at some later time with third and higher orders of colonies\ndeveloping new worlds, another independent expanding civilization would be discovered.\nVery likely mutual contact would already have been made by radio or other remote means.\nThe new arrivals might be a different sort of colonial society. Conceivably two expanding\ncivilizations with different planetary requirements would ignore each other, their filigree\npatterns of expansion intertwining, but not conflicting. They might cooperate in the\nexploration of a province of the Galaxy. Even nearby civilizations could spend millions of\nyears in such separate or joint colonial ventures without ever stumbling upon our obscure\nsolar system.\n\nNo civilization can possibly survive to an interstellar spacefaring phase unless it\nlimits its numbers. Any society with a marked population explosion will be forced to\ndevote all its energies and technological skills to feeding and caring for the population on\nits home planet. This is a very powerful conclusion and is in no way based on the\nidiosyncrasies of a particular civilization. On any planet, no matter what its biology or\nsocial system, an exponential increase in population will swallow every resource.\n\nConversely, any civilization that engages in serious interstellar exploration and colonization\nmust have exercised zero population growth or something very close to it for many\ngenerations. But a civilization with a low population growth rate will take a long time to\ncolonize many worlds, even if the strictures on rapid population growth are eased after\nreaching some lush Eden.\n\nMy colleague William Newman and I have calculated that if a million years ago a\nspacefaring civilization with a low population growth rate emerged two hundred light-years\naway and spread outward, colonizing suitable worlds along the way, their survey starships\nwould be entering our solar system only about now. But a million years is a very long\nperiod of time. If the nearest civilization is younger than this, they would not have reached\nus yet. A sphere two hundred light-years in radius contains 200,000 suns and perhaps a\ncomparable number of worlds suitable for colonization. It is only after 200,000 other\nworlds have been colonized that, in the usual course of things, our solar system would be\naccidentally discovered to harbor an indigenous civilization.\n\nWhat does it mean for a civilization to be a million years old? We have had radio\ntelescopes and spaceships for a few decades; our technical civilization is a few hundred\nyears old, scientific ideas of a modern cast a few thousand, civilization in general a few tens\nof thousands of years; human beings evolved on this planet only a few million years ago.\nAt anything like our present rate of technical progress, an advanced civilization millions of\nyears old is as much beyond us as we are beyond a bush baby or a macaque. Would we\neven recognize its presence? Would a society a million years in advance of us be interested\nin colonization or interstellar spaceflight? People have a finite lifespan for a reason.\nEnormous progress in the biological and medical sciences might uncover that reason and\nlead to suitable remedies. Could it be that we are so interested in spaceflight because it is a\nway of perpetuating ourselves beyond our own lifetimes? Might a civilization composed of\nessentially immortal beings consider interstellar exploration fundamentally childish? It may\nbe that we have not been visited because the stars are strewn abundantly in the expanse of\nspace, so that before a nearby civilization arrives, it has altered its exploratory motivations\nor evolved into forms indetectable to us.\n\nA standard motif in science fiction and UFO literature assumes extraterrestrials\nroughly as capable as we. Perhaps they have a different sort of spaceship or ray gun, but in\nbattle - and science fiction loves to portray battles between civilizations - they and we are\nrather evenly matched. In fact, there is almost no chance that two galactic civilizations will\ninteract at the same level. In any confrontation, one will always utterly dominate the other.\nA million years is a great many. If an advanced civilization were to arrive in our solar\nsystem, there would be nothing whatever we could do about it. Their science and\ntechnology would be far beyond ours. It is pointless to worry about the possible malevolent\nintentions of an advanced civilization with whom we might make contact. It is more likely\nthat the mere fact they have survived so long means they have learned to live with\nthemselves and others. Perhaps our fears about extraterrestrial contact are merely a\nprojection of our own backwardness, an expression of our guilty conscience about our past\nhistory: the ravages that have been visited on civilizations only slightly more backward\nthan we. We remember Columbus and the Arawaks, Cort\u00e9s and the Aztecs, even the fate of\nthe Tlingit in the generations after La P\u00e9rouse. We remember and we worry. But if an\ninterstellar armada appears in our skies, I predict we will be very accommodating.\n\nA very different kind of contact is much more likely - the case we have already\ndiscussed in which we receive a rich, complex message, probably by radio, from another\n\ncivilization in space, but do not make, at least for a while, physical contact with them. In\nthis case there is no way for the transmitting civilization to know whether we have received\nthe message. If we find the contents offensive or frightening, we are not obliged to reply.\nBut if the message contains valuable information, the consequences for our own civilization\nwill be stunning - insights on alien science and technology, art, music, politics, ethics,\nphilosophy and religion, and most of all, a profound deprovincialization of the human\ncondition. We will know what else is possible.\n\nBecause we will share scientific and mathematical insights with any other\ncivilization, I believe that understanding the interstellar message will be the easiest part of\nthe problem. Convincing the U.S. Congress and the Council of Ministers of the U.S.S.R. to\nfund a search for extraterrestrial intelligence is the hard part.* In fact, it may be that\ncivilizations can be divided into two great categories: one in which the scientists are unable\nto convince nonscientists to authorize a search for extraplanetary intelligence, in which\nenergies are directed exclusively inward, in which conventional perceptions remain\nunchallenged and society falters and retreats from the stars; and another category in which\nthe grand vision of contact with other civilizations is shared widely, and a major search is\nundertaken.\n\n* Or other national organs. Consider this pronouncement from a British Defence Department\nspokesman as reported in the London Observer for February 26, 1978: \u2018Any messages transmitted from outer\nspace are the responsibility of the BBC and the Post Office. It is their responsibility to track down illegal\nbroadcasts.\u201d\n\nThis is one of the few human endeavors where even a failure is a success. If we\nwere to carry out a rigorous search for extraterrestrial radio signals encompassing millions\nof stars and heard nothing, we would conclude that galactic civilizations were at best\nextremely rare, a calibration of our place in the universe. It would speak eloquently of how\nrare are the living things of our planet, and would underscore, as nothing else in human\nhistory has, the individual worth of every human being. If we were to succeed, the history\nof our species and our planet would be changed forever.\n\nIt would be easy for extraterrestrials to make an unambiguously artificial interstellar\nmessage. For example, the first ten prime numbers - numbers divisible only by themselves\nand by one - are 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23. It is extremely unlikely that any natural\nphysical process could transmit radio messages containing prime numbers only. If we\nreceived such a message we would deduce a civilization out there that was at least fond of\nprime numbers. But the most likely case is that interstellar communication will be a kind of\npalimpsest, like the palimpsests of ancient writers short of papyrus or stone who\nsuperimposed their messages on top of preexisting messages. Perhaps at an adjacent\nfrequency or a faster timing, there would be another message, which would turn out to be a\nprimer, an introduction to the language of interstellar discourse. The primer would be\nrepeated again and again because the transmitting civilization would have no way to know\nwhen we turned in on the message. And then, deeper in the palimpsest, underneath the\nannouncement signal and the primer, would be the real message. Radio technology permits\nthat message to be inconceivably rich. Perhaps when we tuned in, we would find ourselves\nin the midst of Volume 3,267 of the Encyclopaedia Galactica.\n\nWe would discover the nature of other civilizations. There would be many of them,\neach composed of organisms astonishingly different from anything on this planet. They\n\nwould view the universe somewhat differently. They would have different arts and social\nfunctions. They would be interested in things we never thought of. By comparing our\nknowledge with theirs, we would grow immeasurably. And with our newly acquired\ninformation sorted into a computer memory, we would be able to see which sort of\ncivilization lived where in the Galaxy. Imagine a huge galactic computer, a repository,\nmore or less up-to-date, of information on the nature and activities of all the civilizations in\nthe Milky Way Galaxy, a great library of life in the Cosmos. Perhaps among the contents of\nthe Encyclopaedia Galactica will be a set of summaries of such civilizations, the\ninformation enigmatic, tantalizing, evocative - even after we succeed in translating it.\n\nEventually, taking as much time as we wished, we would decide to reply. We would\ntransmit some information about ourselves - just the basics at first - as the start of a long\ninterstellar dialogue which we would begin but which, because of the vast distances of\ninterstellar space and the finite velocity of light, would be continued by our remote\ndescendants. And someday, on a planet of some far distant star, a being very different from\nany of us would request a printout from the latest edition of the Encyclopaedia Galactica\nand acquire a little information about the newest society to join the community of galactic\ncivilizations.\n",

G. Wells, \u2018The Discovery of the Future,\u2019 Nature 65, 326 (1902)\n\nThe Cosmos was discovered only yesterday. For a million years it was clear to everyone\nthat there were no other places than the Earth. Then in the last tenth of a percent of the\nlifetime of our species, in the instant between Aristarchus and ourselves, we reluctantly\nnoticed that we were not the center and purpose of the Universe, but rather lived on a tiny\n\nand fragile world lost in immensity and eternity, drifting in a great cosmic ocean dotted\nhere and there with a hundred billion galaxies and a billion trillion stars. We have bravely\ntested the waters and have found the ocean to our liking, resonant with our nature.\nSomething in us recognizes the Cosmos as home. We are made of stellar ash. Our origin\nand evolution have been tied to distant cosmic events. The exploration of the Cosmos is a\nvoyage of self-discovery.\n\nAs the ancient mythmakers knew, we are the children equally of the sky and the\nEarth. In our tenure on this planet we have accumulated dangerous evolutionary baggage,\nhereditary propensities for aggression and ritual, submission to leaders and hostility to\noutsiders, which place our survival in some question. But we have also acquired\ncompassion for others, love for our children and our children\u2019s children, a desire to learn\nfrom history, and a great soaring passionate intelligence - the clear tools for our continued\nsurvival and prosperity. Which aspects of our nature will prevail is uncertain, particularly\nwhen our vision and understanding and prospects are bound exclusively to the Earth - or,\nworse, to one small part of it. But up there in the immensity of the Cosmos, an inescapable\nperspective awaits us. There are not yet any obvious signs of extraterrestrial intelligence\nand this makes us wonder whether civilizations like ours always rush implacably, headlong,\ntoward self-destruction. National boundaries are not evident when we view the Earth from\nspace. Fanatical ethnic or religious or national chauvinisms are a little difficult to maintain\nwhen we see our planet as a fragile blue crescent fading to become an inconspicuous point\nof light against the bastion and citadel of the stars. Travel is broadening.\n\nThere are worlds on which life has never arisen. There are worlds that have been\ncharred and ruined by cosmic catastrophes. We are fortunate: we are alive; we are\npowerful; the welfare of our civilization and our species is in our hands. If we do not speak\nfor Earth, who will? If we are not committed to our own survival, who will be?\n\nThe human species is now undertaking a great venture that if successful will be as\nimportant as the colonization of the land or the descent from the trees. We are haltingly,\ntentatively breaking the shackles of Earth - metaphorically, in confronting and taming the\nadmonitions of those more primitive brains within us; physically, in voyaging to the planets\nand listening for the messages from the stars. These two enterprises are linked indissolubly.\nEach, I believe, is a necessary condition for the other. But our energies are directed far\nmore toward war. Hypnotized by mutual mistrust, almost never concerned for the species\nor the planet, the nations prepare for death. And because what we are doing is so horrifying,\nwe tend not to think of it much. But what we do not consider we are unlikely to put right.\n\nEvery thinking person fears nuclear war, and every technological state plans for it.\nEveryone knows it is madness, and every nation has an excuse. There is a dreary chain of\ncausality: The Germans were working on the bomb at the beginning of World War II; so\nthe Americans had to make one first: If the Americans had one, the Soviets had to have\none, and then the British, the French, the Chinese, the Indians, the Pakistanis. . . By the end\nof the twentieth century many nations had collected nuclear weapons. They were easy to\ndevise. Fissionable material could be stolen from nuclear reactors. Nuclear weapons\nbecame almost a home handicraft industry.\n\nThe conventional bombs of World War II were called blockbusters. Filled with\ntwenty tons of TNT, they could destroy a city block. All the bombs dropped on all the cities\nin World War II amounted to some two million tons, two megatons, of TNT - Coventry and\nRotterdam, Dresden and Tokyo, all the death that rained from the skies between 1939 and\n1945: a hundred thousand blockbusters, two megatons. By the late twentieth century, two\n\nmegatons was the energy released in the explosion of a single more or less humdrum\nthermonuclear bomb: one bomb with the destructive force of the Second World War. But\nthere are tens of thousands of nuclear weapons. By the ninth decade of the twentieth\ncentury the strategic missile and bomber forces of the Soviet Union and the United States\nwere aiming warheads at over 15,000 designated targets. No place on the planet was safe.\nThe energy contained in these weapons, genies of death patiently awaiting the rubbing of\nthe lamps, was far more than 10,000 megatons - but with the destruction concentrated\nefficiently, not over six years but over a few hours, a blockbuster for every family on the\nplanet, a World War II every second for the length of a lazy afternoon.\n\nThe immediate causes of death from nuclear attack are the blast wave, which can\nflatten heavily reinforced buildings many kilometers away, the firestorm, the gamma rays\nand the neutrons, which effectively fry the insides of passersby. A school girl who survived\nthe American nuclear attack on Hiroshima, the event that ended the Second World War,\nwrote this first-hand account:\n\nThrough a darkness like the bottom of hell, I could hear the voices of the other\nstudents calling for their mothers. And at the base of the bridge, inside a big cistern\nthat had been dug out there, was a mother weeping, holding above her head a naked\nbaby that was burned red all over its body. And another mother was crying and\nsobbing as she gave her burned breast to her baby. In the cistern the students stood\nwith only their heads above the water, and their two hands, which they clasped as\nthey imploringly cried and screamed, calling for their parents. But every single\nperson who passed was wounded, all of them, and there was no one, there was no\none to turn to for help. And the singed hair on the heads of the people was frizzled\nand whitish and covered with dust. They did not appear to be human, not creatures\nof this world.\n\nThe Hiroshima explosion, unlike the subsequent Nagasaki explosion, was an air burst high\nabove the surface, so the fallout was insignificant. But on March 1, 1954, a thermonuclear\nweapons test at Bikini in the Marshall Islands detonated at higher yield than expected. A\ngreat radioactive cloud was deposited on the tiny atoll of Rongalap, 150 kilometers away,\nwhere the inhabitants likened the explosion to the Sun rising in the West. A few hours later,\nradioactive ash fell on Rongalap like snow. The average dose received was only about 175\nrads, a little less than half the dose needed to kill an average person. Being far from the\nexplosion, not many people died. Of course, the radioactive strontium they ate was\nconcentrated in their bones, and the radioactive iodine was concentrated in their thyroids.\nTwo-thirds of the children and one-third of the adults later developed thyroid abnormalities,\ngrowth retardation or malignant tumors. In compensation, the Marshall Islanders received\nexpert medical care.\n\nThe yield of the Hiroshima bomb was only thirteen kilotons, the equivalent of\nthirteen thousand tons of TNT. The Bikini test yield was fifteen megatons. In a full nuclear\nexchange, in the paroxysm of thermonuclear war, the equivalent of a million Hiroshima\nbombs would be dropped all over the world. At the Hiroshima death rate of some hundred\nthousand people killed per equivalent thirteen-kiloton weapon, this would be enough to kill\na hundred billion people. But there were less than five billion people on the planet in the\nlate twentieth century. Of course, in such an exchange, not everyone would be killed by the\nblast and the firestorm, the radiation and the fallout - although fallout does last for a longish\n\ntime: 90 percent of the strontium 90 will decay in 96 years; 90 percent of the cesium 137,\nin 100 years; 90 percent of the iodine 131 in only a month.\n\nThe survivors would witness more subtle consequences of the war. A full nuclear\nexchange would burn the nitrogen in the upper air, converting it to oxides of nitrogen,\nwhich would in turn destroy a significant amount of the ozone in the high atmosphere,\nadmitting an intense dose of solar ultraviolet radiation.* The increased ultraviolet flux\nwould last for years. It would produce skin cancer preferentially in light-skinned people.\nMuch more important, it would affect the ecology of our planet in an unknown way.\nUltraviolet light destroys crops. Many microorganisms would be killed; we do not know\nwhich ones or how many, or what the consequences might be. The organisms killed might,\nfor all we know, be at the base of a vast ecological pyramid at the top of which totter we.\n\n* The process is similar to, but much more dangerous than, the destruction of the ozone layer by the\nfluorocarbon propellants in aerosol spray cans, which have accordingly been banned by a number of nations;\nand to that invoked in the explanation of the extinction of the dinosaurs by a supernova explosion a few dozen\nlight-years away.\n\nThe dust put into the air in a full nuclear exchange would reflect sunlight and cool\nthe Earth a little. Even a little cooling can have disastrous agricultural consequences. Birds\nare more easily killed by radiation than insects. Plagues of insects and consequent further\nagricultural disorders are a likely consequence of nuclear war. There is also another kind of\nplague to worry about: the plague bacillus is endemic all over the Earth. In the late\ntwentieth century humans did not much die of plague - not because it was absent, but\nbecause resistance was high. However, the radiation produced in a nuclear war, among its\nmany other effects, debilitates the body\u2019s immunological system, causing a deterioration of\nour ability to resist disease. In the longer term, there are mutations, new varieties of\nmicrobes and insects, that might cause still further problems for any human survivors of a\nnuclear holocaust; and perhaps after a while, when there has been enough time for the\nrecessive mutations to recombine and be expressed, new and horrifying varieties of\nhumans. Most of these mutations, when expressed, would be lethal. A few would not. And\nthen there would be other agonies: the loss of loved ones; the legions of the burned, the\nblind and the mutilated; disease, plague, long-lived radioactive poisons in the air and water;\nthe threat of tumors and stillbirths and malformed children; the absence of medical care; the\nhopeless sense of a civilization destroyed for nothing; the knowledge that we could have\nprevented it and did not.\n\nL. F. Richardson was a British meteorologist interested in war. He wished to\nunderstand its causes. There are intellectual parallels between war and weather. Both are\ncomplex. Both exhibit regularities, implying that they are not implacable forces but natural\nsystems that can be understood and controlled. To understand the global weather you must\nfirst collect a great body of meteorological data; you must discover how the weather\nactually behaves. Our approach must be the same, Richardson decided, if we are to\nunderstand warfare. So, for the years between 1820 and 1945, he collected data on the\nhundreds of wars that had then been fought on our poor planet.\n\nRichardson\u2019s results were published posthumously in a book called The Statistics of\nDeadly Quarrels. Because he was interested in how long you had to wait for a war that\nwould claim a specified number of victims, he defined an index, M, the magnitude of a\nwar, a measure of the number of immediate deaths it causes. A war of magnitude M = 3\n\nmight be merely a skirmish, killing only a thousand people (10\u00b0). M = 5 or M = 6 denote\nmore serious wars, where a hundred thousand (10\u00b0) or a million ( 10\u00b0) people are killed.\nWorld Wars I and II had larger magnitudes. He found that the more people killed in a war,\nthe less likely it was to occur, and the longer before you would witness it, just as violent\nstorms occur less frequently than cloudbursts. From his data we can construct a graph\nwhich shows how long on the average during the past century and a half you would have to\nwait to witness the war of magnitude M.\n\nRichardson proposed that if you continue the curve to very small values of M, all\nthe way to M = 0, it roughly predicts the worldwide incidence of murder; somewhere in the\nworld someone is murdered every five minutes. Individual killings and wars on the largest\nscale are, he said, two ends of a continuum, an unbroken curve. It follows, not only in a\ntrivial sense but also I believe in a very deep psychological sense, that war is murder writ\nlarge. When our well-being is threatened, when our illusions about ourselves are\nchallenged, we tend - some of us at least - to fly into murderous rages. And when the same\nprovocations are applied to nation states, they, too, sometimes fly into murderous rages,\negged on often enough by those seeking personal power or profit. But as the technology of\nmurder improves and the penalties of war increase, a great many people must be made to\nfly into murderous rages simultaneously for a major war to be mustered. Because the\norgans of mass communication are often in the hands of the state, this can commonly be\narranged. (Nuclear war is the exception. It can be triggered by a very small number of\npeople.)\n\nWe see here a conflict between our passions and what is sometimes called our better\nnatures; between the deep, ancient reptilian part of the brain, the R-complex, in charge of\nmurderous rages, and the more recently evolved mammalian and human parts of the brain,\nthe limbic system and the cerebral cortex. When humans lived in small groups, when our\nweapons were comparatively paltry, even an enraged warrior could kill only a few. As our\ntechnology improved, the means of war also improved. In the same brief interval, we also\nhave improved. We have tempered our anger, frustration and despair with reason. We have\nameliorated on a planetary scale injustices that only recently were global and endemic. But\nour weapons can now kill billions. Have we improved fast enough? Are we teaching reason\nas effectively as we can? Have we courageously studied the causes of war?\n\nWhat is often called the strategy of nuclear deterrence is remarkable for its reliance\non the behavior of our nonhuman ancestors. Henry Kissinger, a contemporary politician,\nwrote: \u2018Deterrence depends, above all, on psychological criteria. For purposes of\ndeterrence, a bluff taken seriously is more useful than a serious threat interpreted as a\nbluff.\u2019 Truly effective nuclear bluffing, however, includes occasional postures of\nirrationality, a distancing from the horrors of nuclear war. Then the potential enemy is\ntempted to submit on points of dispute rather than unleash a global confrontation, which the\naura of irrationality has made plausible. The chief danger of adopting a credible pose of\nirrationality is that to succeed in the pretense you have to be very good. After a while, you\nget used to it. It becomes pretense no longer.\n\nThe global balance of terror, pioneered by the United States and the Soviet Union,\nholds hostage the citizens of the Earth. Each side draws limits on the permissible behavior\nof the other. The potential enemy is assured that if the limit is transgressed, nuclear war\nwill follow. However, the definition of the limit changes from time to time. Each side must\nbe quite confident that the other understands the new limits. Each side is tempted to\nincrease its military advantage, but not in so striking a way as seriously to alarm the other.\n\nEach side continually explores the limits of the other\u2019s tolerance, as in flights of nuclear\nbombers over the Arctic wastes; the Cuban missile crisis; the testing of anti-satellite\nweapons; the Vietnam and Afghanistan wars - a few entries from a long and dolorous list.\nThe global balance of terror is a very delicate balance. It depends on things not going\nwrong, on mistakes not being made, on the reptilian passions not being seriously aroused.\n\nAnd so we return to Richardson. In his diagram a solid line is the waiting time for a\nwar of magnitude M - that is, the average time we would have to wait to witness a war that\nkills 10\u2122 people (where M represents the number of zeroes after the one in our usual\nexponential arithmetic). Also shown, as a vertical bar at the right of the diagram, is the\nworld population in recent years, which reached one billion people (M = 9) around 1835\nand is now about 4.5 billion people (M = 9.7). When the Richardson curve crosses the\nvertical bar we have specified the waiting time to Doomsday: how many years until the\npopulation of the Earth is destroyed in some great war. With Richardson\u2019s curve and the\nsimplest extrapolation for the future growth of the human population, the two curves do not\nintersect until the thirtieth century or so, and Doomsday is deferred.\n\nBut World War II was of magnitude 7.7: some fifty million military personnel and\nnoncombatants were killed. The technology of death advanced ominously. Nuclear\nweapons were used for the first time. There is little indication that the motivations and\npropensities for warfare have diminished since, and both conventional and nuclear\nweaponry has become far more deadly. Thus, the top of the Richardson curve is shifting\ndownward by an unknown amount. If its new position is somewhere in the shaded region of\nthe figure, we may have only another few decades until Doomsday. A more detailed\ncomparison of the incidence of wars before and after 1945 might help to clarify this\nquestion. It is of more than passing concern.\n\nThis is merely another way of saying what we have known for decades: the\ndevelopment of nuclear weapons and their delivery systems will, sooner or later, lead to\nglobal disaster. Many of the American and European \u00e9migr\u00e9 scientists who developed the\nfirst nuclear weapons were profoundly distressed about the demon they had let loose on the\nworld. They pleaded for the global abolition of nuclear weapons. But their pleas went\nunheeded; the prospect of a national strategic advantage galvanized both the U.S.S.R. and\nthe United States, and the nuclear arms race began.\n\nIn the same period, there was a burgeoning international trade in the devastating\nnon-nuclear weapons coyly called \u2018conventional\u2019. In the past twenty-five years, in dollars\ncorrected for inflation, the annual international arms trade has gone from $300 million to\nmuch more than $20 billion. In the years between 1950 and 1968, for which good statistics\nseem to be available, there were, on the average, worldwide several accidents involving\nnuclear weapons per year, although perhaps no more than one or two accidental nuclear\nexplosions. The weapons establishments in the Soviet Union, the United States and other\nnations are large and powerful. In the United States they include major corporations famous\nfor their homey domestic manufactures. According to one estimate, the corporate profits in\nmilitary weapons procurement are 30 to 50 percent higher than in an equally technological\nbut competitive civilian market. Cost overruns in military weapons systems are permitted\nona scale that would be considered unacceptable in the civilian sphere. In the Soviet Union\nthe resources, quality, attention and care given to military production is in striking contrast\nto the little left for consumer goods. According to some estimates, almost half the scientists\nand high technologists on Earth are employed full- or part-time on military matters. Those\nengaged in the development and manufacture of weapons of mass destruction are given\n\nsalaries, perquisites of power and, where possible, public honors at the highest levels\navailable in their respective societies. The secrecy of weapons development, carried to\nespecially extravagant lengths in the Soviet Union, implies that individuals so employed\nneed almost never accept responsibility for their actions. They are protected and\nanonymous. Military secrecy makes the military the most difficult sector of any society for\nthe citizens to monitor. If we do not know what they do, it is very hard for us to stop them.\nAnd with the rewards so substantial, with the hostile military establishments beholden to\neach other in some ghastly mutual embrace, the world discovers itself drifting toward the\nultimate undoing of the human enterprise.\n\nEvery major power has some widely publicized justification for its procurement and\nstockpiling of weapons of mass destruction, often including a reptilian reminder of the\npresumed character and cultural defects of potential enemies (as opposed to us stout\nfellows), or of the intentions of others, but never ourselves, to conquer the world. Every\nnation seems to have its set of forbidden possibilities, which its citizenry and adherents\nmust not at any cost be permitted to think seriously about. In the Soviet Union these include\ncapitalism, God, and the surrender of national sovereignty; in the United States, socialism,\natheism, and the surrender of national sovereignty. It is the same all over the world.\n\nHow would we explain the global arms race to a dispassionate extraterrestrial\nobserver? How would we justify the most recent destabilizing developments of killer-\nsatellites, particle beam weapons, lasers, neutron bombs, cruise missiles, and the proposed\nconversion of areas the size of modest countries to the enterprise of hiding each\nintercontinental ballistic missile among hundreds of decoys? Would we argue that ten\nthousand targeted nuclear warheads are likely to enhance the prospects for our survival?\nWhat account would we give of our stewardship of the planet Earth? We have heard the\nrationales offered by the nuclear superpowers. We know who speaks for the nations. But\nwho speaks for the human species? Who speaks for Earth?\n\nAbout two-thirds of the mass of the human brain is in the cerebral cortex, devoted\nto intuition and reason. Humans have evolved gregariously. We delight in each other\u2019s\ncompany; we care for one another. We cooperate. Altruism is built into us. We have\nbrilliantly deciphered some of the patterns of Nature. We have sufficient motivation to\nwork together and the ability to figure out how to do it. If we are willing to contemplate\nnuclear war and the wholesale destruction of our emerging global society, should we not\nalso be willing to contemplate a wholesale restructuring of our societies? From an\nextraterrestrial perspective, our global civilization is clearly on the edge of failure in the\nmost important task it faces: to preserve the lives and well-being of the citizens of the\nplanet. Should we not then be willing to explore vigorously, in every nation, major changes\nin the traditional ways of doing things, a fundamental redesign of economic, political,\nsocial and religious institutions?\n\nFaced with so disquieting an alternative, we are always tempted to minimize the\nseriousness of the problem, to argue that those who worry about doomsdays are alarmists;\nto hold that fundamental changes in our institutions are impractical or contrary to \u2018human.\nnature\u2019, as if nuclear war were practical, or as if there were only one human nature. Full-\nscale nuclear war has never happened. Somehow this it taken to imply that it never will.\nBut we can experience it only once. By then it will be too late to reformulate the statistics.\n\nThe United States is one of the few governments that actually supports an agency\ndevoted to reversing the arms race. But the comparative budgets of the Department of\nDefense (153 billion dollars per year in 1980) and of the Arms Control and Disarmament\n\nAgency (0.018 billion dollars per year) remind us of the relative importance we have\nassigned to the two activities. Would not a rational society spend more on understanding\nand preventing, than on preparing for, the next war? It is possible to study the causes of\nwar. At present our understanding is meager - probably because disarmament budgets have,\nsince the time of Sargon of Akkad, been somewhere between ineffective and nonexistent.\nMicrobiologists and physicians study diseases mainly to cure people. Rarely are they\nrooting for the pathogen. Let us study war as if it were, as Einstein aptly called it, an illness\nof childhood. We have reached the point where proliferation of nuclear arms and resistance\nto nuclear disarmament threaten every person on the planet. There are no more special\ninterests or special cases. Our survival depends on committing our intelligence and\nresources on a massive scale to take charge of our own destiny, to guarantee that\nRichardson\u2019s curve does not veer to the right.\n\nWe, the nuclear hostages - all the peoples of the Earth - must educate ourselves\nabout conventional and nuclear warfare. Then we must educate our governments. We must\nlearn the science and technology that provide the only conceivable tools for our survival.\nWe must be willing to challenge courageously the conventional social, political, economic\nand religious wisdom. We must make every effort to understand that our fellow humans, all\nover the world, are human. Of course, such steps are difficult. But as Einstein many times\nreplied when his suggestions were rejected as impractical or as inconsistent with \u2018human\nnature\u2019: What is the alternative?\n\nMammals characteristically nuzzle, fondle, hug, caress, pet, groom and love their young,\nbehavior essentially unknown among the reptiles. If it is really true that the R-complex and\nlimbic systems live in an uneasy truce within our skulls and still partake of their ancient\npredilections, we might expect affectionate parental indulgence to encourage our\nmammalian natures, and the absence of physical affection to prod reptilian behavior. There\nis some evidence that this is the case. In laboratory experiments, Harry and Margaret\nHarlow found that monkeys raised in cages and physically isolated - even though they\ncould see, hear and smell their simian fellows - developed a range of morose, withdrawn,\nself-destructive and otherwise abnormal characteristics. In humans the same is observed for\nchildren raised without physical affection - usually in institutions - where they are clearly in\ngreat pain.\n\nThe neuropsychologist James W. Prescott has performed a startling cross-cultural\nstatistical analysis of 400 preindustrial societies and found that cultures that lavish physical\naffection on infants tend to be disinclined to violence. Even societies without notable\nfondling of infants develop nonviolent adults, provided sexual activity in adolescents is not\nrepressed. Prescott believes that cultures with a predisposition for violence are composed of\nindividuals who have been deprived - during at least one of two critical stages in life,\ninfancy and adolescence - of the pleasures of the body. Where physical affection is\nencouraged, theft, organized religion and invidious displays of wealth are inconspicuous;\nwhere infants are physically punished, there tends to be slavery, frequent killing, torturing\nand mutilation of enemies, a devotion to the inferiority of women, and a belief in one or\nmore supernatural beings who intervene in daily life.\n\nWe do not understand human behavior well enough to be sure of the mechanisms\nunderlying these relationships, although we can conjecture. But the correlations are\nsignificant. Prescott writes: \u2018The percent likelihood of a society becoming physically\nviolent if it is physically affectionate toward its infants and tolerant of premarital sexual\n\nbehavior is 2 percent. The probability of this relationship occurring by chance is 125,000 to\none. I am not aware of any other developmental variable that has such a high degree of\npredictive validity.\u2019 Infants hunger for physical affection; adolescents are strongly driven to\nsexual activity. If youngsters had their way, societies might develop in which adults have\nlittle tolerance for aggression, territoriality, ritual and social hierarchy (although in the\ncourse of growing up the children might well experience these reptilian behaviors). If\nPrescott is right, in an age of nuclear weapons and effective contraceptives, child abuse and\nsevere sexual repression are crimes against humanity. More work on this provocative thesis\nis clearly needed. Meanwhile, we can each make a personal and noncontroversial\ncontribution to the future of the world by hugging our infants tenderly.\n\nIf the inclinations toward slavery and racism, misogyny and violence are connected\n- as individual character and human history, as well as cross-cultural studies, suggest - then\nthere is room for some optimism. We are surrounded by recent fundamental changes in\nsociety. In the last two centuries, abject slavery, with us for thousands of years or more, has\nbeen almost eliminated in a stirring planet-wide revolution. Women, patronized for\nmillennia, traditionally denied real political and economic power, are gradually becoming,\neven in the most backward societies, equal partners with men. For the first time in modern\nhistory, major wars of aggression were stopped partly because of the revulsion felt by the\ncitizens of the aggressor nations. The old exhortations to nationalist fervor and jingoist\npride have begun to lose their appeal. Perhaps because of rising standards of living,\nchildren are being treated better worldwide. In only a few decades, sweeping global\nchanges have begun to move in precisely the directions needed for human survival. A new\nconsciousness is developing which recognizes that we are one species.\n\n\u201cSuperstition [is] cowardice in the face of the Divine,\u2019 wrote Theophrastus, who lived\nduring the founding of the Library of Alexandria. We inhabit a universe where atoms are\nmade in the centers of stars; where each second a thousand suns are born; where life is\nsparked by sunlight and lightning in the airs and waters of youthful planets; where the raw\nmaterial for biological evolution is sometimes made by the explosion of a star halfway\nacross the Milky Way; where a thing as beautiful as a galaxy is formed a hundred billion\ntimes - a Cosmos of quasars and quarks, snowflakes and fireflies, where there may be black\nholes and other universes and extraterrestrial civilizations whose radio messages are at this\nmoment reaching the Earth. How pallid by comparison are the pretensions of superstition\nand pseudoscience; how important it is for us to pursue and understand science, that\ncharacteristically human endeavor.\n\nEvery aspect of Nature reveals a deep mystery and touches our sense of wonder and\nawe. Theophrastus was right. Those afraid of the universe as it really is, those who pretend\nto nonexistent knowledge and envision a Cosmos centered on human beings will prefer the\nfleeting comforts of superstition. They avoid rather than confront the world. But those with\nthe courage to explore the weave and structure of the Cosmos, even where it differs\nprofoundly from their wishes and prejudices, will penetrate its deepest mysteries.\n\nThere is no other species on Earth that does science. It is, so far, entirely a human\ninvention, evolved by natural selection in the cerebral cortex for one simple reason: it\nworks. It is not perfect. It can be misused. It is only a tool. But it is by far the best tool we\nhave, self-correcting, ongoing, applicable to everything. It has two rules. First: there are no\nsacred truths; all assumptions must be critically examined; arguments from authority are\nworthless. Second: whatever is inconsistent with the facts must be discarded or revised. We\n\nmust understand the Cosmos as it is and not confuse how it is with how we wish it to be.\nThe obvious is sometimes false; the unexpected is sometimes true. Humans everywhere\nshare the same goals when the context is large enough. And the study of the Cosmos\nprovides the largest possible context. Present global culture is a kind of arrogant newcomer.\nIt arrives on the planetary stage following four and a half billion years of other acts, and\nafter looking about for a few thousand years declares itself in possession of eternal truths.\nBut in a world that is changing as fast as ours, this is a prescription for disaster. No nation,\nno religion, no economic system, no body of knowledge, is likely to have all the answers\nfor our survival. There must be many social systems that would work far better than any\nnow in existence. In the scientific tradition, our task is to find them.\n\nOnly once before in our history was there the promise of a brilliant scientific civilization.\nBeneficiary of the Ionian Awakening, it had its citadel at the Library of Alexandria, where\n2,000 years ago the best minds of antiquity established the foundations for the systematic\nstudy of mathematics, physics, biology, astronomy, literature, geography and medicine: We\nbuild on those foundations still. The Library was constructed and supported by the\nPtolemys, the Greek kings who inherited the Egyptian portion of the empire of Alexander\nthe Great. From the time of its creation in the third century B.C. until its destruction seven\ncenturies later, it was the brain and heart of the ancient world.\n\nAlexandria was the publishing capital of the planet. Of course, there were no\nprinting presses then. Books were expensive; every one of them was copied by hand. The\nLibrary was the repository of the most accurate copies in the world. The art of critical\nediting was invented there. The Old Testament comes down to us mainly from the Greek\ntranslations made in the Alexandrian Library. The Ptolemys devoted much of their\nenormous wealth to the acquisition of every Greek book, as well as works from Africa,\nPersia, India, Israel and other parts of the world. Ptolemy III Euergetes wished to borrow\nfrom Athens the original manuscripts or official state copies of the great ancient tragedies\nof Sophocles, Aeschylus and Euripides. To the Athenians, these were a kind of cultural\npatrimony - something like the original handwritten copies and first folios of Shakespeare\nmight be in England. They were reluctant to let the manuscripts out of their hands even for\na moment. Only after Ptolemy guaranteed their return with an enormous cash deposit did\nthey agree to lend the plays. But Ptolemy valued those scrolls more than gold or silver. He\nforfeited the deposit gladly and enshrined, as well he might, the originals in the Library.\nThe outraged Athenians had to content themselves with the copies that Ptolemy, only a\nlittle shamefacedly, presented to them. Rarely has a state so avidly supported the pursuit of\nknowledge.\n\nThe Ptolemys did not merely collect established knowledge; they encouraged and\nfinanced scientific research and so generated new knowledge. The results were amazing:\nEratosthenes accurately calculated the size of the Earth, mapped it, and argued that India\ncould be reached by sailing westward from Spain. Hipparchus anticipated that stars come\ninto being, slowly move during the course of centuries, and eventually perish; it was he\nwho first catalogued the positions and magnitudes of the stars to detect such changes.\nEuclid produced a textbook on geometry from which humans learned for twenty-three\ncenturies, a work that was to help awaken the scientific interest of Kepler, Newton and\nEinstein. Galen wrote basic works on healing and anatomy which dominated medicine until\nthe Renaissance. There were, as we have noted, many others.\n\nAlexandria was the greatest city the Western world had ever seen. People of all\n\nnations came there to live, to trade, to learn. On any given day, its harbors were thronged\nwith merchants, scholars and tourists. This was a city where Greeks, Egyptians, Arabs,\nSyrians, Hebrews, Persians, Nubians, Phoenicians, Italians, Gauls and Iberians exchanged\nmerchandise and ideas. It is probably here that the word cosmopolitan realized its true\nmeaning - citizen, not just of a nation, but of the Cosmos.* To be a citizen of the Cosmos . .\n\n* The word cosmopolitan was first invented by Diogenes, the rationalist philosopher and critic of\nPlato.\n\nHere clearly were the seeds of the modern world. What prevented them from taking\nroot and flourishing? Why instead did the West slumber through a thousand years of\ndarkness until Columbus and Copernicus and their contemporaries rediscovered the work\ndone in Alexandria? I cannot give you a simple answer. But I do know this: there is no\nrecord, in the entire history of the Library, that any of its illustrious scientists and scholars\never seriously challenged the political, economic and religious assumptions of their society.\nThe permanence of the stars was questioned; the justice of slavery was not. Science and\nlearning in general were the preserve of a privileged few. The vast population of the city\nhad not the vaguest notion of the great discoveries taking place within the Library. New\nfindings were not explained or popularized. The research benefited them little. Discoveries\nin mechanics and steam technology were applied mainly to the perfection of weapons, the\nencouragement of superstition, the amusement of kings. The scientists never grasped the\npotential of machines to free people.* The great intellectual achievements of antiquity had\nfew immediate practical applications. Science never captured the imagination of the\nmultitude. There was no counterbalance to stagnation, to pessimism, to the most abject\nsurrenders to mysticism. When, at long last, the mob came to burn the Library down, there\nwas nobody to stop them.\n\n* With the single exception of Archimedes, who during his stay at the Alexandrian Library invented\nthe water screw, which is used in Egypt to this day for the irrigation of cultivated fields. But even he\nconsidered such mechanical contrivances far beneath the dignity of science.\n\nThe last scientist who worked in the Library was a mathematician, astronomer,\nphysicist and the head of the Neoplatonic school of philosophy - an extraordinary range of\naccomplishments for any individual in any age. Her name was Hypatia. She was born in\nAlexandria in 370. At a time when women had few options and were treated as property,\nHypatia moved freely and unselfconsciously through traditional male domains. By all\naccounts she was a great beauty. She had many suitors but rejected all offers of marriage.\nThe Alexandria of Hypatia\u2019s time - by then long under Roman rule - was a city under grave\nstrain. Slavery had sapped classical civilization of its vitality. The growing Christian\nChurch was consolidating its power and attempting to eradicate pagan influence and\nculture. Hypatia stood at the epicenter of these mighty social forces. Cyril, the Archbishop\nof Alexandria, despised her because of her close friendship with the Roman governor, and\nbecause she was a symbol of learning and science, which were largely identified by the\nearly Church with paganism. In great personal danger, she continued to teach and publish,\nuntil, in the year 415, on her way to work she was set upon by a fanatical mob of Cyril\u2019s\nparishioners. They dragged her from her chariot, tore off her clothes, and, armed with\n\nabalone shells, flayed her flesh from her bones. Her remains were burned, her works\nobliterated, her name forgotten. Cyril was made a saint.\n\nThe glory of the Alexandrian Library is a dim memory. Its last remnants were\ndestroyed soon after Hypatia\u2019s death. It was as if the entire civilization had undergone some\nself-inflicted brain surgery, and most of its memories, discoveries, ideas and passions were\nextinguished irrevocably. The loss was incalculable. In some cases, we know only the\ntantalizing titles of the works that were destroyed. In most cases, we know neither the titles\nnor the authors. We do know that of the 123 plays of Sophocles in the Library, only seven\nsurvived. One of those seven is Oedipus Rex. Similar numbers apply to the works of\nAeschylus and Euripides. It is a little as if the only surviving works of a man named\nWilliam Shakespeare were Coriolanus and A Winter's Tale, but we had heard that he had\nwritten certain other plays, unknown to us but apparently prized in his time, works entitled\nHamlet, Macbeth, Julius Caesar, King Lear, Romeo and Juliet.\n\nOf the physical contents of that glorious Library not a single scroll remains. In\nmodern Alexandria few people have a keen appreciation, much less a detailed knowledge,\nof the Alexandrian Library or of the great Egyptian civilization that preceded it for\nthousands of years. More recent events, other cultural imperatives have taken precedence.\nThe same is true all over the world. We have only the most tenuous contact with our past.\nAnd yet just a stone\u2019s throw from the remains of the Serapaeum are reminders of many\ncivilizations: enigmatic sphinxes from pharaonic Egypt; a great column erected to the\nRoman Emperor Diocletian by a provincial flunky for not altogether permitting the citizens\nof Alexandria to starve to death; a Christian church; many minarets; and the hallmarks of\nmodern industrial civilization - apartment houses, automobiles, streetcars, urban slums, a\nmicrowave relay tower. There are a million threads from the past intertwined to make the\nropes and cables of the modern world.\n\nOur achievements rest on the accomplishments of 40,000 generations of our human\npredecessors, all but a tiny fraction of whom are nameless and forgotten. Every now and\nthen we stumble on a major civilization, such as the ancient culture of Ebla, which\nflourished only a few millennia ago and about which we knew nothing. How ignorant we\nare of our own past! Inscriptions, papyruses, books time-bind the human species and permit\nus to hear those few voices and faint cries of our brothers and sisters, our ancestors. And\nwhat a joy of recognition when we realize how like us they were!\n\nWe have in this book devoted attention to some of our ancestors whose names have\nnot been lost: Eratosthenes, Democritus, Aristarchus, Hypatia, Leonardo, Kepler, Newton,\nHuygens, Champollion, Humason, Goddard, Einstein - all from Western culture because\nthe emerging scientific civilization on our planet is mainly a Western civilization; but every\nculture - China, India, West Africa, Mesoamerica - has made its major contributions to our\nglobal society and had its seminal thinkers. Through technological advances in\ncommunication our planet is in the final stages of being bound up at breakneck pace into a\nsingle global society. If we can accomplish the integration of the Earth without obliterating\ncultural differences or destroying ourselves, we will have accomplished a great thing.\n\nNear the site of the Alexandrian Library there is today a headless sphinx sculpted in\nthe time of the pharaoh Horemheb, in the Eighteenth Dynasty, a millennium before\nAlexander. Within easy view of that leonine body is a modern microwave relay tower.\nBetween them runs an unbroken thread in the history of the human species. From sphinx to\ntower is an instant of cosmic time - a moment in the fifteen or so billion years that have\nelapsed since the Big Bang. Almost all record of the passage of the universe from then to\n\nnow has been scattered by the winds of time. The evidence of cosmic evolution has been\nmore thoroughly ravaged than all the papyrus scrolls in the Alexandrian Library. And yet\nthrough daring and intelligence we have stolen a few glimpses of that winding path along\nwhich our ancestors and we have traveled.\n\nFor unknown ages after the explosive outpouring of matter and energy of the Big\nBang, the Cosmos was without form. There were no galaxies, no planets, no life. Deep,\nimpenetrable darkness was everywhere, hydrogen atoms in the void. Here and there denser\naccumulations of gas were imperceptibly growing, globes of matter were condensing -\nhydrogen raindrops more massive than suns. Within these globes of gas was first kindled\nthe nuclear fire latent in matter. A first generation of stars was born, flooding the Cosmos\nwith light. There were in those times not yet any planets to receive the light, no living\ncreatures to admire the radiance of the heavens. Deep in the stellar furnaces the alchemy of\nnuclear fusion created heavy elements, the ashes of hydrogen burning, the atomic building\nmaterials of future planets and lifeforms. Massive stars soon exhausted their stores of\nnuclear fuel. Rocked by colossal explosions, they returned most of their substance back into\nthe thin gas from which they had once condensed. Here in the dark lush clouds between the\nstars, new raindrops made of many elements were forming, later generations of stars being\nborn. Nearby, smaller raindrops grew, bodies far too little to ignite the nuclear fire, droplets\nin the interstellar mist on their way to form the planets. Among them was a small world of\nstone and iron, the early Earth.\n\nCongealing and warming, the Earth released the methane, ammonia, water and\nhydrogen gases that had been trapped within, forming the primitive atmosphere and the\nfirst oceans. Starlight from the Sun bathed and warmed the primeval Earth, drove storms,\ngenerated lightning and thunder. Volcanoes overflowed with lava. These processes\ndisrupted molecules of the primitive atmosphere; the fragments fell back together again\ninto more and more complex forms, which dissolved in the early oceans. After a time the\nseas achieved the consistency of a warm, dilute soup. Molecules were organized, and\ncomplex chemical reactions driven, on the surface of clays. And one day a molecule arose\nthat quite by accident was able to make crude copies of itself out of the other molecules in\nthe broth. As time passed, more elaborate and more accurate self-replicating molecules\narose. Those combinations best suited to further replication were favored by the sieve of\nnatural selection. Those that copied better produced more copies. And the primitive oceanic\nbroth gradually grew thin as it was consumed by and transformed into complex\ncondensations of self-replicating organic molecules. Gradually, imperceptibly, life had\nbegun.\n\nSingle-celled plants evolved, and life began to generate its own food.\nPhotosynthesis transformed the atmosphere. Sex was invented. Once free-living forms\nbanded together to make a complex cell with specialized functions. Chemical receptors\nevolved, and the Cosmos could taste and smell. One-celled organisms evolved into\nmulticellular colonies, elaborating their various parts into specialized organ systems. Eyes\nand ears evolved, and now the Cosmos could see and hear. Plants and animals discovered\nthat the land could support life. Organisms buzzed, crawled, scuttled, lumbered, glided,\nflapped, shimmied, climbed and soared. Colossal beasts thundered through the steaming\njungles. Small creatures emerged, born live instead of in hard-shelled containers, with a\nfluid like the early oceans coursing through their veins. They survived by swiftness and\ncunning. And then, only a moment ago, some small arboreal animals scampered down from\nthe trees. They became upright and taught themselves the use of tools, domesticated other\n\nanimals, plants and fire, and devised language. The ash of stellar alchemy was now\nemerging into consciousness. At an ever-accelerating pace, it invented writing, cities, art\nand science, and sent spaceships to the planets and the stars. These are some of the things\nthat hydrogen atoms do, given fifteen billion years of cosmic evolution.\n\nIt has the sound of epic myth, and rightly. But it is simply a description of cosmic\nevolution as revealed by the science of our time. We are difficult to come by and a danger\nto ourselves. But any account of cosmic evolution makes it clear that all the creatures of the\nEarth, the latest manufactures of the galactic hydrogen industry, are beings to be cherished.\nElsewhere there may be other equally astonishing transmutations of matter, so wistfully we\nlisten for a humming in the sky.\n\nWe have held the peculiar notion that a person or society that is a little different\nfrom us, whoever we are, is somehow strange or bizarre, to be distrusted or loathed. Think\nof the negative connotations of words like alien or outlandish. And yet the monuments and\ncultures of each of our civilizations merely represent different ways of being human. An\nextraterrestrial visitor, looking at the differences among human beings and their societies,\nwould find those differences trivial compared to the similarities. The Cosmos may be\ndensely populated with intelligent beings. But the Darwinian lesson is clear: There will be\nno humans elsewhere. Only here. Only on this small planet. We are a rare as well as an\nendangered species. Every one of us is, in the cosmic perspective, precious. If a human\ndisagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another.\n\nHuman history can be viewed as a slowly dawning awareness that we are members\nof a larger group. Initially our loyalties were to ourselves and our immediate family, next,\nto bands of wandering hunter-gatherers, then to tribes, small settlements, city-states,\nnations. We have broadened the circle of those we love. We have now organized what are\nmodestly described as superpowers, which include groups of people from divergent ethnic\nand cultural backgrounds working in some sense together - surely a humanizing and\ncharacter-building experience. If we are to survive, our loyalties must be broadened further,\nto include the whole human community, the entire planet Earth. Many of those who run the\nnations will find this idea unpleasant. They will fear the loss of power. We will hear much\nabout treason and disloyalty. Rich nation-states will have to share their wealth with poor\nones. But the choice, as H. G. Wells once said in a different context, is clearly the universe\nor nothing.\n\nA few million years ago there were no humans. Who will be here a few million years\nhence? In all the 4.6-billion-year history of our planet, nothing much ever left it. But now,\ntiny unmanned exploratory spacecraft from Earth are moving, glistening and elegant,\nthrough the solar system. We have made a preliminary reconnaissance of twenty worlds,\namong them all the planets visible to the naked eye, all those wandering nocturnal lights\nthat stirred our ancestors toward understanding and ecstasy. If we survive, our time will be\nfamous for two reasons: that at this dangerous moment of technological adolescence we\nmanaged to avoid self-destruction; and because this is the epoch in which we began our\njourney to the stars.\n\nThe choice is stark and ironic. The same rocket boosters used to launch probes to\nthe planets are poised to send nuclear warheads to the nations. The radioactive power\nsources on Viking and Voyager derive from the same technology that makes nuclear\nweapons. The radio and radar techniques employed to track and guide ballistic missiles and\ndefend against attack are also used to monitor and command the spacecraft on the planets\n\nand to listen for signals from civilizations near other stars. If we use these technologies to\ndestroy ourselves, we surely will venture no more to the planets and the stars. But the\nconverse is also true. If we continue to the planets and the stars, our chauvinisms will be\nshaken further. We will gain a cosmic perspective. We will recognize that our explorations\ncan be carried out only on behalf of all the people of the planet Earth. We will invest our\nenergies in an enterprise devoted not to death but to life: the expansion of our\nunderstanding of the Earth and its inhabitants and the search for life elsewhere. Space\nexploration - unmanned and manned - uses many of the same technological and\norganizational skills and demands the same commitment to valor and daring as does the\nenterprise of war. Should a time of real disarmament arrive before nuclear war, such\nexploration would enable the military-industrial establishments of the major powers to\nengage at long last in an untainted enterprise. Interests vested in preparations for war can\nrelatively easily be reinvested in the exploration of the Cosmos.\n\nA reasonable - even an ambitious - program of unmanned exploration of the planets\nis inexpensive. The budget for space sciences in the United States is enormous. Comparable\nexpenditures in the Soviet Union are a few times larger. Together these sums represent the\nequivalent of two or three nuclear submarines per decade, or the cost overruns on one of the\nmany weapon systems in a single year. In the last quarter of 1979, the program cost of the\nU.S. F/A-18 aircraft increased by $5.1 billion, and the F-16 by $3.4 billion. Since their\ninceptions, significantly less has been spent on the unmanned planetary programs of both\nthe United States and the Soviet Union than has been wasted shamefully - for example,\nbetween 1970 and 1975, in the U.S. bombing of Cambodia, an application of national\npolicy that cost $7 billion. The total cost of a mission such as Viking to Mars, or Voyager\nto the outer solar system, is less than that of the 1979-80 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.\nThrough technical employment and the stimulation of high technology, money spent on\nspace exploration has an economic multiplier effect. One study suggests that for every\ndollar spent on the planets, seven dollars are returned to the national economy. And yet\nthere are many important and entirely feasible missions that have not been attempted\nbecause of lack of funds - including roving vehicles to wander across the surface of Mars, a\ncomet rendezvous, Titan entry probes and a full-scale search for radio signals from other\ncivilizations in space.\n\nThe cost of major ventures into space - permanent bases on the Moon or human\nexploration of Mars, say - is so large that they will not, I think, be mustered in the very near\nfuture unless we make dramatic progress in nuclear and \u2018conventional\u2019 disarmament. Even\nthen there are probably more pressing needs here on Earth. But I have no doubt that, if we\navoid self-destruction, we will sooner or later perform such missions. It is almost\nimpossible to maintain a static society. There is a kind of psychological compound interest:\neven a small tendency toward retrenchment, a turning away from the Cosmos, adds up over\nmany generations to a significant decline. And conversely, even a slight commitment to\nventures beyond the Earth - to what we might call, after Columbus, \u2018the enterprise of the\nstars\u2019 - builds over many generations to a significant human presence on other worlds, a\nrejoicing in our participation in the Cosmos.\n\nSome 3.6 million years ago, in what is now northern Tanzania, a volcano erupted,\nthe resulting cloud of ash covering the surrounding savannahs. In 1979, the\npaleoanthropologist Mary Leakey found in that ash footprints - the footprints, she believes,\nof an early hominid, perhaps an ancestor of all the people on the Earth today. And 380,000\nkilometers away, in a flat dry plain that humans have in a moment of optimism called the\n\nSea of Tranquility, there is another footprint, left by the first human to walk another world.\nWe have come far in 3.6 million years, and in 4.6 billion and in 15 billion.\n\nFor we are the local embodiment of a Cosmos grown to self-awareness. We have\nbegun to contemplate our origins: starstuff pondering the stars; organized assemblages of\nten billion billion billion atoms considering the evolution of atoms; tracing the long journey\nby which, here at least, consciousness arose. Our loyalties are to the species and the planet.\nWe speak for Earth. Our obligation to survive is owed not just to ourselves but also to that\nCosmos, ancient and vast, from which we spring.\n",
