I call these\nfoundational business concepts \u201cmental models,\u201d and together, they create a\nsolid framework you can rely on to make good decisions.\n\nMental models are concepts that represent your understanding of how\nsomething in the world works. Think of driving a car: What do you expect\nwhen you press down on the right-side pedal? If the car slows down, you\u2019ll be\nsurprised\u2014that pedal is supposed to be the accelerator. The accuracy of your\nmodel of the world determines your expectations, decisions, behavior, and\u2014in\nthe long run\u2014your results.\n\nYour brain forms mental models by noticing patterns in what you\nexperience each day. Very often, however, the mental models you form on\nyour own aren\u2019t accurate\u2014you\u2019re only one person, so your knowledge and\nexperiences are limited. Education is a way to make your mental models more\naccurate by internalizing the knowledge and experiences other people have\ncollected throughout their lives. The best education helps you learn to see the\nworld in a new, more productive way.\n\nFor example, many people believe things like \u201cStarting a business is risky,\u201d\n\u201cTo get started, you must create a detailed business plan and borrow a lot of\nmoney,\u201d or \u201cBusiness is about who you know, not what you know.\u201d Each of\nthese phrases is a mental model, but they\u2019re not quite accurate. Correcting\nyour mental models can help you think about what you\u2019re doing in a clear,\ncomprehensive way, which will help you make better decisions.\n\nINACCURATE MENTAL MODEL ACCURATE MENTAL MODEL\n\nStarting a business is risky. Uncertainty is an ever-present but\nmanageable part of business, and risks can\nbe minimized.\n\n\nINACCURATE MENTAL MODEL\n\nIn order to create a successful business, you\nmust write a flawless business plan first.\n\nACCURATE MENTAL MODEL\n\nAwritten plan is secondary to understanding\nthe critical functions of your business, and no\nmatter how much you prepare, there will\nalways be surprises along the way.\n\nYou must raise large amounts of capital\nbefore you start building your business.\n\nRaising money is necessary only if it allows\nyou to accomplish something that would\notherwise be impossible (like building a\nfactory).\n\nIt's not what you know, it\u2019s who you know.\n\nPersonal connections are important, but\nknowledge is key if you want to use those\nconnections to your best advantage.\n\nAfter learning the mental models in this book, many of my readers have\nrealized that their picture of what businesses are and how businesses work was\ninaccurate\u2014getting their venture off the ground would be far easier than they\noriginally imagined. Instead of wasting valuable time and energy feeling\nintimidated and freaking out, learning these concepts gave them the freedom\nto stop worrying and start making progress.\n\nThis book will help you learn the fundamental principles of business so\nyou can focus your time and energy on doing useful things: creating\nsomething valuable, attracting attention, closing more sales, serving more\ncustomers, getting promoted, making more money, changing the world. Not\nonly will you be able to create more value for others and improve your own\nfinancial situation, you\u2019!] have more fun along the way.\n",

You may\nfind this context useful, but the primary value of this book is independent of my\n\npersonal background. If you'd like to get to the business concepts, feel free to\nskip ahead to this page.\n\neople often ask me if I have an MBA. \u201cNo,\u201d I reply, \u201cbut I did go to business\nschool.\u201d\n\nAs a student at the University of Cincinnati, I was fortunate enough to\nparticipate in the Carl H. Lindner Honors-PLUS program, which resembles an\nMBA at the undergraduate level. The program was funded via scholarships,\nand as a result I had the remarkable opportunity to experience most of what\nbusiness schools teach without the crippling burden of debt.\n\nI\u2019ve also been on the fast track to corporate success. Through the\nUniversity of Cincinnati\u2019s cooperative education program, I landed a\nmanagement position at a Fortune 500 company\u2014Procter & Gamble\u2014during\nmy second year of college. By the time I graduated in 2005, I had an offer to\nbecome an assistant brand manager in P&G\u2019s Home Care division, a role\nreserved for graduates of top MBA programs.\n\nAs I began my last semester of college, I started focusing less on my\ncoursework and more on the future. My new job would require a solid\nunderstanding of business, and almost all of my peers and managers would\nhave MBAs from top-tier schools. I briefly considered enrolling in an MBA\nprogram, but it made no sense to pursue an expensive credential to get the\nkind of job I already had, and my responsibilities would be demanding enough\nwithout adding a load of coursework by enrolling in a part-time program.\n\nWhile considering my options, I remembered a bit of career advice that\nAndy Walter, the first associate director I reported to at P&G, had given me:\n\u201cIf you put the same amount of time and energy you\u2019d spend completing an\nMBA into doing good work and improving your skills, you\u2019ll do just as well.\u201d\n(Andy doesn\u2019t have an MBA\u2014te studied electrical engineering in college. He\nretired as one of the company\u2019s top global IT executives, responsible for\nleading many of P&G\u2019s largest projects.)\n\nIn the end, I decided to skip business school, but not business education.\nInstead of enrolling in an MBA program, I hit the books, creating my own\npersonal MBA.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "ve always been an avid reader, but before I decided to learn everything I\ncould about business, most of what I read was fiction. I grew up in New\nLondon, a small farm town in northern Ohio where the major industries are\nagriculture and light manufacturing. My mother worked as a librarian, and my\n\nfather was a sixth-grade science teacher, then an elementary school principal.\nBooks were a major part of my life, but business was not.\n\nBefore getting my first real job, I knew next to nothing about what\nbusinesses were or how they functioned, other than that they were places\npeople went every day in order to draw a paycheck. I had no idea that\ncompanies like Procter & Gamble existed until I applied for the job that swept\nme into the corporate world.\n\nWorking for P&G was an education in itself. The size and scope of the\nbusiness\u2014and the complexity of managing a business of that size\u2014boggled\nmy mind. During my first three years with the company, I participated in\nmaking decisions across every part of the business process: creating new\nproducts, ramping up production, allocating millions of marketing dollars, and\nsecuring distribution with major retailers like Walmart, Target, Kroger, and\nCostco.\n\nAs an assistant brand manager, I was leading teams of thirty to forty P&G\nemployees, contractors, and agency staff\u2014all of whom had competing\nprojects, plans, and priorities. The stakes were huge, and the pressure was\nintense. To this day, I can\u2019t help but marvel at the thousands of man-hours, the\nmillions of dollars, and the complex processes necessary to make a simple\nbottle of dish soap appear on the shelf of the local supermarket. Everything\nfrom the shape of the bottle to the scent of the product is optimized\u2014\nincluding the text on the cardboard boxes used to ship inventory to the store.\n\nMy work at P&G, however, wasn\u2019t the only thing on my mind. My\ndecision to skip business school in favor of educating myself developed from\na side project into a minor obsession. Every day I would spend hour after hour\nreading and researching, searching for one more tidbit of knowledge that\nwould help me to better understand how the business world worked.\n\nInstead of using the summer after graduation to relax and go on vacation, I\nspent my days haunting the business stacks at the local bookstore, absorbing\nas much as I could. By the time I officially started working full-time for P&G\nin September 2005, I had read books spanning every discipline that business\nschools teach, as well as disciplines that most business schools don\u2019t cover in\ndetail, such as psychology, physical science, and systems theory. When my\nfirst day at P&G finally arrived, I felt prepared.\n\nAs it turned out, my self-education served me well\u2014I was doing valuable\nwork, making things happen, and getting good annual reviews. As time went\non, however, I realized three very important things:\n\n1.\nLarge companies move slowly. Good ideas often died on the vine\nbecause they had to be approved by too many people.\n\n2.\n\nClimbing the corporate ladder is an obstacle to doing great work. I\nwanted to focus on getting things done and making things better, not\ndrafting memos, sitting in meetings, and positioning myself for\npromotion. Politics and turf wars are an inescapable part of the daily\nexperience of working for a large company.\n\n3.\n\nFrustration leads to burnout. 1 wanted to enjoy the daily experience of\nwork, but instead I felt like I was running a gauntlet each day. It began\nto affect my health, happiness, and relationships. The longer I stayed in\nthe corporate world, the more I realized I wanted out. I wanted to\ndecide what to work on, who to work with, and what to prioritize\u2014\nmaking entrepreneurship the best path for me long-term.\n",

UF MATE\n\nf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m good at, it\u2019s taking in an enormous amount of\ninformation and distilling it to the essentials. Even so, sifting through the\nmassive amount of business information available was a huge challenge:\nthousands of new business books are published every year, and business\nperiodicals, journals, and websites publish new research daily. Some of this\ninformation is useful, but most of it is not.\n\nMy early business research was haphazard\u2014I went to a bookstore and\npicked up any book that looked interesting. For every great book I found, I\nhad to wade through ten times as many low-quality texts written by authors\nwho were more interested in creating a three-hundred-page business card than\nproviding useful information.\n\nI started to wonder how much of what\u2019s out there\u2014and there\u2019s a lot out\nthere\u2014I really needed to know. How could I separate the valuable information\nfrom the rubbish? I only had so much time and energy, so I started searching\n\nfor a filter: something that would direct me to the useful knowledge and keep\nme away from the chaff. The more I searched, the more I realized it didn\u2019t\nexist\u2014so I decided to create it myself.\n\nI began tracking which resources were valuable and which ones weren\u2019t,\nthen publishing my findings on my website, both as an archive and for the\nbenefit of anyone interested. It was a personal project, nothing more: I was\njust a recent college graduate doing my best to learn something useful, and\npublishing my research for others seemed like a good use of time and energy.\n\nOne fateful morning, however, the Personal MBA went public\u2014and\nbecame much more than a personal project.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "n addition to reading books, I was following several hundred business blogs.\nSome of the best business thinking was being published on the internet months\n(or years) before it ever appeared in print, and I wanted to read it all as soon as\nit was available.\n\nOne of the bloggers I followed was Seth Godin. A bestselling author (of\nbooks like Permission Marketing, Purple Cow, and Linchpin) and one of the\nearliest successful online marketers, Seth specializes in bold statements of big\nideas designed to challenge you to do more, do better, question the status quo,\nand make a difference.\n\nOne particular morning, Seth was commenting on a recent news story:\nHarvard was rescinding the admission of 119 previously soon-to-be Harvard\nMBA students.* These prospective students had discovered a way to hack into\nthe Harvard admissions website to view their application status before the\nofficial acceptance letters went out. The story became a media frenzy,\ndevolving into a debate about whether MBA students were predisposed to lie,\ncheat, and steal, or if business schools made them that way.\n\nInstead of being outraged at the bad behavior of the applicants, Seth had a\ndifferent perspective: Harvard was giving these students a gift. By rescinding\ntheir admission, the university was returning $150,000 and two years of their\nlives that would otherwise have been spent chasing a piece of paper. \u201cIt\u2019s hard\nfor me to understand,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwhy [getting an MBA\\] is a better use of\n\ntime and money than actual experience combined with a dedicated reading of\n30 or 40 books.\u201d\n\nI experienced a moment of unexpected validation, then got to work.\n\nOver the next two days, I created a list of the books and resources I had\nfound most valuable in my studies, then published it on my website with a\nlink to Seth\u2019s post, so anyone interested in figuring out how to do what Seth\nsuggested would be able to find it. When it was done, I sent Seth an email\nwith a note of thanks and a link to my post.\n\nTwo minutes later, a post went up on Seth\u2019s blog directing people to my\nreading list, and a flood of readers from around the world began visiting my\nwebsite.\n\nPopular personal-development and productivity blogs and sites like\nLifehacker picked up the story, which then spread to social media websites\nand a wide variety of personal blogs. In the first week of the Personal MBA\u2019s\nexistence, thirty thousand people visited my little corner of the internet to see\nwhat I was doing. Better yet, they started talking.\n\nSome readers asked questions\u2014where should they start? Others suggested\ngreat books they\u2019d read, helping me with my research. A few told me the\nentire project was naive and that I was wasting my time. Through it all, I kept\nreading, researching, and developing the Personal MBA in my spare time, and\nthe business self-education movement began to snowball.\n\nIn a very short time, the Personal MBA grew from a one-man side project\ninto a global phenomenon. The site, personalmba.com, has been visited by\nmillions of readers since it went live in early 2005, and the project has been\nfeatured by the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg\nBusinessweek, the Financial Times, Time, Fortune, Fast Company, and\nhundreds of other major news organizations and independent websites. In late\n2008, I left P&G to focus on research, writing, and improving the Personal\nMBA full-time.\n\nAs much as I enjoyed the interest in my reading list, I soon realized that\nproviding a reading list wasn\u2019t enough. People read business books to solve\nspecific challenges or to improve themselves in some tangible way. They\u2019re\nlooking for solutions, and a list of books\u2014while valuable\u2014could only do so\nmuch.\n\nThe books themselves aren\u2019t as important as the ideas and knowledge they\ncontain, but many of my readers were missing out because it took hours of\nturning pages to get to the good stuff. Many readers started with enthusiasm,\nonly to quit after reading a few books\u2014it took too long to reap the rewards,\n\nand the demands of work and family life prevented many readers from\ncompleting the project.\nTo help them, I had more work to do.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "M y first glimpse into the future of the Personal MBA came when I\ndiscovered the work of Charlie Munger.\n\nCharlie was born in Omaha, Nebraska, just before the Great Depression.\nAs a young man, Charlie skipped high school athletics in favor of reading to\nsatisfy his intense curiosity about how the world worked. His early business\nexperience consisted of working in a family-owned grocery store for $2 a day.\n\nIn 1941, Charlie graduated from high school. After two years of studying\nundergraduate mathematics and physics at the University of Michigan, he\nenlisted in the US Army Air Corps, where he was trained as a meteorologist.\nIn 1946, after leaving the army, he was accepted to Harvard Law School, even\nthough he had never earned a bachelor\u2019s degree, which wasn\u2019t required at the\ntime.\n\nCharlie graduated from Harvard Law in 1948 and spent the next seventeen\nyears practicing as an attorney. In 1965, he left the law firm he had created to\nstart an investment partnership, which went on to outperform the market by\n19.8 percent compounded annually over fourteen years\u2014an astounding record\ngiven his complete lack of formal business education.*\n\nCharlie Munger isn\u2019t a household name, but most people have heard of\nWarren Buffett, Charlie\u2019s business partner. Munger joined Buffett at Berkshire\nHathaway, a floundering textile manufacturer turned investment holding\ncompany, in 1978. Together, Buffett and Munger became billionaires.\n\nAccording to Buffett, Charlie\u2019s mental model\u2014centric approach to business\nis a major contributing factor in the success of Berkshire Hathaway and\nBuffett\u2019s status as one of the world\u2019s wealthiest business owners. In Buffett\u2019s\nwords: \u201cCharlie can analyze and evaluate any kind of deal faster and more\n\naccurately than any man alive. He sees any valid weakness in sixty seconds.\nHe\u2019s the perfect partner.\u201d\u00b0\n\nThe secret to Charlie\u2019s success is a systematic way of understanding how\nbusinesses work. Even though he never studied business in college, his\nrelentless self-education in a wide variety of subjects allowed him to construct\nwhat he called a \u201clatticework of mental models,\u201d which he then applied to\nmaking business decisions:\n\nI\u2019ve long believed that a certain system\u2014which almost any intelligent\nperson can learn\u2014works way better than the systems most people use [to\nunderstand the world]. What you need is a latticework of mental models\nin your head. And, with that system, things gradually fit together in a\nway that enhances cognition.\n\nJust as multiple factors shape every system, multiple mental models\nfrom a variety of disciplines are necessary to understand that system . . .\nYou have to realize the truth of biologist Julian Huxley\u2019s idea that \u201cLife\nis just one damn relatedness after another.\u201d So you must have all the\nmodels, and you must see the relatedness and the effects from the\nrelatedness . . .\u00b0\n\nIt\u2019s kind of fun to sit here and outthink people who are way smarter\nthan you are because you\u2019 ve trained yourself to be more objective and\nmore multidisciplinary. Furthermore, there is a lot of money in it, as I can\ntestify from my own personal experience.\u201d\n\nBy basing their investment decisions on their extensive knowledge of how\nbusinesses work, how people work, and how systems work, Buffett and\nMunger created a company worth more than $500 billion\u2014an astounding\ntrack record for a meteorologist-turned-lawyer from Omaha with no formal\nbusiness education.\n\nDiscovering Munger\u2019s approach to business education was a revelation.\nHere was a man who, decades before, had decided to do what I was doing\u2014\nand it had worked beyond all expectation. Munger\u2019s method of identifying and\napplying fundamental principles made much more sense to me than most of\nthe business books I\u2019d read. I decided to learn everything I could about the\nmental models Charlie Munger used to make decisions.\n\nCharlie has never published a comprehensive collection of his mental\nmodels. He\u2019s given hints in his speeches and essays\u2014even going so far as to\npublish a list of the psychological principles he finds most useful in Poor\n\nCharlie\u2019s Almanack, a 2005 biography\u2014but there is no single text that\ncontains Charlie\u2019s conception of \u201ceverything you need to know in order to\nsucceed in business.\u201d\n\nIf I wanted to understand the fundamental principles of how every\nsuccessful businessperson works, I\u2019d have to discover them myself. To do\nthat, I had to rebuild my understanding of business from the ground up.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "FHC PRINCIPLES UF PIALILMALL\n\nM ost business books\u2014and business schools\u2014assume that the student\nalready knows what businesses are, what they do, and how they work\u2014as if it\nwere the most obvious thing in the world. It\u2019s not. Business is one of the most\ncomplex and multidisciplinary areas of human experience, and trying to\nunderstand how businesses work can be difficult, even though they surround\nus every day.\n\nBusinesses are so much a part of daily life that it\u2019s easy to take the business\nworld for granted. Day after day, businesses deliver what we want and need\nwith little fanfare or fuss. Look around: almost every material good you\u2019re\nsurrounded by right now was created and delivered to you by some sort of\nbusiness.\n\nBusinesses create and deliver so many different things in so many different\nways that it makes generalizations difficult: What do apple cider and airlines\nhave in common? As it turns out, quite a bit\u2014if you know where to look.\n\nHere\u2019s how I define a business:\n\nEvery successful business (1) creates or provides something of value that\n(2) other people want or need (3) at a price they\u2019re willing to pay, ina\nway that (4) satisfies the purchaser\u2019s needs and expectations, and (5)\nprovides the business sufficient revenue to make it worthwhile for the\nowners to continue operation.\n\nTake away any of these things\u2014value creation, customer demand,\ntransactions, value delivery, or profit sufficiency\u2014and you have something\n\nother than a business. Each factor is both essential and universal.\n\nAs I researched each of those factors in detail, I found additional universal\nrequirements. Value can\u2019t be created without understanding what people want\n(market research). Attracting customers first requires getting their attention,\nthen making them interested (marketing). In order to close a sale, people must\ntrust your ability to deliver on what\u2019s promised (value delivery and\noperations). Customer satisfaction depends on exceeding the customer\u2019s\nexpectations (customer service). Profit sufficiency requires bringing in more\nmoney than is spent (finance).\n\nThese tasks aren\u2019t rocket science, but they\u2019re always necessary, no matter\nwho you are or what business you\u2019re in. Do them well and your business\nthrives. Ignore them and you won\u2019t be in business very long.\n\nEvery business relies on two additional factors: people and systems. Every\nbusiness is created by people and survives by benefiting other people in some\nway. To understand how businesses work, you must have a firm understanding\nof how people tend to think and behave\u2014how humans make decisions, act on\nthose decisions, and communicate with others. Recent advances in psychology\nand neuroscience are revealing why people do the things they do, as well as\nhow to improve our own behavior and work in a more efficient and effective\nway with others.\n\nSystems, on the other hand, are the invisible structures that hold every\nbusiness together. At the core, every business is a collection of processes that\ncan be repeated to produce a particular result. By understanding how complex\nsystems work, it\u2019s possible to find ways to improve existing systems, whether\nyou\u2019 re dealing with a marketing campaign or an automotive assembly line.\n\nBefore writing this book, I spent several years testing its principles with my\nclients and readers. Understanding and applying these mental models of\nbusiness has helped them launch new careers, land job offers from prestigious\norganizations in corporate and academic fields, land promotions and pay\nraises, start new businesses, and, in several cases, go through the entire\nproduct development process (from idea to first sale) in weeks instead of\nyears.\n\nThese concepts are important because they work. Not only will you be able\nto create more value for others and improve your career, you\u2019ll find it easier to\nachieve what you set out to do\u2014and you\u2019ll have more fun along the way.\n",

A venture that doesn\u2019t bring in enough\nmoney to keep operating is not going to exist very long.\n\nAt the core, every business is a collection of five interdependent\nprocesses, each of which flows into the next:\n\n1.\nValue Creation\u2014discovering what people need or want, then\ncreating it.\n\n2.\n\nMarketing\u2014attracting attention and building demand for what\nyou\u2019ve created.\n\n3.\n\nSales\u2014turning prospective customers into paying customers.\n\n4.\nValue Delivery\u2014giving your customers what you\u2019ve promised and\nensuring that they\u2019re satisfied.\n\n5.\nFinance\u2014bringing in enough money to keep going and make your\neffort worthwhile.\n\nIf these five things sound simple, it\u2019s because they are. Business is not\n(and has never been) rocket science\u2014it\u2019s a process of identifying a problem\nand finding a way to solve it that benefits both parties. Anyone who tries to\nmake business sound more complicated than this is either trying to impress\nyou or trying to sell you something you don\u2019t need.\n\nThe Five Parts of Every Business are the basis of every good business idea\nand business plan. If you can define each of these five processes for any\nbusiness, you\u2019ll have a complete understanding of how it works. If you\u2019re\nthinking about starting a new business, defining what these processes might\nlook like is the best place to start. If you can\u2019t describe or diagram your\nbusiness idea in terms of these core processes, you don\u2019t understand it well\n\nenough to make it work.\n",

In business, it happens\nall the time.\n\nDean Kamen, a renowned and prolific inventor whose creations include\nthe Stirling engine, the world\u2019s first wearable insulin pump, and water-\npurification devices, poured more than $100 million into the development\nof the Segway PT, a $5,000, two-wheeled, self-balancing scooter that he\nclaimed would revolutionize personal transportation \u201cin the same way that\nthe car replaced the horse and buggy.\u201d When the Segway was made\navailable to the public in 2002, the company announced that it expected to\nsell fifty thousand units every year.\n\nFive years into the business, the company had sold a total of twenty-\nthree thousand units\u2014less than 10 percent of the initial goal. (The\ncompany\u2019s financial records are private, but it\u2019s safe to say they didn\u2019t look\ngood. In 2015, the company was sold to Ninebot, a competitor that sells\ninexpensive electric scooters, for an undisclosed sum.)\n\nThe problem wasn\u2019t that the product was poorly designed. The\ntechnology that makes the Segway work is sophisticated, and the benefits\n\nare significant: the Segway is a convenient, green urban car replacement.\nThe problem was that very few people cared enough to spend $5,000 on a\ngoofy-looking alternative to walking or riding a bike\u2014the massive market\nthat Kamen expected didn\u2019t exist.\n\nThe same thing happens to new businesses every day. Without enough\nrevenue to sustain it, any business will fail. Your revenue is dependent on\npeople wanting what you have to offer.\n\nEvery business is fundamentally limited by the size and quality of the\nmarket it attempts to serve. The /ron Law of the Market is cold, hard, and\nunforgiving: if you don\u2019t have a large group of people who want what you\nhave to offer, your chances of building a viable business are very slim.\n\nThe best approach is to focus on making things people want to buy.\nCreating something no one wants is a waste. Market research is the business\nequivalent of \u201cLook before you leap.\u201d Books like The New Business Road\nTest by John Mullins can help you identify promising markets from the\noutset, increasing the probability that your new venture will be a success.\n\nIn the next few sections, we\u2019ll explore how to figure out what people\nwant and need before investing your time and hard-earned money into\ncreating something new.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "f you\u2019re going to build a successful business, it\u2019s useful to have a basic\nunderstanding of what people want. The most well-known general theory of\nwhat people want is Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs, proposed by the\npsychologist Abraham Maslow in 1943. Maslow\u2019s theory was that people\nprogress through five general stages in the pursuit of what they need:\nphysiology, safety, belonging/love, esteem, and self-actualization.\nPhysiology represents the \u201clowest\u201d level of human need, while self-\nactualization (the exploration of a person\u2019s innate potential) is the \u201chighest.\u201d\n\nIn Maslow\u2019s hierarchy, each lower-level need must be met before a\nperson can focus on higher-order needs. If you don\u2019t have enough food or\n\nyou\u2019re in physical danger, you\u2019re probably not paying too much attention to\nhow much other people like you or how much personal growth you\u2019re\nexperiencing.\n\nIn practice, I prefer Clayton Alderfer\u2019s version of Maslow\u2019s hierarchy,\nwhich he called \u201cERG theory\u201d: people seek existence, relatedness, and\ngrowth, in that order. When people have what they need to survive, they\nmove on to making friends and finding mates. When they\u2019re satisfied with\ntheir relationships, they focus on doing things they enjoy and improving\ntheir skills in things that interest them. First existence, then relatedness,\nthen growth.\n\nERG theory explains the general priority of human desires, but not the\nmethods people use to satisfy them. For that, we must turn to other theories\nof human action. According to Harvard Business School professors Paul\nLawrence and Nitin Nohria, the authors of Driven: How Human Nature\nShapes Our Choices, all human beings have four Core Human Drives that\nhave a profound influence on our decisions and actions:\n\n1.\n\nThe Drive to Acquire\u2014the desire to obtain or collect physical\nobjects, as well as immaterial qualities like status, power, and\ninfluence. Businesses built on the drive to acquire include retailers,\ninvestment brokerages, and political consulting companies.\nCompanies that promise to make us wealthy, famous, influential, or\npowerful connect to this drive.\n\n2.\n\nThe Drive to Bond\u2014the desire to feel valued and loved by forming\nrelationships with others, either platonic or romantic. Businesses\nbuilt on the drive to bond include restaurants, conferences, and\ndating services. Companies that promise to make us attractive, well-\nliked, or highly regarded connect to this drive.\n\n3.\n\nThe Drive to Learn\u2014the desire to satisfy our curiosity. Businesses\nbuilt on the drive to learn include academic programs, book\npublishers, and training workshops. Companies that promise to\nmake us more knowledgeable or competent connect to this drive.\n\n4.\n\nThe Drive to Defend\u2014the desire to protect ourselves, our loved\nones, and our property. Businesses built on the drive to defend\ninclude home alarm system manufacturers, insurers, martial arts\ntraining programs, and legal services. Companies that promise to\nkeep us safe, eliminate a problem, or prevent bad things from\nhappening connect to this drive.\n\nThere\u2019s a fifth core drive that Lawrence and Nohria missed:\n\n5.\n\nThe Drive to Feel\u2014the desire for new sensory stimuli, intense\nemotional experiences, pleasure, excitement, entertainment, and\nanticipation. Businesses built on the drive to feel include movie\ntheaters, arcades, concert promoters, and sports teams. Companies\nthat promise to give us pleasure, thrill us, or give us something to\nlook forward to connect with this drive.\n\nWhenever a group of people have an unmet need in one or more of these\nareas, a market will form to satisfy that need. As a result, the more drives\nyour offer connects with, the more attractive it will be to your potential\nmarket.\n\nAt the core, all successful businesses sell the promise of some\ncombination of money, status, power, love, knowledge, protection, pleasure,\nand excitement. The better you articulate how your offer satisfies one or\nmore of these drives, the more attractive your offer will become.\n",

Like many other mammals, humans\nevolved to have a pecking order, a relative ranking of Power or status in a\n\ngroup. Competing with other people for status and power brought many\nbenefits, including access to food, mates, resources, and the protection of\nother group members.\n\nStatus considerations are no longer as critical to survival, but our brains\ndeveloped to place a very high priority on Social Status. As a result, status\nconsiderations influence the vast majority of a person\u2019s decisions and\nactions.\n\nSocial Status is a universal phenomenon: neurotypical human beings\ncare about what other people think of them and spend a significant amount\nof energy tracking their relative status compared to other members of their\ngroup. When opportunities to increase status appear, most people will seize\nthem. When given a choice between different alternatives, people will\nchoose the option with the highest perceived status.\n\nIn general, we like to be associated with people and organizations that\nwe think are powerful, important, or exclusive or that exhibit other high-\nstatus qualities or behaviors. We also like to ensure other people are aware\nof our status: for proof, examine what people post on their social-media\nprofiles.\n\nSocial Status is a fact of human life; it\u2019s not necessarily bad or\nsomething to be avoided. On the contrary: status seeking can motivate\npeople to accomplish amazing things. In the words of Alain de Botton, a\nphilosopher and social critic, \u201cIf one felt successful, there\u2019d be so little\nincentive to be successful.\u201d\n\nUnchecked, this urge toward status can lead people to make poor\ndecisions: think of someone who purchases a large house, a luxury car, and\ndesigner clothing, only to end up bankrupt or in severe debt. As an\nindividual, paying attention to how much you value status is useful when\nmaking buying decisions, particularly when there are other options that can\nmeet the same needs or desires at a lower cost.\n\nAs a business professional, it\u2019s important to understand that status\nconsiderations are present in every level of the Core Human Drives. When\nyou make an offer to a new prospect, they will estimate how your offer will\ninfluence their social status. Building Status Signals into your offer is almost\nalways an effective way to increase its appeal to your target market.\n",

Rate each\nof the ten factors below on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is terrible and 10\nfantastic. When in doubt, be conservative in your estimate:\n\n1.\n\nUrgency. How badly do people want or need this right now?\n(Renting an old movie is low urgency; seeing the first showing of a\nnew movie on opening night is high urgency, since it only happens\nonce.)\n\n2.\n\nMarket Size. How many people are purchasing things like this? (The\nmarket for underwater basket-weaving courses is very small; the\nmarket for cancer cures is massive.)\n\n3.\n\nPricing Potential. What is the highest price a typical purchaser\nwould be willing to spend for a solution? (Lollipops sell for $0.05;\naircraft carriers sell for billions.)\n\n4.\n\nCost of Customer Acquisition. How easy is it to acquire a new\ncustomer? On average, how much will it cost to generate a sale, in\nboth money and effort? (Restaurants built on high-traffic interstate\nhighways spend little to bring in new customers. Government\ncontractors can spend millions landing major procurement deals.)\n\n5.\n\nCost of Value Delivery. How much will it cost to create and deliver\nthe value offered, in both money and effort? (Delivering files via the\ninternet is almost free; inventing a product and building a factory\ncosts millions.)\n\n6.\n\nUniqueness of Offer. How unique is your offer versus competing\nofferings in the market, and how easy is it for potential competitors\nto copy you? (There are many hair salons but very few companies\nthat offer private space travel.)\n\n7.\n\nSpeed to Market. How soon can you create something to sell? (You\ncan offer to mow a neighbor\u2019s lawn in minutes; opening a bank can\ntake years.)\n\n8.\n\nUp-front Investment. How much will you have to invest before\nyou\u2019re ready to sell? (To be a housekeeper, all you need is a set of\ninexpensive cleaning products. To mine for gold, you need millions\nto purchase land and excavating equipment.)\n\n9.\n\nUpsell Potential. Are there related secondary offers that you could\nalso present to purchasing customers? (Customers who purchase\nrazors need shaving cream and extra blades as well; buy a Frisbee\nand you won\u2019t need another unless you lose it.)\n\n10.\n\nEvergreen Potential. Once the initial offer has been created, how\nmuch additional work will you have to put in in order to continue\nselling? (Business consulting requires ongoing work to get paid; a\nbook can be produced once and then sold over and over as is.)\n\nWhen you\u2019re done with your assessment, add up the score. If the score is\n50 or below, move on to another idea\u2014there are better places to invest your\nenergy and resources. If the score is 75 or above, you have a very promising\nidea\u2014full speed ahead.

This strategy is called\nModularity.\n\nMost successful businesses offer value in multiple forms. Take the\nmagazine industry, for example. Magazines charge a monthly or annual\nSubscription fee in exchange for a printed magazine delivered by mail on a\nperiodic basis. Simultaneously, they use Audience Aggregation to sell access\nto their subscribers via advertising, which is included in the magazine\nalongside the content.\n\nTravel websites like Orbitz sell Options (airplane tickets) alongside trip-\ncancellation Insurance and display advertising (Audience Aggregation) to\nwebsite visitors. Movie theaters combine movie showings (a Shared\nResource) with tickets (an Option) and concession sales (Products).\nCompanies like Netflix and Spotify provide digital access to a large library\n\nof movies and music (a Shared Resource) in exchange for a monthly fee\n(Subscription).\n\nIn most companies, each of these offers is handled separately, and the\ncustomer can pick and choose which offers they want to take advantage of.\nBy making offers Modular, the business can create and improve each offer\nin isolation, then mix and match offers as necessary to better serve their\ncustomers. It\u2019s like playing with LEGOs: once you have a set of pieces to\nwork with, you can put them together in all sorts of interesting ways.\n",

Bundling allows you to repurpose\nvalue that you have already created to create even more value.\n\nBundling occurs when you combine multiple smaller offers into a single\nlarge offer. An example of Bundling occurs in the mobile phone industry,\nwhere a mobile phone (a physical Product) is bundled with a monthly\nservice plan (a Subscription) for a single price. Similarly, buy-one-get-one-\nfree offers at the grocery store are a form of Bundling.\n\nThe more offers contained in the bundle, the higher the Perceived Value of\nthe offer and the more the business can charge. That\u2019s why mobile phone\nproviders offer additional minutes, unlimited text messaging, and internet\nservice on top of the basic service plan. The more benefits provided, the\nmore a customer is often willing to pay on a monthly basis for the entire\npackage.\n\nUnbundling is the opposite of Bundling: it\u2019s taking one offer and splitting\nit up into multiple offers. A good example of Unbundling is selling\ndownloads of a single song instead of the entire album. Customers may not\nbe willing to pay $10 for the album, but they might be willing to pay a\ndollar or two for the songs they like. Unbundling the album into individual\nunits opens the way to sales that wouldn\u2019t otherwise happen.\n\nBundling and Unbundling can help you create value for different types\nof customers without requiring the creation of something new. By\ncombining offers and forms in various configurations, you can offer your\ncustomers what they want.\n",

You can\u2019t\njust walk into a store, examine all of the potential options, pick the house\nthat suits you best, then walk up to a cash register to purchase it with cash\nor a credit card. Looking at available homes, clarifying needs and\npreferences, securing financing, negotiating the purchase price, and\ncompleting the legal paperwork takes a nontrivial amount of time,\nknowledge, and expertise.\n\nThat\u2019s why residential real estate agents have a market: potential home\nbuyers often don\u2019t know the options (particularly if they\u2019re not familiar\nwith the area), don\u2019t have a lot of experience completing these sorts of\nTransactions, and feel overwhelmed. Real estate agents assist in the search,\npurchase decision, and closing process, and home buyers are often happy to\nwork with someone who knows what they\u2019re doing.\n\nThe term for this sort of help is intermediation: adding a party between the\nbuyer and seller responsible for helping one of the parties complete the\nTransaction or derive value from the purchase.\n\nIntermediation is useful in complex situations where the purchaser\nbenefits from guidance and help from experts. You\u2019!l often find\nIntermediaries in areas where there are a lot of options to choose from\u2014\nlike retailers who decide which items to stock. They\u2019re also common in\ncomplex negotiations and purchases, like business brokerages who help\nentrepreneurs put a price on their current business operations, then help\n\nthem find potential acquiring companies willing to pay what their business\nis worth. In most cases, the Intermediary also acts as a Buffer between the\nparties, which can shield them from unnecessary pressure or uncomfortable\nsituations.\n\nThe opposite of Intermediation is Disintermediation: removing\nunnecessary parties to a Transaction in favor of direct contact between the\nbuyer and seller. Before the internet, most manufacturers had to deal with\nretailers if they wanted to sell their goods, since mass advertising and\ndistribution opportunities were expensive and limited. The internet allowed\nmanufacturers to attract the attention of potential customers, complete\npurchases, and deliver their goods direct to their consumers: no retailer\nrequired. As a result, more product and service companies can exist in a\nprofitable and sustainable way: the Margins that would otherwise be\ncaptured by an Intermediary can be redirected toward lower prices, targeted\nadvertising, product development, or Profit.\n\nOpportunities exist at both ends of the spectrum: would your potential\ncustomers benefit from more help, or less?\n",

Useful Feedback from real prospects helps you understand\nhow well your offer meets their needs before development is complete,\nwhich allows you to make changes before you start selling.\n\nHere are a few tips to maximize the value of the Feedback you receive:\n\n1.\n\nGet Feedback from real potential customers instead of friends and\nfamily. Your inner circle wants you to succeed and wants to maintain\na good relationship with you, so it\u2019s likely that they\u2019 ll\nunintentionally sugarcoat their Feedback. For best results, be sure to\nget plenty of Feedback from people who aren\u2019t personally invested\nin you or your project.\n\n2.\n\nAsk open-ended questions. When collecting Feedback, you should\nbe listening more than you talk. Have a few open-ended questions\nprepared to give the conversation a bit of structure, but otherwise\nencourage the other person to do most of the talking. Short\nwho/what/when/where/why/how questions work best. Watch what\nthe user does, and compare their actions with what they say.\n\n3.\n\nSteady yourself and keep calm. Asking for genuine Feedback (the\nonly useful kind) requires thick skin\u2014no one likes hearing their\nbaby is ugly. Try not to get offended or defensive if someone\ndoesn\u2019t like what you\u2019ve created; they\u2019re doing you a great service\nby telling you so.\n\n4.\n\nTake what you hear with a grain of salt. Even the most discouraging\nFeedback contains crucial pieces of information that can help you\n\nmake your offering better. The worst response you can get when\nasking for Feedback isn\u2019t emphatic dislike: it\u2019s total apathy. If no\none seems to care about what you\u2019ve created, you don\u2019t have a\nviable business idea.\n\n5.\n\nGive potential customers the opportunity to preorder. One of the\nmost important pieces of Feedback you can receive during the\niteration process is the other person\u2019s willingness to purchase what\nyou\u2019re creating.

If no\none is willing to preorder, you know you have more work to do\nbefore you have a viable offer.

You\u2019re the owner of the diner, and you\u2019re\nlooking for ways to serve your customers better and bring new people into\nthe restaurant. What should you focus on improving?

Some of them are about effort: Should you go to\nthe team meeting or complete the overdue TPS report?\n\nPredicting how people will make certain Trade-offs is tricky\u2014values\nchange, given the environment and context.

What you\nwant today may be different from what you want tomorrow.\n\nWhen making decisions about what to include in your offering, it pays to\nlook for patterns\u2014information about how specific groups of people tend to\nvalue some characteristic in a certain context. The decisions you make\nabout what to include and what to leave out will never make everyone\nhappy, so perfection shouldn\u2019t be your goal.

As you develop your offering, one of\nyour first priorities should be to find out what your potential customers\nvalue more than the buying power of the dollars in their wallets.\n\nEveryone has slightly different values at any given time, but there are a\nfew common patterns that appear when people evaluate a potential\npurchase. Assuming the promised benefits of the offering are appealing,\nthere are nine common Economic Values that people consider when\nevaluating a potential purchase. They are:\n\n1.\n\nEfficacy\u2014how well does it work?\n\n2.\n\nSpeed\u2014how soon does it work?\n\n3.\n\nReliability\u2014can | depend on it to do what I want?\n4.\n\nEase of use\u2014how much effort does it require?\n5.\n\nFlexibility\u2014how many things does it do?\n\n6\n\nStatus\u2014how does this affect the way others perceive me?\n\n7.\n\nAesthetic appeal\u2014how attractive or otherwise aesthetically pleasing\nis it?\n\n8.\n\nEmotion\u2014how does it make me feel?\n\n9.\nCost\u2014how much do I have to give up to get it?\n\nIn the book Trade-Off: Why Some Things Catch On, and Others Donte,\nKevin Maney discusses these common values in terms of two primary\ncharacteristics: convenience and fidelity. Things that are quick, reliable,\neasy, and flexible are convenient. Things that offer quality, status, aesthetic\nappeal, or emotional impact are high fidelity.\n\nAlmost every improvement you make to an offer can be thought of in\nterms of improving either convenience or fidelity. It\u2019s incredibly difficult to\noptimize for both fidelity and convenience at the same time, so the most\nsuccessful offerings try to provide the most convenience or fidelity among\nall competing offerings. If you\u2019re craving pizza, a table at the original\nPizzeria Uno in Chicago is high fidelity; Domino\u2019s home delivery is\nconvenient. Pizzeria Uno benefits more from making the dining experience\nremarkable, while Domino\u2019s benefits more from delivering decent pizza as\nfast as possible.\n\nThe Trade-offs that are made in the development of new offerings are\nwhat give each option its unique identity. Here\u2019s an example from the\napparel business: Old Navy, Banana Republic, and Gap are owned by the\nsame company, Gap Inc. All three lines make the same types of clothing\u2014\nshirts, pants, and so on\u2014but offer different Trade-offs.\n\nInstead of attempting to make a single clothing line that\u2019s designed to\nappeal to everyone (which is impossible, since everyone wants something\ndifferent), the company focused each line around a specific Trade-off. Old\nNavy emphasizes functionality and low cost. Gap emphasizes style and\nfashion at a moderate cost. Banana Republic emphasizes aesthetics and\nSocial Status at a premium cost. Each line has its own identity and appeals to\na different type of potential customer, even though the clothes may be\nmanufactured using the same processes and the revenues end up in the\ncoffers of the same company.\n",

Here\u2019s proof: bring together a group of potential\ncustomers for a focus group. Ask each participant to rate the importance of\neach of the nine Economic Values for your offering on a scale of 0 to 10.\nWhat will the results look like?\n\nRegardless of your product or service, the results will be the same: your\ncustomers want products that provide exceptional results every time, with\nno effort. Simultaneously, they want the offer to make them rich, famous,\nattractive, and eternally blissful. They also want it to be free. If you ask\nthem what they\u2019d be willing to give up, they\u2019! answer that everything is\nimportant and they won\u2019t be happy with less.\n\nThe reality outside of the focus group is always quite different. After the\ngroup adjourns, each of those participants will go out and purchase\nsomething that\u2019s not free and not perfect, and they\u2019! be happy with their\nchoice. Why?\n\nAs arule, people never accept Trade-offs unless they\u2019re forced to make a\nDecision. If the perfect option existed, they\u2019d buy it. Since there\u2019s no such\nthing as the perfect offering, people are happy to settle for the Next Best\nAlternative.\n\nThe best way to discover what people value is to ask them to make\nexplicit Trade-offs during the research process. The problem with the\nhypothetical focus group was that it didn\u2019t ask the participants to make any\nreal Decisions\u2014the participants could have everything, so they wanted\neverything.\n\nRelative Importance Testing\u2014a set of analysis techniques pioneered by\nstatistician Jordan Louviere in the 1980s*\u2014gives you a way to determine\nwhat people want by asking them a series of simple questions designed to\nsimulate real-life Trade-offs. Here\u2019s how it works.\n\nLet\u2019s assume we\u2019re conducting a Relative Importance Test for the diner\npreviously mentioned. Instead of asking the participant to rank each benefit\n\nfrom 0 to 10, we show the participant something like the following:\n\nA.\n\nOrders delivered to table in five minutes or less.\nB.\n\nMost entr\u00e9e prices under $20.\n\nCc.\n\nppealing restaurant decor.\n\nD.\n\nLarge variety of menu options.\n\nAfter this set is shown, the participant is asked the following questions:\n\n1.\nWhich of these items is most important?\n2.\nWhich of these items is least important?\n\nOnce the participant answers the questions, another set is shown:\n\nE.\n\nUnique entr\u00e9es | can\u2019t get anywhere else.\n\nF.\n\nKnowing | can always order my favorite dishes.\nG.\n\nPeople are impressed that I dine here.\n\nH.\n\nLarge portions.\n\nRandom question sets containing four or five criteria are provided until\nthere are no more possible combinations or the participant\u2019s attention\nwanders, which often occurs around the five- to ten-minute mark.\n\nIt won\u2019t take the participant long to provide a response to each of these\nsimple questions, but the results are quite revealing. By asking the\n\nparticipant to make an actual choice, you\u2019re collecting more accurate\ninformation about how the participant would respond when faced with a\nsimilar choice in the real world. When the results are aggregated and\nanalyzed, the relative importance of each benefit becomes very clear. The\nmore sets each participant completes, the better you\u2019ll be able to judge the\nrelative importance of each benefit.4\n\nRelative Importance Testing can help you determine which benefits you\nshould focus on to make your offering maximally attractive.\n",

You\u2019ve\nsketched out what the space would look like and you have a rough idea of\nthe different styles you\u2019d like to offer and whom you'd bring in to teach\nclasses.\n\nYou\u2019ve found a suitable location that you can rent for around $10,000\nper month (if you sign a twelve-month lease), and you estimate that you\u2019ll\nneed an additional $12,000 per month to pay employee salaries and other\nmonthly operating expenses. You\u2019ll also need to spend around $5,000 up\nfront for equipment: mats, blocks, and a computer to handle membership\nrecords.\n\nThe commercial real estate agent you\u2019re working with is putting\npressure on you to move fast, saying the location you want may be snatched\nup by another tenant if you don\u2019t commit now. Your current life\u2019s savings\nare enough to cover the start-up costs and three months of projected\noperating expenses. You\u2019re excited, but you want to ensure that you\u2019re\nmaking the right decision before you move forward. Should you sign the\nlease?\n\nStories like this are very common: an excited first-time entrepreneur has\na dream of owning a restaurant, bar, or bookstore, so they invest their life\u2019s\nsavings and take on significant debt to open the new business. Sometimes\nthese stories work out well. More often than not, in a few months the new\nentrepreneur is bankrupt and out of business, wondering how things went so\nterribly wrong.\n\nCritical Assumptions are facts or characteristics that must be true in the\nreal world for your business or offering to be successful. Every business or\noffering has a set of Critical Assumptions that will make or break its\ncontinued existence: if any of these Critical Assumptions turns out to be\nfalse, the business idea will be less promising than it appears.\n\nThe previous yoga studio example has three primary Critical\nAssumptions:\n\n1.\n\nIndividuals in this neighborhood will be willing to commit to pay\n$100 or more per month for a yoga membership close to their home.\n2.\n\nThe business will be able to attract at least 220 members paying full\nprice within three months.\n\n3.\nTotal monthly revenues will exceed $22,000 for the next twelve\nmonths, which is the minimum duration of the lease term.\n\nLet\u2019s examine what would happen to the yoga studio if these Critical\nAssumptions turn out to be false:\n\n1.\n\nInitial interest is high, but most of the people who tour the new\nstudio balk at paying $100 per month, saying that they\u2019d rather drive\na few miles and pay $75. The studio lowers prices to $75, which\nmeans 300 members are now required to keep the studio afloat.\nAfter lowering prices, membership reaches the 220-member mark as\nplanned, but it\u2019s not enough to keep the studio open.\n\n2.\n\nThe studio doesn\u2019t attract enough members to pay the bills because\nyoga enthusiasts in the neighborhood are already locked into\ntwelve-month membership contracts with a studio a few miles away.\nThe studio runs out of money and closes.\n\n3.\n\nA very nice competing studio opens up in the same neighborhood\naround the same time. After three months, the studio only has half\nof the members it needs to sustain itself. With nine more months on\nthe lease, the financial outlook is bleak.\n\nIf you can identify these assumptions in advance and test whether or not\nthey\u2019re true, you\u2019ll take fewer risks and have more confidence in the\nwisdom of your decisions.\n",

The Fitbit device tracks\nyour activity levels throughout the day and night, then uploads your data to\nthe web, where it analyzes your health, fitness, and sleep patterns.\n\nIt\u2019s a neat concept, but creating new hardware is time consuming,\nexpensive, and fraught with risk, so here\u2019s what Friedman and Park did. The\nsame day they announced the Fitbit idea to the world, they started allowing\ncustomers to preorder a Fitbit on their website, based on little more than a\ndescription of what the device would do and a few renderings of what the\nproduct would look like. The billing system collected names, addresses, and\nverified credit card numbers, but no charges were processed until the\nproduct was ready to ship, which gave the company an out in case their\nplans fell through.\n\nOrders started rolling in, and one month later, investors had the\nconfidence to pony up $2 million dollars to make the Fitbit a reality. A year\nlater, the first real Fitbit was shipped to customers. That\u2019s the power of\nShadow Testing.\n",

Fortunately,\nyou don\u2019t have to create the entire offer before you start selling.\n\nA Minimum Viable Offer is an offer that promises and/or provides the\nsmallest number of benefits necessary to produce an actual sale. A\nMinimum Viable Offer is a Prototype that\u2019s been developed to the point that\nsomeone will pull out their wallet and commit to making a purchase. It\ndoesn\u2019t have to be complicated: Fitbit\u2019s Minimum Viable Offer was a\nPrototype, a description, and a few computer renderings. All you need to do\nis convey enough information to convince a real potential customer to buy.\n\nCreating a Minimum Viable Offer is useful because it\u2019s impossible to\npredict with 100 percent accuracy what will work in advance. You don\u2019t\n\nwant to invest a ton of time and money in something that has no chance of\nworking, and the faster you can figure out if your idea will work or not, the\nbetter off you\u2019ll be.\n\nSince Feedback from prospective customers and paid-in-full orders are\nvery different things, creating a Minimum Viable Offer allows you to start\ncollecting data from real customers, testing the idea\u2019s Critical Assumptions,\nand reducing the risk of making a business-ending investment decision.\n\nHere\u2019s how the hypothetical yoga studio we discussed earlier could use a\nMinimum Viable Offer and Shadow Testing to evaluate its Critical\nAssumptions:\n\nStep 1: Create a simple website describing the studio in detail,\nincluding location, tentative schedule, teaching staff, sketches of the\nspace, and membership fees. The site includes a sign-up form for\nvisitors to preorder memberships by submitting their credit card\ninformation. By signing up, members commit to a twelve-month\nmembership when the studio opens, but they have the opportunity to\ncancel within the first month if they don\u2019t like it. If the studio doesn\u2019t\nopen, all preorders are canceled without charge. Total cost: a few\nhundred dollars.\n\nStep 2: Direct prospective customers to the website. This can be done\ninexpensively in any number of ways: flyers, door-to-door inquiry,\ndirect mail, and local search-engine advertising. Total cost: a few\nhundred dollars.\n\nStep 3: Track how many individuals preorder memberships at the full\nrate via the website or request additional information. Total cost: a\nfew hours of analysis.\n\nThis method of testing is simple, fast, and inexpensive. Services like\nKickstarter (www.kickstarter.com) are making tests like these easy: all it\ntakes to allow potential customers to preorder is a video, a few sketches or\nrenderings, and basic sales copy. Spending a few hours and a few hundred\ndollars testing your Critical Assumptions is a very good use of money,\nparticularly if your findings indicate your business idea won\u2019t work.\n\nThe purpose of starting with a Minimum Viable Offer is to minimize\nyour risk. By keeping the investments small, incremental, and learning\n\noriented, you\u2019ll be able to discover what works and what doesn\u2019t. If the idea\nis promising, you\u2019re in a great position to make it happen. If your\nassumptions don\u2019t hold true, you\u2019re able to cut your losses without losing\nyour shirt or your dignity.\n",

The process is simple: keep making and\ntesting additions to the core offer, continue doing what works, and stop\ndoing what doesn\u2019t.\n\nThe process of customizing cars is an example of Incremental\nAugmentation. Starting with a stock car, the tuner replaces and upgrades\nparts: a better engine, a spoiler, tinted windows, and chrome hubcaps. The\nintent of every change is to make the car just a little bit better, until it\u2019s the\nbest it can be. When the car is finished, it\u2019s a different machine.\n\nIncremental Augmentation helps you improve your offering while\nminimizing the risk that any single iteration will fail catastrophically. If\nyou\u2019re not careful, drastic changes after launch can eliminate the qualities\nthat made your offer attractive or break the systems you use to create the\nvalue you\u2019re providing to your customers. By making and testing changes,\nyou can improve your offer without betting the farm, helping you create\neven more value for your customers over time.\n\nKeep in mind that Incremental Augmentation can only take you so far.\nIn order to enter a new market or change the game, you may need to create\n\nin the real world arena it\u2019s intended for . . .

I think it\u2019s a win/win situation.\n\nField Testing has a long and distinguished history in the creation of\nsuccessful businesses. In 1923, W. H. Murphy, of the Protective Garment\nCorporation of New York, had an associate shoot him in the chest with a\npistol in front of a public audience to prove his product worked\u2014a\nmarketing stunt based on extensive Field Testing to verify that the vest was\ncapable of stopping live rounds. Miguel Caballero, a Colombian suit\nmanufacturer who has created bulletproof suits for heads of state like\nBarack Obama and Hugo Chavez, has continued the tradition by posting\nvideos of people wearing his suits being shot point-blank in the stomach.\u00b0\n\nMost major automotive manufacturers put new car designs through on-\nand off-road obstacle courses to test performance and handling in real-\nworld conditions. Software companies like Microsoft and Google\nextensively Field Test their new products internally with employees before\nreleasing them to customers. Testing internally allows the company to\neliminate any bugs before customers ever see the product.\n\nUsing what you make every day is the best way to improve the quality\nof what you\u2019re offering. Nothing will help you find ways to make your offer\nbetter than being its most avid and demanding customer.\n",

Everyone has too many things to do and too\nlittle time to do them all.\n\nRule #1 of marketing is that your potential customer\u2019s available attention\nis limited. Keeping up with everything in your world would require way\nmore attention than you have to work with. To compensate, you filter: you\nration your attention, allocating more to things you care about and less to\nthings you don\u2019t. So does everyone else, including your potential prospects.\nTo get someone\u2019s attention, you have to find a way around their filters.\n\nHigh-quality attention must be earned.

One of the primary functions of\n\nthe human brain is perceptual filtering: determining what to pay attention to\nand what to ignore. The fastest way to be ignored by anyone is to start\ntalking about something they don\u2019t care about.\n\nReceptivity is a measure of how open a person is to your message. Rabid\nfans of hit novel series like J. K. Rowling\u2019s Harry Potter books are paragons\nof Receptivity: they\u2019re interested in almost anything they can find about\ntheir obsession as soon as it\u2019s available. From a business perspective, that\u2019s\nideal\u2014it\u2019s difficult to offer something that this audience won\u2019t want.\n\nReceptivity has two primary components: what and when. People tend to\nbe receptive only to certain categories of things at certain times. I love\nhearing about interesting new business books, but I never want to be on the\nreceiving end of a 3:00 a.m. phone call from a publicist.\n\nIf you want your message to be heard, the medium matters. The form of\nyour message has a big influence on how receptive people are to the\ninformation that message contains. If the form of your message suggests\nthat it was created just for them, you\u2019re far more likely to get your\nprospect\u2019s attention.\n\nHere\u2019s an example: Almost everyone will ignore postal junk mail\u2014if it\nlooks commercial or mass-produced, there\u2019s a 99 percent chance the\nrecipient will throw it away without a second thought. Change the form,\nhowever, and Receptivity changes as well: most people will at least open a\nhand-addressed envelope, since it\u2019s clear someone spent time and effort\nsending it to them. Taken to an extreme, almost everyone (including busy\nexecutives) will open and look through the contents of a large, hand-\naddressed, overnight FedEx envelope\u2014it\u2019s big and expensive and requires\n\neffort to send.

They don\u2019t ask\nme because they\u2019re fashionable: they ask me because they\u2019re weird.\n\nVibram FiveFingers are shoes that look like a cross between a sock and a\nglove. Wearing them makes you look a bit like a frog: each toe has its own\nlittle pocket, giving your feet a slightly amphibian look\u2014odd enough to be\nnoticed.\n\nI picked up a pair of FiveFingers to experiment with barefoot running\u2014\nthe thin rubber sole protects your feet from rocks and glass without adding\nany unnecessary support, which lets your feet do what they\u2019re designed to\ndo. Running or walking in FiveFingers is fun, which is why I keep wearing\nthem.\n\nFiveFingers are just strange enough that people can\u2019t help but notice\nyour feet when you wear them\u2014they violate expectations of what shoes are\nsupposed to look like. As a result, people ask me about them\u2014even in as\n\u201cunfriendly\u201d a place as the streets of New York City. By the end of the\nconversation, I\u2019ve told my new acquaintance what they are, why I\u2019m\nwearing them, how much they cost, and where they can purchase them.\n\nFiveFingers are designed to overcome the number one problem every\nnew offering faces: if no one knows you exist, no one will buy what you\nhave to sell. Every customer who wears a pair of FiveFingers provides\nVibram all of the advertising they need to keep growing\u2014for free.\n\nFrom a business perspective, the Attention-grabbing design of\nFiveFingers is working beautifully. On the street, salespeople confirm that\nFiveFingers are flying off the shelves\u2014new stock sells out almost\nimmediately. According to the New York Times,* sales of the FiveFingers\nline have tripled every year since they were introduced in 2006, and in 2009\n\nthe company\u2019s revenue crossed the $10 million mark in North America\u2014\nwithout mass-market advertising. Not bad for funny-looking frog shoes.\n\nRemarkability is the best way to attract Attention. In the classic marketing\nbook Purple Cow, Seth Godin uses a wonderful metaphor to illustrate this\nprinciple: A field full of brown cows is boring. A purple cow violates the\nviewer\u2019s expectations, which attracts Attention and interest.\n\nIf you design your offer to be Remarkable\u2014unique enough to pique\nyour prospect\u2019s curiosity\u2014it\u2019lI be significantly easier to attract attention.\n",

Whatever you\u2019re offering, I\ncan guarantee you that most of the people in this world don\u2019t\u2014and will\nnever\u2014care about what you\u2019re doing. Harsh but true.\n\nFortunately, you don\u2019t have to appeal to everyone in order to succeed.\nYou just have to attract enough Attention to close enough sales to produce\nenough profit to keep going.

Harley\u2019s most profitable customers are \u201cweekend warriors\u201d\u2014\nmiddle-aged men with disposable income who want to feel powerful and\ndangerous while cruising around in their spare time.

If you want to attract Attention in a way that produces\nresults, you need to be sensitive to how much your Probable Purchasers know\nand care about what you have to offer.\n\nIn Breakthrough Advertising, Eugene Schwartz suggests that prospects\nexperience five distinct Levels of Awareness during the marketing and sales\nprocess:\n\n1.\n\nUnaware\u2014the prospect is not aware of any need or desire for what\nyou have to offer.\n\n2.\n\nProblem Awareness\u2014the prospect knows they have a need or desire,\nbut they aren\u2019t aware of any suitable solutions.\n\n3.\n\nSolution Awareness\u2014the prospect knows that potential solutions\nexist, but they aren\u2019t aware of your specific offer.\n\n4.\n\nOffer Awareness\u2014the prospect is aware of your offer, but they\u2019re\nnot sure it\u2019s right for them.\n\n5.\n\nFull Awareness\u2014the prospect is convinced your offer is a good\nsolution to their need or desire, they just need to know the price and\n\nterms so they can decide whether or not to purchase.\n\nYour approach to attracting Attention depends on your prospect\u2019s current\nLevel of Awareness, and your objective with each marketing contact is to\nmove the prospect to a higher Level of Awareness over time.\n\nIf your prospect is not aware of any need or desire for your offer, the\nprospect won\u2019t be Receptive to information about the benefits or price\u2014as\nfar as they\u2019re concerned, your marketing is irrelevant noise. In the same\nway, marketing that focuses too much on the problem or the benefits of\nyour solution is annoying to prospects who are at the full-awareness stage:\nthey\u2019re ready to make a decision, so cutting to the chase is the optimal\nstrategy. Targeting potential customers at specific Levels of Awareness\nmakes it easier to create a compelling message.\n\nThis approach extends into the sales process. Education-Based Selling\nhelps the prospect understand why purchasing is in their best interest and\nhow they can derive benefits from the Transaction.\n\nLevels of Awareness create what many marketers refer to as a \u201cfunnel.\u201d\nYour initial marketing efforts create awareness of the offer, but most initial\nprospects won\u2019t purchase for various reasons. As prospects move through\nthe various Levels of Awareness, they\u2019re more likely to move from your\nmarketing to your sales process, resulting in an eventual purchase.\n",

Demonstration increases a prospect\u2019s\nbelief in the benefits of your offer by showing them how well it works.\n\nDemonstration is one of the oldest and most effective marketing\ntechniques; it\u2019s been used to change public opinion for centuries. The\nBrooklyn Bridge opened in 1883, but pedestrians didn\u2019t trust the structure\n\u2014it was the longest suspension bridge in the world at the time, and the first\nbridge that crossed the East River. Early users were nervous.\n\nSix days after the Brooklyn Bridge opened to the public, a woman\nslipped on the stairs that led up to the bridge. The commotion caused a mass\npanic, the pedestrian equivalent of theatergoers rushing to the exits to\nescape a fire. Twelve people died, seven sustained life-threatening injuries,\nand twenty-eight were wounded in the stampede.?\n\nFollowing this public-relations crisis, the city allowed P. T. Barnum, the\nfamed circus showman, to parade twenty-one elephants and seventeen\ncamels across the bridge. The bridge didn\u2019t waver, and public confidence\nwas restored: if the Brooklyn Bridge could accommodate a score of five-ton\nelephants, it could handle pedestrian traffic.*\n\nMany of the most profitable businesses of the twentieth century were\nbuilt using Demonstration as the primary marketing strategy. Consider the\ngolden age of infomercials: Billy Mays sold more than $1 billion dollars of\nhome products like OxiClean, Mighty Putty, Orange Glo, and Kaboom via\ndirect-response television advertisements.\u2018 Billy\u2019s over-the-top enthusiasm\nwas effective in overcoming the viewer\u2019s Preoccupation and natural impulse\nto change the channel, but watching Billy restore a grimy floor or a stained\nshirt to its original glory made the cash registers ring. Viewers didn\u2019t have\nto take Billy\u2019s word for how well the product performed: they could see the\nresults for themselves.\n\nDemonstration can go a long way in establishing belief in your offer\u2019s\nability to help the prospect. Whenever possible, don\u2019t tell your prospects\nwhat you can do to help: show them.\n",

Not every\ncustomer is a good customer: customers who require more time, energy,\nattention, or risk than they\u2019re worth to your bottom line aren\u2019t worth\nattracting in the first place.\n\nQualification is the process of determining whether or not a prospect is a\ngood customer before they purchase from you. By evaluating a prospect\nbefore they buy, you can minimize the chance of wasting your time dealing\nwith a customer who\u2019s not a good fit for your business.\n\nProgressive Insurance has turned Qualification into a profitable business\nstrategy. To see Qualification in action, go to the Progressive Insurance\n\nwebsite? and request a quote for car insurance.\n\nWhen you request a quote, Progressive asks you a set of basic questions:\n\n1.\n\nWhat type of car do you have?\n\n2.\n\nDo you own or lease it? If you own it, are you still making\npayments?\n\n3.\n\nWhat\u2019s your ZIP code?\n\n4.\n\nAre you married?\n\n5.\n\nDid you go to college?\n\n6.\n\nHave you had any at-fault accidents in the past five years?\n\nProgressive then uses your answers to gather data from a series of\ndatabases to answer two questions:\n\nA.\nAre you the type of person Progressive wants to insure?\n\nB.\nIf so, how much should they charge to insure you?\n\nIf you\u2019re the type of person Progressive wants as a customer, they\u2019ll\nquote you a price and encourage you to purchase an insurance policy. If\nyou\u2019re not, Progressive will tell you that you can get a better price\nelsewhere and encourage you to purchase insurance from one of their\ncompetitors.\n\nWhy in the world would a business encourage a hot prospect to purchase\nfrom the competition? As you recall from our previous discussion of\nInsurance, the profitability of an insurer depends on collecting as much\nmoney as possible in premiums while paying out as little money as possible\nin claims.\n\nProgressive doesn\u2019t want to maximize its total client base: it wants to\ninsure only people who are likely to drive safely and have few accidents,\nwhich means attracting customers who will pay premiums for a long time\nwithout making claims. Qualification allows Progressive to maximize the\nnumber of highly profitable customers it insures while funneling the \u201cbad\nrisks\u201d to its competitors. It\u2019s good for customers as well\u2014if they\u2019re \u201cgood\nrisks,\u201d they get lower rates on their car insurance.\n\nScreening your customers can help you filter out the bad customers\nbefore they do business with you. The better you define your ideal\ncustomer, the better you can screen out the prospects who don\u2019t fit that\ndescription and the more you\u2019ll be able to focus on serving your best\ncustomers well.\n",

Contrary to\npopular belief, the Amish don\u2019t reject every modern technology: they\ndecide whether or not a technology is permitted based on whether it\nstrengthens or weakens their local community.\u00ae Pneumatic and steam\nsystems are common, and many Amish manufacturing businesses use\nsophisticated power tools. Even so, that doesn\u2019t make them a prime target\nfor salespeople: making the sale requires visiting each prospect in their\nlocal community, making the sale in person, and being willing to deliver to\n\nand support customers in rural environments. That\u2019s a lot of work for a\nsingle sale, so most marketers and salespeople don\u2019t bother.\n\nAddressability is a measure of how easy it is to get in touch with people\nwho might want what you\u2019re offering. A highly Addressable audience can\nbe reached with little effort and cost. A non-Addressable audience can be\nreached only with extreme difficulty or isn\u2019t Receptive and doesn\u2019t want to\nbe reached at all.\n\nYoga is a good example of a highly Addressable market. It\u2019s relatively\neasy to find places where people are already paying attention to yoga-\nrelated information: studios, popular magazines like Yoga Journal,\nconferences, websites, etc. Yoga is a $16 billion industry, and you can tap\ninto some or all of these outlets to help yogis and yoginis learn more about\nwhat you have to offer.\n\nSensitive or embarrassing topics tend to have low Addressability, even if\nthere\u2019s a huge need. Chronic medical conditions are a good example: it\u2019s\ndifficult to find and reach a large group of people who suffer from an\nuncomfortable and potentially embarrassing condition like psoriasis or\nulcerative colitis. People suffering from these conditions don\u2019t gather in the\nsame place or read the same things, and many will avoid being publicly\nidentified as sufferers by joining organizations, so it\u2019s hard to find and talk\nto them.\n\nDoctors, on the other hand, are more Addressable: they have publicly\nlisted addresses and phone numbers, and are willing and able to meet with\ndrug company representatives about new offerings. Since each doctor sees\nmany patients and acts as a gatekeeper for prescription medications,\npharmaceutical companies spend so much time and money marketing to\nMDs.\n\nThe internet has improved the Addressability of most markets. People\nwho have a sensitive medical condition are highly likely to search for\ninformation on the internet, where they are Addressable via advertising.\nBlogs, discussion boards, and databases like WebMD make it easier for\npeople who don\u2019t know one another to share their experiences and\nknowledge, making these low-Addressability markets more accessible than\never before.\n\nAddressability is a huge concern when you are developing a new offer.\nIf you have a choice, it\u2019s far better to focus on building something for an\n\nAddressable audience than it is to go around and hand sell or try to address\nan audience that is not Addressable or doesn\u2019t want to be addressed.\n\nIf you choose to serve an Addressable market before committing to an\noffer, it\u2019ll be significantly easier to market your offer without breaking the\nbank.\n",

In\norder for a prospect to be willing to pay you good money for what you\u2019re\noffering, they must want what you have. If your marketing activities don\u2019t\nproduce some visceral feeling of Desire in your prospects, you\u2019re wasting\nyour time and money.\n\nProvoking Desire is the part of marketing that makes most people\nuncomfortable. It\u2019s understandable: pop culture is enamored with the image\nof the marketer as a shadowy master manipulator, hypnotizing the masses\ninto wanting things they don\u2019t want or need. Nothing could be further from\nthe truth.\n\nHere\u2019s the reality: it\u2019s almost impossible to make someone want\nsomething they don\u2019t already desire. Yes, it\u2019s possible to be scammy and\nmanipulative if you misrepresent what you\u2019re offering or promise\nsomething you can\u2019t deliver. Don\u2019t mistake that for brainwashing: the\nquickest way to waste a multimillion-dollar advertising budget is to try to\nforce people to want something they don\u2019t already want. The human mind\ndoesn\u2019t work that way\u2014we only purchase what we already desire on some\nlevel.\n\nThe essence of effective marketing is discovering what people already\nwant, then presenting your offer in a way that intersects with that\npreexisting Desire. The best marketing is similar to Education-Based Selling:\nit shows the prospect how the offer will help them achieve what they desire.\nYour job as a marketer isn\u2019t to convince people to want what you\u2019re\n\noffering; it\u2019s to help your prospects convince themselves that what you\u2019re\noffering will help them get what they want.\n\nSo what do people want? We\u2019ve already covered that: the Core Human\nDrives are a starting point that will help you discover what your market\nwants at the most basic level. The more drives you can connect with your\noffering, the more effective your marketing activities will be.\n",

The test drive is the most effective tool a salesperson has\nto convince you to purchase a car that day.\n\nUntil you\u2019re driving a car, it\u2019s much easier to treat a potential purchase\nin a detached way. You\u2019re capable of rationally comparing makes and\nmodels, features, and prices. You can convince yourself that you\u2019re \u201cjust\nlooking,\u201d with no intention of purchasing anything just yet.\n\nOnce you\u2019re behind the wheel of a car, however, the emotional parts of\nyour mind take control. You start to imagine what your life would be like if\nyou owned this vehicle. Instead of dispassionately comparing horsepower\nand acceleration metrics, you can feel the power of the engine and the ease\nof handling, and you can imagine the respect (or envy) of your neighbors as\nyou pull your attractive new vehicle into the driveway.\n\nYou\u2019ve stopped comparing and started wanting. Once you start wanting,\nyou\u2019 ll probably buy\u2014 it\u2019s only a matter of time.\n\nB&H Photo Video uses the same strategy in a different market. Roaming\nthe aisles of their Manhattan superstore is an intense sensory experience.\nYou can feel the weight of the camera you\u2019re considering, see the buttons\nand dials up close, and hear the snap of the shutter. Better yet, you can\ncompare the feel of each camera to hundreds of others, all within arm\u2019s\n\nreach. It\u2019s little wonder B&H is one of the most successful photography\nretailers in the world\u2014after test-driving a few cameras, it\u2019s difficult to resist\nthe urge to take one home.\n\nThe most effective way to get people to want something is to encourage\nthem to use Visualization\u2014to picture what their life would be like if they\naccepted your offer. As we\u2019ll discuss later, in Mental Simulation, our minds\nare designed to imagine the consequences of our actions. You can use this\nnatural tendency to your advantage by helping your prospects imagine the\npositive experiences they\u2019ll have.\n\nIf you encourage your prospects to Visualize what their life will look\nlike after purchasing, you increase the probability that they\u2019Il purchase from\nyou. The best way to help your customers Visualize is to expose them to as\nmuch sensory information as possible\u2014the information their mind uses to\nconclude, \u201cI want this.\u201d\n",

                        "extracted-text": "na famous experiment conducted by psychologists Amos Tversky and\nDaniel Kahneman, participants were asked to make a decision about\nadministering medical treatment to a sick population of six hundred people.\nParticipants in the study were given two options: Treatment A would save\ntwo hundred lives. Treatment B had a 33 percent chance of saving all six\nhundred people and a 66 percent possibility of saving no one.\n\nTreatment A and Treatment B are mathematically identical\u2014when you\ndo the math, there\u2019s no difference in the expected outcome. The study\nresults, however, revealed a clear psychological preference: 72 percent of\nparticipants chose Treatment A, while 28 percent of the participants chose\nTreatment B.\n\nThe experiment was then repeated with two different treatment options.\nTreatment C would result in four hundred deaths. Treatment D offered a 33\npercent chance that no one would die but a 66 percent probability that all\n\nsix hundred would die. Participants overwhelmingly preferred Treatment D,\n78 percent to 22 percent.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting to note is that Treatments A and C are also\nstatistically identical, but A was overwhelmingly preferred while C was not.\nContemplating lives saved versus fatalities significantly altered the\npreferences of the people making decisions, even though the expected\noutcomes were the same. We\u2019ll explore one of the reasons for this\npreference in Loss Aversion, but for now, let\u2019s focus on how the emphasis of\nthe various messages changed the results.\n\nFraming is the act of emphasizing the details that are important while de-\nemphasizing things that aren\u2019t by either minimizing certain facts or leaving\nthem out entirely. Proper use of Framing can help you present your offer\npersuasively while honoring your customer\u2019s time and attention.\n\nFraming is a natural part of communication; some form of compression\nin any message is inevitable. It\u2019s not practical to include all of the facts and\ncontext when communicating with others\u2014we emphasize some details and\nleave out others to save time. We Frame because we have to: otherwise, it\nwould take a huge amount of time to communicate even the simplest\ninformation to other people. It would take two hours to order a pizza, as you\ntold the person at the other end of the line not only the size and toppings\nyou wanted but how you got their phone number and why on this particular\nevening you were in the mood for pizza, not hamburgers or sushi.\n\nSince Framing is an ever-present part of communication, it pays to be\nconscious of it. By being mindful of what you\u2019re emphasizing and what\nyou\u2019re minimizing, you can communicate the benefits of your offer to your\nprospects in a clear and concise way, which maximizes your persuasive\npower.\n\nFraming is not the same as lying or being deceitful. Honesty is always\nthe best policy, and not just from a moral perspective. Misrepresenting your\noffer may net a few more sales in the short term, but it increases the\nprobability that your customer\u2019s expectations will be violated, decreasing\ntheir satisfaction and permanently harming your Reputation, which we\u2019ll\ndiscuss later in the Expectation Effect.\n\nUsing Framing to your advantage will allow you to communicate the\nbenefits of your offer to your Probable Purchasers persuasively, as long as\nyou don\u2019t leave out information that your customers have a right to know.\n",

Unsolicited phone calls, press releases, mass-market\nadvertising, and \u201cresident\u201d-addressed direct mail are the most common\nlegal equivalents of spam: blanketing a huge, undifferentiated group of\npeople with a standard message in the hopes that a tiny fraction will\nrespond.\n\nIn the early days of television and radio advertising, commercial\ninterruptions worked. When there were only three channels, people were\nmore likely to pay Attention during the commercials. By purchasing a\nsingle thirty-second prime-time advertising slot on each of the three major\nnetworks, you could reach 90 percent of the television-watching population\nin a single day.\n\nNow, people have the ability to filter out anything they don\u2019t want to pay\nAttention to, either by ignoring the offending message or by shifting their\nAttention to something else. The moment you start talking about something\nyour prospects don\u2019t care about, they\u2019re gone.\n\nAsking for Permission to follow up after providing Free value is more\neffective than interruption. Offering genuine value earns your prospect\u2019s\nAttention, and asking for Permission gives you the opportunity to focus on\ncommunicating with people you know are interested in what you have to\noffer.\n\nPermission is a real asset. Reaching new people tends to be difficult and\nexpensive. It\u2019s far easier to follow up with someone you already know\u2014all\nit takes is an email, a letter, or a phone call, all of which are easy and\ninexpensive. If you ask the new prospects you meet for Permission to\nfollow up, you\u2019re making the most of your outreach activities.\n\nThe best way to get Permission is to ask for it. Whenever you provide\nvalue to people, ask them if it\u2019s okay to continue to give them more value in\nthe future. Over time, your list of prospective customers will grow, and the\nlarger it grows, the higher the likelihood you\u2019ll start landing more sales.\n\nUse Permission once you have it, but don\u2019t abuse the privilege. Getting\nPermission to follow up never gives you carte blanche to send them\nanything you like. Before asking your prospects for Permission to follow\nup, make it clear what they\u2019ll be getting and how it\u2019ll benefit them.\n\nIf you honor your commitments by continually providing value and\nrefraining from spamming your prospects with irrelevant information,\nyou\u2019 ll have a powerful asset that can help you build a deeper relationship\nwith the people who are interested in what you\u2019re offering.\n",

When paired with the book\u2019s cover\nimage of a guy relaxing in a hammock on a tropical beach, the title goes a\nlong way in convincing people to purchase and read the book.\n\nApple used a Hook for the launch of the iPod: \u201c1,000 songs in your\npocket.\u201d At the time, portable music players consisted of bulky CD and\ncassette players, and advertising for early MP3 players focused on geek\nspeak: megabytes of disk space. Apple\u2019s Hook highlighted the primary\nbenefit: instead of carrying around hundreds of tapes or CDs, you could\ncarry your entire music collection in one elegant device.\n\nApple\u2019s five-word tag line worked wonders. In a little under a year,\n236,000 first-generation iPods were sold\u2014an astounding start, considering\nthis was the company\u2019s first foray into the portable music category. The\nHook grabbed Attention, and the quality of the product closed the sale.\n\nWhen creating a Hook, focus on the primary benefit or value your offer\nprovides. Emphasize what\u2019s uniquely valuable about your offer and why the\nprospect should care. Brainstorm a list of words and phrases related to your\nprimary benefit, then experiment with different ways to connect them in a\nshort phrase. Crafting a Hook is a creative exercise\u2014the more potential\noptions you generate, the faster you\u2019ll find one that works.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve created your Hook, use it! Place it on your website, your\nadvertising, your business cards\u2014make it one of the first things potential\ncustomers see. The Hook grabs Attention, and the remainder of your\nmarketing and sales activities close the deal.\n\nThe better your Hook, the more Attention you\u2019ll grab, and the easier it\u2019II\nbe for your satisfied customers to tell their friends about you.\n",

If you want your prospects to take\nthe next step you\u2019re encouraging, you need to tell them what you want them\nto do. The most effective marketing messages give the recipient or prospect\na single, clear, very short action to take next.\n\nThink about a roadside billboard that says something like \u201cTony\u2019s\nHamburgers Are the Best.\u201d What will people who see that message do?\nNothing, probably. In all likelihood, the billboard is a waste of time and\nmoney.\n\nGive them a Call to Action (CTA) such as \u201cTake Exit 25 and Turn Right for\nthe Best Burgers in Town,\u201d and soon Tony will be serving more hamburgers\nto hungry travelers.\n\nA Call to Action directs your prospects to take a single, simple, obvious\naction: Visit a website. Enter an email address. Call a phone number. Mail a\nself-addressed, stamped envelope. Click a button. Purchase a product. Tell a\nfriend.\n\nThe key to presenting an effective Call to Action is to be as clear,\nsimple, and obvious as you can. The more compelling your proposal, the\nhigher the probability your prospect will do what you suggest.\n\nIf you\u2019re encouraging someone to enter their email address to sign up for\na newsletter, say that verbatim multiple times, and make it clear where the\n\nemail address field is, why they should fill it out, what to click once they\u2019ve\nentered their email, and what they can expect to happen when they do. If\nyou think you\u2019re being too obvious, you\u2019re doing it right.\n\nThe best Calls to Action ask either for the sale or for Permission to follow\nup. Making direct sales is optimal, since it makes it easy to figure out\nwhether or not your marketing activities are cost-effective. Asking for\nPermission is the next best thing, since it allows you to follow up with your\nprospects over time, decreasing your marketing costs and increasing the\nprobability of an eventual sale.\n\nEnsure that every message you create has a clear Call to Action, and\nyou\u2019 ll increase the effectiveness of your marketing activities.\n",

Telling stories\nis a universal human experience, and stories have always been used in the\nconduct of trade. A good story will make even the best offer even better.\n\nMost compelling Narratives around the world follow a common format.\nThe world-renowned mythologist Joseph Campbell called this prototypical\nstoryline the \u201cHero\u2019s Journey\u201d or the \u201cmonomyth.\u201d People all over the\nworld respond very strongly to this story motif, and you can use this basic\nformat to craft and tell your own stories.\n\nThe Hero\u2019s Journey begins by introducing the Hero: a normal person\nwho is experiencing the trials and tribulations of everyday life. The Hero\nthen receives a \u201ccall to adventure\u201d: a challenge, quest, or responsibility that\nrequires them to rise above their normal existence and hone their skills and\nabilities in order to prevail.\n\nWhen the Hero accepts the call, they depart their normal experience and\nenter into a world of uncertainty and adventure. A series of remarkable\nexperiences initiates them into this new world, and the Hero undergoes\nmany trials and learns many secrets in the pursuit of ultimate success.\n\nAfter persevering in the face of adversity and vanquishing the foe, the\nHero receives a mighty gift or power, then returns to the normal world to\nshare this knowledge, wisdom, or treasure with the people. In return, the\nHero receives the respect and admiration of all.\n\nYour customers want to be Heroes. They want to be respected and\nadmired by all, to be powerful, successful, and determined in the face of\nadversity. They want to be inspired by the trials and tribulations of other\npeople who have come before and vanquished the foe. Telling a story about\npeople who have already walked the path your prospects are considering is\na powerful way to make them interested in proceeding.\n\nTestimonials, case studies, and other stories are effective in encouraging\nyour prospects to accept your \u201ccall to adventure.\u201d By telling stories about\nthe customers who have come before, you grab your prospect\u2019s Attention and\nshow them a path to achieve what they want. The more vivid, clear, and\nemotionally compelling the story, the more prospects you'll attract.\n\nTell your prospective customers the stories they\u2019re interested in hearing\nand you\u2019ll grab their Attention.\n",

Used constructively, Controversy can be an\neffective way to attract Attention: people start talking, engaging, and paying\nAttention to your position, which is a very good thing.\n\nThe Personal MBA itself is a good example of the power of positive\nControversy. The Personal MBA is about fundamental business principles\n\u2014what you need to understand about business in order to succeed. I believe\nthat anyone can learn whatever they need to know about business on their\nown terms, without mortgaging their future earnings by enrolling in a\ntraditional MBA program.\n\nSome people vehemently disagree with that position\u2014particularly\ngraduates of Ivy League business-school programs. MBA graduates and\n\ncandidates are often quite vocal in their disagreement, which usually takes\nthe form of denouncing the Personal MBA approach to business education\non their own websites or publicly disagreeing with me by leaving comments\non my website.\n\nThat\u2019s not a bad thing: this consistent level of mild Controversy has\nallowed the Personal MBA to grow year after year without paid advertising.\nBy making their thoughts known, the Personal MBA\u2019s detractors are\nspreading the word to people who may not have been aware that there are\nalternatives to traditional business-school programs.\n\nThe Controversy leads many new people to investigate and examine the\nPersonal MBA and make up their own minds about its usefulness. More\nthan a few of them stick around, read my Free content, then decide to\npurchase a book, take a course, or hire me as a consultant. As long as my\ndetractors keep things civil, I welcome the disagreement.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to have an opinion and take a strong stand. Everyone has a\nnatural tendency to want other people to like them, and disagreement is\noften uncomfortable. In an effort to be unobjectionable, it\u2019s easy to water\ndown your opinions to the point where they offend no one. If your position\nis agreeable to everyone, it becomes so boring that no one will pay\nAttention to you.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to support a position that not everyone else supports. It\u2019s okay\nto disagree with someone, or to call someone out, or to position yourself\nagainst something, because Controversy provokes a discussion. Discussion\nis Attention, which is a very good thing if you want to attract people who\nwill benefit from what you\u2019re doing.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say all Controversy is good Controversy: there\u2019s a fine line\nbetween being constructively controversial and creating a soap opera.\nControversy with a purpose is valuable; Controversy for the sake of\nControversy, or Controversy that belittles and demeans, is not. Controversy\nwon\u2019t help you if you lose sight of the purpose behind your actions.\n\nAs long as you\u2019re able to maintain a sense of the bigger picture of how\nyou\u2019re trying to help, creating a bit of Controversy can be a very effective\ntool in encouraging people to seek out more information about what you\u2019re\ndoing.\n",

There\u2019s nothing magical or complex\nabout building a brand: when business professionals say they want to\n\u201cenhance their brand\u201d or \u201cbuild brand equity,\u201d they almost always mean\n\u201cimprove their reputation.\u201d\n\nReputation is what people think about a particular offer or company.\nReputations arise whenever people talk to one another. Some products and\nservices are worth the price; others are not. Some experiences are worth\nhaving; others are not. Some people are good to work with; others are not.\nNo one wants to waste their time or money, so people pay very close\nattention to what others say about things they\u2019re interested in.\n\nBuilding a strong Reputation is valuable: people are often willing to pay\na premium for a good Reputation. One of the reasons well-known consumer\nbrands like Tide and Crest can continue to charge premium prices in near-\ncommodity categories is the strength of their Reputation. Potential\ncustomers want to feel certain that the purchase they\u2019re considering will\nbenefit them, that others will think highly of their decision, and that they\nwon\u2019t be wasting their money. As the venerable corporate saying goes, \u201cNo\none ever got fired for buying IBM.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that your Reputation is not under your direct\ncontrol\u2014it\u2019s the sum total of what others think about everything you do: the\nproducts you release, the advertising you promote, the customer service you\nprovide. No matter how hard you try, you can\u2019t \u201cmanage\u201d your Reputation\n\u2014you can only try to improve it over time by making people glad they\nchose to do business with you.\n\nAlways remember that the marketplace is the final arbiter of your\nReputation, and that it\u2019s always watching what you do. When you build a\ngreat Reputation, your customers will continue to do business with you and\nwill refer you to others because they think highly of you (and because\nreferring friends to good products and services is a way to build their own\n\nReputations). Building your Reputation takes time and effort, but it\u2019s the\nmost effective kind of marketing there is.\n",

If I\nhave something you want and you have something I want, we\u2019d both be\nbetter off if we agreed to trade.\n\nThe Transaction is the defining moment of every business. Sales are the\nonly point in the business cycle where resources flow into the business,\nwhich makes completing Transactions essential for the continued existence\nof the venture. Businesses survive by bringing in more money than they\nspend, and there\u2019s no way to do that without completing Transactions.\n\nYou can only transact with things that are Economically Valuable. If you\ndon\u2019t have anything your prospective customers want, they won\u2019t buy from\nyou. This may seem obvious, but it\u2019s amazing how many prospective\nbusinesspeople enter the market without something the market wants.\nThat\u2019s why developing and testing a Minimum Viable Offer is so important: it\u2019s\nthe best way to determine whether or not you\u2019ve created something\nvaluable enough to sell before you invest your life savings.\n\nWhen you\u2019re starting a new business, the object is to make your first\nprofitable Transaction: that\u2019s the point where you transition from being a\nproject to being a business.

How can you be sure I won\u2019t just take the money and disappear?\n\nYou can\u2019t, which is why you shouldn\u2019t cut me (or anyone else) a check\nfor a villa on the Mediterranean you\u2019ve never seen.\n\nLet\u2019s reverse the situation: let\u2019s assume I\u2019m capable of building this\nvilla, and you\u2019re interested in purchasing one. Would it be smart for me to\npurchase land, break ground, and start building before I\u2019m sure you have\nthe money to pay for it? Probably not\u2014if the deal falls through, I\u2019d have to\nfind another customer or eat the cost.\n\nWithout a certain amount of Trust between parties, a Transaction will not\ntake place. No matter what promises are made or how good the deal sounds,\nno customer is going to be willing to part with their hard-earned money\nunless they believe you\u2019re capable of delivering what you promise.\nLikewise, it\u2019s usually not smart to accept credit or IOUs from customers\nyou don\u2019t know.\n\nBuilding a trustworthy Reputation over time by dealing fairly and\nhonestly is the best way to build Trust. You can also take steps to signal\nyou\u2019re trustworthy: online reviews, credit and background check services,\nand financial arrangements like escrow accounts exist to help overcome an\ninitial lack of Trust between parties in a Transaction. These offerings break\ndown an important mutual barrier to completing a sale: without these\nindicators of trustworthiness, many Transactions would never take place.\n\nThe easier it is to demonstrate your trustworthiness and verify that the\nother party is trustworthy, the greater the chance of a successful\nTransaction.\n",

Think of your available options as a circle that surrounds you. Your\nprospects have a circle of available options as well. Your job is to find\nwhere those circles overlap, which is much easier if you understand what\n\nyour Probable Purchasers want or need.\n\nConsider the job you\u2019re currently in, or the last one you held. Chances\nare, you accepted that job because you were willing to take on certain\nresponsibilities, and your employer was interested in having you do the\nwork. You were interested in being paid a certain amount, and your\nemployer was willing to pay you at least that much. Your interests\noverlapped, which resulted in a job offer and a paid position at the\ncompany. That\u2019s Common Ground.\n\nThe same thing happens every time you purchase something from a\nretail business. They have a Product you want to own; you have a certain\namount of money they are willing to accept for the Product. If you don\u2019t\nwant the Product or the retailer wants more than you\u2019re willing to pay, no\nTransaction will take place.\n\nCommon Ground is a precondition of any type of Transaction. Without\nany areas of overlapping interest, there\u2019s no reason for a prospect to choose\nto work with you. After all, it wouldn\u2019t make sense to pay more for\nsomething than it\u2019s worth to you. Why expect your prospects to accept your\noffer if it\u2019s not in their best interest?\n\nAligning interests is critical to finding Common Ground. Sales isn\u2019t\nabout convincing somebody to do something that\u2019s not in their best interest.\nIdeally, you should want what your prospects want: the satisfaction of their\ndesire or the resolution of their problem. The more your interests are\naligned with your prospect\u2019s, the more they\u2019! Trust your ability to give them\nwhat they want.\n\nThere are always many paths to a successful Transaction, which is the\nessence of negotiation. Negotiation is the process of exploring different\noptions to find Common Ground: the more potential paths you explore, the\ngreater the chance you\u2019ll be able to find one on which your interests\noverlap. The more open you are to potential options, the higher the\nlikelihood you\u2019ll find an area of Common Ground that\u2019s acceptable for all\nparties involved.\n",

There's a price to pay if you want to make things\nbetter, a price to pay just for leaving things as they are. a price for everything.\n\n\u2014HARRY BROWNE, AUTHOR OF FAIL-SAFE INVESTING\n\n0 ne of the most fascinating parts of sales is what I call the Pricing\nUncertainty Principle: all prices are arbitrary and malleable. Pricing is always\nan executive decision. If you want to try to sell a small rock for $350\nmillion, you can. If you want to quadruple that price or reduce it to $0.10 an\nhour later, there\u2019s nothing stopping you. Any price can be set to any level at\nany time, without limitation.\n\nThe Pricing Uncertainty Principle has an important corollary: you must\nbe able to support your asking price before a customer will accept it. In\ngeneral, people prefer to pay as little as possible to acquire the things they\nwant (with some notable exceptions, which we\u2019l! discuss later, in Social\nStatus). If you expect people to pay you good money to buy what you\u2019re\noffering, you must be able to provide a Reason Why the offered price is\nworth paying.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to support a price of $350 million for a rock\u2014unless that\nrock is the Hope diamond, a 45.5-carat deep-blue diamond with a long and\ndistinguished history.\n\nThe Hope diamond is currently owned by the Smithsonian National\nMuseum of Natural History and is not for sale. If the Smithsonian decided\nto sell the Hope diamond, however, they could set an asking price of $1\nbillion. What\u2019s to stop them?\n\nAuctions are an example of the Pricing Uncertainty Principle at work\u2014\nprices change, rising in proportion to how many people are interested and\nhow much they\u2019re each willing to spend.\n\nBecause they set a low starting price and allow potential buyers to bid\nagainst one another, auctions are often an efficient way to establish a true\nmarket price for something that is difficult to reproduce and for which no\ncomparable items already exist in the market. That\u2019s why rare items like the\nHope diamond\u2014if they\u2019re sold\u2014are sold at auction. The most expensive\ndiamond ever sold was the rough, 507.5-carat Cullinan Heritage diamond,\nwhich went for $35.3 million at auction. Not bad for a rock.\n",

Value\nfor cash.\n\n\u2014PATRICK CAMPBELL, COFOUNDER AND CEO, PROFITWELL\n\nL et\u2019s assume for a moment you own a house you\u2019re willing to sell. The\n\nPricing Uncertainty Principle says the price could be anything\u2014you have to set\nit yourself, since houses don\u2019t come with built-in price tags. Let\u2019s also\nassume you\u2019d prefer to sell the house for as much as possible. How would\nyou go about setting the largest price a customer will accept?\n\nThere are four ways to support a price on something of value: (1)\nreplacement cost, (2) market comparison, (3) discounted cash flow/net\npresent value, and (4) value comparison. These Four Pricing Methods will\nhelp you estimate just how much something is potentially worth to your\ncustomers.\n\nThe replacement cost method supports a price by answering the question\n\u201cHow much would it cost to replace?\u201d In the case of the house, the question\nbecomes \u201cWhat would it cost to create or construct a house just like this\none?\u201d\n\nAssume a meteorite scored a direct hit on the house, and there\u2019s nothing\nleft\u2014you have to rebuild the house from scratch. What would it take to\npurchase similar land, pay for an architect to draw up plans, acquire\nidentical materials, and hire construction workers to create the same house?\nTotal up these costs, add a bit of margin to compensate for your time and\neffort, and you\u2019ll have a supportable estimate of how much your house is\nworth.\n\nApplied to most offers, replacement cost is usually a \u201ccost-plus\u201d\ncalculation: figure out how much it costs to create, add your desired\nmarkup, and set your price appropriately.\n\nThe market comparison method supports a price by answering the\nquestion \u201cHow much are other things like this selling for?\u201d In the case of\nthe house, this question becomes \u201cHow much have houses like this, in this\ngeneral area, sold for recently?\u201d\n\nIf you look at the surrounding area, there are probably a few other\nhouses similar to the one you own that have been sold within the past year.\nThey\u2019re probably not exactly the same\u2014maybe they have an extra bedroom\nor bathroom, a little less square footage, etc.\u2014but they\u2019re close enough.\nAfter you adjust for the differences, you can use the sale prices of those\n\n\u201ccomparable\u201d houses to create a supportable estimate of how much your\nhouse is worth.\n\nMarket comparison is a very common way to price offers: find a similar\noffer and set your price relatively close to what they\u2019re asking.\n\nThe discounted cash flow (DCF)/ net present value (NPV) method\nsupports a price by answering the question \u201cHow much is it worth if it can\nbring in money over time?\u201d In the case of your house, the question becomes\n\u201cHow much would this house bring in each month if you rented it for a\nperiod of time, and how much is that series of cash flows worth as a lump\nsum today?\u201d\n\nRent payments come in every month, which is quite handy: you can use\nthe DCF/NPV formulas? to calculate what that series of payments over a\ncertain period of time would be worth if you received it in one lump sum.\nBy calculating the NPV of the house, assuming you could rent it for $2,000\na month for a period of ten years with 95 percent occupancy and you could\nearn 7 percent interest on your money by choosing the Next Best Alternative,\nyou\u2019 ll have a supportable estimate of what the house is worth.\n\nDCF/NPV is used only for pricing things that can produce an ongoing\ncash flow, which makes it a very common way to price businesses when\nthey\u2019re sold or acquired\u2014the more profit the business generates each\nmonth, the more valuable the business is to the purchaser.\n\nThe value comparison method supports a price by answering the\nquestion \u201cWho is this particularly valuable to?\u201d In the case of the house,\nthis question becomes \u201cWhat features of this house would make it valuable\nto certain types of people?\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s assume the house is in an attractive, safe neighborhood with a top-\ntier public school nearby. These characteristics would make the house more\nvaluable to families who have school-age kids, particularly if they want to\nattend that school. To potential home buyers in the market, this particular\nhouse would be more valuable than the same house in an area with inferior\nschools.\n\nHere\u2019s another example: assume Elvis Presley once owned the house. To\ncertain types of people\u2014wealthy people who love Elvis\u2014this house would\nbe priceless. Elvis\u2019s previous involvement with the property could triple or\nquadruple the price you\u2019d be able to support via the replacement, market\ncomparison, or DCF/NPV methods. By looking at the unique characteristics\n\nof what you\u2019re offering and the corresponding worth of those characteristics\nto certain individuals, you can often support much higher prices.\n\nValue comparison is usually the optimal way to price your offer, since\nthe value of an offer to a specific group can be quite high, resulting in a\nmuch better price. Use the other methods as a baseline, but focus on\ndiscovering how much your offer is worth to the party you hope to sell it to,\nthen set your price appropriately.\n",

A change in prices can change your typical prospect\novernight.\n\nMost people who are new to business assume that the best way to\nincrease sales is to reduce prices. That\u2019s not necessarily true. Often, raising\nyour prices is an effective way to attract more customers.\n\nDiscounts attract customers when the offer is a commodity. If there\u2019s no\ndifference between the gasoline at one gas station and another, the station\nthat reduces its gas prices may bring in more customers. Since most service\nstations make more money from their convenience stores than they make\nselling gasoline, a gas discounting strategy may lead to higher profits.\n\nIn introductory economics courses, this idea is called \u201cprice elasticity.\u201d\nOffers with high price elasticity experience major changes in demand when\nprices go up or down. Offers with low price elasticity experience little\nfluctuation in demand when prices change. Economists love to draw\ndownward-sloping pricing curves that show demand increasing as prices\ndecrease.\n\nThe trouble with the traditional pricing curve is that it can be misleading\nwhen the offer isn\u2019t a commodity. In practice, raising your prices can\nincrease demand by appealing to a more attractive type of customer.\n\nAutomobiles are a classic example of this type of price sensitivity: some\ncars are desirable because they\u2019re expensive. The typical customer who\n\npurchases a Bentley Continental GT is very different from the type of\ncustomer who purchases a Toyota Camry.\n\nAs you test different pricing strategies, you\u2019ll notice thresholds where\nyou stop appealing to certain types of customers and start appealing to\ncustomers with very different characteristics. This Price Transition Shock can\nchange the experience of operating your business, and you shouldn\u2019t take it\nlightly.\n\nThere are two major considerations when setting your prices with Price\nTransition Shock in mind: (1) potential profitability and (2) ideal customer\ncharacteristics. The best strategy is to set your prices to appeal to the\nprospects that will ensure you work with your most desirable customers in a\nway that results in the highest profits.\n\nThe ideal balance depends on your target market. In some markets, it\u2019s\neasy to serve customers who are attracted to low prices; in others, discount\ncustomers can be challenging and rude. Likewise, prospects that don\u2019t blink\nat high prices can be pleasant and cordial or demanding and snooty. The\nexperience depends on the industry and the prospects\u2019 expectations.\n\nOne of the businesses I\u2019ve been involved with over the years succeeded\nin doubling its average order value by eliminating low-priced offers. As a\nresult, profits increased. As a Second-Order Effect, the company\u2019s typical\ncustomer changed for the worse: prospects made unreasonable demands\nmore often and acted in disrespectful ways when those demands weren\u2019t\nmet. The short-term financial result was positive, but the change placed\nextraordinary stress on the staff.\n\nOn the other hand, a service business I advise decided to quadruple the\nprice of its standard offer and found that its new positioning appealed to its\nideal customers: people who valued the firm\u2019s work and took the project\nseriously. Nonideal customers were turned off by the hike in prices, so they\nwent away. As a result, the company filled its client roster with excellent\ncustomers and increased profits by more than 500 percent. The staff is\nthrilled with the change: they\u2019re doing more work for better clients and\ngetting paid more for their expertise.\n\nAs you change your prices, the prospects attracted to your offer will also\nchange. So long as you maintain Sufficiency, you can choose to appeal to any\ntype of customer you please.\n",

Is your service worth\n$10 million a year? Sure\u2014after all, what company would give up $90\nmillion in ongoing revenue?\n\nDoes it matter if providing this valuable service doesn\u2019t cost you much\nmoney? No\u2014even if it only costs you a hundred dollars a year to provide\nthe service, you\u2019re providing a huge amount of value, which supports the\ncomparatively high price.\n\nDoes it matter if most business-to-business services cost $10,000 or\nless? No\u2014you\u2019re providing much more value than other services in the\nmarket, which justifies a higher price.\n\nValue-Based Selling is the process of understanding and reinforcing the\nreasons your offer is valuable to the purchaser. In the previous section, we\ndiscussed how the value comparison method is often the best way to\nsupport a high price on your offer. Value-Based Selling is how you support\nthat price. By understanding and reinforcing the Reason Why a Transaction\nwill be valuable to the customer, you simultaneously increase the likelihood\nof a Transaction as well as the price the buyer will be willing to pay.\n\nValue-Based Selling is not about talking\u2014it\u2019s about listening. When\nmost people think of sales, they imagine a pushy, smooth-talking shyster\nwhose sole priority is to \u201cclose the deal.\u201d Emulating shady used car dealers\nis the fastest way to destroy Trust and give your potential customers the\nimpression that you care more about your bottom line than about what they\nwant. In reality, the best salespeople are the ones who can listen intently for\nthe things the customer wants.\n\nAsking good questions is the best way to identify what your offer is\nworth to your prospect. In the classic sales book SPIN Selling, Neil\nRackham describes the four phases of successful selling: (1) understanding\nthe situation, (2) defining the problem, (3) clarifying the short-term and\nlong-term implications of that problem, and (4) quantifying the need-\n\npayoff, or the financial and emotional benefits the customer would\nexperience after the resolution of their problem. Instead of barging in with a\npremature, boilerplate hard sell, successful salespeople focus on asking\ndetailed questions to get to the root of what the prospect wants.\n\nBy encouraging your prospects to tell you more about what they need,\nyou reap two major benefits. First, you increase the prospect\u2019s confidence in\nyour understanding of the situation, increasing their confidence in your\nability to deliver a solution. Second, you\u2019 ll discover information that will\nhelp you emphasize just how valuable your offer is, which helps you in\nFraming the price of your offer versus the value it will provide.\n\nIf you discover why, how, and how much your offer will benefit the\ncustomer, you\u2019ll be able to explain that value in terms they\u2019! understand\nand appreciate. Understanding the value you can provide your customers is\nthe golden path to a profitable sale.\n",

Dont build better cameras\u2014build better photographers.\n\nKATHY SIERRA, AUTHOR AND COCREATOR OF THE HEAD FIRST SERIES OF BOOKS\n\nB efore moving to Colorado, my wife, Kelsey, was the sales manager of\nthe Mark Ingram Bridal Atelier in New York City, the most prestigious\nbridal salon in the world. Her job was to help brides from around the world\nfind \u201cthe One\u201d\u2014the perfect dress for their dream wedding.\n\nMark Ingram is the Martha Stewart of the bridal industry\u2014his sense of\nstyle is legendary. Gowns by Monique Lhuillier, Lela Rose, and Vera Wang\npopulate his collection. Mark\u2019s consultants are so skilled that one of the first\nthree gowns they present is almost always the gown the bride chooses for\nher wedding. In addition, the shopping experience and customer service are\nsuperb\u2014Mark doesn\u2019t discount, but brides would rather work with him\nthan purchase their gown from a competitor, even though it\u2019d be less\nexpensive.\n\nCompared with most bridal salons, the Mark Ingram Bridal Atelier sells\nvery high-end gowns. The average sale price of a gown at Mark\u2019s atelier is\n\n$6,000\u2014four times the national average. To make the sale, Mark\u2019s\nconsultants must help the bride (and her parents, who often pay the bill)\nunderstand why the gown is worth the price.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to purchase a less expensive gown from another salon, but\ncheaper gowns cut corners: they use lower-quality fabrics, skimp on\nconstruction, and use machined lace or beading. In addition, alterations are\nnecessary to ensure that the gown fits the bride. Mark\u2019s team of bridal\nseamstresses is the best in the world, and you can only work with them if\nyou purchase a gown from Mark\u2019s atelier.\n\nIf you care about these things\u2014and most fashion-conscious brides do\u2014\nit\u2019s easy to see why it\u2019s worth it to purchase a gown from Mark if you can\nafford to.\n\nEducation-Based Selling is the process of making your prospects better,\nmore informed customers. As a sales consultant, Kelsey worked to do two\nthings: (1) make the bride feel comfortable and relaxed, and then (2) help\nthe bride become more knowledgeable about gowns in terms of how they\nare made and what to look for when buying one.\n\nInstead of pressuring the bride to \u201cclose the sale,\u201d Kelsey always took\nthe time to explain the ins and outs of fabric, lace, beading, construction,\nand alterations to the bride and her family. She invested time in making her\nbrides more knowledgeable, and this made them more likely to purchase an\nexpensive dress from her, both because they had learned to fully appreciate\nthe quality of what she was selling and because she had earned their Trust.\n\nEducation-Based Selling requires an up-front investment in your\nprospects, but it\u2019s worth it. By investing energy in making your prospects\nsmarter, you simultaneously build Trust in your expertise and make them\nbetter customers. Be forewarned, however, that effective education requires\nyour offer to be superior in some way to your competitors\u2019\u2014otherwise,\nyou\u2019 ll be sending customers away. All the more reason to ensure that you\nhave an offer worth selling.\n",

Sometimes you are\nbetter off not getting to yes.\n\n\u2014ROBERT RUBIN, FORMER US SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY\n\nW hen negotiating, it\u2019s always useful to know what the other party is\nlikely to do in the event that an agreement can\u2019t be reached. Sometimes, it\u2019s\njust not possible to reach an agreement\u2014there\u2019s no Common Ground, so both\nparties agree to go their separate ways. What then?\n\nYour Next Best Alternative is what you\u2019|l do in the event you can\u2019t find\nCommon Ground with the party you\u2019re negotiating with. Imagine you\u2019re\nlooking for a job, and there are three companies interested in hiring you.\nYou may prefer to work at Company A, but if you can\u2019t reach a mutually\nacceptable agreement, it\u2019s easier to be a confident negotiator if you know\nthat Companies B and C are also interested in hiring you. If Company A is\nyour only option and they know it, you\u2019re not likely to get a good deal.\n\nThe other party always has a Next Best Alternative as well\u2014that\u2019s what\nyou\u2019re negotiating against. If you\u2019re selling a product that costs $100, you\nare selling against the next best thing that they could do with that $100:\nsave it, invest it, or purchase something else. If you\u2019re trying to hire an\nemployee, you\u2019re competing against the next best offer they have from\nanother company. The more options the other party has, the weaker your\nnegotiating position.\n\nUnderstanding the other party\u2019s Next Best Alternative gives you a major\nsales advantage: you can structure your agreement so it\u2019s more attractive\nthan their next best option. The more you know about the other party\u2019s\nalternatives, the better you can fine-tune your offer by Bundling or\nUnbundling various options.\n\nHaving a strong Next Best Alternative keeps negotiations moving. Many\nprofessional sports players who are approaching free agency use the\nopportunity to renegotiate or renew their contracts with their current teams,\nparticularly if other teams express interest in them. If the original team\ndoesn\u2019t want to lose the player, they have an incentive to reach an\nacceptable deal.\n\nIn every negotiation, the power lies with the party that is able and\nwilling to walk away from a bad deal. In almost every case, the more\nacceptable alternatives you have, the better your position. The more\nattractive your alternatives, the more willing you\u2019ll be to walk away from a\ndeal that doesn\u2019t serve you, resulting in better deals.\n",

So long as you want an iPhone and\naren\u2019t willing to settle for an alternative, Apple wins.\n\nExclusivity is beneficial for many reasons. Exclusive offers make it\nmuch easier to maintain high Perceived Value, since there\u2019s no direct\ncompetition.

Resellers often find it difficult to establish exclusivity unless they\nplay a role in the product\u2019s manufacture, which is why retailers often create\n\u201cprivate label\u201d brands.

                        "extracted-text": "Time will take your money, but maney won't buy time.\n~JAMES TAYLOR, MUSICIAN\n\nIn every negotiation, there are Three Universal Currencies: resources, time,\nand flexibility. Any one of these currencies can be traded for more or less of\nthe others.\n\nResources are tangible items like money, gold, oil, etc. Resources are\nphysical: you can hold them in your hand. If you want to buy some\nfurniture, you can offer money in exchange. If you\u2019re selling your car, the\npurchaser could (with your agreement) give you a bar of gold or a mint\nfirst-edition issue of Action Comics #1, which features the first appearance\nof Superman in print. You\u2019re trading one resource for another.\n\nTime is the second universal currency. If you go to work as an hourly\nemployee, you are trading a certain amount of time and effort for a certain\namount of resources. You can also trade resources for time: you can offer to\npay other people in exchange for their work, which is the essence of\nemployment, contracting, and freelancing.\n\nFlexibility is the third universal currency\u2014one that is usually quite\nunderrated. Becoming a salaried employee isn\u2019t a straightforward exchange\nof resources for time and effort\u2014you\u2019re also giving up a certain amount of\nflexibility. There\u2019s an implicit agreement that you won\u2019t work on other\nthings when you\u2019re supposed to be working for the company, which is a\nvery real Opportunity Cost. While you\u2019re working, you\u2019re giving up the\nflexibility to do something else.\n\nIt\u2019s entirely possible to negotiate for a greater or lesser degree of\nflexibility by trading off effort or resources. For example, you can decrease\nyour effort and increase your flexibility by working part time, in exchange\nfor fewer resources\u2014reduced salary and benefits. Purchasing a house\nrequires less time if you agree to a thirty-year mortgage versus saving up to\nbuy it outright, at the cost of additional resources (interest payments) and\ndecreased flexibility.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to gain more of any of these desired currencies by finding\nappropriate Trade-offs between one or more of the others. If you\u2019d like\nadditional compensation in the form of a raise or a larger contract, you can\ngive up time or flexibility (such as the ability to use what you make for\nother purposes) as a Trade-off. If you\u2019d like a bit more flexibility or time off\nin your working arrangements, you can negotiate a decrease in salary to\ncompensate. If your employer or client wants you to work more or wants to\nbenefit more from your work, you can ask them for more compensation in\nreturn.\n\nKeep the Three Universal Currencies in mind when negotiating and\nyou\u2019ll be amazed at the range of potential options you\u2019ll be able to present\nto the other party, making it easier to find an option that works for all\nparties involved.\n",

But that\u2019s the last phase of\nthe process; the other two happen well before you ever sit down at the\nnegotiating table.\n\nThe Three Dimensions of Negotiation are setup, structure, and discussion.\nAs David A. Lax and James K. Sebenius discuss in 3-D Negotiation, each\nof these phases is essential: by creating an Environment that\u2019s conducive to a\ndeal and preparing your strategy in advance, you can increase the\nprobability of finding a mutually acceptable solution.\n\nThe first phase of every negotiation is the setup: setting the stage for a\nsatisfying outcome to the negotiation. The more you can stack the odds in\nyour favor before you start negotiating, the better the deal you\u2019ll be able to\nstrike.\n\ne\nWho is involved in the negotiation, and are they open to dealing\nwith you?\n\nWho are you negotiating with, and do they know who you are and\nhow you can help them?\n\n.\nWhat are you proposing, and how does it benefit the other party?\n\nWhat\u2019s the setting\u2014will you present your offer in person, by phone,\nor by some other means?\n\n.\n\nWhat are all of the environmental factors around the deal\u2014do\nrecent events make this deal more or less important to the other\nparty?\n\nSetup is the negotiation equivalent of Guiding Structure\u2014the Environment\nsurrounding the deal plays a huge role in the eventual outcome, so it pays to\nensure that the Environment is conducive to getting a good deal before you\never reach the table. By thinking about the setup, you can make sure you\u2019re\nnegotiating with the right person\u2014the person who has the Power to give you\nwhat you want. Research is what gives this dimension of negotiation its\npower\u2014the more knowledge you gain about your negotiating partner\nduring this phase, the more power you have in the entire negotiation, so do\nyour homework before presenting an offer.\n\nThe second dimension of negotiation is structure: the terms of the\nproposal. In this phase, you put together your draft proposal in a way the\nother party is likely to appreciate and accept:\n\n.\n\nWhat will you propose, and how are you Framing your proposal to\nthe other party?\n\ne\n\nWhat are the primary benefits of your proposal to the other party?\n.\n\nWhat is the other party\u2019s Next Best Alternative, and how is your\nproposal better?\n\n.\n\nHow will you overcome the other party\u2019s objections and Barriers to\nPurchase?\n\ne\n\nAre there Trade-offs or concessions you\u2019re willing to make to reach\nan agreement?\n\nRemember, your goal in creating the proposal is to find Common Ground:\nan agreement that both parties will be happy to accept. By thinking through\nthe structure of your proposal in advance, you can prepare a few different\noptions that you believe the other party will want, on terms you\u2019re willing\nto accept.\n\nIf you\u2019re expecting the other party to balk at the price, for instance, you\ncan prepare arguments to overcome the objection, lower-cost options that\nprovide less value, or alternative offers that would better fit their needs.\nWhen the time comes for you to discuss the deal with your negotiating\npartner, you\u2019 ll be ready for anything.\n\nThe third dimension of negotiation is the discussion: presenting the offer\nto the other party. The discussion is when you talk through your proposal\nwith the other party. Sometimes the discussion happens the way you see it\nin the movies: in a mahogany-walled boardroom, across the table, toe to toe\nwith the CEO. Sometimes it happens over the phone. Sometimes it happens\nover email. Whatever the setting, this is the point where you present your\noffer, discuss or clarify any issues the other party doesn\u2019t understand,\nanswer objections and remove Barriers to Purchase, and ask for the sale.\n\nRegardless of what happens during the discussion phase, the end result\nof every round of discussion is either (1) \u201cYes, we have a deal on these\nterms,\u201d (2) \u201cWe don\u2019t have a deal quite yet\u2014here\u2019s a counteroffer or\nanother option to consider,\u201d or (3) \u201cNo, we don\u2019t have a deal\u2014there\u2019s no\nCommon Ground, so we\u2019|l suspend negotiations and reserve the right to\ntalk to somebody else.\u201d Discussion continues until a final agreement is\nreached or the parties decide to quit negotiating, whichever happens first.\n\nIf you prepare the Three Dimensions of Negotiation (setup, structure,\nand discussion) in advance, you\u2019 ll be far more likely to settle on terms that\nbenefit both parties.\n",

Being able to say, \u201cI need to discuss this with my\nagent/accountant/attorney\u201d before giving final approval on a deal is a\nvaluable check step that prevents hasty or unwise decisions.\n\nBe very mindful of incentive-caused Bias when working with a Buffer.\nDepending on the arrangement, your Buffer\u2019s priorities may be very\ndifferent from your own. For example, real estate agents act as Buffers\n\nbetween the sellers of property and potential purchasers. If you\u2019re looking\nto buy property, it\u2019s often useful to work with a buy-side agent, provided\nyou\u2019re aware of how they\u2019re compensated.\n\nAgents are usually compensated on a commission basis, so it pays to be\nwary if you\u2019re using them on the buy side of a deal. The Agent is\ncompensated if (and only if) a Transaction occurs. Their first priority is to\ncomplete a deal\u2014any deal\u2014regardless of whether or not it\u2019s the best\npossible deal for the buyer.\n\nIf at all possible, work with a Buffer who is willing to accept a flat fee in\nexchange for services rendered, whether or not the deal happens. If your\nBuffer will be paid regardless of what happens, their interests will be more\nclosely aligned with getting you the best deal possible, which enhances\ntheir Reputation.\n\nDon\u2019t let your Buffer replace your own informed judgment. One of the\nworst things you can do is relinquish control over your decisions to your\nBuffer, particularly if your interests aren\u2019t aligned. Many unwary investors\nhave found their savings depleted by giving carte blanche to \u201cinvestment\nprofessionals\u201d who are compensated every time a security is bought or sold.\nBy \u201cchurning\u201d the account, the broker is able to legally rack up thousands\nof dollars in unnecessary fees. As a rule of thumb, don\u2019t give anyone\nunfettered control over decisions that affect your money.\n\nBuffers can be a valuable resource as long as you\u2019re clear about how\nthey\u2019ll be rewarded, what they\u2019re responsible for, and how you intend to\nwork together.\n",

CLEMENT STONE, INSURANCE SALESMAN, PHILANTHROPIST, AND AUTHOR\n\n0 ne of the things that makes prospects uncomfortable around salespeople\nis the feeling that they\u2019re going to get the \u201chard sell\u201d or be tricked into\nagreeing to something that\u2019s not in their best interest. This experience is\ncalled Persuasion Resistance, and it\u2019s a major barrier to making sales.\n\nWhen a prospect senses that someone is trying to convince or compel\nthem to do something they\u2019re not sure about, they resist and attempt to\nmove away from the conversation. This is particularly true in situations\nwhere the salesperson is trying to force a choice or limit the prospect\u2019s\navailable options in some way.\n\nPsychologists call this \u201creactance,\u201d and it appears in early childhood.\nEvery parent has experienced the fallout of telling a child they \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d or\n\u201chave to\u201d do something. Prospects react in much the same way when a\nsalesperson attempts to pressure a sale, resisting out of an instinct to\npreserve their autonomy. The harder the salesperson pushes, the more the\nprospect resists. That\u2019s why hard-sell approaches usually fail to generate\nsustainable results.\n\nThe more effective strategy, in the words of the renowned sales expert\nZig Ziglar, is to present yourself to the prospect as an \u201cassistant buyer.\u201d\nYour job is not to sell the prospect a bill of goods: it\u2019s to help them make an\ninformed decision about what\u2019s best for them. You\u2019re not pressuring them\nto give you their money; you\u2019re helping to ensure they invest their\nresources wisely. This basic Reinterpretation of your role in the sales process\nworks: it eliminates the prospect\u2019s feeling of pressure by convincing them\nyou\u2019re looking out for their best interests.\n\nSalespeople need to be aware of two additional signals that can trigger\nPersuasion Resistance: desperation and chasing. Sending either signal\nduring any part of the sales process will reduce the number and size of the\nTransactions you Close.\n\nIf a prospect feels that you\u2019re desperate to make a sale, it diminishes\ntheir interest in a matter of seconds. Desperation is a subtle signal that other\npeople don\u2019t find your offer desirable, and Social Proof starts working\nagainst you. In the same way that people don\u2019t want to date a person who\ndesperately wants to be in a relationship, prospects don\u2019t want to do\nbusiness with a person who desperately wants or needs their money.\n\nIt\u2019s much better to present yourself with confidence, in a way that\nsignals your offer is valuable, is a good fit for the prospect, and will be a\nwise investment of the prospect\u2019s money. If you don\u2019t genuinely believe\nthat, you need to find something else to sell.\n\nIf a prospect senses you\u2019re chasing them, their first impulse will be to\nmove away from you. Chasing and being chased are evolutionary patterns:\nfor thousands of years, human beings have chased things that are desirable\n\nand they have been chased by threats. Even if we wouldn\u2019t label a situation\nas \u201cchasing\u201d or \u201cbeing chased,\u201d our minds notice and respond without\nconscious effort.\n\nChasing a prospect to make a sale is counterproductive, a waste of time\nand energy. Instead, find ways to use Framing to present the situation in a\nway that encourages the prospect to feel like they\u2019re chasing you. If your\nprospect feels like they need to justify why they\u2019re good enough to work\nwith you, you\u2019re in a very strong position to make a sale on favorable\nterms.\n\nWe\u2019|l discuss additional ways our primal minds process our modern\nEnvironment in Caveman Syndrome. For now, it\u2019s important to remember that\nthese social signals may seem silly at best or manipulative at worst, but that\ndoesn\u2019t make them any less real or important. By understanding how your\nprospects evaluate offers, you can plan your pitch in a way that minimizes\nPersuasion Resistance and encourages the prospect to Desire what you have\nto offer.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Gifts are never free: they bind the giver and receiver in a loop of reciprocity.\nMARCEL MAUSS, SOCIOLOGIST AND ANTHROPOLOGIST\n\nR eciprocation is the strong desire most people feel to \u201cpay back\u201d favors,\ngifts, benefits, and resources provided. If you\u2019ve ever had the experience of\nreceiving a holiday gift from someone you didn\u2019t send anything to, you\nknow how uncomfortable this feels. If someone benefits us, we like to\nbenefit them in return.\n\nAs a social force, Reciprocation is one of the primary psychological\ntendencies that underlie human cooperation. The \u201cYou scratch my back, I\u2019ll\nscratch yours\u201d instinct is powerful and forms the foundation of friendships\nand alliances. Historically, gift giving was how the powerful remained in\nPower: in throwing lavish parties or generously awarding titles and land,\nleaders increased their influence by amassing a store of favors that could be\ncalled in during times of need.\n\nHere\u2019s the tricky part: the desire to reciprocate is not necessarily in\nproportion to the original benefit provided. In Influence: The Psychology of\nPersuasion, Dr. Robert Cialdini provides an example of reciprocation in car\nsales. Car salesmen often offer prospects a small gift up front. \u201cCan I get\nyou a coffee? Would you like a soda? Some water? Cookies? Is there\nanything that I can do to make you more comfortable?\u201d\n\nIt seems like a common gesture of hospitality. It\u2019s not. Accepting this\nsmall offer creates a psychological need to Reciprocate, subtly stacking the\ndeck in the salesman\u2019s favor. Prospective car buyers who accepted this Free\noffer were far more likely to purchase a vehicle, add optional accessories,\nand agree to less attractive financing terms. As a result, these customers\nspent thousands of dollars more than the people who did not accept\nanything from the salesman while negotiating. That doesn\u2019t make rational\nsense, because the coffee or cookies cost the dealer very little, but\nReciprocation makes it more likely that the buyer will \u201cpay back\u201d the favor\nwith a much larger concession.\n\nThe more legitimate value you can provide to others up front, the more\nreceptive they\u2019 ll be when it\u2019s time for your pitch. Providing Free value\nbuilds your social capital, making it more likely the people you benefit will\nReciprocate when you make an offer down the road.\n\nBeing generous is one of the best things you can do to improve your\nresults as a salesperson. If you give away value and help others as much as\nyou can, they\u2019ll respect you; it will build your Reputation, but it will also\nincrease the probability that they will be interested enough when you do\npresent your Call to Action.\n",

Should you choose the\nfastest available processor, the least powerful option that\u2019s half the price, or\nthe middle-of-the-road option? How much storage do you need? How much\ninternal memory is enough to run your software without slowing you down?\nWhich display size should you select? Should you purchase a portable\ncomputer, a desktop system, or a tablet?\n\nThis matrix of decisions is overwhelming to most computer purchasers.\nChoosing the best option seems like it should be easy, but it\u2019s not: if there\nare five separate variables, and three options for each variable, there are 243\npossible combinations to consider. That\u2019s enough to short-circuit anyone\u2019s\nbrain.\n\nOption Fatigue is often a major barrier to buying decisions: if a prospect is\noverwhelmed by Decisions, they often choose to resolve their discomfort by\nabandoning the purchase instead of completing it. Every choice the prospect\nmust make decreases the probability of closing the deal.\n\nIn general, the best approach is to guide the purchaser to select from two\nor three predefined options that represent good starting points for certain\ntypes of customers, then customize that option further if necessary. That\u2019s\nwhy computer manufacturers like Apple and Dell present a few\npreconfigured computers designed to appeal to certain types of customers,\nthen allow you to upgrade or downgrade individual components later in the\npurchasing process.

The fact that they\u2019re even\ntalking with you implies that they have at least some interest in your offer\u2014\notherwise, the conversation would end. There\u2019s still hope of closing the\nsale, if you start asking the right questions.\n\nSelling anything is the process of identifying and eliminating Barriers to\nPurchase: risks, unknowns, and concerns that prevent your prospects from\nbuying what you offer. Your primary job as a salesperson is to identify and\neliminate barriers standing in the way of completing the Transaction.\nEliminate your prospect\u2019s objections and barriers and you\u2019ll close the deal.\n\nThere are five standard objections that appear in sales of all kinds:\n\n1.\n\nIt costs too much. Loss Aversion makes spending money feel like a\nloss\u2014by purchasing, the prospect is giving something up, and that\nmakes people hesitate. (Some people even experience this sense of\nloss after they make a purchase decision, a condition called \u201cbuyer\u2019s\nremorse.\u201d\n\n2.\n\nIt won't work. If the prospect thinks that there\u2019s a chance the offer\nwon\u2019t (or can\u2019t) provide the promised benefits, they won\u2019t purchase.\n3.\n\nIt won't work for me. The prospect may believe that the offer is\ncapable of providing benefits to other people but that they\u2019re\ndifferent\u2014a special case.\n\n4.\n\nI can wait. The prospect may believe they don\u2019t have a problem\nworth addressing right now, even if it\u2019s very clear to you that they\ndo.\n\n5.\n\nIt\u2019s too difficult. If the offer takes any effort whatsoever on their\npart, the prospect may believe that their contribution will be too\nhard to manage.\n\nTo overcome these objections, it makes sense to build them into the\nstructure of your initial offer. Since these objections are very common,\n\nanything that you can do to alleviate them before the prospect considers the\noffer will make the sales process much easier.\n\nObjection 1 (\u201cIt costs too much\u201d) is best addressed via Framing and Value-\nBased Selling. If you\u2019re selling a piece of software to a business that can save\nthem $10 million a year, and you\u2019re asking $1 million a year for a license,\nyour software isn\u2019t expensive\u2014it\u2019s almost Free. If it\u2019s clear that the value of\nyour offer far exceeds the asking price, this objection is moot.\n\nObjections 2 and 3 (\u201cIt won\u2019t work\u201d / \u201cIt won\u2019t work for me\u201d) are best\naddressed via Social Proof\u2014showing the prospect how customers just like\nthem are already benefiting from your offer. The more like your prospect\u2019s\nsituation your stories and testimonials are, the better. That\u2019s why Referrals\nare such a powerful sales tool\u2014customers tend to refer people who have\nsimilar situations and needs, and the Referral itself helps break down these\nobjections.\n\nObjections 4 and 5 (\u201cI can wait\u201d / \u201cIt\u2019s too difficult\u201d) are best addressed\nvia Education-Based Selling. Often, your prospects haven\u2019t fully realized they\nhave a problem, particularly in the case of Absence Blindness. If the business\ndoesn\u2019t realize it\u2019s losing $10 million in the first place, it\u2019s difficult to\nconvince them that you can help. The best way to get around this is to focus\nyour early sales efforts on making your customers smarter by teaching them\nwhat you know about their business, then use Visualization to help them\nimagine what their involvement would look like if they decide to proceed.\n\nOnce you have the prospect\u2019s Attention and Permission, there are two\npossible tactics if they still have these objections: (1) convince the prospect\nthat the objection isn\u2019t true, or (2) convince the prospect that the objection\nis irrelevant. The approach you'll use depends on the objection raised, but\nsome combination of Framing, Value-Based Selling, Education-Based\nSelling, Social Proof, and Visualization will usually do the trick.\n\nIf the prospect still doesn\u2019t buy, that often means there\u2019s a Power issue\u2014\nyour negotiating partner may not have the budget or the authority to agree\nto your proposal. Always try to negotiate with the decision-maker\u2014that\nway, if they refuse your offer, you know that it\u2019s because it wasn\u2019t a good fit\nfor them, and you can move on to more promising prospects.\n",

They hate feeling stupid. They hate making\nbad decisions or wasting money. They hate taking risks.\n\nWhen it comes to closing sales, you are that risk. In every Transaction,\nthe purchaser is taking on some risk. What if this offer doesn\u2019t work as\npromised? What if it doesn\u2019t meet their needs? What if purchasing from you\nis a waste of money?\n\nThese questions are always in the back of your prospect\u2019s mind as\nthey\u2019re considering purchasing from you. If you don\u2019t eliminate these\nquestions, it\u2019s very likely they\u2019ll ruin the sale.\n\nRisk Reversal is a strategy that transfers some (or all) of the risk of a\nTransaction from the buyer to the seller. Instead of making the purchaser\nshoulder the risk of a bad Transaction, the seller agrees in advance to make\nthings right if\u2014for whatever reason\u2014things don\u2019t turn out as the purchaser\nexpected.\n\nTake the bedding industry, for example. Look around, and you\u2019ll see a\nlot of over-the-top offers: twelve-month, 100 percent money-back\nguarantees, no questions asked! A customer could sleep on a bed for a year,\ndecide they didn\u2019t like it, and call up the store to return it for a full refund.\nCrazy, right?\n\nIt\u2019s not crazy at all: this strategy eliminates the purchaser\u2019s perception of\nrisk, which is a major Barrier to Purchase. If a customer makes a purchase\nand it doesn\u2019t work out, they don\u2019t have to feel stupid about wasting their\nmoney\u2014and they don\u2019t have to feel angry at the company or at themselves\nfor making a bad decision. All they need to do is take advantage of the\nguarantee and return it\u2014no big deal. As a result, they\u2019! go through with the\nTransaction\u2014there\u2019s no downside, so why not?\n\nThis approach is sometimes called the \u201ctake the puppy home\u201d strategy. If\nyou visit a pet store and meet an adorable puppy, but you\u2019re not sure\nwhether or not you\u2019re ready to commit, the pet store will often tell you to\n\ntake the puppy home on a trial basis. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work out,\u201d the\nsalesperson says, \u201cyou can always bring it back.\u201d\n\nThe puppy almost never comes back, of course. The promise of an easy\nreturn is the key to making the sale: the salesperson is happy to accept the\nsmall risk of a return to secure the sale, the new owners feel less anxious\nabout their decision, and the puppy gets a new home. Everyone wins.\n\nAdopting a Risk Reversal strategy is uncomfortable because sellers also\nhate to lose. No seller wants to feel used or taken advantage of, and it\u2019s\noften easy to feel that way if a customer obviously gets value from the offer\nand asks for a refund anyway.\n\nThe difference is that the purchaser is purchasing from one seller\u2014the\nseller is selling to many purchasers. Your customers experience this risk\nwith every purchase they make, and it\u2019s a big deal. Since you\u2019re serving\nmany customers, you can spread the cost of a return across the total number\nof customers you serve.\n\nYes, you\u2019ll lose money on customers who are obviously taking\nadvantage of your generosity, and that never feels good. In compensation,\nby eliminating the risk that every purchaser feels, you\u2019ll close many more\nsales and come out way ahead in terms of total revenue and profit.\n\nIf you want to maximize your sales, it almost always makes sense to\noffer a very strong, risk-reversing guarantee and to extend the risk-free\nperiod as much as possible. If you don\u2019t already have a Risk Reversal\npolicy, implement one and you\u2019ll see your sales increase.\n",

If you\ncancel a Netflix subscription, three to six months later you\u2019ll receive a\npostcard and/or email with an offer to resubscribe at a reduced rate. If you\ndon\u2019t reply, they\u2019Il send another message every few months until you\nresubscribe or request to be removed from their marketing system. Since\nNetflix is a Subscription business, every reactivated customer means an\nadditional monthly stream of income, which greatly enhances the Lifetime\nValue of each customer.\n\nReactivation is often a quicker, simpler, and more effective approach to\nincreasing revenue than attracting new customers.

TRAN, TECHNOLOGIST AND DESIGNER\n\nW hen I worked at Procter & Gamble, one of the most fascinating things\nabout my job was understanding how products were created and delivered.\nHere\u2019s a quick look at how a bottle of Dawn dishwashing liquid is made:\n\n1.\n\nRaw materials are delivered to the factory.\n\n2.\n\nThe materials are combined to create dishwashing liquid, which is\nstored in large vats.\n\n3.\n\nPlastic bottles are blown into shape using molds, then filled with the\nliquid and capped.\n\n4.\n\nAdhesive labels are applied to each bottle.\n\n5.\n\nEach bottle is inspected, boxed, then loaded onto a pallet.\n\nIt\u2019s a textbook example of a value-creation process, which begins with\nraw materials and ends with a finished Product, ready to be shipped. Here\u2019s\nwhat happens next:\n\n6.\n\nPallets are wrapped, stacked, and stored for shipment in a\nwarehouse.\n\n7.\n\nWhen orders from customers are placed, pallets are moved into\nposition for loading onto a truck.\n\n8.\n\nA truck picks up the pallets and delivers them to the customer\u2019s\nclosest distribution center.\n\n9.\nThe customer puts the pallets on a delivery truck.\n\n10.\nThe truck delivers the pallet to a store that needs additional\ninventory.\n\n11.\nThe store unwraps the pallet, unboxes the product, and transfers it to\nthe shelf, where it will remain until purchased by the consumer.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of steps for a little bottle of dish soap. Those steps are worth\nstudying.\n\nA Value Stream is the set of all steps and all processes from the start of\nyour value-creation process all the way through the delivery of the end\nresult to your customer.\n\nYou can think of the Value Stream as a combination of your value-\ncreation and value-delivery processes. Even though the purposes of these\ncore processes are very different, treating them as one big process can help\nyou improve your ability to deliver the value you create.\n\nThe Toyota Production System (TPS) was the first large-scale\nmanufacturing operation to systematically examine its entire Value Stream\non a regular basis. Analyzing the production system in great detail paved\nthe way for an ongoing series of small, incremental improvements: Toyota\nengineers make more than 1 million improvements to the TPS each year. As\na result, the company reaps huge rewards in speed, consistency, and\nreliability, which has greatly improved Toyota\u2019s Reputation as a company\nwith very high-quality products\u2014that is, until the Paradox of Automation\ndamaged that Reputation, which we\u2019|I discuss in detail later.\n\nThe best way to understand your Value Stream is to diagram it. Tracing\nthe steps or transformations your offer goes through from the beginning to\nthe end is an enlightening process that can show you just how efficient your\nvalue-delivery process is. It\u2019s very common for processes to contain\nunnecessary steps or awkward transitions. Creating a complete diagram of\nyour entire Value Stream takes effort, but it can help you streamline your\nprocess, making the entire system perform better.\n\nIn general, try to make your Value Stream as small and efficient as\npossible. As we\u2019ll examine later in the book when we discuss systems, the\nlonger your process, the greater the risk of things going wrong. The shorter\nand more streamlined your Value Stream, the easier it is to manage and the\nmore value you\u2019ll be able to deliver.\n",

FAIRLESS, FORMER PRESIDENT OF US STEEL\n\n0 nce a sale is made, you must deliver what you promised to your\ncustomer. A Distribution Channel describes how your form of value is\ndelivered to the end user.\n\nThere are two basic types of Distribution Channels: direct-to-user and\nintermediary.\n\nDirect-to-user distribution works across a single channel: from the\nbusiness to the end user. Services are a classic example: when you get a\nhaircut, the value is provided by the business itself to you, with no\nintermediary.\n\nDirect-to-user distribution is simple and effective, but it has limitations\n\u2014you have full control of the entire process, but you can only serve as\nmany customers as your time and energy allow. Once demand for your offer\noutpaces your ability to deliver it, you\u2019re risking disappointing your\ncustomers and diminishing your Reputation.\n\nIntermediary distribution works across multiple channels. When you\npurchase a Product from a store, that store is engaging in Resale. The store\n(in most cases) doesn\u2019t manufacture the Products\u2014it purchases them from\nanother business.\n\nThe business that created the Product can sell it to as many stores as it\nwants, a process called \u201csecuring distribution.\u201d The more distribution a\nProduct has, the more sales the business is likely to make\u2014the more stores\nselling the Product, the more opportunities for sales.\n\nIntermediary distribution can increase sales, but it requires giving up a\ncertain amount of control over your value-delivery process. Trusting\nanother business to deliver your offer to your customers frees up your\nlimited time and energy, but it also increases Counterparty Risk\u2014the risk that\nyour partner will screw up and diminish your Reputation.\n\nImagine you\u2019re in the business of selling cookies and you secure\ndistribution at a local supermarket. The supermarket purchases cookies\nfrom you, places them on their shelves, and sells them to their shoppers at a\npremium. Instead of buying cookies from you, shoppers purchase them via\nthe supermarket: classic intermediary distribution.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see the benefits of this approach, but there are drawbacks.\nLet\u2019s say your cookies are damaged in the supermarket\u2019s truck on the way\nto the store: they break, they crumble, and the box they\u2019re delivered in is\ncrushed. The supermarket\u2019s shoppers won\u2019t know what happened, but if it\nhappens often, they\u2019ll assume that you create a low-quality Product,\ndamaging your Reputation.\n\nSecuring distribution can be valuable, but keep an eye on your\nintermediaries. Distribution isn\u2019t a set-it-and-forget-it strategy\u2014if you\u2019re\nworking with multiple Distribution Channels, plan to devote time and\nenergy to making sure they\u2019re representing your business well.\n",

Those two policies eliminate the risk of making\na bad purchase, so customers are more willing to try Zappos out.\n\nThat\u2019s not, however, the reason Zappos has developed such a solid\nReputation in this market. The secret lies in an unexpected benefit the\n\ncompany doesn\u2019t advertise.\n\nWhen you order from Zappos, it\u2019s likely that you\u2019ll receive a pleasant\nsurprise: your shoes will often arrive a few days ahead of schedule.\n\nZappos could advertise \u201cfree expedited shipping,\u201d but they don\u2019t\u2014the\nsurprise is far more valuable.\n\nA customer\u2019s perception of quality relies on two subjective criteria:\nexpectations and performance. You can characterize this relationship in the\nform of a quasi-equation, which I call the Expectation Effect: Quality =\nPerformance\u2014Expectations.\n\nCustomer expectations have to be high enough for a customer to\npurchase from you in the first place. After the purchase is made, however,\nthe performance of the offering must surpass the customer\u2019s expectations in\norder for them to be satisfied. If performance is better than expectations, the\ncustomer\u2019s perception of quality will be high. If performance is lower than\nexpectations, the perception of quality will be low\u2014no matter how good\nthe offer is in absolute terms.\n\nApple\u2019s first-generation iPhone was a massive success\u2014customers\nexpected something good, and they received a device that delivered benefits\nbeyond their expectations.

The same thing happened again with\nthe launch of the fourth-generation iPhone\u2014a small antenna glitch soured\nmany customers on the device, even though the new version was better than\nthe old in every other respect.\n\nThe best way to surpass expectations is to give your customers an\nunexpected bonus in addition to the value they expect.

A fine product or\nservice is its own best selling point.\n\n\u2014VICTOR KIAM, FORMER OWNER OF REMINGTON PRODUCTS AND THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS\n\nA aron Shira, one of my best friends growing up, cofounded a painting\ncompany with his brother, Patrick, in Columbus, Ohio, USA. Shira Sons\nPainting specializes in large-scale painting projects\u2014they\u2019ve painted\nuniversities, military bases, megachurches, and multimillion-dollar homes.\nHaving started from scratch, they\u2019re now the preferred painting company\nfor several major general contractors in the Columbus area.\n\nHow did two young guys break into a competitive market filled with\ncontractors who have been in business longer than they\u2019ve been alive?\nSimple: when you hire Aaron and Pat, you can be certain the job will be\ndone right and on time.\n\nContractors are notoriously unpredictable: they often show up late, take\ntoo long, do sloppy work, and/or have bad attitudes. The secret of Aaron\nand Pat\u2019s success is Predictability\u2014they do great work every single time,\nthey deliver on schedule, and they\u2019re always pleasant to work with. As a\nresult, they\u2019re booked solid\u2014an impressive achievement, particularly in a\nsoft construction market.\n\nWhen purchasing something of value, customers want to know what\nthey can expect\u2014they want their experience to be predictable. Pleasant\nsurprises can provide a customer with a great experience, but if you\u2019re not\nable to deliver what the customer expects in a predictable manner, it doesn\u2019t\nmatter how many bonuses you offer. People love pleasant surprises, but\nthey hate to be caught off guard.\n\nThere are three primary factors that influence the Predictability of an\noffer: uniformity, consistency, and reliability.\n\nUniformity means delivering the same characteristics every time. Coca-\nCola was one of the first large companies to combine solid marketing with\n\nlarge-scale product uniformity. Product uniformity in the beverage industry\nis an astounding feat: creating, bottling, and distributing soda is a complex\nprocess. A little too much sugar or flavoring, slightly more air, or an\nintroduction of bacteria can drastically alter the final product.\n\nNo one wants their favorite soda to taste different every time they drink\nit. When you open a can of Coke, you expect the same product as you had\nthe last time, no matter where you are in the world. If even 0.1 percent of\nthe cans of Coca-Cola sold were flat or sour, people would stop buying.\n\nConsistency means delivering the same value over time. One of the\nreasons \u201cNew Coke\u201d failed in the mid-1980s was that customers expected\nCoke to taste a certain way, and the company delivered something new\nunder the same name. Violating consistency led to a swift decline in sales,\nfollowed by a swift increase when the Coca-Cola Company restored the\noriginal formula.\n\nViolating the expectations of loyal customers is not the way to success\u2014\nif you\u2019re offering something different, present it as something new.\n\nReliability means being able to count on delivery of the value without\nerror or delay. Ask Microsoft Windows users what they hate most about\ntheir computers, and they\u2019ll always tell you, \u201cSystem crashes.\u201d Unreliability\nis a huge frustration for a user, particularly when Predictability is at a\npremium. How would you feel if you were building a house and a\ncontractor didn\u2019t show up on time?\n\nImproving Predictability has major Reputation and value perception\nbenefits. The more Predictable your standard offering is, the more you\u2019ll be\nable to increase the perceived quality of the Products and the Services that\nyou offer.\n",

Factory\nproduction is the quintessential example of Duplication: one design, many\ncopies. Instead of reinventing the wheel over and over again, Duplication\nallows you to design the wheel once, then make as many of them as you\nwish.\n\nThe better your ability to Duplicate your offer, the more value you can\nprovide. The more time and effort it costs to make something, the less\navailable it tends to be. Duplication allows you to make copies of your\noffer, making it more widely available in a cost-effective way.\n\nConsider this book. In the olden days, books used to be copied and\nbound by hand. It would take a scribe months (sometimes years\u201d) of full-\ntime work to copy a single book. As a result, books were expensive and\ndifficult to obtain.\n\nHow times have changed. This book was written only once, but via the\nwonder of large-scale printing equipment, it can be reproduced in a fast,\nreliable, and inexpensive way. As a result, tens of millions of copies can be\nmade and distributed all over the world and can be purchased for a few\ndollars. That\u2019s the magic of Duplication.\n\nThe internet has made Duplication of some forms of value even easier.\nAs Kevin Kelly remarked in his essay \u201cBetter Than Free,\u201d\u00ae the internet is\n\nan enormous, inexpensive copy machine.

If you have to\nbe personally involved with every customer, there\u2019s an upper limit on the\nnumber of customers you can serve in a given amount of time.

Starbucks is able to enhance its ability to\nDuplicate lattes via Automation. Starbucks employees are involved in\nmaking drinks, but the process is semiautomated: a machine makes the\nespresso, many of the ingredients are prepared ahead of time, and so on.\nThe overall level of human attention or intervention that\u2019s required to make\na good drink is quite small, which is why Starbucks can crank out so many\ndrinks every hour.\n\nIf your goal is to create a business that doesn\u2019t require your direct daily\ninvolvement, scalability should be a major consideration. Products are often\nthe easiest to Duplicate, while Shared Resources (like gyms, etc.) are easiest\nto Multiply.\n\nHumans don\u2018 Scale. Individual people only have so much time and\nenergy each day, which is a Constraint that doesn\u2019t change with the volume\nof work to be done. On the contrary\u2014as we\u2019ll discuss later, in Performance\nLoad, a person\u2019s effectiveness usually goes down as the demands on them\nincrease.\n\nAs a result, Services are often difficult to Scale, since they tend to rely\nheavily on the direct involvement of people to deliver value. As a general\ntule, the less human involvement required to create and deliver value, the\nmore scalable the business.\n",

Instead, they focus on building something new\nand Remarkable, then perfecting it as much as possible.\n\nApple\u2019s competitors, on the other hand, seem to be locked in a never-\nending scramble to keep up. After Apple launched the iPhone in 2007,\nBlackBerry scrambled to create the Storm, which replicated many of the\nsame features. By the time the Storm launched, the iPhone had already gone\nthrough several iteration Cycles, making it very difficult for BlackBerry to\ncompete. To date, Apple has sold hundreds of millions of iPhones\nworldwide, becoming one of the most valuable companies in the world in\nthe process. In contrast, BlackBerry\u2019s share of the global mobile device\nmarket is now approximately 0 percent, down from a high of 20 percent in\n2009.2\n\nIn the same vein, instead of trying to compete with commodity laptop\nmanufacturers like Asus, HP, and Dell in the category of netbooks (small,\nlow-powered computers designed for portability), Apple avoided the market\nfor years. That changed when the iPad was launched in 2010\u2014an offer that\nredefined the market instead of competing with preexisting netbooks on\nfeatures. In the first two months of its existence, the company sold more\nthan two million units. By choosing to innovate instead of compete, Apple\nsuccessfully captured a leadership share of a very competitive market.\n\nEvery improvement you make to your Value Stream makes it harder for\npotential competitors to keep up, creating a Barrier to Competition. By\nincreasing your ability to create and deliver value in an efficient and\neffective way, you make it more difficult for competitors to compete with\nyou by doing what you\u2019re doing.\n\nEvery benefit you deliver and every customer you serve make it harder\nfor competitors to replicate you.

As soon as | arrived, a nurse saw me, took detailed notes\non my symptoms, then directed me to the waiting area.\n\nI waited three hours to see the doctor on call. That was a good thing.\n\nTriage is the process of identifying and handling the most important\nmatters first, allowing less urgent matters to wait. Hospital emergency\nrooms are equipped to deal with a wide variety of ailments, ranging from\ntrivial to life-threatening. There are a limited number of doctors and nurses\navailable to provide care, and in the most severe cases, seconds matter. The\nfirst task of the triage nurse is to identify who needs care right away and\nwho can afford to wait.\n\nIn my case, the mystery stomach pain was extreme at the beginning, but\nit was already improving by the time I arrived at the hospital, and I wasn\u2019t\nexhibiting any of the signs of someone who needed critical care. By the\ntime the doctor on call had capacity to see me, my symptoms had resolved,\nand a few quick tests confirmed there was nothing urgent or critical. While I\nwaited, the doctors and nurses had tended to dozens of patients with severe\nissues that required immediate attention.\n\nTriage, as a strategy, applies to much more than medical care. Not every\ntask on your to-do list has the same impact: some tasks are more important\nand valuable than others; some are time sensitive, while others are not.\nTriage can help you focus on your Most Important Tasks and not feel bad\nabout letting less important tasks slip.\n\nThe same idea applies to most business systems. Most businesses have\nsome sort of customer-support queue, and some requests are more urgent or\nimportant than others. If you have a large, long-term client who is\nexperiencing issues, it is both rational and wise to prioritize resolving their\nproblem before responding to someone with a small free trial account.\n\nYour ability to Triage relies on your ability to collect information\nrelevant to the situation. It\u2019s often helpful to create a defined hierarchy of\npriority for each context, then customize the questions you ask to ensure\nyou have the relevant information needed to categorize each case.\n\nIn a business context, this technique is often referred to as \u201clead\nscoring.\u201d Defining metrics like the strength of each prospect, the projected\nLifetime Value of a customer, or the urgency and importance of each\nincoming request helps you Systematize the support process so you can\nhandle the most important cases first.\n",

Business is not about what you make\u2014it\u2019s\nabout what you keep.\n\nProfit is a very simple concept: it\u2019s bringing in more money than you\nspend. In order for a business to continue to exist, the total revenue it\ncollects must exceed the total expenses it accumulates at some point in the\nforeseeable future. If it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019ll cease to be a business\u2014the operation\nwill run out of resources and close, or it\u20191] become a project subsidized by\nthe Profits of another business. Nothing can operate at a loss forever.\n\nProfit is important because it allows businesses to stay in operation.\nWithout generating Profits, a business can\u2019t compensate its owners, who\nmay be investing considerable time, money, and energy into the operation.\nIf the owners don\u2019t find their investment worthwhile, they\u2019ll close the\nbusiness.\n\nProfit also provides a cushion that allows the business to weather\nunexpected events. If a business is barely generating enough revenue to\ncover its expenses, and those expenses suddenly rise, the business is in a\ngreat deal of trouble. The more profitable the business, the better it will be\nable to handle Uncertainty and Change, and the more options it has to respond\nto the unforeseeable.\n\nProfit is a very important consideration, but it\u2019s not the be-all and end-all\nof business. Some people believe that the purpose of a business is to\nmaximize the amount of Profit generated, but that\u2019s not the only reason\nbusinesses are created. For some people (like me), business is more of a\ncreative endeavor\u2014a way to explore what\u2019s possible, help others, and\nsupport yourself at the same time. From this perspective, as long as you\u2019re\nmaking enough Profit, your business will continue to be successful.\n\nThe concepts you'll learn in this chapter will help you ensure that your\nbusiness creates enough Profit to keep going.\n",

Here\u2019s the formula for Profit Margin:\n\n((Revenue \u2014 Cost) / Revenue) x 100 = % Profit Margin\n\nIf you spend $1 to get $2, that\u2019s a 50 percent Profit Margin. If you\u2019re\nable to create a Product for $100 and sell it for $150, that\u2019s a Profit of $50\nand a Profit Margin of 33 percent. If you\u2019re able to sell the same Product for\n$300, that\u2019s a margin of 66 percent. The higher the price and the lower the\ncost, the higher the Profit Margin. In any case, your Profit Margin can never\nexceed 100 percent, which only happens if you\u2019re able to sell something\nthat cost you nothing.\n\nProfit Margin is not the same as \u201cmarkup,\u201d which represents how the\nprice of an offer compares to its total cost. Here\u2019s the formula for markup:\n\n((Price \u2014 Cost) / Cost) x 100 = % Markup\n\nIf the cost of an offer is $1 and you sell it for $2, your markup is 100\npercent, but your Profit Margin is only 50 percent. Margins can never be\nmore than 100 percent, but markups can be 200 percent, 500 percent, or\n10,000 percent, depending on the price and the total cost of the offer. The\nhigher your price and the lower your cost, the higher your markup.\n\nMost businesses try to keep each offer\u2019s Profit Margin as high as\npossible, which makes sense: the higher the margin, the more money the\nbusiness gets to keep from each sale. Regardless, there are many market\npressures that can lead to a decline in margins over time: aggressive pricing\nby competitors, new offers that decrease demand for older offers, and rising\ninput costs.\n\nBusinesses often use Profit Margin as a way of comparing offers. If a\ncompany has more than one offer in the market, it tends to favor the offers\nwith the highest margins. If a business needs to cut costs, it often starts by\neliminating offers with the lowest margins.\n\nWhen examining a business, pay close attention to Profit Margin. The\nhigher the margin, the stronger the business.\n",

If it doesn\u2019t, the business will have a difficult time\ngenerating enough resources over time to continue operation.\n\nValue Capture is the process of retaining some percentage of the value\nprovided in every Transaction. If you\u2019re able to offer another business\nsomething that will allow it to bring in $1 million of additional revenue, and\nyou charge $100,000, you\u2019re capturing 10 percent of the value created by\nthe Transaction.\n\nValue Capture is tricky. In order to be successful, you need to capture\nenough value to make your investment of time and energy worthwhile, but\n\nnot so much that there\u2019s no reason for your customers to do business with\nyou. People buy because they believe they\u2019re getting more value in the\nTransaction than they\u2019re spending.\n\nThe more value you capture, the less attractive your offer becomes.\nCapture too much and your prospects won\u2019t bother purchasing from you.\nMovies are great, but would you pay $5,000 for two hours of\nentertainment?\n\nThere are two dominant philosophies behind Value Capture:\nmaximization and minimization.\n\nMaximization (the approach taught in most business schools) means that\na business should attempt to capture as much value as possible\u2014capturing\nless than the maximum amount of value possible is unacceptable, and\nchoosing to leave value \u201con the table\u201d is considered a dereliction of duty.\n\nIn the short run, it\u2019s easy to see the appeal of maximization\u2014more Profit\nis a good thing for the owners of a company. But the maximization\napproach tends to erode the reason customers purchase from a business in\nthe first place.\n\nWould you spend $999,999 in order to make $1 million? It may be\nrational (after all, you\u2019d be $1 ahead), but most people won\u2019t bother.\nCustomers purchase from you because they\u2019re receiving more value than\nthey\u2019re giving up in the purchase. The less they receive, the less they\u2019 ll\nwant to buy from you.\n\nThe minimization approach means that businesses should capture as little\nvalue as possible, as long as the business maintains Sufficiency. While this\napproach may not bring in as much short-term revenue as maximization, it\npreserves the value customers see in doing business with the company,\nwhich is necessary for the business\u2019s long-term success.\n\nWhen something is a good deal, customers tend to continue to patronize\nthe business and spread the word to other potential customers. When a\nbusiness tries to maximize revenue by nickel-and-diming its customers or\ntrying to capture too much value, customers flee.\n\nAs long as you\u2019re bringing in enough to keep doing what you\u2019re doing,\nthere\u2019s no need to fight for every last penny. Create as much value as you\ncan, then capture enough of that value to make it worthwhile to keep\noperating.\n",

As the fisherman lashed his boat to the pier, the\nexecutive complimented him on the size and quality of his fish.\n\n\u201cHow long did it take you to catch these fish?\u201d the executive asked.\n\n\u201cOnly a little while,\u201d the fisherman replied.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay out longer and catch more?\u201d the executive asked.\n\n\u201cI have enough to support my family\u2019s needs,\u201d said the fisherman.\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d asked the executive, \u201cwhat do you do with the rest of your time?\u201d\n\nThe fisherman replied, \u201cI sleep late, fish a little, play with my children,\ntake a siesta with my wife, and stroll into the village each evening, where I\nsip wine and play guitar with my friends. I have a full and busy life.\u201d\n\nThe executive was flabbergasted. \u201cI\u2019m a Harvard MBA and I can help\nyou. You should spend more time fishing. With the proceeds, you could buy\na bigger boat. A bigger boat would help you catch more fish, which you\ncould sell to buy several boats. Eventually, you\u2019d own an entire fleet.\n\n\u201cInstead of selling your catch to a middleman, you could sell direct to\nthe consumer, which would improve your margins. Eventually, you could\nopen your own factory, so you\u2019d control the product, the processing, and the\ndistribution. Of course, you\u2019d have to leave this village and move to the city\nso you could run your expanding enterprise.\u201d\n\nThe fisherman was quiet for a moment, then asked, \u201cHow long would\nthis take?\u201d\n\n\u201cFifteen, twenty years. Twenty-five, tops.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen what?\u201d\n\nThe executive laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s the best part. When the time is right,\nyou\u2019d take your company public and sell all of your stock. You\u2019d make\nmillions.\u201d\n\n\u201cMillions? What would I do then?\u201d\n\nThe executive paused for a moment. \u201cYou could retire, sleep late, fish a\nlittle, play with your children, take a siesta with your wife, and stroll into\nthe village each evening to sip wine and play guitar with your friends.\u201d\n\nShaking his head, the executive bade the fisherman farewell. After\nreturning from vacation, the executive resigned from his position.\n\nI\u2019m not sure where this parable originated, but the message is useful:\nbusiness is not necessarily about maximizing Profits. Profits are important,\nbut they\u2019re a means to an end: creating value, paying expenses,\ncompensating the people who run the business, and supporting yourself and\nyour loved ones. Dollars aren\u2019t an end in themselves: money is a tool, and\nthe usefulness of that tool depends on what you intend to do with it.\n\nYour business does not have to bring in millions or billions of dollars to\nbe successful. If you have enough Profit to do the things you need to do to\nkeep the business running and make it worth your time, you\u2019re successful,\nno matter how much revenue your business brings in.\n\nSufficiency is the point where a business is bringing in enough Profit that\nthe people who are running the business find it worthwhile to keep going\nfor the foreseeable future. Paul Graham, venture capitalist and cofounder of\nY Combinator (an early-stage venture capital firm), calls the point of\nSufficiency \u201cramen profitable\u201d\u2019\u2014being profitable enough to pay your rent,\nkeep the utilities running, and buy inexpensive food like ramen noodles.\nYou may not be raking in millions of dollars, but you have enough revenue\nto keep building your venture without going under.\n\nYou can\u2019t create value if you can\u2019t pay the bills. If you\u2019re not bringing in\nsufficient revenue to cover the operating expenses, that\u2019s a major issue. In\norder to keep going, you must be able to pay the employees and the owners\nfor the time, effort, and attention they\u2019re giving to the venture. If these\npeople don\u2019t find their investment sufficiently worthwhile, they\u2019ll stop\ndoing what they\u2019re doing and start doing something else.\n\nYou can track financial Sufficiency using a number called \u201ctarget\nmonthly revenue\u201d (TMR). Since employees, contractors, and vendors are\nusually paid on a monthly basis, it\u2019s relatively simple to calculate how\nmuch money you\u2019!] need to pay out each month. Your target monthly\nrevenue helps you determine whether or not you\u2019ve reached the point of\nSufficiency: as long as you bring in more than your TMR, you\u2019ve reached\nSufficiency. If not, you have work to do.\n\nSufficiency is subjective\u2014it\u2019s up to you to decide how much is enough\nto make your time and effort worthwhile. If your financial needs are\nmeager, you don\u2019t need that much revenue to keep going. If you\u2019re\nspending millions of dollars on payroll, office space, and expensive\nsystems, you\u2019ll need much more revenue to maintain Sufficiency.\n\nThe faster you can reach the point of Sufficiency, the better the chance\nyour business will survive and thrive. The more revenue you generate and\nthe less money you spend, the quicker you\u2019 ll reach the point of Sufficiency.\n\nOnce you reach the point of Sufficiency, you\u2019re successful\u2014no matter\nhow much (or how little) money you make.\n",

The higher a\nbusiness\u2019s revenues, the stronger the company\u2019s Profit Margins, the higher its\nbank balance, and the more promising its future, the higher its Valuation.\n\nMany companies base their financial decisions on what will increase the\nbusiness\u2019s Valuation. Higher estimates of value are beneficial for many\nreasons. If a company is private, having a high Valuation makes it easier to\nborrow money. If the company is public, a high Valuation leads to a high\nshare price and a profit opportunity for the shareholders. If another business\nseeks to acquire the company, a high Valuation leads to a big payday for the\nbusiness\u2019s owners or shareholders.\n\nValuation is also important if you intend to take on investors. The\namount of Capital you raise, as well as the total amount of ownership you\ngive to your investors in exchange, depends on the business\u2019s Valuation at\nthe time of investment. The higher the business\u2019s Valuation, the more\nmoney you\u2019ll be able to command for every share you sell to the investor.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that Perceived Value applies just as much to\nbusinesses as it does to individual offers. When people believe a company\n\nhas bright future prospects, the company\u2019s Valuation increases. If people\nbelieve the company is in trouble, the Valuation decreases. This dynamic\nexplains why some companies, like Amazon, have share prices of more\nthan one hundred times the company\u2019s most recent earnings per share\nreport, while troubled companies sometimes sell for less than the\nliquidation value of their current assets.\n\nValuation is important to consider if you intend to sell shares of the\ncompany to investors or are positioning your business for future acquisition.\nIf you own your own business and never intend to sell it, Valuation\nconsiderations become less important. If you\u2019re an executive of a public\ncompany, building a business you'd like to sell someday, or investing your\ncapital in a company, Valuation may be on the top of your mind every day.\n",

Where\nshould you begin?\n\nI recommend starting with the Cash Flow Statement. We\u2019! examine the\nother basic types of financial statements in a moment, but examining the\nCash Flow Statement is the best place to begin.\n\nThe Cash Flow Statement is straightforward: it\u2019s an examination of a\ncompany\u2019s bank account over a certain period of time. Think of it like a\nchecking-account ledger: deposits of cash flow in, and withdrawals of cash\nflow out. Ideally, more money flows in than flows out and the total never\ngoes below zero.\n\nEvery Cash Flow Statement covers a specific period of time: a day, a\nweek, a month, a year. The time period of the report depends on the\npurpose. Shorter periods, like days and weeks, are most useful for making\nsure the company doesn\u2019t run out of cash. Longer periods, like months and\nyears, are more useful for tracking performance over time.\n\nCash tends to move in three primary areas: operations (selling offers and\nbuying inputs), investing (collecting dividends and paying for capital\nexpenses), and financing (borrowing money and paying it back). Cash Flow\nStatements usually track these sources separately to make it easy to see\nwhere the cash flows come from.\n\nThe nice thing about cash is that it doesn\u2019t lie. Barring outright fraud,\ncash either is in the bank account or it\u2019s not. If the company spends a lot of\nmoney, but less is coming in, the business\u2019s cash position will decrease over\ntime. There\u2019s little room for \u201ccreative interpretation.\u201d\n\nMany investors use a metric called \u201cfree cash flow\u201d when evaluating\ncompanies. This metric comes from the Cash Flow Statement: it\u2019s the\namount of cash a business collects from operations minus cash spent for\ncapital equipment and assets, which are necessary to keep the company\noperating. The higher a company\u2019s free cash flow, the better: it means the\nbusiness doesn\u2019t have to keep investing huge amounts of Capital in order to\ncontinue bringing in money.\n\nIn every business, cash represents Options: the ability to create new\noffers, invest in marketing and sales, hire employees, purchase equipment,\nacquire another company, etc. As a general rule, the more cash your\nbusiness has at its disposal, the more Options it has and the more Resilient\nthe business becomes.\n",

Now that I'm old, | know it is.\n\u2014OSCAR WILDE, RENOWNED SATIRIST\n\nCon is important, but it\u2019s not the whole picture. Cash is not Profit, and\nProfit is what we\u2019re after. It\u2019s possible to have a nice, comfortable cash\nposition for a while but lose money with every sale.\n\nImagine a retailer that buys products from a manufacturer on credit: it\nreceives inventory but doesn\u2019t have to pay the manufacturer for ninety days.\nFor three months, the sales roll in, and the retailer\u2019s cash position grows and\ngrows. To the untrained eye, things look great.\n\nAfter ninety days, the manufacturer\u2019s invoice comes due. When you\ntotal the cost of the products and the retailer\u2019s operating expenses, you\ndiscover the truth: the company lost money, even though the cash balance\nlooked great for three months. If the retailer doesn\u2019t do something, it\u2019ll\neventually run out of money and close. Businesses can\u2019t exist without\nProfits for long.\n\nThe retailer\u2019s error was relying on cash accounting without\nunderstanding its limitations. For many types of businesses, cash\naccounting is ideal: it\u2019s simple and easy to understand. As long as you bring\nin more cash than you spend and you don\u2019t run out of money, life is good.\nI\u2019ve run my businesses using cash accounting for years. I get paid before I\nprovide products and services, and I don\u2019t have an inventory to manage. My\nbusiness isn\u2019t complicated, so my accounting and financial tracking don\u2019t\nneed to be complicated.\n\nFor other businesses, relying on a Cash Flow Statement isn\u2019t enough. If the\nbusiness manages an inventory or extends credit to customers, a simple\ncash flow analysis can be misleading. In order to determine whether or not\nyour sales are profitable, you need to be able to track which sales and\nexpenses are related. By matching each sale with the expenses incurred in\nthe process of making that sale, it\u2019s possible to see if you\u2019re making a Profit\nimmediately, eliminating unpleasant surprises.\n\nFirst, the company must change the way it accounts for expenses.\nInstead of recording revenue when cash flows in and an expense when cash\nflows out, the company must begin tracking revenue and expenses on\nwhat\u2019s called an \u201caccrual\u201d basis.\n\nIn accrual accounting, revenue is recognized when a sale is made (i.e., a\nproduct is purchased, a service is rendered, etc.), and the expenses\nassociated with that sale are incurred in the same time period.\n\nAccountants call this the \u201cmatching principle,\u201d and one of the primary\njobs of an accountant is to match revenue and expense records. This is\nharder than it sounds: an incredible amount of judgment is required, and\nambiguous areas are common. (If you\u2019ve ever wondered what accountants\ndo all day, this is a big part of the job.)\n\nThe result of this effort is an Income Statement, which is sometimes called\na \u201cprofit and loss statement,\u201d \u201coperating statement,\u201d or \u201cearnings\nstatement.\u201d Regardless of the label, the Income Statement contains an\n\nestimate of the business\u2019s Profit over a certain period of time, once revenue\nis matched with the related expenses.\nThe general format for an Income Statement looks like this:\n\nRevenue \u2014 Cost of Goods Sold - Expenses \u2014 Taxes = Net Profit\n\nIncome Statements are very useful: there\u2019s a reason businesses go to the\ntrouble of creating them. By matching expenses with revenue, Income\nStatements make it easier to look at the company\u2019s profitability and make\ndecisions that will improve the company\u2019s bank balance in the weeks and\nmonths to come.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s important to recognize that Income Statements, by nature,\ninclude many estimates and assumptions. They have to: large expenses like\nequipment purchases may involve a huge cash outlay, but the Income\nStatement attributes only a small piece of the expense to each sales period,\na practice called Amortization. This practice helps match the expense to the\nassociated revenue: looking at a huge negative Cash Flow Statement for\nthat period would be misleading.\n\nThe matching principle, for all of its benefits, introduces many sources\nof potential bias in the Income Statement. By changing when revenue is\nrecognized and how expenses are matched to that revenue, accountants and\nfinance professionals can make the \u201cprofit\u201d line skyrocket or plummet by\nchanging a few assumptions or formulas.\n\nExploring every source of potential bias in the Income Statement is way\nbeyond the scope of this book. If you\u2019re interested in more detail on this\ntopic, I highly recommend Financial Intelligence for Entrepreneurs by\nKaren Berman and Joe Knight with John Case.\n\nIf you suspect your business needs accrual accounting to generate an\naccurate Income Statement, don\u2019t do it yourself; talk toa CPA or CFA as\nsoon as possible. The more accurate and reliable your Income Statement is,\nthe better you\u2019ll be able to manage your business: money well spent.\n",

You can think of it as an estimate of the\ncompany\u2019s net worth at the time the Balance Sheet was created.\n\nBalance Sheets always cite a specific day and use this calculation:\n\nAssets \u2014 Liabilities = Owner\u2019s Equity\n\nAssets are things the company owns that have value: products,\nequipment, stock, etc. Liabilities are obligations the firm hasn\u2019t yet\ndischarged: loans, financing, etc. What\u2019s left over when you discharge all of\nthe business\u2019s liabilities is owner\u2019s equity, the company\u2019s \u201cnet worth.\u201d\n\nFor smaller businesses, the Balance Sheet is pretty straightforward:\ncount your cash on hand, add the estimated market value of any assets you\nown, and subtract all debt and current obligations. Voila: you\u2019ve created a\nbasic Balance Sheet.\n\nFor larger businesses, the Balance Sheet is more complicated, and there\nare more entries to keep track of. Common assets include cash, accounts\nreceivable (credit that you\u2019ve extended to customers), inventory, equipment,\nand property. Common liabilities include long- and short-term debt,\naccounts payable (credit that other firms have extended to you), and other\nobligations. Owner\u2019s equity includes the value of the company\u2019s stock,\ncapital from investors, and retained earnings (profit that hasn\u2019t been paid to\nthe company\u2019s shareholders).\n\nWhat makes the Balance Sheet \u201cbalance\u201d is the secondary form of the\ncalculation, which is a rearrangement of the first equation:\n\nAssets = Liabilities + Owner\u2019s Equity\n\nThis calculation looks odd at first: why would you ever want to add\nliabilities and owner\u2019s equity?\n\nHere\u2019s why: when a business borrows money, it receives the amount of\ncash borrowed. That goes on the Cash Flow Statement, and the influx of\nmoney makes it look like the business had a very good month if you don\u2019t\nnotice it\u2019s a loan. When you think about it, the company\u2019s financial picture\ndidn\u2019t change: the business now has more assets (more cash), but it also has\na new liability (more debt). The company\u2019s \u201cnet worth\u201d didn\u2019t change at all.\n\nThe second formula is useful because it reflects this relationship. Let\u2019s\nassume you\u2019re starting a business and you borrow $10,000. Before you\nborrow the money, your Balance Sheet looks like this:\n\n$0 = $0 + $0 (you have no assets, no liabilities, and no equity)\nAfter you borrow the money, your Balance Sheet looks like this:\n\n$10,000 = $10,000 + $0 (you have $10,000 in assets, $10,000 in\nliabilities, and no equity)\n\nBoth sides of the Balance Sheet are the same. The Balance Sheet always\nbalances. If it doesn\u2019t balance, you\u2019ve made an error.\n\nSince Balance Sheets are snapshots of a moment in time, it\u2019s common to\nreview several of them at a time. For example, a company might include\nBalance Sheets calculated on the last day of its fiscal year for the past two\nor three years. Comparing the Balance Sheets makes it easy to see how\nassets, liabilities, and owner\u2019s equity have changed over time.\n\nBalance Sheets are valuable because they answer many important\nquestions about the financial health of a business. By examining a\ncompany\u2019s Balance Sheet, you can determine whether or not the company\nis solvent (i.e., its assets are greater than its liabilities), if it\u2019s having trouble\npaying its bills, or how the company\u2019s value has changed over time.\n\nBalance Sheets, just like income Statements, are full of assumptions and\nestimates that can introduce bias in the numbers. What\u2019s the value of a\nbrand name or Reputation? What percentage of the company\u2019s accounts\nreceivable will be paid? How valuable is the business\u2019s current inventory?\nDon\u2019t skip the footnotes: by examining the assumptions behind the entries\non the Balance Sheet, you\u2019ll develop a more accurate picture of the strength\nof the business.\n",

One of the most effective strategies\nis to calculate a Financial Ratio: a comparison of two important elements of\nyour business.\n\nFinancial Ratios are beneficial because they allow you to make\ncomparisons between businesses. Instead of poring over raw financial data,\nlooking at a Financial Ratio helps you decide at a glance whether or not\ncertain parts of the business are healthy. Looking at how these Ratios change\nover time helps you see how the business is changing over time. Comparing\nthe Ratios to industry averages makes it easy to see if the company is\nperforming like a typical company in the industry or if something is odd.\n\nProfitability ratios indicate a business\u2019s ability to generate Profit. The\nhigher your revenue and the lower your costs, the higher your profitability\nratios. We\u2019ve already discussed Profit Margin, which is a very basic\nprofitability ratio. \u201cReturn on Assets,\u201d which is calculated by dividing net\nprofit by total assets, tells you what percentage of every dollar invested in\nthe business was returned as profit.\n\nLeverage ratios indicate how your company uses debt. \u201cDebt-to-equity\nratios,\u201d which are calculated by dividing total liabilities by shareholders\u2019\nequity, tell you how many dollars a company has borrowed for every $1 in\nowner\u2019s equity. If the Ratio is high, it\u2019s a signal the company is highly\nLeveraged, which could be a bad sign. Other Ratios, like \u201cinterest coverage,\u201d\ncalculate how much of the business\u2019s profit goes to pay off interest on debt.\n\nLiquidity ratios indicate the ability of a business to pay its bills. Running\nout of cash is a serious issue, so ratios like the \u201ccurrent ratio\u201d (current assets\ndivided by current liabilities) and the \u201cquick ratio\u201d (current assets, minus\ninventory, divided by current liabilities) make it easy to determine how\nclose a company is to bankruptcy, or if the business is sitting on cash\ninstead of investing money in growth or improvement.\n\nEfficiency ratios indicate how well a business is managing assets and\nliabilities. The most common use is inventory management: having too little\ninventory is a bad thing, but having too much is also bad. Calculating the\naverage number of days an item is in inventory, how long it takes to sell out\ncurrent inventory, and \u201cday sales outstanding,\u201d a measure of how long it\ntakes to collect the cash from sales, are helpful when making changes in\nproduction, managing inventory on hand, and planning future capital\ninvestments.\n\nThere are thousands of Financial Ratios, and covering them all is way\nbeyond the scope of this book. Financial analysts tend to choose a small set\nof important Ratios based on the industry: it makes no sense to calculate\n\u201cinventory turns\u201d for a barbershop, unless the shop also happens to sell hair\nproducts. Every business has a small number of important Ratios to\nconsider; it\u2019s worthwhile to do a bit of research to see what they are for\nyour industry.\n\nWe'll discuss other Ratios in chapter 10; the technique is useful in many\nareas outside of finance. For now, remember that Financial Ratios are useful\nfor sanity-checking profit, debt, cash, and efficiency without spending too\nmuch time.\n",

The subject is difficult, and good men do not agree.\n\n\u2014ABRAHAM LINCOLN, SIXTEENTH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\nThe purpose of financial analysis isn\u2019t to produce impressive-looking\nspreadsheets: it\u2019s to make better decisions. If the data you\u2019re examining\ndoesn\u2019t lead to changes that improve your business, you\u2019re wasting your\ntime. The core of finance is examining a potential action, consulting the\ndata you have at your disposal, and deciding what (if anything) to do.\n\nCost-Benefit Analysis is the process of examining potential changes to\nyour business to see if the benefits outweigh the costs. Instead of acting on\na change the moment you think of it, you take a step back to evaluate the\ntrue cost of the action and whether or not you believe it\u2019s the best thing you\ncan do with your limited time, energy, and resources.\n\nWhen conducting a Cost-Benefit Analysis, it\u2019s important to include costs\nand benefits that aren\u2019t purely financial. Noneconomic costs, like\nenjoyment, can play a large role in whether or not a project is worth\npursuing. Google\u2019s famous cafeteria benefits are a good example: the\ncompany provides free, high-quality food to employees around the clock.\nThis policy looks like a huge cost until you consider the benefit: by\nproviding breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks, the company is encouraging\n\nemployees to be at work as much as possible. The cost is offset by the\nincrease in productivity and team cohesion, which is very significant.\n\nRemoving chronic frustrations and small inefficiencies can be just as\nbeneficial. I recently spent a few hundred dollars to upgrade my computer\u2019s\nhard disk to a solid-state drive that is six times faster. My applications and\nprograms now launch in less than a second, instead of requiring a five- to\nten-second wait. That doesn\u2019t sound like much, but small improvements\nAccumulate over time. I spend most of my work time on the computer, and\nit\u2019s a huge difference. I\u2019m happier and I\u2019m getting more work done: money\nwell spent.\n\nBefore making a decision, evaluate the total costs and benefits. A little\nevaluation will ensure you spend your money in the most effective ways.\n",

CLASON, THE RICHEST MAN IN BABYLON\n\nB elieve it or not, there are only four ways to increase your business\u2019s\nrevenue:\n\n1.\nIncrease the number of customers you serve.\n\n2.\nIncrease the average size of each Transaction by selling more.\n\n3.\nIncrease the frequency of Transactions per customer.\n\n4.\nRaise your prices.\n\nImagine you\u2019re operating a restaurant and you want to increase the\namount of revenue that your restaurant brings in. Here\u2019s how to apply these\nstrategies:\n\nIncreasing the number of customers means you're trying to bring more\npeople in the door. This strategy is relatively straightforward: more visitors\nto your restaurant will equal more tabs, which (assuming the average\nTransaction size stays the same) will bring in more money.\n\nIncreasing average Transaction size means you\u2019 re trying to get each\ncustomer to purchase more. This is often done through a process called\n\u201cupselling.\u201d When a customer purchases an entr\u00e9e, you offer them\nappetizers, drinks, and dessert. The more of these items the customer\npurchases, the more they spend, and the more revenue you collect.\n\nIncreasing the frequency of Transactions per customer means\nencouraging people to purchase from you more often. If your average\ncustomer comes in once a month, convincing them to patronize your\nbusiness once a week will increase your revenue. The more frequently they\nvisit your establishment, the more revenue your restaurant will bring in,\nassuming the average transaction size stays the same.\n\nRaising your prices means you'll collect more revenue from every\npurchase a customer makes. Assuming your volume, average Transaction\nsize, and frequency stay the same, raising your prices will bring in more\nrevenue for the same amount of effort.\n\nRemember the lesson of Qualification: not every customer is a good\ncustomer. Some customers will sap your time, energy, and resources\nwithout providing the results that you\u2019re looking for. If you\u2019re spending a\nlot of energy serving customers who don\u2019t come in often, have a low\naverage Transaction size, don\u2019t spread the word, and complain about the\nprice, it doesn\u2019t make sense to attract more of those customers.\n\nAlways focus the majority of your efforts on serving your ideal\ncustomers. Your ideal customers buy early, buy often, spend the most,\nspread the word, and are willing to pay a premium for the value you\nprovide.\n\nThe more ideal customers you can attract, the better your business.\n",

If you\u2019d lose less than half of your\ncustomers, it\u2019s probably a good move.\n\nPricing Power is your ability to raise the prices you\u2019re charging over time.\nThe less value you\u2019re capturing, the greater your Pricing Power. Serving\ncustomers takes time, energy, and resources\u2014the more you earn per\ncustomer served, the better your business. Changing your prices can help\nyou maximize your results while minimizing your effort and investment.\n\nPricing Power is related to a concept economists call \u201cprice elasticity.\u201d If\ncustomers are very sensitive to the price of your offer, you\u2019ll lose many\ncustomers with even a slight increase in price, meaning demand is \u201celastic.\u201d\nEstablished semicommodity markets like toothpaste are good examples:\nunless you\u2019re able to create something new and unique that customers badly\nwant, increasing your prices is a good way to ensure that everyone stops\nbuying your product and starts buying from your competitor.\n\nIf your customers aren\u2019t price sensitive, you could quadruple the price\nwith little change in sales. Take luxury goods, for example\u2014customers\npurchase them because they\u2019re expensive Status Signals that are exclusive\nbecause they\u2019re costly. Increasing the price of designer handbags, clothing,\nand watches is likely to make those items more desirable, not less.\n\nEconomists like to spend time graphing and calculating price elasticity,\nbut it\u2019s not necessary\u2014aunless you already have accurate Norms, you can\u2019t\nknow how much Pricing Power you have until you change your prices and\nwatch what happens. Fortunately, unless you\u2019re an established player in a\nlarge and active market (in which case you\u2019ll have Norms to work with),\nchanging your prices very rarely has permanent effects unless your prices\nare broadly publicized and scrutinized; you can experiment to find what\nworks.\n\nPricing Power is important because raising your prices allows you to\novercome the adverse effects of inflation and increased costs. Historically,\ncurrency issued by any government tends to decrease in value over time\u2014\nthere are many strong incentives for officials to increase the supply of\ncurrency, which debases that currency\u2019s Purchasing Power.\n\nAs a result, it takes more currency to purchase the same products and\nservices necessary to stay in business, increasing your business\u2019s financial\n\nSufficiency needs. Without adequate Pricing Power, your business may not\nbe able to maintain Sufficiency in the face of higher expenses.\n\nThe higher the prices you can command, the easier it will be to maintain\nprofit Sufficiency. If you have a choice, choose a market in which you\u2019ll\nhave Pricing Power\u2014it\u2019ll be much easier to maintain Sufficiency over time.\n",

The purpose of a sale is to get a customer.\nBILL GLAZER, ADVERTISING EXPERT\n\nmagine operating a lemonade stand on the sidewalk of a popular tourist\ndestination. Each cup of lemonade costs $1. You may be busy serving\ncustomers, but each customer you serve is just passing by\u2014you\u2019|| probably\nnever see them again.\n\nContrast that with the insurance business. Assume the average customer\npays a premium of $200 per month for term life insurance\u2014that\u2019s $2,400 in\npremiums per customer per year. If the typical customer remains with the\nsame insurance agency for the entire thirty-year term, each client is worth\n$72,000 in premium payments over the lifetime of their relationship with\nthe company. That\u2019s a big difference.\n\nLifetime Value is the total value of a customer\u2019s business over the lifetime\nof their relationship with your company. The more a customer purchases\nfrom you and the longer they stay with you, the more valuable that\ncustomer is to your business.\n\nOne of the reasons Subscriptions are so profitable is that they maximize\nLifetime Value. Instead of making a single sale to a customer, Subscription\nbusinesses focus on providing value\u2014and collecting revenue\u2014for as long\nas possible. The longer a customer remains Subscribed and the higher the\nprice they pay, the higher the Lifetime Value of that customer.\n\nThe higher your average customer\u2019s Lifetime Value, the better your\nbusiness. By understanding how much your average customer purchases\nand how long they tend to buy from you, you can place a tangible value on\neach new customer, which helps you make good decisions. Losing a single\nlemonade-stand customer isn\u2019t a huge deal\u2014losing an insurance client is.\n\nAll told, it\u2019s much better to operate in markets where customers have a\nhigh Lifetime Value.

Not much\u2014you\u2019re only earning $1 per cup of\nlemonade, so you can\u2019t afford to spend much on marketing to individuals.\n\nContrast that with the insurance agency: if the Lifetime Value of a\ncustomer is $72,000, how much could you spend to attract a new customer?\nMuch more.\n\nGetting people\u2019s attention and acquiring new prospects costs time and\nresources. Once you understand the Lifetime Value of a prospect, you can\ncalculate the maximum amount of time and resources you\u2019re willing to\nspend to acquire a new prospect.\n\nAllowable Acquisition Cost (AAC) is the marketing component of Lifetime\nValue. The higher the average customer\u2019s Lifetime Value, the more you can\nspend to attract a new customer, making it possible to spread the word\nabout your offer in new ways.\n\nHaving a customer with a high Lifetime Value even allows you to lose\nmoney on the first sale. Guthy-Renker sells a topical acne treatment called\nProactiv using long-form television infomercials, which are expensive\u2014\nthey hire celebrity endorsers and spend millions to produce and air those\ncommercials. At first glance, it doesn\u2019t make any sense: the first sale is for\nthe \u201clow, low price\u201d of $20. How on earth are they not losing money hand\nover fist?\n\nThe answer is Subscription. When a customer purchases Proactiv, they\naren\u2019t just buying a single bottle of face goo\u2014they\u2019re signing up to receive\n\na bottle every month in exchange for a recurring payment. The Lifetime\nValue of each new Proactiv customer is so high that it doesn\u2019t matter that\nGuthy-Renker \u201cgoes negative\u201d on the initial sale\u2014the company makes a\nton of money, even if it loses money on a few customers who don\u2019t\ncontinue with the program.\n\nThe first sale is sometimes called a \u201closs leader\u201d\u2014an enticing offer\nintended to establish a relationship with a new customer. Banks and\nfinancial services firms will often encourage qualified prospects to open an\naccount by giving them hundreds of dollars in free waivers, gifts, or, in\nsome cases, cash.\n\nThese enticements may absorb up to a year\u2019s worth of Subscription\nrevenue, but the company comes out ahead when you consider the Lifetime\nValue of each customer. When every new client is worth tens of thousands of\ndollars of future income, spending a few hundred dollars to establish a new\naccount makes perfect sense.\n\nTo calculate your market\u2019s Allowable Acquisition Cost, you\u2019ll need to\nknow your desired Profit Margin. Start with your average customer\u2019s Lifetime\nValue, then subtract your Value Stream costs\u2014the Variable Costs required to\ncreate and deliver the value promised to that customer over your entire\nrelationship with them. Then subtract your Overhead divided by your total\ncustomer base, which represents the Fixed Costs required to stay in business\nover that period of time: that\u2019s your net income before marketing expenses.\nMultiple the Lifetime Value by your desired Profit Margin, then subtract\nthat result from your net income before marketing expenses. That\u2019s your\nmaximum Allowable Acquisition Cost.\n\nHere\u2019s an example: if your average Lifetime Value is $2,000 over a five-\nyear period, and the cost of value creation and value delivery is $500, that\nleaves you with $1,500 in revenue per customer served. Assuming your\nOverhead expenses are $500,000 over the same five-year period and you\nhave 500 customers, your Fixed Costs are $1,000 per customer, which\nleaves you with $500 in net income before marketing expenses. If you\u2019re\nshooting for a minimum 15 percent Profit Margin, you can afford to spend\nup to $200 per customer on marketing expenses ($500 \u2014 0.15 x $2,000 =\n$200). If your assumptions are correct, any customer you can attract for\n$200 or less will be worth the investment, giving you a clear budget for\nfuture marketing campaigns.\n\nThe higher the Lifetime Value of your customers, the higher the\nAllowable Acquisition Cost. The more each new customer is worth to your\nbusiness, the more you can spend to attract a new customer and keep them\nhappy.\n",

They added more\nemulsifiers, preservatives, and other chemical additives to keep the\nzombified chocolate together and make it last forever on the shelf.\n\nSounds appetizing, right?\n\nSaving money doesn\u2019t help you if you degrade the quality of your offer.\nAt the time, these \u201ccost-saving\u201d measures didn\u2019t appear to have a huge\nimpact on the chocolate\u2019s quality\u2014they seemed to be a Trade-off worth\nmaking. Over time, however, the accumulated effects undermined the taste\nand quality of the product. People noticed, and so did the manufacturers:\nyou can now buy \u201cpremium\u201d versions that contain the original high-quality\ningredients.\n\nFinance and accounting executives get their bean-counting reputations\nfrom focusing primarily on cutting costs\u2014reducing expenses in an effort to\nmake an offer or business more profitable. Cutting costs can help you\nincrease your Profit Margin, but it often comes at a steep price: the\nIncremental Degradation of your offer.\n\nIf your goal is to increase your profitability, cutting costs can only take\nyou so far. Creating and delivering value will always cost at least some\namount of money, so there is a lower limit to how much you can cut costs\nbefore the cuts begin to diminish the value you provide. Cutting costs that\nare wasteful or unnecessary is a good idea, but Diminishing Returns always\nkick in\u2014be careful not to throw the baby out with the bath water.\n\nCreating and delivering more value is a much better way to enhance\nyour bottom line. You can never spend less than nothing, but there\u2019s no\nupper limit on the amount of value you can provide or revenue you can\ncollect.\n\nControl your costs, but don\u2019t undermine the reason customers buy from\nyou in the first place.\n",

Will the result of my action\nbe a blessing or a heavy burden?\n\n\u2014ALFRED A. MONTAPERT, AUTHOR OF THE SUPREME PHILOSOPHY OF MAN: THE LAWS OF LIFE\n\nY curve created the toy of the century: a stuffed animal that looks and acts\nlike a real dog but doesn\u2019t need to be fed, watered, or let out in the middle\nof the night. Kids go crazy for your Prototype, and parents are already\nthrowing their credit cards at you to make sure they get one the minute it\u2019s\navailable. It\u2019s a foregone conclusion that you\u2019 ll sell millions.\n\nThere\u2019s only one problem: in order to make these faux dogs affordable,\nyou\u2019ll have to tool up a major factory, which will cost at least $100 million.\nYour bank account has nowhere near $100 million in it\u2014that\u2019s a lot of\nmoney. How can a business afford something as expensive as a factory and\nstill make money?\n\nAmortization is the process of spreading the cost of a resource investment\nover the estimated useful life of that investment. In the case of the faux dog\nfactory, let\u2019s assume the factory is capable of producing 10 million units\nduring its useful life. On a per-unit basis, that brings the cost per unit of the\nfactory down to $10. If you sell every unit you produce for $100, there\u2019s\nroom for a very healthy Profit Margin.\n\nAmortization can help you determine whether or not a big expense is a\ngood idea. As long as you have a reliable estimate of how much it will cost\nand how much you can produce, Amortization helps you figure out whether\nor not investing large amounts of Capita! makes sense.\n\nFor example, a book designer may choose to purchase a copy of Adobe\nInDesign, the software often used by professionals to typeset books.\nCompared to most software packages, InDesign is pricey: a single-user\nlicense costs $700. Is it worth it?\n\nThe answer depends on how many books the designer uses the software\nto typeset. If they never complete a project, they\u2019ve wasted their money. If\nthey use it to typeset ten books for $1,000 each, they\u2019ve earned $10,000 by\nmaking a $700 investment\u2014not bad at all. Amortized across ten projects,\nthe cost of the software is only $70 a project, or 7 percent of the revenue\neach project brings in. The designer\u2019s credit card may hurt when the\n\npurchase is made, but the tool offers the ability to earn more money than\nwould be possible otherwise.\n\nAmortization depends on an accurate assessment of useful life, which is\na prediction. Amortization doesn\u2019t work well if you don\u2019t sell what you\nproduce or if your equipment wears out faster than expected. Predictions\nare a tricky business\u2014if you\u2019re wrong in your estimate, your investment\nmay cost a lot more on a per-unit basis than you originally assumed.\n\nCrocs makes funny-looking rubber shoes. After Crocs became an\nunexpected hit, the company ramped up for huge volumes: they opened a\nfactory in China and started producing millions of shoes on the expectation\nthat they\u2019d continue to sell each unit produced. As it turned out, Crocs were\na fad\u2014sales plummeted, and the company was stuck with a lot of expensive\nmanufacturing capacity and huge amounts of inventory it couldn\u2019t sell.\nAmortization couldn\u2019t save the company from careening toward\nbankruptcy.\n\nUsing Amortization to figure out whether or not a big investment is\nworth it is smart\u2014just remember you\u2019re making a prediction, and every\nprediction you make has unavoidable risks.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "All truth is found in the cash account.\n\u2014CHARLIE BAHR, MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT\n\nM oney flows through a business in predictable ways. If you understand\nhow revenue, expenses, receivables, and credit work, you can ensure that\nyou continue to have enough Purchasing Power on hand to continue\noperation and maximize your available options.\n\nThe Cash Flow Cycle describes how cash flows through a business. Think\nof your business\u2019s bank account like a bathtub. If you want the water in the\nbathtub to rise, you add more water and keep it from leaking out via the\ndrain. The more water that flows in and the less that flows out, the higher\nthe level of water in the tub. Revenues and expenses work the same way:\nyour bank account is a Stock of cash that increases or decreases based on\nyour income and payments.\n\nReceivables are promises of payment you\u2019ve accepted from others.\nReceivables are attractive, because they feel like a sale\u2014someone has\npromised to give you money, which is great. There\u2019s a catch, however:\nreceivables don\u2019t translate into cash until the promise is fulfilled. IOUs are\nnot cash\u2014the faster that promise is translated into payment, the better your\n\ncash flow. Many businesses have closed with millions of dollars of \u201csales\u201d\non the books.\n\nDebt is a promise you make to pay someone at a later date. Debt is\nattractive because you can benefit from a purchase now while holding on to\nyour cash until later. The later you pay, the more cash you have at your\ndisposal. Debt can be useful, but there\u2019s also a catch: debts cost additional\nmoney in the form of interest. Very often, you\u2019!! also have to pay back a\nportion of your debt over time, which is called \u201cdebt service,\u201d which you\ncan treat as another type of expense. If you can\u2019t cover your debt service,\nyou\u2019re in trouble.\n\nMaximizing your cash tackles the issue in a direct way: bring in more\nrevenue and cut costs. Increasing your Profit Margin, making more sales, and\nspending less of what you bring in will improve your cash flow.\n\nDeferring payment or negotiating a longer repayment period with your\ncreditors can also help alleviate a cash crunch. If you have a supplier,\nvendor, or partner who is willing to let you pay later in exchange for\nreceiving materials or capabilities now, that allows you to keep more cash\nin your bank account now. You must watch this Habit carefully: debts can\nget out of hand if you don\u2019t keep track of how much you owe and when it\u2019s\ndue. When done properly, however, paying creditors later can be quite\nuseful, particularly for marketing expenses. Borrowing $1 to make $10 is a\ngood trade; it\u2019s even better if you\u2019re able to do that for months before the\nfirst bill comes due.\n\nTo improve your cash situation, it\u2019s best to speed up collections and\nreduce the extension of credit. The faster you get paid, the better your cash\nflow situation. Ideally, try to get paid immediately, even before buying raw\nmaterials and delivering value.\n\nIt\u2019s common in many industries to extend credit to customers, but that\ndoesn\u2019t mean you have to as well. Always remember that you\u2019re a business,\nnot a bank (unless your business involves Loans)\u2014collect any outstanding\npayments as soon as possible.\n\nIf necessary, you can increase your Purchasing Power by taking on\nadditional debt or opening lines of credit. It\u2019s best to avoid using debt or\nlines of credit if you don\u2019t need to, but increasing available credit increases\nyour Purchasing Power. Think of these accounts as backup funding sources\n\u2014for emergency use only.\n\nThe more Purchasing Power you have, the more Resilient your business\nis and the better your ability to handle the unexpected.\n",

The system,\nwhich is intended to reduce cases of fraud and theft, limits a single person\u2019s\nability to complete the following business processes:\n\n1.\n\nAuthorization: reviewing, approving, or overseeing a Transaction.\n2.\n\nCustody: receiving, accessing, or controlling any assets related to\nthat Transaction.\n\n3.\n\nRecord keeping: creating and storing accounting records related to\neach Transaction.\n\n4.\n\nReconciliation: verifying that two sets of records, like internal\ncompany Transaction records and external bank statements, match\nwith respect to timing and amount.\n\nThe core principle behind Segregation of Duties is multiparty\nverification: no individual in the organization is able to complete all four of\nthese processes concerning a single Transaction. In most cases, any specific\nperson might be able to complete one or two of these activities on their\nown, but the rest must be done and/or verified by another individual.\n\nThe classic example of multiparty verification is common corporate\nbanking practice: any check, bank transfer, or other instrument of payment\nabove a certain threshold requires the signature of two authorized officers\nof the company. Unless two signatures are present, the payment isn\u2019t valid\nand is flagged for investigation.\n\nThis simple rule prevents all sorts of financial shenanigans. What\nprevents a CEO from deciding to double their own salary without approval\nfrom the owners or the board of directors? Easy: authorization of the\nincrease by the payroll manager, along with records kept by the payroll\nsystem, which can be used to identify and prove the CEO\u2019s misconduct.\n\nWhat prevents the payroll manager\u2014who has direct access to the\npayroll system\u2014from doubling their own salary? Cash Flow Statements and\nInternal Controls by company executives, which can expose a higher-than-\nexpected expense the payroll manager can\u2019t hide.\n\nWhat prevents the CEO and the payroll manager from conspiring to\nincrease both of their salaries without approval? Bank statements and\ntransaction records, which can signal to the chief financial officer (CFO) or\nother executive officers that something fishy is going on. Every part of the\nsystem is overseen by more than one individual, so misconduct is more\ndifficult to commit and easier to spot.\n\nSegregation of Duties is also useful when dealing with physical assets\nand cash. Having more than one person responsible for ordering, receiving,\nand keeping records of every order and delivery makes it more difficult to\ndivert money or assets in inappropriate ways, since the scheme would\nrequire more than one person to cooperate. Ordering and inventory fraud is\nmore difficult to get away with if there\u2019s another individual who\u2019s expecting\nto receive an order that doesn\u2019t arrive or is charged with auditing the\ninventory records to ensure everything is accurate.\n\nMost fraudulent activity occurs when someone in a position of power or\nresponsibility recognizes the potential opportunity to cheat and believes\nthere\u2019s a low probability of being detected.* Segregation of Duties is a\nsimple and direct way to reduce fraud by cutting it off at the source: it\nreduces potential opportunities for misconduct, raises the probability\nsomeone will discover the wrongdoing, and increases the number of people\nwho would have to work together to defraud the business.\n",

There might be\nadvantages to doing this: everyone in the company would have the ability to\nfix or improve any aspect of the system at any time. There is, however, a\nsevere risk inherent in this approach: everyone in the company would also\nhave the ability to break any part of the system at any time.\n\nIn the worst case, a disgruntled employee or contractor would be able to\nshut down the system, access sensitive information, alter critical data, or\ndelete backups and Fail-safes in a way that would make recovery impossible.\nThere\u2019s also nothing preventing a well-meaning employee or contractor\nfrom accomplishing the same thing by accident. If any of those things\nhappened, it would cause severe damage, up to and including the potential\nbankruptcy and closure of the company.\n\nGranting authorization is an exercise in balancing Friction and Cognitive\nSwitching Penalties against risk: there\u2019s a Middle Path between granting too\nmuch access and granting too little. Authorization is something that should\n\nchange over time on the basis of Trust, Earned Regard, and current\nresponsibilities.\n",

LUCE, PUBLISHER AND FOUNDER OF TIME INC.\n\nL et\u2019s say you decide to quit your $50,000-a-year job and start a business.\nStarting the business will have costs of its own, but it will also cost you the\n$50,000 you would have made had you stayed at your job.\n\nOpportunity Cost is the value you\u2019re giving up by making a Decision. We\ncan\u2019t do everything at once\u2014we can\u2019t be in more than one place at a time\nor spend the same dollar on two different things.\n\nWhenever you invest time, energy, or resources, you\u2019re choosing not to\ninvest that time, energy, or resources in any other way. The value that would\nhave been created by your Next Best Alternative is the Opportunity Cost of\nthat decision.\n\nOpportunity Cost is important because there are always other options. If\nyou\u2019re working for a company that\u2019s paying you $30,000 a year and you\nhave the option to move to a company that\u2019s paying $200,000 a year for the\nsame work, why would you stay? If you\u2019re paying your employees or\ncontractors less than they could make elsewhere for the same work, why\nwould they work for you? If your customers can spend $20 to get\nsomething you\u2019re charging $200 for, why would they buy from you?\n\nOpportunity Cost is important because it\u2019s hidden. As we\u2019ll discuss later,\nin Absence Blindness, humans have a hard time paying attention to what\u2019s\nnot present. Paying attention to what you\u2019re giving up by making a\nDecision helps you consider all of your options before making a decision.\n\nObsessing over Opportunity Cost too much, however, can drive you\ncrazy. If you\u2019re a natural maximizer (like I am), it\u2019s tempting to overanalyze\nevery Decision to make sure you\u2019ve chosen the very best option available,\nwhich can go well past the point of Diminishing Returns. Don\u2019t get bogged\n\ndown with all of the options available\u2014consider only what appear to be the\nbest alternatives at the time of your decision.\n\nIf you pay attention to the Opportunity Costs of your decisions, you\u2019ll\nmake much better use of the resources at your disposal.\n",

Having the money now means you\ncan spend it now, or invest it now. A million dollars, invested at a\nCompounding interest rate of 5 percent, will be $1,276,281.56 five years\nfrom now. Why give up the extra $270,000 if you don\u2019t need to?\n\nA dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow. How much more\ndepends on what you choose to do with that dollar. The more profitable\noptions you have to invest that dollar, the more valuable it is.\n\nCalculating the Time Value of Money is a way of making Decisions in the\nface of Opportunity Costs. Assuming you have various options of investing\nfunds with various returns, the Time Value of Money can help you\ndetermine which options to choose and how much you should spend, given\nthe alternatives.\n\nLet\u2019s go back to the $1 million example: Assume someone offers you an\ninvestment that will deliver $1 million risk free in one year\u2019s time. What\u2019s\nthe maximum amount you should be willing to pay for it today?\n\nAssuming your Next Best Alternative is another risk-free investment with a\n5 percent interest rate, you shouldn\u2019t pay anything more than $952,380.\nWhy? Because if you took that amount and invested it in your Next Best\nAlternative, you\u2019d have $1 million: $1,000,000 divided by 1.05 (the 5\npercent interest/discount rate) equals $952,380. If you can buy the first\ninvestment for less than that amount, you\u2019ll be ahead.\n\nThe Time Value of Money is a very old idea\u2014it was first explained in\nthe early sixteenth century by the Spanish theologian Martin de Azpilcueta.\n\nThe central insight that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow\ncan be extended to apply to many common financial situations.\n\nFor example, the Time Value of Money can help you figure out the\nmaximum you should be willing to pay for a business that earns $200,000\nin profit each year. Assuming an interest rate of 5 percent, no growth, and a\nforeseeable future of ten years, the \u201cpresent value\u201d of that series of future\ncash flows is $1,544,347. If you pay less than that amount, you\u2019ll come out\nahead as long as your assumptions are correct. (Note: this is the \u201cdiscounted\ncash flow method\u201d we discussed in the section on the Four Pricing Methods.)\n\nThe Time Value of Money is a versatile concept, and a full exploration\nof it is beyond the scope of this book. For a more in-depth examination, I\nrecommend picking up The McGraw-Hill 36-Hour Course in Finance for\nNonfinancial Managers by Robert A. Cooke.\n",

Not bad at all.\n\nCompounding is important because it creates the possibility of huge\ngains in short periods of time. If you reinvest the revenue your business\ngenerates and your business is growing rapidly, you can multiply your\noriginal investment many times over.

OLSEN, COFOUNDER OF THE DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORPORATION\n\nU sing \u201cother people\u2019s money\u201d sounds like a great way to make a fortune.\nBorrow some money, make a fortune, pay back your lender, and keep the\nrest. What could be better?\n\nMaking money by borrowing from others can be savvy, provided you\u2019re\naware of the risks.\n\nLeverage is the practice of using borrowed money to magnify potential\ngains. Here\u2019s an example: let\u2019s assume you have $20,000 you\u2019d like to\ninvest in real estate. You could use that money as a 20 percent down\npayment on a $100,000 property, borrowing $80,000, but that ties up all of\nyour money in a single investment.\n\nInstead of using the $20,000 for a single down payment, you could take\nthe same pool of money and invest in four $100,000 properties, each with a\ndown payment of $5,000. That strategy requires borrowing $95,000 four\ntimes\u2014a total of $380,000 in loans.\n\nHere\u2019s where the magic happens. Let\u2019s assume all of the properties\ndouble in value, and you sell them. In the first scenario, you\u2019d make\n$100,000 on a $20,000 investment\u2014a 5x return on your $20,000 down\npayment. In the second scenario, you\u2019d make $400,000 on the very same\n$20,000 down payment\u2014a 20x return on investment. Leverage seems like <\nno-brainer, right?\n\nNot so fast\u2014what will happen if the value of each property drops, and\nyou sell them all to get back as much money as possible? Assuming the\nproperty value drops by 50 percent, in the first scenario you'd lose $50,000.\nIn the second scenario, the use of Leverage will magnify your losses to\n$200,000\u2014four times as much.\n\nLeverage is a form of financial Amplification\u2014it magnifies the potential\nfor both gains and losses. When your investment pays off, Leverage helps it\npay off more. When your investment tanks, you lose more money than you\nwould otherwise.\n\nOne of the major contributing factors of the recession of 2008-2009 was\nthe use of enormous amounts of Leverage by investment banks. It wasn\u2019t\nuncommon for banks to Leverage their investments by a factor of thirty or\nforty. Millions (or billions) of dollars were made or lost when the value of a\nparticular stock went up or down by a single percentage point. When the\nmarket crashed, a bank\u2019s losses were magnified by the amount of Leverage\nit had taken on, which was more than enough to threaten the entire firm\u2019s\nexistence.\n\nUsing Leverage is playing with fire\u2014it can be a useful tool if used\nproperly, but it can also burn you. Never use Leverage unless you\u2019re fully\naware of the consequences and are prepared to accept them. Otherwise,\nyou\u2019re putting your business and personal financial situation at risk.\n",

Demand for your invention is a given\u2014all you need to do is create\nenough devices to fill the demand.\n\nThere\u2019s a problem, however\u2014estimates indicate that tooling up a\nproduction line with the equipment you need to build these devices will cost\n$1 billion, but you don\u2019t have $1 billion to spare. Your device solves a huge\nproblem, but the next step is out of reach. What do you do?\n\nFunding can help you do things that would otherwise be impossible with\nyour current budget. If your business requires expensive equipment or many\nworkers to create and deliver value, you\u2019!l probably need outside funding.\nFew of us have enormous sums of money in our bank accounts waiting to\nbe used, but it\u2019s easy to reach out to those who do.\n\nFunding is the business equivalent of rocket fuel. If your business needs\nto move faster and is already pointed in the right direction, judicious use of\nfinancing can help you accelerate the operation\u2019s growth. If the business has\nstructural issues, it will explode, and not in a good way.\n\nIn order to obtain access to funding, it\u2019s often necessary to give up a\ncertain amount of control over the business\u2019s operations. Businesspeople\nwon\u2019t give you money for nothing\u2014they always ask for something in\nreturn.\n\nRemember, providing Capital is a form of value for many businesses. In\nexchange for resources, your lenders or investors are looking for value in\nreturn\u2014interest, lease payments, or a share of your company\u2019s profits.\nThey\u2019re also looking for a way to decrease their risk of losing everything if\nthe business goes under. To alleviate this risk, they ask for control: the\nability to influence the operations of the business. The more money you ask\nfor, the more control they\u2019ll want.\n\nI think it\u2019s useful to imagine a Hierarchy of Funding: a ladder of available\noptions. Every businessperson starts on the bottom and climbs as far up the\nladder as necessary. The higher you climb, the more funding you get and\nthe more control you give up in exchange.\n\nLet\u2019s examine the Hierarchy of Funding, starting at the bottom:\n\nPersonal cash is by far the best form of financing. Investing cash you\nalready own is quick and easy and requires no approval or paperwork. Most\nentrepreneurs begin by financing themselves out of cash as much as\npossible.\n\nPersonal credit is another low-cost method of financing. As long as your\nneeds don\u2019t exceed a few thousand dollars, it\u2019s easy to finance expenses via\npersonal credit. Approval is quick if you have good credit, and payment\nover time helps increase your cash flow. You risk ruining your personal\ncredit rating (a form of Reputation) if you can\u2019t make your payments, but for\nmany entrepreneurs, that\u2019s a risk worth taking.\n\nI financed my entire business out of cash and personal credit. If your\nneeds are modest, using personal credit to finance your start-up costs is a\ngood option as long as you watch your budget.\n\nPersonal loans are often made by friends and family. If you need more\nmoney than you can cover via personal cash and personal credit, Loans from\nfriends and family are not uncommon. Just be wary: the risk that you won\u2019t\nbe able to pay them back is very real and can have a devastating effect on\nimportant personal relationships. For that reason, I\u2019d advise avoiding asking\nyour parents or grandparents to gamble their life savings on your idea\u2014\nthere are better ways.\n\nUnsecured loans are usually made by banks and credit unions. You fill\nout an application and ask for a certain amount of money, and the bank will\nevaluate your ability to pay the loan back with interest over a certain time\nperiod. The loan can be either a lump sum or a line of credit that can be\nused at any time. The bank doesn\u2019t ask for collateral for smaller amounts (a\nfew thousand dollars), so the interest rate will probably be a bit higher than\non a credit card or secured loan.\n\nSecured loans require collateral. Mortgages and automotive loans are\ngood examples of secured loans: if you don\u2019t make the payments, the lender\ncan legally seize the property promised as collateral. Because the lender can\nthen sell that property to recoup their funds, secured loans are much larger\nthan unsecured loans\u2014tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nBonds are debt sold to individual lenders. Instead of asking a bank for a\nloan, the business asks individuals or other companies to loan them money.\nBond purchasers give money to the business, which is paid back at an\nagreed-upon rate for a certain amount of time. When the time expires (i.e.,\nthe bond \u201cmatures\u201d), the company must give back the original loan amount\nin addition to the payments already made. The legal and regulatory process\nthat surrounds the bond market can be complicated, so bond issues are\nusually conducted through an investment bank.\n\nReceivables financing is a special type of secured lending unique to\nbusinesses. Receivables financing can make millions of dollars in credit\navailable, but at a cost: the collateral for the loan is control over the\nbusiness\u2019s receivables. Since the bank controls the receivables, they can\nensure their loan is paid before anything else, including employee salaries\nand vendor commitments. Large amounts of funding are available, but\nyou\u2019re giving up a great deal of control to the lender.\n\nAngel capital is where we shift from Loans to Capital. An \u201cangel\u201d is an\nindividual private investor\u2014someone who has excess wealth they'd like to\ninvest in a private business, usually $10,000 to $1 million. In exchange,\nthey\u2019ll own 1 to 10 percent of the business.\n\nTaking on an angel investor is a bit like taking on a silent partner\u2014they\ngive you Capital, and in exchange you give them partial legal ownership of\nthe business. Some angels offer advice and are available for consulting, but\nthey don\u2019t have the power to make business decisions.\n\nVenture capital takes over where angels leave off. Venture capitalists\n(VCs) are wealthy investors (or groups of investors who pool their funds)\nwith very large sums of Capital available: tens (or hundreds) of millions of\ndollars in a single investment. Funding via venture capital happens in\n\u201crounds\u201d that start small, then grow as more Capital is needed. Later rounds\ncan dilute the ownership percentage of current shareholders, so there\u2019s often\na great deal of negotiation involved. VCs also require large amounts of\ncontrol in exchange for large amounts of Capital, which usually means seats\non the company\u2019s board of directors.\n\nPublic stock offerings involve selling partial ownership of the company\nto investors on the open market. This is usually done via investment banks:\ncompanies that will provide a business with enormous amounts of Capital\nin exchange for the shares of that company to sell on the public stock\nmarket. The investment banks make money by selling the shares they\u2019ve\npurchased at a premium to individual investors on the open market. An\n\u201cjnitial public offering\u201d (IPO) is the first public stock offering a company\noffers on the open market.\n\nAny investor who purchases shares is a partial owner of the company,\nwhich includes the right to participate in management decisions via electing\nthe board of directors. Whoever owns the most shares in the company\ncontrols it, so \u201cgoing public\u201d creates the risk of a hostile takeover: the mass\npurchasing of shares in an effort to control the company.\n\nPublic stock offerings are usually used by angel and venture capital\ninvestors to exchange ownership for money. Investors can collect their\nreturns in one of two ways: reaping dividends that distribute the Profits of\nthe company or selling their shares to another investor. Public stock\nofferings enable investors to sell their shares in exchange for money, so it\u2019s\ncommon for angels and VCs to push successful companies to \u201cgo public\u201d or\nbe acquired by another company in order to \u201ccash out\u201d of the investment.\n\nThe more control you must give up for each dollar of funding obtained,\nthe less attractive the source of funding. The more people you\u2019re required to\nconsult with before making decisions, the slower your company will\noperate. Investors increase Communication Overhead, which can adversely\naffect your ability to get things done.\n\nIt\u2019s also not uncommon for investors to remove executives of a company\nthat\u2019s not performing well, even if those executives are the founders of the\ncompany. Even high-flying executives aren\u2019t immune: when Apple was\nperforming poorly in the 1990s, the board of directors fired Steve Jobs from\nthe company he cofounded. A word to the wise: before you take on large\namounts of Capital, be aware of how much Power the business\u2019s board of\ndirectors will have over the operation of the company.\n\nFunding can be useful, but be wary of giving up control over your\nbusiness\u2019s operations\u2014unless the funds are essential, err on the side of\nmaintaining your autonomy.\n",

If\nyou\u2019re grasping for the brass ring\u2014accumulating enormous wealth by\nbuilding a massive public company\u2014you\u2019ll probably need financing. If\nyour intent is to be self-sufficient and free to make your own decisions, it\u2019s\nmuch better to avoid financing in favor of retaining control.\n\nBootstrapping is the art of building and operating a business without\nfunding. Don\u2019t assume that the only way to create a successful business is\n\nby raising millions of dollars of venture capital\u2014it\u2019s not true. By limiting\nyourself to the use of personal cash, personal credit, the business\u2019s revenue,\nand a little ingenuity, you can build successful businesses without seeking\nfunding at all. My business operates via a checking account, a savings\naccount, and a business credit card, and | like it that way.\n\nBootstrapping allows you to grow your business while maintaining 100\npercent control over the business\u2019s operations. You don\u2019t have to get anyone\nelse\u2019s approval to make the decisions you think are best. The drawback is\nthat growing the business can take much longer. Prudently used, funding\ncan help make things happen faster than they\u2019d happen otherwise.\n\nIf you accept funding, make sure that you use it to do things that you\ncouldn\u2019t do any other way. Force Multipliers are useful but expensive\u2014taking\non funding in order to get access to critical capabilities can be smart.\nOtherwise, try to operate from cash and operating revenue as much as\npossible.\n\nFor best results, Bootstrap as far as you can go, then move up the\nHierarchy of Funding only as needed.

WARD, APHORIST\n\nW hen you invest in something, you expect it to provide more value than\nyou paid for it. Knowing how to estimate how much you'll receive versus\nhow much you'd invest is a very useful skill.\n\nReturn on Investment (RO) is the value created from an investment of time\nor resources. Most people think of ROI in terms of currency: if you invest\n$1,000 and you collect $100 in profit, that\u2019s a 10 percent return on your\ninvestment: ($1,000 + $100) / $1,000 = 1.10, or 10 percent. If your ROI is\n100 percent, you\u2019ve doubled your initial investment.\n\nReturn on Investment can help you decide between competing\nalternatives. If you deposit money in a savings account, the return on your\ninvestment will be equal to the interest rate that the bank gives you to hold\n\nyour money. Why put your money in an account that pays 1 percent interest\nif you can deposit that money in an account that pays 2 percent, with no\ndifference in fees?\n\nThe usefulness of Return on Investment extends far beyond money: you\ncan use it for the other Universal Currencies as well. Return on invested time\nis an useful way to analyze the benefits of your effort. If you were forced to\nwork twenty-four hours a day nonstop for a year in exchange for $1 million,\nwould you do it? When you look at the return versus the cost to your time\nand sanity, it\u2019s not worth it.\n\nThe return on every investment is always related to how much the\ninvestment costs. The more you spend (in terms of both money and time),\nthe lower your return. Even \u201csure bets\u201d like buying a house or getting a\ncollege degree aren\u2019t wise if you pay too much for them. Every estimate of\nreturn is speculative\u2014you never know how it\u2019!l turn out. Calculating\nreturns is an exercise in predicting the future, which is fundamentally\nimpossible.\n\nEvery future ROI estimate is a semieducated guess. You can only know\nyour ROI for certain after the investment is made and the returns collected.\nNothing in this world is a sure bet\u2014always take into account the risk of\nsomething going wrong before making an investment, no matter how high\nthe potential ROI appears to be.\n",

FIELDS, COMEDIAN\n\nA fter returning from World War II, my grandfather started the Kaufman\nConstruction Company, building storefronts, homes, union halls, and\napartment buildings in Akron, Ohio. In 1965, after twenty-five years in the\nbusiness, he kicked off his most ambitious project: a five-story, twenty-six-\nunit apartment building on Portage Path.\n\nThe \u201cBaranel\u201d was to be built on the lots of two older homes, which had\nbeen purchased and demolished for the job. Steel rebar and bricks had been\n\nordered, and excavation was proceeding as planned. The expected cost of\nthe project was $300,000, roughly $2.4 million in today\u2019s dollars.\n\nThe project proceeded smoothly until the excavators found huge hidden\ndeposits of blue clay, which could make the foundation unstable. To\ncontinue the project, thousands of cubic feet of clay and dirt would have to\nbe excavated to reach bedrock, and additional concrete and rebar would be\nrequired to fill the massive hole. Completing the building would cost far\nmore than originally expected, but it was difficult to determine how much.\n\nInstead of walking away, Grandpa decided to finish the project\u2014he\u2019d\nalready spent so much money on the land and excavation that it felt wrong\nto \u201cwaste it\u201d without having something to show for the effort and\ninvestment. He found a few investors, put up another apartment building\nand the family home as collateral, and the project continued.\n\nBy the time the building was complete, they\u2019d spent more than three\ntimes as much money as originally planned: approximately $1 million,\nmore than $8 million in today\u2019s dollars when adjusted for inflation. It was\nmore than the building was worth. Grandpa spent the rest of his career\nhandling angry investors and lawyers. It\u2019s a sad story, but one worth\nlearning from.\n\nSunk Costs are investments of time, energy, and money that can\u2019t be\nrecovered once they\u2019ve been made. No matter what you do, you can\u2019t get\nthose resources back. Continuing to invest in a project to recover lost\nresources doesn\u2019t make sense\u2014all that matters is how much more\ninvestment is required versus the reward you expect to obtain.\n\nAvoiding the perils of Sunk Costs is easy to understand conceptually but\nmuch harder to put into practice. When you sink years of work into a career\nyou realize you don\u2019t want, or millions of dollars into a project that\nunexpectedly requires millions more, it\u2019s difficult to walk away. You\u2019ve\ninvested so much that it feels wrong to \u201cgive it up for nothing.\u201d In reality,\nthere\u2019s nothing you can do about your past investment\u2014it\u2019s gone. All you\ncan do is act based upon the information you have now.\n\nMaking mistakes is inevitable: no one is perfect. You will make a few\ndecisions that, in retrospect, you\u2019ll wish you hadn\u2019t\u2014count on it. If you\ncould turn back time, you\u2019d try a different approach, but you can\u2019t. There\nwill always be other projects, provided you don\u2019t double down on a risky\nproject to recover your losses. Throwing good money after bad is not a\nwinning strategy.\n\nDon\u2019t continue to pour concrete into a bottomless pit\u2014if it\u2019s not worth\nthe additional investment, walk away. You never have to earn back money\nin the same way you lost it. If the reward isn\u2019t worth the investment\nrequired to obtain it or the risk, don\u2019t invest.\n",

Over time, these patterns become useful for budgeting, supervising\noperations, complying with laws and regulations, and preventing theft and\nfraud.\n\nInternal Controls are a set of specific Standard Operating Procedures a\nbusiness uses to collect accurate data, keep the business running smoothly,\nand spot trouble. The better a company\u2019s Internal Controls, the more\nreliable its financial reports, and the more confidence you can have in the\nquality of the company\u2019s operations. Internal Controls are most useful in\nthree areas:\n\nBudgeting is the act of estimating future costs and taking steps to ensure\nthat these estimates aren\u2019t exceeded without good reason. Budgets are very\nimportant in controlling Profit Margins, the Cash Flow Cycle, and Leverage. If\npart of your business breaks the budget in a given time period, you can take\naction to correct the situation.\n\nSupervision is important in businesses that rely on employees or outside\nfirms for important parts of their business process. By establishing controls\nrelated to delivery time, quality, cost, and systems failures, it\u2019s possible to\nconduct evaluations and make changes in operations if necessary if\nstandards appear to slip or performance targets aren\u2019t met.\n\nCompliance is necessary when a business operates in an industry\naffected by government regulations. The company may be obligated to\ncollect and report certain data in the course of operations. Internal Controls\n\nensure that this data is complete and accurate, preventing risks, significant\nlosses, and potential legal issues.\n\nTheft and fraud prevention is important to protect against the risk of\nfinancial loss at the hands of an unscrupulous party. Solid Internal Controls\nmake it easier to notice something is amiss, identify the responsible party,\nand resolve the situation with a minimum of fuss.\n\nIn all of these areas, it\u2019s useful to have a dispassionate third party audit\nyour data and control processes. Auditing is necessary to find and correct\nerrors, particularly in large businesses with many moving parts. Auditing\nhelps ensure the quality of the company\u2019s data and can increase the\nconfidence of lenders, investors, shareholders, and regulatory bodies\nregarding the business\u2019s practices. In all cases, the auditing party should\nhave no interest in the outcome: this Segregation of Duties helps ensure the\nresults are accurate, particularly if they\u2019re not pretty.\n\nFinancial controls also help you to benchmark your company against\nother companies in your market. Every year, the Risk Management\nAssociation (RMA) compiles a huge amount of data from businesses in all\nindustries. The RMA data set makes it easier to discover what solvent\nbusinesses of various sizes spend on marketing, sales, and value delivery\nover a given period of time.\n\nBanks and investors rely on RMA data to determine whether or not a\nbusiness they\u2019re examining is typical. If the company\u2019s costs are in line\nwith revenues, outside parties are likely to assume the business has a lower\nrisk profile. If the company is spending three times the typical amount on\nsales and marketing, it can be a signal of trouble, inefficiency, or shady\naccounting.\n\nIndustry groups can also be a useful source of data. Many markets have\ntrade associations that collect and share information about successful\nbusinesses. By comparing your business\u2019s data to that of other companies in\nyour market, you can get a better picture of how well you\u2019re performing\nand where your business could use improvement.\n",

In the evening, you\u2019ll sit around the fire the\ngroup has built to cook food and keep predators away, and you\u2019! discuss\nthe day and tell stories until you drift off to sleep. Tomorrow, you\u2019 ll do it all\nover again.\n\nHuman biology is optimized for conditions that existed a hundred\nthousand years ago, not for the world in which we live today. Food is\neverywhere; predators are not. You no longer have to be in constant motion;\ninstead, you probably spend most of your time occupied by sedentary\nactivities, like computer and office work. As a result, we face many new\nthreats to our brains and bodies, like obesity, heart disease, diabetes,\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease, and cancer.\n\nI call this state of affairs Caveman Syndrome: your brain and body aren\u2019t\noptimized for the modern world. Part of the challenge of working in the\nmodern world is that our brains and bodies are tuned for physical and social\nsurvival, not sixteen-hour workdays. Business hasn\u2019t been around long\nenough for our biology to adapt to the new demands we\u2019re placing upon\nourselves.\n\nDon\u2019t be too hard on yourself\u2014you weren\u2019t built for the type of work\nyou\u2019re currently responsible for. No one is\u2014we\u2019re all running demanding\nnew software on ancient hardware.\n",

That voice is sometimes electric with excitement, but\nmore often it\u2019s uncertain, concerned, or scared.\n\nFortunately, \u201cyou\u201d are not that voice.\n\n\u201cYou\u201d are only a small part of your brain. The voice in your head is just\na radio announcer, commenting on what your brain is doing. It is not you\u2014\nyour consciousness is what your brain uses to solve problems it can\u2019t handle\non autopilot.\n\nSince human behavior has its roots in the brain, it\u2019s very useful to\nunderstand how your brain is constructed. Here\u2019s a brief (and\noversimplified) look at how your brain works.\n\nHumans have an Onion Brain\u2014our brain has several layers, which sit on\ntop of one another. At the core is a structure called the hindbrain, which is\nresponsible for keeping you alive. The hindbrain is responsible for all of the\nphysiological functions necessary for survival: heart rate, sleeping, waking,\nreflexes, muscle movements, and biological urges.\n\nLocated at the base of the brain, the hindbrain is sometimes called the\n\u201clizard brain\u201d because this basic neurological structure appears in all of our\nbiological precursors, including reptiles and amphibians. The hindbrain is\nprimarily responsible for generating signals that are passed down through\nyour spinal cord and nerves to every part of your body, resulting in your\nphysical actions.\n\nAbove your hindbrain is the midbrain, which is responsible for\nprocessing sensory data, emotion, memory, and Pattern Matching. Our\nmidbrain predicts what will happen next, then sends that information to the\nhindbrain, which readies our body for immediate action. The midbrain is\nthe radio announcer, and the hindbrain is the radio.\n\nSitting just above the midbrain is a thin, folded layer of tissue\u2014the\nforebrain. This small sheet of neural matter is responsible for the cognitive\ncapabilities that make us human: self-awareness, logic, deliberation,\nInhibition, and Decision.\n\nDevelopmentally speaking, the forebrain is very new and likely evolved\nto help us handle ambiguity. Most of the time, our midbrain and hindbrain\nrun the show\u2014we\u2019re operating on instinct and autopilot. That changes,\nhowever, when we face something unexpected or unfamiliar, which\nconfounds the midbrain\u2019s ability to predict what will happen next. That\u2019s\nwhen the forebrain kicks into gear, gathering data and considering options.\n\nAfter some deliberation and analysis, the forebrain decides what to do\nbased on what appears to be best at the time. Once a Decision is made, the\nmidbrain and hindbrain assume normal operation and carry out the decision.\n\nNeuroscientists are probably ready to shoot me at this point, but this\nvery basic model of the brain is accurate enough to be useful.* My friend P.\nJ. Eby uses a great analogy to explain the relationship between the different\nparts of your mind: your brain is a horse, and \u201cyou\u201d are the rider. Your\nhorse is intelligent\u2014it moves on its own, can identify challenges, and will\nbalk at things that appear dangerous or scary. But you, the rider, are there to\nset a direction and reassure the horse that it\u2019s safe to proceed.\n\nOne of the best things you can do to get more done is to dissociate\nyourself from the voice in your head. The radio announcer has the attention\nspan of a two-year-old after drinking a triple espresso. Its job is to highlight\nthings in your environment you may be interested in paying attention to\u2014\nthings that may fulfill one of your Core Human Drives or present some danger.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the voice is always right or that you must take\neverything it says as gospel truth.\n\nMeditation is a simple practice that can help you separate \u201cyou\u201d from\nthe voice in your head. There\u2019s nothing mystical or magical about\nmeditation\u2014you sit, breathe in and out, and watch what your \u201cmonkey\nmind\u201d does without associating yourself with it. After a while, the voice\nbecomes quieter, improving your ability to keep yourself on the course you\nchoose.\n\nA few moments of quiet meditation every day can be the difference\nbetween feeling scared and overwhelmed and feeling in control of your\ndestiny.\n",

Behavior is the contral of perception\n\n\u2014WILLIAM T. POWERS, SYSTEMS THEORIST\n\nn the hallowed halls of businesses (and business schools) around the\nworld, B. F. Skinner is the hidden king.\n\nSkinner was one of the major intellectual forces behind the \u201cbehaviorist\u201d\nmovement in psychology\u2014the idea that biological systems always respond\na certain way to certain stimuli. Control the stimuli and you can control the\nbehavior. \u201cCondition\u201d the organism with rewards and punishments, and the\norganism will learn how to behave.\n\nOver the decades, behaviorism has fallen out of vogue in psychology\u2014\nresearch has made it clear that there\u2019s far more to behavior than the carrot\nand the stick. But that understanding hasn\u2019t extended to business practice\u2014\nin corporations and business-school classrooms around the world, the\nsearch continues for the magic incentive that will make people do what\nbusinesses want.\n\nIn reality, human behavior is much more like a thermostat. A thermostat\nis a very simple system: all it consists of is a sensor, a set point, and a\nswitch. The sensor measures the temperature of the surrounding\nEnvironment. When the temperature is within a given range, the thermostat\ndoes nothing. When the temperature is below the set point, the switch turns\nthe heater on. Once the temperature is above the set point, the switch turns\nthe heater off.\n\nThis relationship is called Perceptual Contro\u2014\u2014the thermostat controls the\ntemperature of the room by comparing the perceived temperature against\nthe set point, then taking an action if and only if that perception is \u201cout of\ncontrol.\u201d Once the action brings the perception under control, the system\nstops acting until the set point is violated once again.\n\nLiving organisms\u2014 including human beings\u2014are very complex\nPerceptual Control systems: we act in ways to keep our perceptions of the\nworld within acceptable boundaries. We don\u2019t put on a coat because cold\nweather forces us to\u2014we put on a coat because we feel cold and we don\u2019t\nwant to feel cold. If the light entering our eyes is too bright, we find shade,\n\npull down the blinds on the windows, or put on sunglasses\u2014the action\ncontrols the perception, and the action we take depends on the Environment\nwe find ourselves in at the time.\n\nIn Making Sense of Behavior: The Meaning of Control, William T.\nPowers uses the following example to explain how control systems account\nfor the wide range of behaviors human beings exhibit: Imagine a ship in the\nmiddle of an ocean during a wild storm. The ship is rising and falling at\nrandom, pitching back and forth as it\u2019s buffeted by the waves.\n\nA rock on the deck of the ship is not a control system. The rock doesn\u2019t\nwant anything, so it has nothing to control\u2014it just tumbles wherever the\nforces of physics take it. A human being on the deck of the ship, however,\nwants to stay upright, and will therefore take many different actions to\ncontinue to stay standing: changing balance, moving, holding on to\nhandrails, etc. If the human stumbles and falls, they\u2019ll take whatever actions\nthey can to get back on their feet once more.\n\nThe Environment dictates which actions are possible to bring the\nperception under control. Control is not planning\u2014it\u2019s adjusting to changes\nin the Environment as they happen. The human in the storm doesn\u2019t have\nthe capability to predetermine what actions they\u2019 | take to stay on their feet\n\u2014as the Environment changes, their actions will change in response,\ndepending on the resources and options available at the moment.\n\nPerceptual Control explains why the same stimulus often produces\ndifferent responses. A good example of why the stimulus/response model\ndoesn\u2019t paint the whole picture is the classic incentive of many employers:\npaid overtime. If you want your hourly employees to work more, you\nshould pay more overtime, right?\n\nNot necessarily. Workers who are controlling for income (i.e., they don\u2019t\nhave enough and want more) will probably work more overtime, but what\nabout workers who already feel they\u2019re making enough money or have\npriorities that are more important than work? A few of those workers will\nwork the same amount of time, and some will work less\u2014they\u2019re\ncontrolling for a certain amount of income, then spending their time doing\nother things that are important to them, like being with their family or\npursuing a side project. Raising overtime pay will allow them to reach that\npoint faster, so they\u2019Il spend less time at work.\n\nThe overtime incentive produces three different results, two of which are\ncomplete opposites\u2014working more and working less. So much for\n\nbehaviorism.\n\nPerceptual Control represents a fundamental shift in understanding why\npeople do the things they do. Once you understand that people act to control\ntheir perceptions, you\u2019|I be better equipped to influence how they act.\n",

RUNKEL, PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY AND EDUCATION, UNIVERSITY OF OREGON\n\nA. the heart of every Perceptual Control system is a Reference Level\u2014a range\nof perceptions that indicate the system is \u201cunder control.\u201d When a\nperception is within the system\u2019s Reference Level, nothing happens. When\nthe perception violates the Reference Level by being too high or too low,\nthe system will act to bring the perception back under control.\n\nThere are three kinds of Reference Levels: set points, ranges, and errors.\n\nA set point is a minimum or maximum value. The thermostat is an\nexample of a system that has a set point\u2014whenever the temperature falls\nbelow a certain value, the heater kicks on. Your body\u2019s production of\nmelatonin is another set point\u2014once it reaches a particular threshold, you\u2019 ll\nstart falling asleep.\n\nBusiness financial controls are managed as set points: as long as your\nrevenue is above a certain set point and your expenses are below a certain\nset point, you\u2019re okay. If you suddenly spend three times what you normally\nspend or your revenue falls below your point of Sufficiency, that triggers\naction\u2014you want to find out why you overspent and how to bring your\nexpenses back under control.\n\nA range is a spread of acceptable values. The difference between a range\nand a set point is the existence of an upper and lower limit to the perception\nbeing controlled. With a set point, the perception must be above or below a\ncertain level to be under control; with a range, the perception must be\nbetween two set points to be under control.\n\nFor example, your body has a system for regulating the level of glucose\nin your blood, which it uses for energy. Too much or too little blood glucose\n\ncan be life threatening, so your body works to keep the level within an\nacceptable range by releasing insulin, which causes extra glucose to move\ninto (or out of) the cells in your body. As long as your blood glucose is\nwithin the acceptable range, nothing happens. When the reference range is\nviolated, your body starts working to bring the situation back under control.\n\nAn error is a set point defined as zero\u2014any perception that\u2019s not zero is\nout of control. Think of the pain receptors in your skin. Most of the time,\nthey do nothing, which means everything is under control. If you cut or\nburn yourself, however, the receptors send a signal that something is wrong,\nand you\u2019ll act to remedy the situation. Customer-service complaints are a\nbusiness example\u2014if you don\u2019t receive any, everything is under control. If\nyour in-box is filling with complaints, you know something needs to be\nfixed.\n\nIf you want to change a behavior, you must either change the system\u2019s\nReference Level or change the Environment in which the system is operating.\nThink back to the thermostat\u2014if you want to turn the heater off, you can\nchange the set point to a lower temperature. If you\u2019re aware that your\nexpenses will be three times what they were last month because you\u2019re\nlaunching a huge marketing campaign, your finances are no longer out of\ncontrol. If you\u2019re in the process of getting a tattoo, pain receptors firing in\nyour skin is an acceptable situation.\n\nThe perceptions themselves haven\u2019t changed, but you\u2019ll no longer act to\nbring the perception under control because it already is under control.\nChanging the Reference Level changes the behavior of the system.\n\nDefining and redefining Reference Levels can help you change your\nbehavior. If you\u2019re worried that your spending is out of control, you can\ncreate a budget that will give you information on what your target monthly\nrevenue needs to be in order to maintain financial Sufficiency. If you\u2019re\nworried that your weight is too high or low, a visit to your doctor can help\nyou calibrate your expectations and self-perception against medical data. If\nyou\u2019re working twelve-hour days and you decide that no more than eight is\nacceptable, your work habits will change.\n\nChange the Reference Level, and your behavior will change as a result.\n",

As a result, we\u2019ve evolved to avoid expending energy\nunless absolutely necessary, a Habit | call Conservation of Energy.\n\nOver the past several decades, researchers have studied marathoners and\nultramarathoners (people who run fifty to one hundred miles at a stretch) to\nlearn more about how the body responds to pain. Here\u2019s what they\u2019ve\nfound: when you\u2019re so tired that it feels like you\u2019re about to kick the bucket\nany second, physiologically, you\u2019re not even remotely close to dying. The\nsignals your brain is sending to your body are a ruse that serves as a\nwarning, prompting you to keep some energy in reserve, just in case energy\nis needed later.\n\nUnless a Reference Level is violated, people will conserve energy by not\nacting. Think of two roommates who have different standards of household\ncleanliness. To one, the presence of dirty dishes in the sink is a problem\u2014in\ntheir mind, any dishes at all is \u201cout of control,\u201d which prompts action to fix\nthe situation. To the other roommate, the situation may not be out of control\nuntil the sink is overflowing, at which point they\u2019ll expend some energy\nwashing dishes. Different Reference Levels, different actions.\n\nIf you think your weight, health, and physique are just fine, you\nprobably won\u2019t change your diet or start exercising. If you\u2019re comfortable\nwith your social circle and confidence, you probably won\u2019t do much to\nimprove your social skills or expand your circle of acquaintances. If you\nthink you\u2019re making enough money, you probably won\u2019t do much to earn\nmore.\n\nConservation of Energy explains why some people stay in dead-end jobs\nfor decades, even though they know the position isn\u2019t great. If the work is\n\nokay, the bills get paid, and the job never becomes stressful or frustrating\nenough to violate expectations, people won\u2019t go out of their way to get a\npromotion, find another job, or start a new business. People only start to\nexpend effort if their Reference Levels are violated in some way, so if their\nexpectations aren\u2019t violated, they don\u2019t act.\n\nSources of information that change your Reference Levels are valuable\nin prompting action. One of the things that prompted me to build courses\nand offer consulting was the knowledge that some business authors and\ncoaches were able to spend all day learning and helping others and be paid\nvery well for their expertise. That was enough to violate my Reference\nLevels about work at the time\u2014if they could get paid for doing what I\nloved to do, why should I have to spend all day in a day job that was just\nokay? The more I learned about what people did to make this possible, the\nmore | wanted to do to make it a reality for myself.\n\nBefore Roger Bannister\u2019s record-breaking performance in 1954, running\na mile in under four minutes was considered beyond the physical limitations\nof the human body. After Bannister proved it was possible, the\npsychological barrier was broken: by the end of 1957, sixteen runners had\naccomplished the feat. The only thing that changed was the Reference\nLevel: these athletes knew it was possible and wanted to do it, so they did.\n\nGood books, magazines, blogs, documentaries, and even competitors are\nvaluable if they violate your expectations about what\u2019s possible. When you\ndiscover that other people are doing something you once considered\nunrealistic or impossible, it changes your Reference Levels in a very useful\nway. All you need to know is that something you want is possible, and\nyou\u2019 ll find a way to get it.\n",

There\u2019s\noverwhelming evidence that it\u2019s not good for your health, and you\u2019re\nconvinced your quality of life would improve if you can kick the habit.\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem: sugar tastes good, and you experience cravings\nthat are difficult to resist. How can you make it easier to change your eating\nhabits?\n\nOne of the most effective strategies is simple: don\u2019t purchase products\nwith refined sugar at the grocery store, get rid of any food with added sugar\nin your house, and purchase a few healthy snacks that meet your new\ncriteria. If sugar isn\u2019t available when and where you experience hunger, and\nif there are easy alternatives to your typical choices, there\u2019s no need to resist\ntemptation: the structure of your immediate Environment makes your new\nbehavior automatic. A few minutes of willpower applied to altering the\nworld around you can make it much easier to act in the ways you\u2019ve\ndecided to act.\n\nGuiding Structure means the structure of your Environment is the largest\ndeterminant of your behavior. If you want to successfully change a\nbehavior, don\u2019t try to change the behavior by itself. Change the structure\nthat influences or supports the behavior, and the behavior will change. If\nyou don\u2019t want to eat ice cream, don\u2019t buy it in the first place.\n\nIn Homer\u2019s Odyssey, Odysseus and his crew prepare to sail past the\nisland of the Sirens\u2014bird women who sing songs so beautiful and alluring\nthat unwitting sailors lose all reason and shipwreck themselves. Instead of\nrelying on strength of will to resist the temptation of the Sirens, Odysseus\nchanges the structure of the Environment, plugging his men\u2019s ears with\nbeeswax and tying himself to the ship\u2019s mast. Temptation thus avoided, the\nship makes safe passage.\n\nChange the structure of your Environment, and your behavior will\nchange as a result. Add a bit of Friction or eliminate certain options, and\nyou\u2019 ll find it much easier to focus on what you\u2019re trying to accomplish.\n\nA great example of Guiding Structure is the \u201csterile cockpit rule\u201d that\nthe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) instituted in 1981. Most airline\naccidents happen below ten thousand feet, where distractions can be deadly.\nAbove ten thousand feet, pilots can talk about anything they want, but\nbelow ten thousand feet, the only discussion permitted is about information\nrelated to the flight in progress. By eliminating distractions, the sterile\ncockpit rule reduces errors and accidents.\n\nChange the structure of your Environment, and you\u2019ll be amazed at how\nyour behavior will change in response.\n",

TULAIEN, AUTHUR UF THE DURU UF Ie RINGS\n\nW henever a perception violates the system\u2019s Reference Level, action will\noccur to bring the perception back under control. Sometimes that response\nis well defined\u2014as we discussed earlier, your body knows what it needs to\ndo to regulate blood glucose. Often, however, you don\u2019t know what is\nwrong\u2014or how to fix it.\n\nThink of a perception as abstract as \u201cjob satisfaction\u201d\u2014there\u2019s a set\npoint in your mind that stands for \u201chow happy I should be at work,\u201d and\nyour perception of job satisfaction is an average of your actual experiences\nat work. Pleasant experiences move the average higher, and unpleasant\nexperiences move the average lower.\n\nIf your perception of job satisfaction is lower than you think it should be\n(your Reference Level), your brain will kick into action\u2014\u201cI\u2019m not as happy\nas I should be . . . Something needs to change.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: you may not know what that something is. Would\nyou be happier if you changed assignments, worked for a new boss, left the\ncompany, or started working for yourself? Who knows? That\u2019s where\nReorganization comes in.\n\nReorganization is random action that occurs when a Reference Level is\nviolated but you don\u2019t know what to do to bring the perception back under\ncontrol. The \u201cquarter-life\u201d or midlife crisis many people experience is a\nperfect example of Reorganization. You don\u2019t quite know what to do to\neliminate the angst you\u2019re feeling, so you start doing things that aren\u2019t\nnormal for you, like quitting your job to backpack across Europe or getting\na tattoo and buying a motorcycle.\n\nReorganization feels like you\u2019re lost, depressed, or crazy\u2014that\u2019s normal.\nYour brain starts spitting out all kinds of off-the-wall things in an effort to\nfind something to fix the situation. Sometimes, when I\u2019m stressed out, I\u2019ll\nstart to think that being a janitor sounds appealing\u2014the work\u2019s not difficult,\nyou don\u2019t have to think so much, and you still get paid. That doesn\u2019t mean\n\nit\u2019s a good idea, but this type of thought process is normal\u2014my brain is just\ntrying out random ideas to bring certain systems back under control.\n\nReorganization is the neurological basis of learning. As we\u2019ll discuss in\nPattern Matching, our minds are learning machines that associate specific\nbehaviors with specific effects. If your mind hasn\u2019t already learned what to\ndo in a certain situation, the best way to solve the problem is to try new\nthings in an effort to gather data. That\u2019s what Reorganization is for\u2014it\u2019s the\nimpulse to consider or try new things to see what works.\n\nOne of the most important things to understand about Reorganization is\nthat it\u2019s best not to fight it. Even though it\u2019s sometimes tempting to try to\nconvince yourself that everything is okay, resisting or repressing the\nimpulse to try something different slows down your learning.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing odd or abnormal about dark nights of the soul\u2014they\u2019re\na signal that some perception about your life is out of control, and\nReorganization is required to gather more data about how to fix it. Once\nyou learn how to bring the perception back under control, Reorganization\nstops.\n\nWhen you\u2019re feeling lost, take heart\u2014it\u2019s just your brain gathering the\ninformation it needs to make good decisions. Embracing the impulse to try\nsomething new will help you exit Reorganization faster than you would\notherwise.\n",

How can you\nfocus on something due in the future when there\u2019s something that needs to\nbe done now?\n\nWhat\u2019s particularly frustrating are the times we know we have time to\nget something done in advance, but we just don\u2019t feel like doing it right\nnow. Part of us wants to work, and part of us wants to not work. If you try\nto force yourself to work, you find that you\u2019re so distracted that you don\u2019t\nget much done. If you try to rest, part of you feels bad that you\u2019re not\nworking, which means you\u2019re not resting.\n\nEntire days can pass where you neither really work nor really rest, but\nyou feel exhausted from the effort of getting nothing done. What gives?\n\nConflicts occur when two control systems try to change the same\nperception. When you\u2019re procrastinating, one of your brain\u2019s subsystems is\ntrying to control \u201cgetting things done,\u201d while another is trying to control\n\u201cgetting enough rest.\u201d Since both systems are trying to control the same\nperception\u2014physical action\u2014the systems fight to move the perception in\nthe direction they want it to go.\n\nThe situation is akin to a heater and an air conditioner fighting to control\nthe temperature in a single room. As long as their respective Reference Levels\nare mutually exclusive, neither system will ever be under control\u2014they\u2019 I]\ncontinue to expend effort to move the system in the direction they\u2019re\ncontrolling for. Even if one system brings the perception back under control\ntemporarily, it won\u2019t be long before the other system ensures it\u2019s out of\ncontrol once more.\n\nProcrastination is an example of an inner Conflict, but Conflicts happen\nbetween people as well. Conflicts occur when people are controlling for\ndifferent outputs that require the same input. Think of two children fighting\nover the same toy. It\u2019s the procrastination/temperature battle all over again,\nonly the control systems are people. As long as one child has the toy, the\nother will be upset. As a result, the toy moves back and forth, and both\nchildren are upset.\n\nThink about senior leaders in a large company squabbling over how a\nlimited budget will be allocated, and you\u2019ll have a good idea of where\nConflicts come from. If $1 million is allocated to one vice president, that\nmeans all of the other VPs can\u2019t use it, so they protest\u2014corporate politics at\nits best.\n\nOne of the things that make interpersonal Conflict challenging is that we\ncan never truly control the actions of another human being. We can\ninfluence, persuade, inspire, or negotiate, but we can never act upon another\nperson\u2019s perceptions or change their Reference Levels in a direct way.\n\nConflicts can only be resolved by changing Reference Levels\u2014how\nsuccess is defined by the parties involved. Attempting to resolve a Conflict\nby calling attention to unacceptable behavior is ineffective in the same way\nthat willpower can\u2019t change behavior in a direct way\u2014it\u2019s not addressing\nthe root cause of the Conflict.\n\nEach party in the Conflict has a different Reference Level, which is\nprimarily influenced by the situation or Environment. The only way to\nresolve the conflict is to change each party\u2019s Reference Level, which is best\ndone by changing the structure of the situation.\n\nIn the case of procrastination, Conflict can be ended by scheduling firm\ntimes for work and rest, ensuring enough of each. In The Now Habit, Neil\nFiore recommends creating an \u201cunschedule\u201d that prioritizes rest over work.\nWhen your brain is sure that you\u2019 ll be receiving all of the relaxation and\nenjoyment you need, and that you only have a certain amount of time to get\nthings done, it\u2019s easier to focus on doing productive work.\n\nIn the case of the competing heater and air conditioner, the situation can\nonly exist as long as you maintain the conflicting temperatures on the\nthermostats. Change the Reference Levels and you resolve the Conflict.\n\nIn the case of squabbling children (or vice presidents), you can change\nthe situation by ensuring that each combatant gets roughly the same toy,\ngets no toy at all, or changes their measure of success from \u201cgetting mine\u201d\nto \u201cworking together.\u201d\n\nChange the situation that creates the Reference Levels each party is\nusing to measure success, and you\u2019|l eliminate the Conflict.\n",

Gravity\nis a name for something your brain learned by itself.\n\nOne of the most interesting things about the brain is its ability to learn\nand recognize patterns. Think of Pavlov\u2019s famous dogs: ring a bell, and\nthey\u2019! start to salivate. Pavlov taught them a pattern: every time the bell\nrings, food is on the way. It didn\u2019t take long for the dogs to learn the\npattern, so they began to respond even before the food appeared.\n\nOur brains are natural Pattern Matching machines. The brain is busy trying\nto find patterns in what we perceive, then associating new patterns with\nother patterns that are stored in memory. This Pattern Matching process\nhappens without conscious effort. By paying attention to the world around\nyou, your brain is collecting new patterns and adding them to memory.\n\nHumans learn patterns primarily via experimentation. If a small child\nwants to be held by its mother, it doesn\u2019t take long to try several different\napproaches and learn which response produces the desired result: \u201cIf I cry,\nMom is going to pick me up and hold me.\u201d From then on, the child will rely\non the pattern whenever it desires the result.\n\nYou can think of your memory as the database of patterns you\u2019ve\nlearned via past experience. Patterns get stored in our long-term memory,\nwaiting to be used to determine responses to new or uncommon situations.\nRecall is optimized for speed, not accuracy\u2014the brain stores information\ncontextually, which helps you recall related patterns when you need them.\nThat\u2019s why the best way to find a set of lost keys is to mentally walk\nthrough all of the places you\u2019ve been\u2014the context makes it easier to recall\nthe information.\n\nThe more accurate patterns you\u2019ve learned, the more options you have\nwhen solving new problems.

Having a\nlarger mental database to draw from is what gives experts their expertise.\n\nPattern Matching is one of the foundational capabilities of our mind and\nhow it works.

The\nonly limitation on what you can simulate is your imagination.\n\nFor example, how would you go about visiting Antarctica? It\u2019s a random\nquestion, but when you hold the End Result in mind for a few seconds, your\nbrain starts connecting the dots, based on the patterns you\u2019ve learned. \u201cI\ncould call a travel agent . . . Cruises go to Antarctica all the time... I\u2019d\nhave to fly to Argentina . . . I\u2019d have to buy a warm coat,\u201d etc. All of this\nthinking just happens, without much effort on your part\u2014it\u2019s what your\nbrain is designed to do.\n\nMental Simulation only works if you supply a \u201cpoint B,\u201d even if the\naction or goal is arbitrary\u2014you can simulate the path to even the most\nunrealistic and absurd destination you can imagine. Think of using a vehicle\nGPS system\u2014the system can give you accurate directions, but it won\u2019t\nwork unless you enter a destination. That destination can be your best\nfriend\u2019s house or someplace random, like Albuquerque, New Mexico.\nEither way, unless you supply a Goal, the system can\u2019t operate. The same\ntule applies to Mental Simulation\u2014no destination, no simulation.\n\nMental Simulation is particularly powerful if you learn how to apply it\non demand, which we\u2019!! explore in detail when we discuss Thought\nExperiments.\n",

Your mind reached a conclusion that wasn\u2019t true based on what\nyou thought you perceived, only to discover there was a different way of\ninterpreting the message that also made sense.\n\nOur minds are always simulating different courses of action, but\nsometimes there\u2019s not enough information to ensure that a perceived pattern\nis accurate. Since you\u2019re not omniscient, your mind never has complete\ndata, so it fills in missing pieces by interpreting what you sense via the\npatterns you have stored in memory. In the absence of information to the\ncontrary, you\u2019ll jump to conclusions by relying on the interpretation your\nmind creates.\n\nThis capacity to fill in the blanks even happens on the physiological\nlevel. In our field of vision we have two complete blind spots\u2014the points\nwhere our optic nerves connect to our eyes. We literally cannot see in those\nspots, but our brains take in all of the surrounding information and fill in the\nblanks. As a result, we appear to have a solid field of vision, even though\nit\u2019s an illusion created by our brain\u2019s ability to interpret information.\n\nThe human brain relies on prior patterns and information to make\nInterpretations in the absence of information. Think of the spam folder in\nyour email account\u2014it uses a collection of previous spam messages to\nestimate the probability that any new incoming message is also spam. The\nmessages don\u2019t self-identify as spam, but the computer\u2019s spam filter can\nspot them anyway, using information from past emails as a guide.\n\nYour brain does the same thing every time you decide you like someone\nright after meeting them\u2014your brain is relying on patterns you\u2019ve learned\nvia past experiences with other people to make a snap judgment.\n\nThese snap Interpretations can also be altered\u2014a process called\nReinterpretation. Think of meeting an attractive person who becomes quiet\nand aloof whenever you\u2019re around. At first glance, their behavior may\nsignal to you that they\u2019re shy or don\u2019t like you very much. If one of your\nfriends tells you that they\u2019re interested in you, however, your Interpretation\nof that person\u2019s past behavior can change in an instant.\n\nReinterpretation is possible because your memory is impermanent. Our\nmemories aren\u2019t like computer disks\u2014every time we recall a memory, it\ndoesn\u2019t resave to the same location in the same state. Every time we recall\nsomething, the memory is saved in a different location, with a twist: the\nnew memory will include any alterations we\u2019ve made to it.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to change your beliefs and Mental Simulations by recalling\nand Reinterpreting past events. Mental Simulation and Interpretation rely\non patterns stored in memory. If you want to change the results of your\nbrain\u2019s simulations, the best approach is to alter the mental database of\ninformation those simulations are based on. Reinterpretation is how you\nchange the database.\n\nIn Re-Create Your Life, Morty Lefkoe teaches a process that can be used\nto Reinterpret past events in a simple and useful way:\n\n1.\n\nIdentify the undesirable pattern.\n2.\n\nName the underlying belief.\n\n3.\nIdentify the source of the belief in memory, including as much\nsensory detail as possible.\n\n4.\nDescribe possible alternate Interpretations of the memory.\n\n5.\nRealize that your original belief is an Interpretation, not reality.\n\n6.\nChoose to reject the original belief as \u201cfalse.\u201d\n\n7.\nChoose to accept your Reinterpretation as \u201ctrue.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how I used Lefkoe\u2019s process: One possible way of\nInterpreting my brand-management career at P&G is that I was a miserable\nfailure\u2014I was on the Management fast track, and I couldn\u2019t \u201ccut it,\u201d so I\n\u201cwashed out.\u201d For a while, I believed that was true, but that belief didn\u2019t\nserve me very well. When I tried to explore alternate paths, my mind\npredicted that my \u201cfailure\u201d would extend to my new projects as well. As\nlong as my mind relied on this Interpretation to simulate the future, I was\nstuck in a self-defeating cycle.\n\nThere\u2019s another way of Interpreting my previous career at P&G: My\nexperience taught me a lot about how large corporations work, and I learned\nmore about what I\u2019m good at, what I don\u2019t enjoy doing, and how | want to\ninvest my time. Working at P&G helped me discover a path that didn\u2019t\nwork for me, so I stopped following that path and started experimenting\nwith other approaches that better fit my strengths and desires until I found a\nnew career option that worked for me\u2014a major victory and a huge life\nimprovement.\n\nWhich Interpretation is \u201ctrue\u201d? Both are valid Interpretations. My mind\nwasn\u2019t malfunctioning when it created the first Interpretation, but that\nInterpretation didn\u2019t serve me very well. Reinterpreting the situation and\naccepting the second version as \u201ctrue\u201d was much more useful\u2014without it,\nyou probably wouldn\u2019t be reading this book.\n\nReinterpret your past and you\u2019ll enhance your ability to make great\nthings happen in the present.\n",

Going back to the Onion Brain\nas a basic model, Motivation is the link between the midbrain (which\nperceives the world) and the hindbrain (which sends signals to our body to\ntake action). In most cases, Motivation is automatic\u2014our mind perceives a\ndifference between the way things are and the way we want them to be, and\nthe body acts to eliminate the difference.\n\nYou can break down the experience of Motivation into two basic desires:\nmoving toward things that are desirable and moving away from things that\naren\u2019t. Things that fulfill our Core Human Drives appear desirable, so we\nexperience an impulse to move toward them. Things that appear dangerous,\nscary, or threatening are undesirable, so we experience an impulse to move\naway from them.\n\nIn general, \u201cmoving away\u201d takes priority over \u201cmoving toward.\u201d The\nreason comes back to Caveman Syndrome\u2014tunning away from a lion takes\npriority over cooking lunch.\n\nLet\u2019s say you have an exciting opportunity to start a new business. A\nfeeling of excitement may cause you to move toward that opportunity. At\nthe same time, if the opportunity requires you to leave a high-paying job,\nwhich feels risky, you may be compelled to move away from the very same\nopportunity, resulting in Conflict. As long as the risk outweighs the\nexcitement, you\u2019ll hesitate, even if there\u2019s very little chance you\u2019ll ever be\nin danger if you take the leap. This safety mechanism in our minds\ndeveloped for very good reasons, but today, most of the decisions we make\ndon\u2019t have life-and-death consequences.\n\nMotivation is an emotion\u2014not a logical, rational activity. Just because\nyour forebrain thinks you should be motivated to do something does not\nmean you\u2019ll become motivated to do that thing. (If only it were that easy,\nright?) Very often, Mental Simulations, patterns, Conflicts, and Interpretations\nhidden in the midbrain can get in the way of making progress toward what\nwe want to accomplish. As long as there are \u201cmove away from\u201d signals\nbeing sent, you\u2019ll have a hard time feeling motivated to move toward what\nyou want.\n\nIn the same vein, you can\u2019t \u201cmotivate\u201d other people by yelling at them to\nwork faster\u2014all the drill-sergeant approach accomplishes is making them\nwant to move away from you. They may comply with you temporarily if\nthey perceive some threat to themselves in noncompliance, but you can bet\nthat they\u2019ll move away from working with you at the first available\nopportunity.\n\nEliminate the inner conflicts that compel you to move away from\npotential threats and you\u2019ll find yourself experiencing a feeling of\nMotivation to move toward what you want.\n",

Think about driving a car: with practice, your body\ndoes everything necessary to keep the car on the road, without requiring\nmuch conscious thought.\n\nEvery once in a while, however, it pays to ignore the autopilot and do\nsomething different. If you stumble across a bear in the woods, the last\nthing you want to do is run, even though that\u2019s what your instincts may be\n\ntelling you to do. If you run, the bear is likely to decide you look like lunch\nand chase you down.\n\nInstead of running, it\u2019s more effective to stand your ground and make\nyourself appear as big and loud and threatening as you can. Appearing to be\na threat requires you to inhibit your natural response, but it\u2019ll cause the bear\nto see you as a threat and decide to leave you alone.\n\nInhibition is the ability to temporarily override our natural inclinations.

As we discussed in the section on the\nOnion Brain, the forebrain\u2019s job is ambiguity resolution, decision making,\nand Inhibition. Whenever we inhibit our natural responses to our\nEnvironment, willpower is at work. Our midbrain and hindbrain are the\nautopilot, and the forebrain is the override.

Call it the Aristocrat's Theatre and the peogle will come.\nJULES RENARD, NINETEENTH-CENTURY FRENCH AUTHOR\n\nE very minute of every day, a nontrivial part of your brain has been\ndevoted to keeping track of how you measure up against the rest of the\nworld. Without very much effort, you could make a list of things like:\n\n.\nWho is more attractive than you.\n.\n\nWho is stronger than you.\n\nWho is wealthier than you.\n\nWho is more influential than you.\n\ne\nWho is more powerful than you.\nWho is more famous than you.\n\nWho is better than you are in some specific area of skill (regardless\nof whether or not you\u2019re skilled in that area at all)\n\nHumans are social creatures\u2014we\u2019re built to survive and thrive in\ngroups. Group behavior confers many advantages when it comes to\nensuring survival in an often hostile Environment, but it also introduces\nintragroup competition for scarce resources.\n\nThe individuals who prosper within the group tend to be the ones who\nmost successfully compete on obvious reproductive survival dimensions\n(like beauty, wealth, strength, coalition-building, or group influence) and\nthose who innovate by inventing a new dimension to compete on. That\u2019s\nwhy humans have direct incentives to explore, create, and build skill in\nmillions upon millions of different areas: being \u201cthe best\u201d in something is a\nstraightforward way to increase Social Status.\n\nRelative status is often tricky to calculate precisely, so we rely on Status\nSignals: tangible indicators of some intangible quality that increases a\nperson\u2019s Social Status or group affiliation. Rare or expensive items, awards,\nhonors, victory in recognized competition, and verifiable public acclaim are\nall examples of Status Signals.\n\nStatus concerns permeate human desires and actions. Have you ever\ndreamt of being a movie star? Performer or musician? Professional athlete?\nAstronaut? CEO? Politician or world leader? Celebrity? Those are all\noccupations that carry significant Social Status, and the status is a huge part\nof the compensation for the otherwise extreme demands and sacrifices\nrequired to break into, compete in, and maintain position in those fields.\n\nEver wanted to buy a Bentley, Lamborghini, Ferrari, or Tesla Model S?\nA private jet or your own yacht? A private island? That\u2019s status-motivated\ncognition: all of these things, aside from their utility, signal wealth.\n\nEver wanted to win a Nobel Prize, be Time magazine\u2019s Person of the\nYear, win an Oscar, or be awarded some prestigious medal of honor? These\nsorts of awards signal importance, skill, or influence.\n\nEver felt envy when someone accomplishes something impressive,\npurchases something cool, or receives some sort of difficult-to-attract\nattention? The benefit in question doesn\u2019t harm or diminish you in any way,\nbut their good fortune does change your perceived relative status, even if\nthe tangible benefit is minimal.\n\nThis sort of pattern of thought and behavior operates at all levels. A\nsubstantial amount of our cognitive resources are devoted to tracking our\ncurrent status and changes in our status relative to others. Likewise, many\nthings that factor into our emotions and behavior boil down to a single\nquestion: \u201cWill this improve my Social Status in some meaningful way?\u201d\n\nA Rolex doesn\u2019t tell time any better than a Timex, but that\u2019s not the\npoint: it\u2019s an obvious signal of wealth. In the same way, an Olympic gold\nmedal is poor compensation on a currency-per-hour basis for the years of\nintense training it takes to win. Not only that, does it really matter, in the\ngrand scheme of things, who was able to run a little faster or play a game a\nlittle better than the second-best competitor? Again, that\u2019s not the point: An\nOlympic gold medal is a recognized symbol of victory in worldwide\ncompetition. It\u2019s not about the value of the materials or the value of the\nskill. It\u2019s about the status conferred to the winner.\n\nStatus seeking is a part of human nature and can be harnessed for good\nor ill. Learning to recognize status-motivated behavior\u2014in yourself and in\nother people\u2014will help you understand why people tend to act in certain\npredictable ways, help you avoid common pitfalls, and improve your ability\nmake wise decisions.\n",

Everyone pays attention to\nthe gold medalists and ignores the fact that most Olympic hopefuls struggle\nto pay their day-to-day living expenses. Maintaining an intense training\nschedule is often not compatible with running a business or holding down a\nfull-time job, and sponsorship opportunities are limited.\u201c\n\nTo the victors go the spoils, both in terms of status and financial\nopportunities like sponsorships: for the rest of the field, the price of being\nready for competition is monetary hardship and an uncertain future.\n\nI happen to know several performers who grace Broadway stages.

The drawbacks are\noften underappreciated by novices: the vast majority of auditions will lead\nto rejections, every project is speculative, pursuing one opportunity might\nremove you from consideration for others, and the demands of the work\nmake it challenging to support a family.\n\nIf you land a role, you\u2019ll find producers have most of the power because\nthere are other actors willing to take your place: their Next Best Alternative is\nalways better than yours, which reduces your negotiating power.

It\u2019s a glamorous life, but it\u2019s also a difficult one.\n\nThe same dynamic exists for performers of all kinds: there are more\npeople willing to do the work than there are positions to fill. It\u2019s a winner-\ntake-all market, and there are only a few temporary winners at any given\ntime.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that you should never compete for high-status roles: for\nthe winners, the benefits can be quite substantial. Understanding Status\nMalfunction helps you take a mental and emotional step back from the\nMystique of status, examine your options and potential opportunities with a\nclear mind, and understand the day-to-day realities of what you\u2019re getting\nyourself into before you commit.\n\nStatus Malfunction is also a way to identify opportunities that other\npeople overlook. As I mentioned in the section on the Mercenary Rule,\nbusinesses like trash disposal, plumbing, and oil extraction aren\u2019t high\nstatus, but they can be quite lucrative. Many fortunes have been built by\nentrepreneurs and business owners willing to do high-quality work in low-\nstatus markets.\n\nThere are millions of ways to get better results in important areas of life\nif you\u2019re willing to ignore alluring distractions and focus on doing what\nworks.\n",

When the brokerage deposited the money into her\nbank account, they deposited an additional $10,000 by mistake.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t have been a big deal\u2014it was a simple mistake. On an\nemotional level, however, Kelsey felt like she was \u201closing\u201d the extra\nmoney, even though it wasn\u2019t hers at all.\n\nLoss Aversion is the idea that people hate to lose things more than they\nlike to gain them. There are very few relationships that psychology is able\nto quantify, but this is one of them: people respond twice as strongly to\npotential loss as they do to the opportunity of an equivalent gain. If you\nlook at your investment portfolio and notice that it\u2019s increased by 100\npercent, you\u2019ll feel pretty good. If you notice that your portfolio went down\n100 percent, you\u2019ll feel horrible.\n\nLoss Aversion explains why threats usually take precedence over\nopportunities when it comes to Motivation. The threat of loss used to require\nimmediate attention, because losses were costly\u2014even life threatening.\nDying or losing a loved one to a predator, sickness, exposure, or starvation\nis universally a horrible experience, so we\u2019re built to do everything in our\npower to prevent that from happening. The potential losses we face now are\nrarely as serious, but our minds still give them automatic priority.\n\nLoss Aversion also explains why uncertainty appears risky. Depending\non the study you look at, anywhere between 80 and 90 percent of adults\nthink it would be great to own their own business and work for themselves.\nIf that\u2019s true, why don\u2019t more people start businesses? Loss Aversion keeps\nthem from acting: the threat of losing a steady (and somewhat predictable)\njob commands more Attention than the opportunity to create a new, self-\nsustaining business. Starting a business involves the specter of potential\nloss, which prevents people from getting started in the first place.\n\nLoss Aversion is particularly pronounced in recessions and depressions.\nLosing a job, a home, or a significant percentage of your retirement fund\nisn\u2019t life threatening, but it feels horrible all the same. As a result, people\ntend to become more conservative, avoiding risks that could make things\nworse. Yet some of those risks\u2014like starting a new business\u2014may present\na major opportunity to make things better.\n\nThe best way to overcome Loss Aversion is to use Reinterpretation to\nconsider the risk of loss as \u201cno big deal.\u201d Casinos are in the business of\novercoming Loss Aversion every single day\u2014in a sense, the ostentatious\nbuildings on the Las Vegas Strip are enormous monuments to human\nstupidity. How do casinos encourage people to play games in which they\u2019re\nmathematically certain to lose money?\n\nCasinos win by abstracting the loss. Instead of having players gamble\nwith currency, which is perceived as valuable, the casino converts currency\ninto chips or value on debit cards, which don\u2019t feel as valuable. As the\nplayer loses this \u201cfake\u201d money over time, the casino will provide \u201crewards\u201d\nlike free drinks, T-shirts, room upgrades, or other benefits to alleviate any\nremaining sense of loss. As a result, losing becomes \u201cno big deal,\u201d so\nplayers continue to play\u2014and continue to lose money night after night.\n\nLoss Aversion is why Risk Reversal is so important if you\u2019re presenting\nan offer to a potential customer. People hate to lose, which makes them feel\nstupid and taken advantage of. As a result, they\u2019ll go to great lengths to\nensure that they don\u2019t lose, and the best way to ensure that they don\u2019t make\na stupid decision is to not buy your offer in the first place. If you\u2019re in the\nbusiness of making sales, that\u2019s a big problem. Eliminate this perception of\nrisk by offering a money-back guarantee or similar offer of Risk Reversal\nand people will feel the decision is less risky, resulting in more sales.\n",

Almost\nimmediately, you\u2019re alert\u2014your heart rate increases, your pupils dilate to\ntake in more light and detail, and stress hormones like adrenaline and\ncortisol flood your bloodstream. Your mind identifies the likely source of\nthe noise, escape routes, and potential defensive weapons. In the blink of an\neye, you\u2019re ready to defend yourself against the threat, whatever it might\nbe.\n\nWhen your mind perceives a potential threat\u2014real or imaginary\u2014your\nbody prepares to respond. This automatic physiological response is\ndesigned to help you do one of three things to eliminate the threat: fight,\nflee, or freeze. As long as you\u2019re in \u201cprotection mode,\u201d it\u2019s difficult to do\nanything other than fixate on the threat. Until you search the house, there\u2019s\nno way you\u2019ll be able to go back to sleep\u2014your body will only come out of\nprotective mode after you\u2019re sure there\u2019s no threat to face.\n\nThe subconscious choice to fight, flee, or freeze is dependent on your\nbrain\u2019s automatic Mental Simulation of the situation. If your brain predicts\nyou can win if you fight, you\u2019ll fight. If your brain predicts you can \u201cwin\u2019\nby getting away, you\u2019ll flee. If your brain predicts you can\u2019t get away,\nyou\u2019 ll freeze in the hope that the threat will pass you by. Freezing makes\nyour brain go into Threat Lockdown\u2014protection mode\u2014which makes it\ndifficult to do anything other than fixate on the threat.\n\nThreat Lockdown is a constructive response designed to help you defend\nyourself, but like many ancient instincts, it often malfunctions in our\nmodern environment. The threats you face are far less acute today, but they\nare often chronic.\n\nIn the olden days, when the threat was a predator or an angry tribal\nchief, the lockdown response was constructive, since it focused our energy\non staying alive and/or part of the tribe. Even though the thoughts that run\nthrough our heads on a daily basis have little in common with those of our\nancient ancestors, the hardware those thoughts are running on\u2014our brains\n\n\u2014is still the same and is on the lookout for very old threats in a very new\nenvironment. As a result, we eat too much and exercise too little, and the\ninstinctive behaviors of fighting, freezing, or running away aren\u2019t very\nconstructive when dealing with an angry boss or an overdue mortgage\npayment.\n\nPeriodic turmoil in the stock market is an excellent example of Threat\nLockdown in action. The stock market crash in late 2008 sparked a flurry of\npanic and hand-wringing, even among people who were in no danger of\nlosing their homes or jobs. The mere possibility of bad things happening\ngrinds businesses to a halt at the very time increased productivity is needed\nto keep the firm in good shape. Instead of focusing on doing good work,\nemployees spend most of their time and energy worrying about what the\nfuture holds and gossiping about who\u2019s next on the chopping block,\ndecreasing the overall amount of value created and increasing the likelihood\nthat the firm\u2019s future will get worse.\n\nThreat Lockdown can become a vicious cycle. If you\u2019re ever in the\nunfortunate situation of having to lay off workers, it\u2019s best to make cuts fast\nand all at once, then reassure remaining employees that no more cuts will\nbe made. Rumors of layoffs or workers wondering \u201cif I\u2019ll be next\u201d is a\nrecipe for Threat Lockdown.\n\nIf you\u2019re experiencing Threat Lockdown, don\u2018 try to repress the threat\nsignal. Many studies have shown that active repression doesn\u2019t make a\nperception go away\u2014instead, it makes the signals stronger. Think of what a\nsmall child does when they want to get your attention, but you ignore them\n\u2014they\u2019ll increase the commotion they make until they\u2019re sure you\u2019ve\nnoticed them. Your brain does the same thing\u2014repression only makes the\nthreat signals stronger. Sending a mental \u201cmessage received, safe to\nproceed\u201d signal to your brain is a simple and effective way to make yourself\nstop fixating on the issue so you can consider appropriate responses.\n\nThe key to dealing with Threat Lockdown is to convince your mind that\nthe threat no longer exists. You can do that in one of two ways: (1) you can\nconvince your mind there was never any threat, or (2) you can convince\nyour mind the threat has passed. Convincing your mind there was never a\nthreat is the equivalent of searching your house in the dark at midnight\u2014the\nsearch proves that no threat exists, so it\u2019s safe to leave protective mode.\nConvincing your mind that the threat has passed does the same thing\u2014the\nthreat is gone and can no longer harm you, so it\u2019s safe to carry on.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s difficult to defuse Threat Lockdown, particularly if\nyou\u2019ve been in it for a long time. Because protective mode is physiological,\nit\u2019s often best to use physiological means to calm yourself down. Exercise,\nsleep, and meditation can help calm your mind by metabolizing or\ncounteracting the stress hormones that have been flooding your body. When\nyou\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, going for a quick run or lifting weights can do\nwonders for your state of mind.\n\nNotice the threat signal, then do what you can to prove to your mind the\nthreat no longer exists, and you\u2019ll break yourself out of Threat Lockdown.\n",

You are an object\u2014an\nobstacle standing between where they are and where they want to go. As a\nresult, they\u2019ll run you over with impunity.\n\nNo matter how intelligent a person is, there\u2019s an upper bound on the\namount of information a single mind can process, store, and respond to.\nAbove that limit, information may be considered in abstract terms, but it\u2019s\nnot treated as urgent and important as information related to that\nindividual\u2019s personal experience or concerns.\n\n\u201cDunbar\u2019s number\u201d is a theoretical cognitive limit on the number of\nstable social relationships humans can maintain at one time. According to\nRobin Dunbar, a British anthropologist, humans have the cognitive capacity\nto keep track of somewhere around 150 close personal connections. Beyond\nthis limited circle, we start treating people less like individuals and more\nlike objects, and groups of people beyond this limit are likely to splinter off\ninto subgroups over time.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever wondered why you don\u2019t write letters to your elementary\nschool classmates, Dunbar\u2019s number is a decent hypothesis\u2014you\u2019re too\n\nbusy maintaining your ties to people who are in your immediate social\ncircle.\n\nThere\u2019s some controversy regarding the actual quantity of connections\nwhere Cognitive Scope Limitation kicks in (the Bernard-Killworth median, a\ncompeting estimate, is 231), but there\u2019s little doubt that such a limit exists.\nWhen a disaster strikes somewhere around the world that affects millions of\npeople, we may feel bad, but we don\u2019t feel a million times what we would\nfeel if that disaster affected a close friend or family member. The more\nremote the connection, the less such an impact affects us individually.\n\nThe tourists in Times Square aren\u2019t evil\u2014they\u2019re just overwhelmed.\nMore than 380,000 people pass through Times Square every day,\u201d and our\nminds aren\u2019t capable of handling that much information at once. On an\nabstract level, these people still realize that you\u2019re a human being, but\nthere\u2019s so much going on in the area that it\u2019s difficult for them to treat you\nlike one. The mind gets overwhelmed, so it starts simplifying reality to\ncompensate.\n\nThe same thing happens to executives of large companies. Rationally,\nthey may be aware that they\u2019re responsible for hundreds of thousands of\nemployees and millions of shareholders, but no matter how intelligent they\nare, their brains aren\u2019t capable of processing the magnitude of that reality.\nAs a result, executives can hurt a lot of people without even realizing it.\nThe CEO of a large company may not care if thousands of frontline workers\nare laid off\u2014at the highest levels, it\u2019s easy to think of \u201chuman resources\u201d as\nnumbers on a spreadsheet, not individual human beings.\n\nWhenever you see an executive making a boneheaded decision like\ndumping toxic waste into a river millions of people drink from, or\ndownsizing thousands of jobs while handing out millions of dollars in\nbonuses, it\u2019s probably not because they\u2019re rotten to the core. As scary as it\nsounds, it\u2019s probably because they haven't thought too much about it\u2014the\nscope and scale of what they\u2019re managing is too complex to handle, so their\nmind processes the decision abstractly instead of viscerally.\n\nPersonalizing an issue is a way to hack this universal limitation. In the\nabsence of brain upgrades, it\u2019s not possible to expand the scope of\ninformation our minds are capable of processing. In order to get around this\nlimitation, it\u2019s useful to personalize decisions and issues by imagining they\naffect someone close to us.\n\nIn the case of the boneheaded executive, they\u2019d feel very different about\ntheir decision if their mother\u2019s water was polluted, or their child\u2019s job was\neliminated. Instead of considering the issue abstractly, personalizing it\nmakes it easier to feel the effects of the decision viscerally, which makes it\neasier to make better decisions.\n\nIn Green to Gold, Daniel C. Esty and Andrew S. Winston describe\nseveral ways of making it easier to internalize the results of large decisions.\nThe \u201cnewspaper rule\u201d and the \u201cgrandchild rule\u201d are effective ways of\npersonalizing the results of your decisions. The \u201cnewspaper rule\u201d is a\nsimulation of the following: assume your decision was publicized on the\nfront page of tomorrow\u2019s New York Times, and your parents and/or\nsignificant other read it. What would they think? Imagining the personal\nconsequences of your decisions in this way is a much more accurate way to\nevaluate the impact of short-term decisions.\n\nThe \u201cgrandchild rule\u201d is a way of evaluating decisions with long-term\nconsequences. Imagine that, thirty or forty years from now, your grandchild\ngives you feedback on the results of your decision. Will they laud you for\nyour wisdom or reprimand you for your stupidity?\n\nPersonalize the results of your decisions and actions, and you\u2019 ll be far\nless likely to run afoul of Cognitive Scope Limitation.\n",

Remember, your brain is taking in information all the\ntime and is using it to create patterns that describe how the world works.\nRationally, these things may not matter\u2014you probably know that using the\nsame golf clubs Tiger Woods uses won\u2019t magically correct your atrocious\nslice. When it comes time to buy golf clubs, however, your mind will be\ndrawn to the clubs that make you feel good, and more likely than not, you\u2019 ll\nfind the clubs Tiger uses quite appealing.\n\nThe human mind stores information contextually, including cues like\nEnvironment and Correlation. Because the brain is a Pattern Matching machine,\nit\u2019s trying to figure out what\u2019s associated with what. As a result, your mind\nforms Associations\u2014even between things that aren\u2019t logically connected.\n\nFor decades, the Coca-Cola Company has been associating Coke with a\nsingle emotion: happiness. Do a quick search for Coke commercials on the\ninternet: you won\u2019t find any images of layoffs or funerals. What you will\nfind is a litany of happy moments: Adrien Brody cruising in his car, parades\nof whimsical creatures celebrating as a bottle of Coke exits a vending\nmachine, and Charlie Brown winning the race for a runaway Coke-bottle\nballoon in the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving parade. Even holidays aren\u2019t immune:\nthe company invented the modern image of Santa Claus, who just so\nhappened to be holding a bottle of Coca-Cola.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to influence behavior by using associative cues, even\nAssociations that make no logical sense. Coca-Cola\u2019s advertisements don\u2019t\nconvince soda consumers that Coke is better in some functional respect\n(\u201cNow with 37 percent more sugar!\u201d), but they do make people feel good\nwhenever they think about Coke. When a customer is standing in the\nsupermarket deciding which soft drink to buy, those feelings make a big\ndifference in each customer\u2019s final choice.\n\nConsider beer commercials, which usually feature attractive women and\nconfident men. Your rational mind knows that drinking a certain type of\nbeer won\u2019t make you more attractive or confident, but Correlation is\npowerful\u2014your brain will make the Association anyway. As a result, beer\nads influence behavior, even though no one takes the images they contain\nseriously.\n\nPresenting your prospects with positive Associations can influence how\nthey think about what you offer. Celebrity endorsements work because they\ntie into strong Associations people already have with the endorsers,\nassociations that rub off on the product or service being endorsed. Everyone\nknows James Bond is a fictional character, but when Daniel Craig is\nfeatured wearing a tuxedo in a watch advertisement, the \u201csophisticated\ninternational spy\u201d Association is transferred to the timepiece.\n\nCultivate the right Associations, and potential customers will want what\nyou have even more.\n",

The Product worked, but users didn\u2019t realize it\u2014they\nhad a hard time believing the Product did something, since they couldn\u2019t\nsee anything happening. After the test phase was complete, the project was\ncanceled.\n\nAbsence Blindness is a cognitive bias that prevents us from identifying\nwhat we can\u2019t observe. Our perceptual faculties evolved to detect objects\nthat are present in the Environment. It\u2019s far more difficult for people to notice\nor identify what\u2019s missing.\n\nExamples of Absence Blindness are everywhere. Here\u2019s a common\nexample: great Management is boring\u2014and often unrewarding. The hallmark\nof an effective manager is anticipating likely issues and resolving them in\nadvance, before they become a problem. Some of the best managers in the\nworld exhibit a quiet sort of competence: there\u2019s little drama, and\neverything gets done on time and under budget.\n\nThe problem is, no one sees all of the bad things that the great manager\nprevents. Less skilled managers are more likely to be rewarded, since\neveryone can see them \u201cmaking things happen\u201d and \u201cmoving heaven and\nearth\u201d to resolve issues\u2014issues they may have created themselves via poor\nManagement.\n\nMake a note to remind yourself to reward the low-drama manager who\ngets things done with little fuss. It may not seem like their job is particularly\ndifficult, but you\u2019ll miss them when they\u2019re gone.\n\nAbsence Blindness makes prevention grossly underappreciated. In the\ncase of the Product I was working on, people had a hard time believing that\nsomething they couldn\u2019t see working was effective. If you\u2019re trying to sell\nthe absence or prevention of something, you\u2019re fighting an uphill battle,\neven if your Product is great. Always state benefits in positive, immediate,\nconcrete, and specific terms by focusing on things the user can experience.\n\nAbsence Blindness also makes it uncomfortable for people to \u201cdo\nnothing\u201d when something bad happens, even if doing nothing is the best\ncourse of action. Often, the best course of action is to choose not to act, but\nthat can be difficult for humans to accept.\n\nThe economic \u201cboom and bust\u201d cycle most markets experience is\npartially a consequence of Absence Blindness. According to Ludwig von\nMises in Human Action, economic \u201cbubbles\u201d are created when a\ngovernment tries to encourage an economy to grow by reducing interest\nrates, making it easier to borrow money. By making access to Capital easier,\nthis policy leads investors to speculate, paying abnormally high prices for\nassets they\u2019d otherwise avoid, like tulips,\u00ae internet companies with no\nrevenue,\u201d and risky mortgage-backed securities.\u00ae Eventually, the bubble\n\u201cpops\u201d when investors realize that the assets they\u2019ve been speculating on\naren\u2019t worth what they paid, leading to a sudden crash in the price of the\novervalued asset.\n\nBecause of Loss Aversion, people start freaking out and start clamoring\nfor an immediate solution to the collapsing market. More often than not, the\n\u201csolution\u201d is to reduce interest rates even more to encourage the economy\nto start growing again\u2014a self-reinforcing Feedback Loop that does nothing\nbut exacerbate the issue by creating the conditions necessary for an even\nlarger bubble to form down the road.\n\nTo fix the issue, the best course of action is to stop manipulating interest\nrates, which caused the issue in the first place. Absence Blindness makes\ndoing nothing psychologically uncomfortable\u2014after all, \u201cwe can\u2019t sit here\nand do nothing while the world burns!\u201d As a result, people usually prefer\nthe government to act, even if the action the government takes makes things\nworse in the long run.\n\nExperience makes it easier to avoid Absence Blindness. Experience is\nvaluable primarily because the expert has a larger mental database of\nrelated patterns and thus a higher chance of noticing an absence. By\nnoticing violations of expected patterns, experienced people are more likely\n\nto get an \u201codd feeling\u201d that things \u201caren\u2019t quite right,\u201d which is often\nenough warning to find an issue before it becomes serious.\n\nIn Sources of Power: How People Make Decisions, researcher Gary\nKlein tells the story of a team of firefighters putting out a fire on the first\nfloor of a house. When water was sprayed at the base of the fire, the fire\ndidn\u2019t respond as expected\u2014it didn\u2019t diminish at all. The chief noticed and\nordered everyone out\u2014something just didn\u2019t feel right. A few minutes later,\nthe house collapsed\u2014the fire had started in the basement, destroying the\nfoundation. If the team had stayed inside, they would have died. That\u2019s the\npower and benefit of experience.\n\nThe only reliable way I\u2019ve found to overcome Absence Blindness is by\nusing Checklists. By thinking in advance what you want something to look\nlike and translating that Visualization into visible reminders you can refer to\nwhile making decisions, Checklists can help you remember to look for the\nabsence of qualities in the moment. (We\u2019|I discuss creating Checklists in\ngreat detail in chapter 11.)\n",

                        "extracted-text": "The world is full of obvious things which nabody by any chance ever observes.\nSIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE, AUTHOR OF THE SHERLOCK HOLMES BOOKS\n\nf you walk into a department store to buy a business suit, you\u2019re likely to\nnotice a few expensive options. The store will very rarely sell these suits\u2014\nthat\u2019s not their purpose. Compared to a $3,000 suit, a $400 suit doesn\u2019t\nseem expensive\u2014even if the same suit could be purchased at another store\nfor $200.\n\nThe same principle applies to the order in which products are presented\nby the salesperson. After choosing a suit, you\u2019ll be directed to shirts, shoes,\nand accessories. Compared to $400 for a suit, what\u2019s another $100 on\nshoes? $80 for a belt? $60 for a few shirts? $50 for a few ties? $40 for a set\nof cuff links? Compared to the suit, the accessories seem inexpensive, so\nwhy not?\n\nHere\u2019s what Jordan Smart, one of my clients, reported:\n\nI went shopping last year on Black Friday, looking to get some slightly\nmore formal clothes . . . | went out with the intent of buying a set of\nshirts and two blazers. I thought for a while on buying ties to go with\nit, and decided that the one or two | had in my closet already would\nsuffice.\n\nI went shopping at two stores. In the first, I picked out a set of\nshirts, and as I was leaving, the salesman asked if I needed ties to go\nwith them. I politely told him no, and privately congratulated myself\non sticking to my resolution.\n\nAt the second store, I tried on a few blazers and decided to purchase\nthem. Again, the salesman asked if I needed ties to go with my\nblazers. At that point, I very clearly remember thinking about the price\nof the blazers and thinking to myself, \u201cWell, I\u2019m spending this much\nmoney anyway,\u201d and proceeded to buy a set of ties.\n\nI didn\u2019t think anything of it until I learned about contrast. Looking\nback at the receipt, I realized I\u2019d spent more on the ties than I had\nspent on the blazers.\n\nOur perceptions are influenced by information gathered from the\nsurrounding environment. Is $10,000 a lot of money? It depends on your\ncircumstances. If you have $10 in your bank account, $10,000 is an\nenormous sum. If you have $100 million, it\u2019s a rounding error.\n\nOur perceptual faculties are optimized to notice Contrast, not to compare\nwhat we perceive with things that aren\u2019t there, which is the root of Absence\nBlindness. Everything we notice and every decision we make is based on\ninformation gathered from the surrounding Environment. That\u2019s why\ncamouflage works\u2014it reduces the contrast between an object and its\nsurrounding Environment, which makes it harder to notice.\n\nContrast is often used to influence buying decisions. In the business\nworld, Contrast is often used as pricing camouflage. In the case of the $60\nshirt, it may be possible to buy the exact same shirt at another retailer for\n$40, but the less expensive shirt isn\u2019t present in the store where the\ncomparison is taking place. What is present is the $400 suit, which makes\nthe $60 shirt look like a bargain.\n\nCompared with a $2,000 computer, a $300 extended warranty appears\ninexpensive, even though it increases the total purchase price by 15 percent.\nCompared with a $30,000 vehicle, spending $1,000 for leather seats feels\n\nlike a bargain. Compared with buying a $400,000 house, spending $20,000\nto remodel the kitchen feels like no big deal.\n\nFraming is a way to control the perception of Contrast. For example, I\noften use the phrase \u201c$149,000 less than a top-tier business program\u201d when\nmarketing my business courses. Compared with buying a book, my course\nlooks expensive; compared with the cost of an MBA program, it\u2019s a\nbargain.\n\nTake advantage of Contrast when presenting your offer, and you\u2019ll\nincrease the odds that your potential customers will view your offer\nfavorably.\n",

CHESTERTON, ESSAYIST\n\nB ecause of Conservation of Energy, people have a natural tendency to\ndecide to \u201cdo things later\u201d unless there\u2019s a compelling reason to act\nimmediately. As a businessperson, \u201clater\u201d is a big issue, because \u201clater\u201d\nturns into \u201cnever\u201d if the customer forgets about you. How can you\nencourage your customers to act immediately?\n\nScarcity encourages people to make decisions quickly. Scarcity is one of\nthe things that overcomes our tendency to conserve\u2014if you want something\nthat\u2019s scarce, you can\u2019t afford to wait without the risk of losing what you\nwant. Loss Aversion ensures that this possibility feels bad enough to prompt\nus to take action now.\n\nAs a result, adding a Scarcity element to your offer is a great way to\nencourage people to take action. Scarcity makes people understand that\nthey\u2019ll lose something valuable if they wait, making it more likely they\u2019Il\nchoose to act if they desire what is being offered.\n\nThe more scarce the value, the more intense the desire. In 1996, the\nTickle Me Elmo doll was the hot toy of the Christmas season. Elmo was\nalready a popular television character, but limited quantities of the toy\ndrove parents into a buying frenzy. Otherwise rational people started\nmobbing retailers when new stock became available and were willing to\n\nspend hundreds (sometimes thousands) of dollars for a toy that cost $28.99\nretail.\nHere are a few ways you can add an element of Scarcity to your offer:\n\n1.\n\nLimited quantities\u2014inform prospects that you\u2019re offering a limited\nnumber of units for sale.\n\n2.\n\nPrice increases\u2014inform prospects that the price will go up in the\nnear future.\n\n3.\nPrice decreases\u2014inform prospects that a current discount will end\nin the near future.\n\n4.\nDeadlines\u2014inform prospects that the offer is only good for a\nlimited period of time.\n\nScarcity that appears artificial can backfire. For example, putting an\nartificial limit on sales of ebooks, downloadable software, or electronic\nmusic files makes no sense\u2014everyone knows electronic files can be\nDuplicated at close to zero cost, so the Scarcity feels manipulative, which\nmakes people want to buy from you less. Price increases with deadlines, on\nthe other hand, tend to work well\u2014raising the price after a certain number\nof orders or a certain amount of time is a reasonable policy and is less likely\nto come across to the customer as unreasonable or manipulative.\n\nAdd an element of Scarcity to your offer and you\u2019ll encourage people to\nbuy now instead of \u201clater.\u201d\n",

Radar operators were natural test subjects\u2014their job\nconsisted of looking at blips on a radar screen in a dark room for hours on\nend.\n\nMost of the time, very little on the radar screen changed. When\nsomething abnormal appeared on the screen, however, it could be an\nemergency: inbound enemy airplanes on a bombing mission. The radar\noperator\u2019s job was to be alert enough to notice anomalies immediately, but\nthe task was difficult\u2014boredom often led to mistakes that cost lives.\n\nTo simulate this challenging environment, Mackworth created the\n\u201cMackworth Clock,\u201d a device designed to test how well people pay\nattention over time. The \u201cclock\u201d featured a second hand that worked like\nthe one on a normal clock, with a twist\u2014it would randomly skip a second,\nticking two notches instead of one. The test subject\u2019s job was to press a\nbutton every time they noticed the skip.\n\nHere\u2019s what Mackworth found: after ten minutes of staring at the clock,\nthe quality of the subject\u2019s attention went down\u2014way down. The maximum\nperiod of sustained attention even highly motivated operators (who were\ngiven substantial bonuses for performance) were able to sustain was thirty\nminutes\u2014any longer and they\u2019d zone out.\n\nNovelty\u2014the presence of new sensory data\u2014is critical if you want to\nattract and maintain attention over a long period of time. One of the reasons\npeople can focus on playing games or surfing the internet for hours at a\ntime is novelty\u2014every new viral video, blog post, social-media update, and\nnews report reengages our ability to pay attention.\n\nIn Brain Rules, John Medina shares how he\u2019s able to keep the attention\nof his students in classes that last more than an hour: he plans his class in\nmodules that last no more than ten minutes. Each module starts with a Hook\n\u2014an interesting story or anecdote, followed by a brief explanation of the\nkey concept. Following this format ensures that his audience retains more\ninformation and doesn\u2019t zone out. (That\u2019s the primary reason this book is\norganized in short sections that take less than ten minutes to read.)\n\nEven the most remarkable object of attention gets boring over time.\nHuman attention requires novelty to sustain itself. Continue to offer\nsomething new, and people will pay attention to what you have to offer.\n",

All of us have had the\nexperience of knowing or feeling that we should do something or that an\naction would be in our best interest . . . but we don\u2019t do it. The term for that\nexperience is Akrasia (pronounced \u201cah-KRAH-see-ah\u201d).\n\nAkrasia and procrastination are related, but they\u2019re not the same thing.\nProcrastination occurs when you\u2019ve decided to complete a task but you\nkeep putting it off until later without deciding to do it later. If you have\n\u201canswer email\u201d on your to-do list, but you browse the internet for hours\nwithout answering any email, that\u2019s procrastination.\n\nAkrasia is a deeper issue: it\u2019s a general feeling that you \u201cshould\u201d do\nsomething, without necessarily deciding to do it. The \u201cshould\u201d feeling\ndoesn\u2019t lead to decision or action, even if the action seems to be in your best\ninterest. Most people experience Akrasia when considering changing Habits\nthey no longer want (\u201cI should quit smoking\u201d), taking a new action (\u201cI\nshould donate to that nonprofit\u201d), or contemplating an uncomfortable topic\n(\u201cI should look into life insurance and talk to a lawyer to write a will\u201d). The\n\u201cshould\u201d feeling sticks around, but never leads to action, generating intense\nfrustration.\n\nAkrasia is a very old problem: discussions about the source of Akrasia\ngo back to Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. The term comes from the Greek\nakpaoia, which means \u201clacking command (over oneself).\u201d Socrates and\nPlato believed that Akrasia was a moral defect, while Aristotle argued that\nit stems from a mistaken opinion about what a person \u201cshould\u201d do. Even\nthough philosophers have been debating the topic for centuries, they\nhaven\u2019t discovered a cure.\n\nAkrasia is one of the most widespread and persistent barriers to getting\nthings done. In order to spend your time making progress, instead of\n\nfighting both sides in a battle of wills, it\u2019s useful to have a strategy for\nrecognizing and combating Akrasia when you see it.\n\nIn my experience, Akrasia has four general parts: a task, a desire, a\n\u201cshould,\u201d and an emotional experience of resistance. Within this\nframework, there can be many potential sources of resistance:\n\n\u00b0\nYou can\u2019t define what you want.\n\u00b0\n\nYou believe the task will bring you closer to something you don\u2019t\nwant.\n\nYou can\u2019t figure out how you\u2019re going to get from where you are\nright now to where you want to be.\n\n\u00b0\n\nYou idealize the desired End Result to the point that your mind\nestimates a low probability of achievement, resulting in Loss\nAversion.\n\nThe \u201cshould\u201d was established by someone else, not you, prompting\nPersuasion Resistance.\n\n\u00b0\n\nA competing action in the current Environment promises immediate\ngratification, while the reward of the task in question will come\nmuch later. (Psychologists call this \u201chyperbolic discounting.\u201d)\n\n.\n\nThe benefits of the action are abstract and distant, while other\npossible actions will provide concrete and immediate benefits.\n(Psychologists call this \u201cconstrual level theory\u201d or \u201cnear/far\u201d\nthinking.)\n\nAkratic situations can take many forms: eating a cookie versus\n\u201cbecoming healthier\u201d by sticking to a diet. Browsing the web versus\nexercising. Staying in a bad relationship versus moving on. Dreaming about\n\na new business idea versus testing it. Whenever you \u201cshould\u201d do something,\nbut resist doing it, you\u2019re experiencing Akrasia.\n\nAkrasia is a slippery problem, and there\u2019s no easy, universal solution.\nThat said, there are many strategies and techniques that are useful in\npreventing and resolving akratic situations. We\u2019ll discuss them in this\nchapter.\n",

                        "extracted-text": "W hen we\u2019re trying to \u201cbe productive,\u201d what are we trying to do?\n\nIdeally, you want to focus the full powers of your energy and Attention on\na single subject at a time.\n\nMonoidealism is the state of focusing your energy and attention on only\none thing, without conflicts. Monoidealism is often called a \u201cflow\u201d state, a\nterm coined by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. This is the state of\nhuman attention at its most productive: clear, focused Attention and effort\ndirected at one (and only one) subject for an extended period of time.\n\nMy friend P. J. Eby is a former computer programmer who specializes in\nhelping people use their minds in a more productive way. Here\u2019s how he\ndefines Monoidealism:\n\nWhen somebody says \u201cjust do it,\u201d they are trying to communicate that\nyou should not do anything else. It might better be phrased as, \u201cDo it,\nwithout thinking about anything, not even about what you\u2019re doing. In\nfact, don\u2019t even do it, just watch yourself doing it, but don\u2019t actually\ntry to do anything.\u201d\n\nProperly, \u201cmonoidealism\u201d is simply the state in which you have\nexactly one thing on your mind, with no conflicts. It\u2019s a condition that\nresults in one naturally taking action in relation to the thought, rather\nthan a technique in and of itself . . . The usefulness of a particular\n[productivity] technique for a particular individual will largely depend\n\non whether it addresses their particular stumbling blocks in achieving\na monoideal state.\n\nWhen you\u2019re \u201cjust doing it,\u201d you\u2019re in \u201cflow\u201d\u2014a Monoideal state. There\nare no distractions, no interruptions, no self-judgments, no doubts. When\nyour mind is in 100 percent \u201cdo\u201d mode, you get a lot done.\n\nSo how do you get yourself into a Monoideal state?\n\nFirst, eliminate potential distractions and interruptions. Depending on\nthe level of cognitive activity required to complete your work, it\u2019ll take ten\nto thirty minutes before your mind becomes absorbed in what you\u2019re doing.\nPhone calls, coworkers \u201cdropping by to pick your brain,\u201d and other\nunanticipated demands on your Attention will break your Monoideal state,\nso priority number one is ensuring that you don\u2019t get distracted. I often use\nearplugs or play instrumental music to eliminate background noise, and\ndisconnect the phone when | don\u2019t want to be interrupted.\n\nTurning off my internet connection while I\u2019m writing also makes it\nmuch easier for me to maintain a Monoideal state. Otherwise, I\u2019m way too\nlikely to browse the web when the going gets tough. Using similar Guiding\nStructure techniques is a good way to prevent your Attention from straying.\n\nSecond, eliminate inner Conflicts. Sometimes it\u2019s difficult to get started\nbecause you\u2019re experiencing a Conflict between two Perceptual Control\nsystems in your mind. Eliminating these Conflicts before you start working\nhelps you achieve a Monoideal state faster than you would\u2019 ve otherwise. If\nyou feel resistance to getting started, it\u2019s useful to spend some time and\nenergy exploring that Conflict more deeply before you keep working.\n\nWhile writing this book, I experienced several periods of frustrating\nresistance. Instead of trying to ignore the resistance or push through it,\nexploring that resistance using Mental Simulation and Reinterpretation helped\nme uncover a hidden Conflict: I wasn\u2019t happy with how my work was\nturning out, and doing more of what wasn\u2019t working would be a waste.\nSpending some time revising the structure of the book resolved that\nConflict, simultaneously making the book better and eliminating the source\nof the resistance.\n\nThird, kick-start the attention-focusing process by doing a \u201cdash.\u201d Since\nit can take ten to thirty minutes to get into the zone, setting aside ten to\nthirty minutes for a quick burst of focused work can make it much easier to\nget into the zone quickly. If you\u2019re not productive by the time the dash is\n\nover, you have permission to stop and do something else. That\u2019s rarely the\ncase: once you get started, it\u2019s easy to keep going.\n\nOne technique I often use is called the Pomodoro Technique,* named by\nits creator, Francesco Cirillo, after those funny little kitchen timers shaped\nlike a tomato (pomodoro in Italian). Here\u2019s how the technique works: Set a\nkitchen timer for twenty-five minutes. Your job is to focus on a single task\nfor the entire duration\u2014if you get stuck, just keep focusing until the timer\ngoes off. After the twenty-five-minute work period is over, you can take a\nfive-minute break, bringing the total duration to half an hour\u2014a block of\ntime any of us can fit into our schedule here and there.\n\nWhat I love about the Pomodoro Technique is that it accomplishes two\ngoals at once: it makes it easy to get started, and it gives you permission to\nignore distractions. Even if you\u2019re not excited about what you need to do,\nsaying to yourself \u201cit\u2019s only twenty-five minutes\u201d is a great way to\novercome the initial resistance to getting started. The Pomodoro Technique\nis also a good excuse to ignore distractions: if the phone rings, reminding\nyourself that \u201ca Pomodoro is indivisible\u201d is an effective way to give\nyourself permission to ignore it, maintaining your Monoideal state.\n\nIf you eliminate distractions and Conflicts before you start your dash,\nyou\u2019|I transition into a Monoideal state a few minutes into the work period.\nMeditation is a form of Monoidealism \u201cresistance training.\u201d Simple\nmeditations like focusing on your breathing, then bringing your focus back\n\nto your breath if and when your Attention strays is a way to practice the\nskills used to maintain your Attention in the face of distractions. As little as\nten minutes of simple meditation every day can improve your ability to\nfocus.\n",

The question is: How can\n\nyou accomplish everything you need to do in an efficient and effective\nway?\n\nMany people rely on multitasking: trying to do more than one thing at\nthe same time. While people assume this makes them more efficient,\nMonoidealism and multitasking are complete opposites. Neurologically, it\u2019s\nimpossible for your brain to multitask. When you\u2019re trying to do more than\none thing at a time, you\u2019re not parallel processing\u2014you\u2019re rapidly\nswitching your Attention from one thing to another. While you\u2019re paying\nattention to Task A, you\u2019re ignoring Task B until you switch back to it.\n\nAs a result, productive multitasking is a myth. According to several\nrecent neurological studies,\u2019 the more tasks you try to pay attention to at\nany given time, the more your performance at all of them suffers. That\u2019s\nwhy it\u2019s never a good idea to talk on a mobile phone while driving\u2014by\ntrying to focus on two things at once, you decrease your reaction times to\nthe same level as someone who\u2019s driving while intoxicated.\u201c\n\nEvery time you switch the focus of your Attention from one subject to\nanother, you incur the Cognitive Switching Penalty. In order to take action,\nyour brain has to \u201cload\u201d the context of what you\u2019re doing into working\nmemory. If you switch the focus of your Attention, you\u2019re forcing your\nbrain to spend time and effort thrashing, loading and reloading contexts\nover and over again. That\u2019s why it\u2019s possible to spend an entire day\nmultitasking, get nothing done, and feel exhausted at the end\u2014you\u2019ve\nburned all of your energy context-switching instead of making progress.\n\nThe Cognitive Switching Penalty is a Friction cost: the less you switch,\nthe lower the cost. That\u2019s why Monoidealism is so efficient\u2014by focusing\nyour Attention on only one thing at a time, you\u2019re allowing your brain to\nload the context into working memory once, which means you can focus\nyour energy on accomplishing the task at hand.\n\nTo avoid unproductive context switching, a batching strategy is best.\nEliminating distractions can help prevent unnecessary interruptions, but it\u2019s\nentirely possible to waste energy thrashing even if you have the entire day\nfree. The best approach to avoid unnecessary cognitive switching is to\ngroup similar tasks together.\n\nFor example, I find it difficult to make progress on creative tasks (like\nwriting or shooting training videos) between client calls. Instead of\nattempting to juggle both responsibilities at the same time, I batch them\ntogether. I usually focus on writing for a few uninterrupted hours in the\n\nmorning, then batch my calls and meetings in the afternoon. As a result, I\ncan focus on both responsibilities with my full Attention.\n\nI use a similar strategy when doing chores, updating financial reports, or\nrunning errands: I\u20191I dedicate a block of uninterupted hours to finishing\nthose tasks. As a result, | accomplish everything | need to do in very little\ntime.\n\nPaul Graham, a venture capitalist, programmer, and essayist, calls this\nbatching strategy \u201cMaker\u2019s Schedule/Manager\u2019s Schedule.\u201d\u00ae If you\u2019re\ntrying to create something, the worst thing you can do is to try to fit creative\ntasks in between administrative tasks\u2014context switching will kill your\nproductivity. The \u201cMaker\u2019s Schedule\u201d consists of large blocks of\nuninterrupted time; the \u201cManager\u2019s Schedule\u201d is broken up into many small\nchunks for meetings. Both schedules serve different purposes\u2014don\u2019t try to\ncombine them if your goal is to get useful work done.\n\nA simple rule of thumb | use to plan my day is the 3-10-20 method: in\none day, I have the capacity to finish three major tasks and ten minor tasks.\nA major task is any activity that requires more than twenty minutes of\nfocused concentration; all other tasks are minor. If a major task is\ninterrupted, restarting it counts as a new task.\n\nFor example, one day\u2019s major tasks might be writing a proposal,\nconsulting with a client, and reviewing a book. Between these major tasks, I\nmight make a short phone call, process and answer incoming emails, read a\nfew articles, do the dishes, and clean my office.\n\nAs long as I set aside large chunks of time for my major tasks, I can\naccomplish everything in a single day. If I\u2019m interrupted in the middle of a\nmajor task, that task won\u2019t be done that day, or another major task will have\nto slip. Keeping in mind that there\u2019s a limit to what I can accomplish in a\nsingle day makes it easier to keep Stress and Recovery in balance.\n\nEliminate unproductive context switching and you\u2019ll get more done with\nless effort.\n",

If\nyou keep a to-do list, you\u2019re probably assuming that those tasks are all your\nresponsibility to get done. That\u2019s not quite ttue\u2014completion is best for\nimportant tasks that only you can do particularly well. Everything else can\nbe handled in another manner.\n\nDeletion\u2014eliminating the task\u2014is effective for anything that\u2019s\nunimportant or unnecessary. If something on your task list is unimportant,\ndon\u2019t feel bad about eliminating it. If it\u2019s not worth doing, it\u2019s not worth\ndoing well or quickly\u2014don\u2019t hesitate to get rid of it.\n\nDelegation\u2014assigning the task to someone else\u2014is effective for\nanything another person can do 80 percent as well as you can. In order to\ndelegate, you must have someone to delegate to. Employees, contractors, or\noutsourcers can all help you get more things done by completing tasks on\nyour behalf.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have anyone to delegate routine tasks to, working with a\nvirtual-assistant company can be quite useful. For less than $100 a month,\nyou can enlist a team of professionals to help you get things done. If you\nhave little experience with delegation, it\u2019s an experiment worth trying.\n\nDeferment\u2014putting the task off until later\u2014is effective for tasks that\naren\u2019t critical or time dependent. Don\u2019t feel bad about putting some things\noff; the best way to bog yourself down is to try to handle too many things at\nthe same time. Saving noncritical tasks for later is a good way to keep your\nattention and energy focused on what\u2019s most important.\n\nIn Getting Things Done, David Allen recommends keeping a\n\u201csomeday/maybe\u201d list of things you\u2019d like to do someday but that aren\u2019t\nthat important right now. Creativity researcher Scott Belsky recommends a\nsimilar approach in Making Ideas Happen: create a \u201cback burner\u201d list of\ntasks you want to get to eventually but that aren\u2019t a priority right now.\nReviewing this list every few weeks is enough to identify tasks you\u2019re\nready to promote to active projects.\n\nUse all four options when processing your to-do list and you\u2019ll get more\ndone than you ever thought possible.\n\nYou've got to think about the big things while you're doing small things, so that all the small things go\nin the right direction.\n",

Well-formed Goals accomplish two things: they help you\nvisualize what you want and make you excited about achieving it. A Goal is\na statement that clarifies precisely what you want to achieve, which makes\nit easy for your brain to use Mental Simulation to Visualize what achieving that\nGoal looks like. If the End Result you\u2019re looking for is vague or fuzzy,\nyou\u2019re making it difficult for your mind\u2019s automatic planning systems to\nfind ways to get what you want. Well-formed Goals also play a key role in\nMotivation\u2014the better defined your Goal, the easier it is to get excited about\ndoing the things required to get what you want.\n\nFuzzy Goals like \u201cI want to climb a mountain\u201d aren\u2019t very helpful\nbecause they don\u2019t give your brain any material to work with. Which\nmountain? Where? When? Why? Without answers to these questions, you\nprobably won\u2019t do anything at all.\n\nWell-formed Goals pass the \u201cEverest Test.\u201d Useful Goals look like this:\n\u201cT want to climb to the summit of Mount Everest before my fortieth\nbirthday and take a panoramic picture to frame on my wall as a trophy.\u201d\nThis Goal is easy for your brain to simulate\u2014Mount Everest is in Nepal, so\nyou\u2019 ll have to arrange travel. You\u2019ll also have to improve your climbing\nskills, find a guide, buy equipment, purchase a suitable camera, etc. Once\nyou make a conscious Decision to achieve the Goal, your mind starts finding\nways to get it done.\n\nthe call or tell the caller, \u201cI\u2019m working under deadline\u2014I\u2019ll get back to you\nlater.\u201d By definition, everything that\u2019s not an MIT is not as important, so it\u2019s\neasier to say no to noncritical interruptions.\n\nAchieve your MITs first thing in the morning and then you\u2019ll have the\nrest of the day to handle anything else that comes up.\n",

Well-formed Goals accomplish two things: they help you\nvisualize what you want and make you excited about achieving it. A Goal is\na statement that clarifies precisely what you want to achieve, which makes\nit easy for your brain to use Mental Simulation to Visualize what achieving that\nGoal looks like. If the End Result you\u2019re looking for is vague or fuzzy,\nyou\u2019re making it difficult for your mind\u2019s automatic planning systems to\nfind ways to get what you want. Well-formed Goals also play a key role in\nMotivation\u2014the better defined your Goal, the easier it is to get excited about\ndoing the things required to get what you want.\n\nFuzzy Goals like \u201cI want to climb a mountain\u201d aren\u2019t very helpful\nbecause they don\u2019t give your brain any material to work with. Which\nmountain? Where? When? Why? Without answers to these questions, you\nprobably won\u2019t do anything at all.\n\nWell-formed Goals pass the \u201cEverest Test.\u201d Useful Goals look like this:\n\u201cT want to climb to the summit of Mount Everest before my fortieth\nbirthday and take a panoramic picture to frame on my wall as a trophy.\u201d\nThis Goal is easy for your brain to simulate\u2014Mount Everest is in Nepal, so\nyou\u2019 ll have to arrange travel. You\u2019!l also have to improve your climbing\nskills, find a guide, buy equipment, purchase a suitable camera, etc. Once\nyou make a conscious Decision to achieve the Goal, your mind starts finding\nways to get it done.\n\nGoals are most useful if they\u2019re Framed in a Positive, Immediate,\nConcrete, Specific (PICS) format:\n\n.\n\nPositive refers to Motivation\u2014your Goal should be something you\nmove toward, not away from. Goals like \u201cI don\u2019t want to be fat\nanymore\u201d are a recipe for Threat Lockdown\u2014you\u2019re reinforcing the\nnegative instead of using Reinterpretation to change your mind\u2019s\nprediction to get excited about improving. For best results, eliminate\nConflicts first, then move toward what you want to achieve.\n\n.\n\nImmediate refers to time scale: your Goals should be things that you\ndecide to make progress on now, not \u201csomeday\u201d or \u201ceventually.\u201d If\nyou don\u2019t want to commit to working on a particular Goal now, put\nit on your someday/maybe list and focus on something else.\n\n.\n\nConcrete means you\u2019re able to see the results in the real world.\nGoals are achievements\u2014you should know when you\u2019ve\naccomplished what you set out to achieve. Setting Goals like \u201cI\nwant to be happy\u201d won\u2019t work because they\u2019re not concrete\u2014how\nwould you know when you\u2019re done? When you reach the top of\nMount Everest, you\u2019ve achieved something in the real world\u2014that\u2019s\nconcrete.\n\n\u00b0\n\nSpecific means you\u2019re able to define what, when, and where you\u2019re\ngoing to achieve your Goal. Climbing Mount Everest before a\n\ncertain date in the near future is specific, which makes it easy for\nyour mind to plan how you\u2019ll go about accomplishing it.\n\nFor best effect, your Goals should be under your control. Goals like \u201cI\nwant to lose twenty pounds\u201d are soul crushing because they\u2019re not under\nyour control\u2014losing weight is a result, not an effort. If your weight\nrandomly moves up a few pounds on a given day, it\u2019s easy to feel defeated,\neven though you had no choice in the matter. For best results, make your\nGoals actions that are within your Locus of Control, like doing a minimum of\n\nthirty minutes of exercise every day and controlling the number of calories\nyou consume.\n\nTo track your Goals, any simple notebook or reference system will do. I\ncapture all of my Goals in a simple text file, which I print out and keep in\nmy to-do notebook. Whenever I\u2019m thinking about what I need to do, I have\nmy list of Goals handy for easy reference, which makes it easy to determine\nwhich tasks are most important.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to change your Goals. Sometimes we think we want something,\nonly to find out later that we don\u2019t want it so much anymore. Don\u2019t feel bad\nabout that\u2014it\u2019s called learning. If you find yourself working toward a Goal\nyou no longer feel good about, work on something else.\n",

It\u2019s okay to want to \u201cbe\nhappy\u201d or \u201cbe successful,\u201d but treating these desires as Goals is a recipe for\nfrustration. Instead of treating these states as achievements, it\u2019s far better to\nthink of them as decision criteria\u2014ways of understanding whether or not\nyour actions are leading to your desired results.\n\nStates of Being help you answer the question \u201cIs what I\u2019m doing right\nnow working?\u201d For example, if you want to feel happy, you may notice that\nspending time with close friends and family members creates the\n\nexperience you want, so making time for those things is obviously\nimportant.

Instead of using complex States of Being like \u201csuccess\u201d and\n\u201chappiness\u201d as decision criteria, it\u2019s far better to decide what these states\nmean to you. For example, | define \u201cbeing successful\u201d as \u201cworking on\nthings I enjoy with people | like,\u201d \u201cfeeling free to choose what I work on,\u201d\nand \u201chaving enough money to live without financial stress.\u201d Together, these\nStates of Being provide a much more useful definition of success\u2014if that\u2019s\nhow I\u2019m experiencing the world, I\u2019m \u201csuccessful.\u201d\n\nThe same goes for \u201chappiness.\u201d Instead of being a single State of Being,\n\u201cbeing happy\u201d is a combination of \u201chaving fun,\u201d \u201cspending time with\npeople I enjoy,\u201d \u201cfeeling calm,\u201d and \u201cfeeling free.\u201d When those States of\nBeing describe my experience in the present moment, I\u2019m \u201chappy.\u201d\nBreaking down \u201chappiness\u201d into its component parts helps me ensure I\u2019m\ndoing things that will help me experience it more fully and more often.\n\nDecide what States of Being you want to experience, and you\u2019ll have a\npowerful set of decision criteria you can use to evaluate the results of your\nactions in an entirely new and useful way.\n",

Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.\n\u2014WILL DURANT, HISTORIAN, PARAPHRASING ARISTOTLE, ANCIENT GREEK PHILOSOPHER\n\nW hat about things you want to do on a daily basis, like exercising? Is\nthat a Goal or a State of Being? Trick question: they don\u2019t belong in either\ncategory.\n\nHabits are regular actions that support us. Exercising, brushing your\nteeth, taking vitamins, following a particular diet, or keeping in touch with\nfriends and family are all examples of Habits that keep us happy and\nhealthy. Due to the power of Accumulation, small Habits can add up to huge\nresults over time.\n\nMost Habits take on one of four common forms: things you want to start\ndoing, things you want to stop doing, things you want to do more, and\nthings you want to do less. For example, you might want to start exercising\nregularly, stop watching television, drink more water, or spend less money.\n\nHabits usually require a certain amount of willpower to create. Therefore\nit\u2019s best to use the techniques we discussed in the section on Guiding\nStructure to make it easier to instill the Habits you want to adopt. If you\nwant to go to the gym first thing in the morning, packing your gym bag and\nlaying out workout clothing the night before makes it easier to go, since\nyou\u2019ve structured your environment to require less effort to act.\n\nHabits are easier to install if you look for triggers that signal when it\u2019s\ntime to act. For example, if you want to take vitamins, it\u2019s easier to\nremember to take them if you use another habitual action as a trigger for the\naction. Instead of relying on your mind to remember to take your vitamins\nin the middle of the day, you can use brushing your teeth in the morning or\nevening as a reminder.\n\nFor best results, focus on installing one Habit at a time. If you try to\ninstall too many Habits at once, you probably won\u2019t succeed at adopting\nany of them for long. Focus on installing one Habit until taking action feels\nautomatic, then move on to the next.\n",

I have\u2014it feels like someone suddenly\nunloaded hundreds of the exact make and model of the car you like all over\nthe highway.\n\nThat\u2019s not true, of course\u2014the universe isn\u2019t playing tricks on you. The\ncars were always there; you just never noticed them before. Before you\n\ndecided you were interested in a particular type of car, your brain filtered\nthose cars out of your awareness.\n\nOnce you became interested, however, your brain stopped filtering out\nthat information, and you started noticing every time that particular car\ndrove by. In a sense, you programmed your brain to notice certain things\nabout the Environment around you. All it took was becoming interested in\nsomething specific to remove the filter.\n\nPriming is a method of programming your brain to alert you when\nparticular information is present in your Environment. One of the\nfascinating ramifications of our brain\u2019s Pattern Matching function is that\nwe're always scanning the Environment for useful information. If you tell\nyour mind specifically what you want to find, it will alert you whenever\nyour senses notice it.\n\nPriming is a way to influence your brain\u2019s Pattern Matching capabilities.\nBy taking a few moments to decide what you\u2019re interested in and what\nyou\u2019re looking for, you can program your mind to alert you when it notices\nsomething relevant. Some people call this \u201cintuition\u2019\u2014Priming is how you\nput your intuition to productive use.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how | use Priming: in the book 10 Days to Faster\nReading, Abby Marks-Beale recommends a technique I refer to as \u201cpurpose\nsetting\u201d: taking a few minutes before you start reading to figure out (1) why\nyou want to read this material and (2) what kind of information you\u2019re\nlooking for. Jotting down a few notes before picking up the book reinforces\nwhat you\u2019re looking to find.\n\nAfter defining your purpose, you then pick up the book and flip through\nit quickly, paying particular Attention to the table of contents, section\nheadings, and index\u2014condensed sources of information about what the\nbook contains and how the material is structured. Jotting down terms and\nconcepts that appear to be important helps prime your brain to notice them\nwhen they appear later.\n\nThis process only takes a few minutes, but the impact it has on your\nreading speed is profound. Once you\u2019ve primed your mind to notice\nimportant concepts, you can work your way through the entire book at\nlightning speed. As you read, your brain filters out unimportant material\nand homes in on the material you\u2019re interested in learning.\n\nAs a result, it\u2019s possible to extract most of the useful content in almost\nany nonfiction book in less than twenty minutes. When I go to a library or\n\nbookstore, this technique allows me to read several books in less than an\nhour. Without using this method, there\u2019s no way I could have created the\nPersonal MBA reading list as it exists today, let alone written this book.\n\nOne of the ways people \u201cget lucky\u201d when they\u2019re working toward a\nparticular Goal is via Priming. One of the reasons Goal setting is useful is\nbecause it\u2019s an easy way to prime your brain to look for things that will help\nyou get what you want. If your goal is to climb Mount Everest, you\u2019re far\nmore likely to notice when tickets to Nepal are 70 percent off while\nbrowsing a travel website. If you read the same thing before setting the\nGoal, you\u2019d probably filter it out\u2014you\u2019d have no reason to pay Attention.\n\nTake some time to prime your brain to notice what\u2019s important to you\nand you'll find it.\n",

The word\n\u201cdecide\u201d comes from the Latin decidere, which means \u201cto cut off.\u201d When\nyou make a Decision, you\u2019re cutting off the other possible avenues that you\ncould explore, leaving only the path you\u2019re committing to. If you\u2019re not\ncutting off viable options, you\u2019re not making a Decision.\n\nNo matter how good your personal productivity system is, it can\u2019t make\nDecisions for you. No matter how sophisticated your task-tracking system\nis, it will never be able to tell you the best thing to do at any given moment.\nConstructing a system to make Decisions for you is a pipe dream\u2014all\nsystems can do is help provide information you can use to make better\nDecisions. Making the Decision will always be your responsibility.\n\nNo Decision, large or small, is ever made with complete information.\nSince we can\u2019t predict the future, we often attribute the feeling of\nindecisiveness to a lack of information. What\u2019s happening is mental\nthrashing\u2014your forebrain\u2019s job is to resolve ambiguities and make\nDecisions, so your midbrain will continue to send signals until your\n\nforebrain does its job. Once a Decision is made\u2014whatever it is\u2014the\nthrashing stops.\n\nDon\u2019t feel you need to have all of the information before you decide\u2014\nthe world is too complicated to make accurate predictions. Retired general\nColin Powell famously advocates collecting half of the information\navailable, then making a Decision, even though your information is\nincomplete. \u201cDon\u2019t wait until you have enough facts to be 100 percent sure,\nbecause by then it is almost always too late . .. Once [you\u2019ve acquired 40 to\n70 percent of the available information], go with your gut.\u201d\u201d\n\nIf that\u2019s a winning strategy for life-and-death battle decisions, it\u2019ll work\nfor life\u2019s daily Decisions as well. Collect just enough information to make\nan informed Decision, then make your Decision and move forward.\n\nFailure to make a Decision is itself a Decision. Life doesn\u2019t stop if you\nrefuse to choose\u2014the world will keep moving forward, and you may be\nforced to take action by default. Abdicating responsibility for your\nDecisions doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not making them\u2014you\u2019re just allowing\nyourself to be a victim of circumstance.\n\nFor best results, make your Decisions in a conscious, deliberate way. In\nmy experience, many people have difficulty figuring out what to do because\nthey hesitate to make a Decision\u2014Loss Aversion prompts them to leave all\nof their options open, \u201cjust in case.\u201d Without a Decision, however, their\nbrain can\u2019t use Mental Simulation to figure out how to get from where they are\nnow to where they think they want to be, so their minds thrash around\nunproductively.\n\nSaying to yourself, \u201cI am deciding to do X right now,\u201d makes it much\neasier to proceed. Once a Decision is finally made, your brain\u2019s Mental\nSimulation planning circuits will kick into gear, and you\u2019ll start moving\nagain.\n\nIf you\u2019re having difficulties making a Decision, Steve Pavlina, the\nauthor of Personal Development for Smart People, recommends using this\nquestion as the tiebreaker: \u201cOut of the available options, which experience\ndo I want to have?\u201d If you\u2019re having a difficult time making a particular\nDecision, it\u2019s probably because your brain is having a hard time figuring out\nwhich one is best. It\u2019s an uncomfortable situation, but what it means is that\nit doesnt really matter which one you choose. If that\u2019s true, you can choose\nthe experience vou find more interesting.\n\nWhen Kelsey received an enticing job offer in New York City, we spent\nweeks torn between staying in Cincinnati and moving to the big city. There\nwere many uncertainties involved with moving: Where would we live?\nCould we afford it? What about my job? It was enough to give us both a\nbad case of Threat Lockdown.\n\nIn the end, we realized there wasn\u2019t a clear winner, so it didn\u2019t matter\nwhich one we chose. Living in New York was an experience we both\nwanted to have, so we decided to move. Almost immediately, we felt a\nsense of clarity and relief. Instead of continuing to thrash, making a\nDecision allowed us to move forward, even in the face of Uncertainty.\n",

Conducting a\n\u201croot-cause analysis\u201d is a useful way to discover the motivations behind our\ndesires.\n\nThe Five-Fold Why is a technique to help you discover what you actually\nwant. Instead of taking your desires at face value, examining the root cause\nof what you want can help you define your core desires.\n\nApplying the Five-Fold Why is easy: whenever you set a Goal or\nobjective, ask yourself why you want it. If you want to become a\nmillionaire, ask yourself why you want to have $1 million.\n\nDon\u2019t try to force an answer\u2014just ask yourself the question in a spirit of\ncuriosity and wait until your mind generates a response on its own.

How do you work on a project so large it threatens to\noverwhelm you?\n\nSimple: focus only on the action you need to take next to move toward\nyour Goal.\n\nThe Next Action is the next specific, concrete thing you can do right away\nto move a project forward. You don\u2019t have to know everything that must be\ndone to make progress on a project\u2014all you need to know is the very next\nthing you can do to move the project forward.\n\nDavid Allen, the author of Getting Things Done, coined the term to\ndescribe one of the core steps of his \u201cfundamental process\u201d:\n\n1.\nWrite down a project or situation that is most on your mind at this\nmoment.\n\n2.\n\nNow describe in a single written sentence your intended desired\noutcome for this problem or situation. What needs to happen to\nmark this \u201cdone\u201d?\n\n3.\nNext, write down the very next physical action step required to\nmove the situation forward.\n\n4.\nPut those answers in a system you trust.\n\nAccording to Allen, these questions help you clarify what \u201cdone\u201d and\n\u201cdoing\u201d look like. If you define what \u201cdone\u201d looks like, you can focus your\nattention and energy on doing the things that will get you to \u201cdone.\u201d\n\nWriting this book was a massive undertaking\u2014it took me years to\ncompile the research and a little over a year to write the text. \u201cWrite the\nbook\u201d is not an action\u2014it\u2019s a project.

After I broke up the book into well-defined\nsections, it was much easier to make progress, since each individual task\nwas less overwhelming.\n\nTo keep yourself from feeling overwhelmed, track your projects and\ntasks separately. Here\u2019s what I do: I always carry around a notebook that\ncontains a three-by-five index card.\u00ae The card contains a short list of my\nactive projects. The notebook contains my to-do list: the Next Actions that\nwill move my projects forward, which I process using a system called\nAutofocus, which was created by Mark Forster.\u00b0 The system helps me use\nmy intuition to identify what I can do right now to make progress. As long\nas my projects are tied to my Goals and are aligned with my preferred States\nof Being, it\u2019s only a matter of time before I complete them.\n\nFocus on completing the Next Action and you\u2019ll complete the entire\nproject.\n",

When exercising by yourself, it\u2019s very easy to listen to the little voice\ninside your head that says, \u201cThis hurts\u2014you should stop,\u201d even if you\u2019 ll get\nbetter results by continuing.\n\nWhen you\u2019re working with someone else, the little voice goes away,\nsince there\u2019s a person in your Environment who\u2019s encouraging you to push\nyourself just a little bit more. As a result, you get a better workout.\n\nSince we respond more to stimuli in our Environment than our own\ninternal thoughts, there\u2019s a simple method we can use to improve our\nproductivity\u2014we can convert our internal thoughts into an external form\nour minds are better equipped to use.\n\nExternalization takes advantage of our perceptual abilities in a very\nintelligent way. By converting our internal thought processes into an\nexternal form, Externalization gives us the ability to reinput information\ninto our own brains via a different channel, which gives us access to\n\nadditional cognitive resources we can use to process the same information\nin a different way.\n\nThere are two primary ways to Externalize your thoughts: writing and\nspeaking. Writing (or drawing, if you prefer) is the best way to capture\nideas, plans, and tasks. Not only does writing give you the ability to store\ninformation in a form you can reference later, it gives your mind the\nopportunity to examine what you know from a different angle. Challenges\nand issues that seem insurmountable while they\u2019re bouncing around in your\nfrontal lobe can often be solved after putting them onto paper.\n\nCapturing your ideas on paper makes them easier to share with others, in\naddition to archiving your thoughts for later reference and review. As the\nsaying goes, \u201cThe palest ink is clearer than the fondest memory.\u201d\nNotebooks and journals, regularly used, are worth their weight in gold.\n\nSpeaking\u2014to yourself or to another person\u2014is another effective method\nof Externalization. Vocal Externalization explains why most of us have had\nthe experience of solving our own problems while talking with a friend or\ncolleague. By the time you\u2019re done talking, you\u2019re likely to have more\ninsight into your problem\u2014even if your listener didn\u2019t say a word.\n\nThe key to vocal Externalization is to find an audience who is willing to\nlisten and avoid interrupting you as you talk through an issue. Even talking\nto yourself or an inanimate object can help: explaining your problem to a\nrubber duck, teddy bear, action figure, or other anthropomorphic object\nsitting on your desk can work if you can get over the initial awkwardness.\nMore often than not, \u201crubber ducking\u201d the problem makes it easier to solve.\n\nHowever you choose to Externalize your thoughts, don\u2019t keep them\nlocked up in your head. Experiment with different approaches to find which\nmethod works best for you. To help keep your mind clear during the day,\nschedule a small amount of dedicated time to Externalize. Early mornings\nor late evenings work best for this purpose.\n\nHowever you do it, the more you Externalize, the clearer your thoughts\nwill become, and the faster you\u2019ll make progress toward your goals.\n",

All you have to do is suspend judgment, pose the question, let your\nmind wander, and wait for the answer.\n\nThought Experiments are one of our most powerful (and underused)\ncapabilities. Instead of waiting for your brain to simulate a potential course\nof action, a well-constructed Thought Experiment allows you to \u201cforce\u201d\nyour brain to run the simulations you want it to run.\n\nThought Experiments are useful because of their flexibility: you can\nimagine anything you want, even if an actual experiment would be too\nexpensive or risky.

While traveling on business in September of 2008, I wrote\na question in my notebook: \u201cWhat would have to be true if I left my job by\nearly November?\u201d I didn\u2019t think the question was realistic, but it was\nambitious enough to be interesting, so | inhibited my judgment and\nsimulated the question anyway.\n\nWhen you run a Thought Experiment, you assume the event or end state\nyou\u2019re simulating is already true. When you supply your mind with an\nartificial destination, it will start to fill in the blanks between point A and\npoint B. When I ran the simulation on leaving my job, I assumed that it was\ndefinitely going to happen, then figured out how it would be possible.\n\nAs Iran the simulation, other questions presented themselves. How\nmuch revenue was coming in from the Personal MBA? How many clients\nwould I need to have? What other projects would I work on, and how much\nmoney would I need to bring in to be financially Sufficient? As these\nquestions presented themselves, I answered them as best I could.\n\nBy the time I finished the Thought Experiment, I had discovered it was\npossible for me to leave my job at P&G that day, instead of \u201cin a year or\ntwo.\u201d When I returned to work the following Monday, I resigned. My last\nday of corporate work was four days before my twenty-eighth birthday.\n\nIn my experience, time spent examining counterfactuals and potential\nactions is never wasted. Instead of assuming what you want isn\u2019t realistic or\npossible, Thought Experiments allow you to figure out what it would take\nto make what you want real. After doing a simulation, you\u2019! always come\naway with a greater understanding of what it takes to do something or what\nwould need to be true in order to make something work.\n",

In that essay,\nParkinson proposed what became his eponymous law: \u201cWork expands so as\nto fill the time available for its completion.\u201d\n\nIf something must be done in a year, it\u2019ll be done in a year. If something\nmust be done next week, it\u2019ll be done next week. If something must be done\ntomorrow, it\u2019l] be done tomorrow. We plan based on how much time we\nhave, and when the deadline approaches, we start to make choices and\nTrade-offs to do what must be done to complete the task by the deadline.\n\nParkinson\u2019s Law should not be considered carte blanche to set\nunreasonable deadlines. All projects take time; you can\u2019t build a skyscraper\nin a day or a factory in a week. The more complex the project, the more\ntime it takes\u2014up to a point.\n\nParkinson's Law is best used as a Thought Experiment question. What would\nit look like if you finished the project on a very aggressive time scale? If\nyou had to build a skyscraper in a day, how would you go about doing it?\nAnswer the question the way you would a counterfactual and you\u2019ll\n\ndiscover techniques or approaches you can use to get the work done in less\ntime.\n\nIngvar Kamprad, the founder of IKEA, once said, \u201cIf you split your day\ninto ten-minute increments, and you try to waste as few of those ten-minute\nincrements as possible, you\u2019|l be amazed at what you can get done.\u201d For\nsmall tasks, use what I call Ingvar\u2019s Rule\u2014assume each task will take no\nmore than ten minutes to complete, then begin. This includes meetings and\nphone calls: for some reason, the default time period for meetings is an\nhour, whether you need it or not. Often you can get just as much, if not\nmore, done if you assume that the basic unit of time for a meeting is ten\nminutes. Ingvar\u2019s Rule is a Thought Experiment\u2014what would you do if\nyou only had ten minutes to get something useful done? Figure out what\nyou can accomplish in that period of time, then do it.\n",

The contrast is astounding\u2014how could anyone be so\nhorribly wrong about something so obvious?\n\nExcessive Self-Regard Tendency is the natural tendency to overestimate\nyour own abilities, particularly if you have little experience with the matter\nat hand. Being optimistic about our capabilities has benefits\u2014it increases\nthe probability we\u2019ll try something new. That\u2019s how novices sometimes\naccomplish great things\u2014they do them before realizing how risky or\ndifficult their objective was.\n\nSteve Wozniak, who cofounded Apple Computer with Steve Jobs, built\nthe world\u2019s first personal computer.

But I\nwas going to do it, and so I did it.\u201d Woz didn\u2019t know what he was doing, but\nhe thought he could, so he did.\n\nOur natural confidence also comes with a cost\u2014the potential for\nharmful self-delusion.\n\nThe Excessive Self-Regard Tendency is even more pronounced if you\ndon\u2019t know much about the subject at hand. The more incompetent a person\nis, the less they realize they\u2019re incompetent. The more a person knows, the\nbetter their ability to self-assess their capabilities, and the more likely they\nare to doubt their capabilities until they have enough experience to know\nthey\u2019ve mastered the subject.\n\nAccording to David Dunning and Justin Kruger of Cornell University,\nCharles Darwin\u2019s famous quip \u201cIgnorance more frequently begets\nconfidence than does knowledge\u201d is literally true.

When you\u2019re\nconsciously competent, you regain your confidence: you know the limits of\nyour knowledge and can assess your abilities in an unbiased way.\n\nA certain amount of humility is a valuable self-correcting quality.\nOverconfidence sometimes produces greatness, but it\u2019s a high-risk bet\u2014\nwithout guidance, you\u2019re far more likely to find yourself in a bad situation.\nCultivating a healthy amount of humility can keep you from assuming you\nknow everything there is to know about everything, then painfully\ndiscovering otherwise.\n\nThe Excessive Self-Regard Tendency is universal (be very wary if your\nfirst impulse is to think you\u2019re immune to it), so it\u2019s important to have\ntrusted advisers who aren\u2019t afraid to tell you if you\u2019re making a mistake.\nOne of the easiest ways to get yourself in trouble via the Excessive Self-\nRegard Tendency is estimating deadlines\u2014overconfidence is a major cause\nof the Planning Fallacy.

Above a certain point, the more tasks a person has to\ndo, the more their performance on all of those tasks decreases.\n\nImagine juggling bowling pins.

If you\u2019re working for a manager who expects\nyou to work twenty hours a day, seven days a week, telling them no by\nsetting limits on your working hours may cost you your job.

No matter what you choose to do, time will pass.\n\nThe implicit assumption of time-management systems is that every hour\nis fungible\u2014equivalent to any other. Nothing could be further from the\ntruth: all people are created equal, but all hours are most definitely not.\n\nThroughout the day, your energy level cycles up and down. Your body\nhas natural rhythms during the day, which I call Energy Cycles. Most people\nare familiar with the twenty-four-hour circadian rhythm, which wakes you\nup in the morning and makes you feel tired at night. Lesser known is the\nninety-minute ultradian rhythm, which is described in The Power of Full\nEngagement by Jim Loehr and Tony Schwartz.\n\nThe ultradian rhythm influences the flow of hormones throughout your\nbody. When your energy is on an upswing, you\u2019re capable of focusing\ndeeply and getting a lot accomplished. When it\u2019s on a downswing, all your\nmind and body want to do is rest and recover. There\u2019s nothing abnormal\n\nabout these changes in energy during the day, but we often act as though\nbeing on a downswing is somehow a problem that needs to be fixed.\nNowadays, it\u2019s popular to try to \u201chack\u201d this cycle to get more done by\nresting less. Attempting to work eight to twelve hours without a break is not\nuncommon in competitive workplaces. Most of us try to overclock our\nbrains with large doses of sugar and caffeine. Some people even resort to\nabusing prescription or illegal drugs to work a little bit longer or faster.\nLike all biological organisms, humans need to rest and recover for peak\nperformance. Taking a break isn\u2019t a sign of laziness or weakness\u2014it\u2019s a\nrecognition of a fundamental human need. Paying attention to your natural\nEnergy Cycle will help you perform at your best over long periods of time.\nHere are four simple ways to work with your body instead of against it:\n\n1.\n\nLearn your patterns. Use a notebook or calendar to track how much\nenergy you have during different parts of the day, as well as what\nyou\u2019re eating and drinking. If you do this for a few days, you\u2019 ll\nnotice patterns in how your energy waxes and wanes, allowing you\nto plan your future work.!!\n\n2.\n\nMaximize your peak cycles. When you\u2019re in an up cycle, you\u2019re\ncapable of getting a lot accomplished, so plan your day to take\nadvantage of that energy. If you\u2019re doing creative work, carve out a\nthree- to four-hour block of time during an up cycle to get it done. If\nyour work consists of attending a lot of meetings, plan the most\nimportant meetings during the up cycle.\n\n3.\n\nTake a break. When you\u2019re in a down cycle, it\u2019s better to rest than\nattempt to power through it. Rest and recovery are not optional\u2014if\nyou don\u2019t rest now, your body will force you to rest later, either by\ncycling down longer than usual or by getting sick. During a down\ncycle, go for a walk, meditate, or take a twenty-minute nap.\nRelaxing on the down cycle can restore your energy, allowing you\nto take full advantage of the next up cycle.\n\n4.\n\nGet enough sleep. Sleep deprivation results in a prolonged down\ncycle, which gets in the way of getting things done. To ensure you\nget enough sleep each evening, set a timer to go off an hour before\nyou'd ideally be in bed sleeping. When the timer goes off, turn off\nthe computer and/or TV, go through your evening routine, make a\ncup of noncaffeinated tea, and spend some time with a book you\nenjoy. When your reading comprehension starts to go down, you\u2019 ll\nknow it\u2019s time for bed.\n\nPaying attention to your Energy Cycles during the day will help you get\nthe most out of the time you have available. Take maximum advantage of\nyour up cycles and rest on your down cycles, and you\u2019ll be amazed at what\nyou can accomplish in a day.\n",

ELIOT, POET AND PLAYWRIGHT\n\nD uring my last semester of college\u2014around the time I created the\nPersonal MBA\u2014I pushed myself to the breaking point.\n\nI was taking twenty-two credit hours of classes across three subjects:\nbusiness information systems, real estate, and philosophy. Every class I\ntook had some kind of capstone project on top of the final exam. Two of the\ncourses | was taking were at the graduate level, and each required a twenty-\nplus-page paper on a complex topic to pass. I had far too much work to do\nin the time available.\n\nBy the last two weeks of the quarter, I was an absolute wreck: sleep\ndeprived, exhausted, and burned out. Everything got done on time, but the\nworkload took its toll, and it took me a few weeks of doing nothing after\ngraduation to fully recover.\n\nEven though it wasn\u2019t pleasant, I\u2019m glad I found my breaking point.\nHere\u2019s why: now I know how much I\u2019m capable of doing and how much is\ntoo much. I know more about how my mind and body react to stress, and\n\nI\u2019m better able to identify the warning signs of taking on too much before\nthings get out of hand.\n\nAs a result, I\u2019ve learned to keep myself running at about 90 percent\ncapacity, which is enough to get a lot done without burning out. At any\ngiven time, I\u2019m writing, consulting, and working on a few interesting side\nprojects. Paying attention to Stress and Recovery ensures that I don\u2019t take on\ntoo much to handle. Learning my breaking point has made it much easier to\nknow when to push and when to slow down.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to know how much you\u2019re capable of until you decide to\npush your limits. As long as you stay safe by limiting your experimentation\nto things that won\u2019t kill you or do permanent damage, you can learn a lot\nabout how you work by stretching yourself to the limit. The knowledge you\ngain will help you make better choices in the future about which projects to\ntake on and how much is too much.\n\nThat said, our bodies are not machines that are designed to operate at\nmaximum capacity at all times. It\u2019s easy to fall into the trap of comparing\nyour output to an idealized version of yourself who can build Rome in a\nday, then build the Great Wall of China as a fun side project. If that\u2019s your\nvision of personal effectiveness, you\u2019ll always come up short.\n\nYou are not a machine\u2014the ideal of human productivity is not acting\nlike a robot. Humans need rest, relaxation, sleep, and play in order to\nfunction in an efficient and effective way. Too little of any of these things\ncan seriously diminish your capacity to do good work and impact how\nmuch you enjoy your life.\n\nSo how do you rest and recover? It\u2019s simple: spend time doing\nsomething different from your normal activities and responsibilities. The\nless overlap between your hobby and your work, the better.\n\nDuring World War II, Winston Churchill was under as much stress as a\nperson can withstand. As prime minister of the United Kingdom, he was\nresponsible for leading the defense of Great Britain from 1940 until the end\nof the war in 1945. The fate of a country and the freedom of its people\ndepended upon his fortitude and persistence for five long years.\n\nHow did Churchill keep from collapsing under such a heavy burden? In\nPainting as a Pastime, Churchill explains how spending time painting\nhelped him recover from the demands of war and politics:\n\nMany remedies are suggested for the avoidance of worry and mental\noverstrain by persons who, over prolonged periods, have to bear\nexceptional responsibilities and discharge duties upon a very large\nscale. Some advise travel, and others, retreat. Some praise solitude,\nand others, gaiety. No doubt all these may play their part according to\nthe individual temperament. But the element which is constant and\ncommon in all of them is Change.\n\nChange is the master key. A man can wear out a particular part of\nhis mind by continually using it and tiring it, just in the same way as\nhe can wear out the elbows of his coat. There is, however, this\ndifference between the living cells of the brain and inanimate articles:\none cannot mend the frayed elbows of a coat by rubbing the sleeves or\nshoulders; but the tired parts of the mind can be rested and\nstrengthened, not merely by rest, but by using other parts. It is not\nenough to merely switch off the lights which play upon the main and\nordinary field of interest; a new field of interest must be illuminated.\n\nIt is no use saying to the tired mental muscles\u2014if one may coin\nsuch an expression\u2014\u201cI will give you a good rest,\u201d \u201cI will go for a\nlong walk,\u201d or \u201cI will lie down and think of nothing.\u201d The mind keeps\nbusy just the same. If it has been weighing and measuring, it goes on\nweighing and measuring. If it has been worrying, it goes on worrying.\nIt is only when new cells are called into activity, when new stars\nbecome the lords of the ascendant, that relief, repose, refreshment are\nafforded.\n\nIf Churchill could find time to paint in the middle of a world war, you\ncan find time in your busy schedule to rest and recover doing something\nyou enjoy. Dedicating guilt-free time to rest and recovery will make your\nlife more enjoyable and more productive.\n",

In the short term, it might: for the first week or so, you\u2019ll probably\nexperience great pleasure when you drive. Over time, however, your joy\nwill fade, a phenomenon psychologists call \u201chedonic adaptation.\u201d Before\nlong, your new car will blend into your surroundings and your mind will\nfixate on something else to pursue in the quest for happiness.\n\nThis cycle is called the Hedonic Treadmill: we pursue pleasurable things\nbecause we think they\u2019ll make us happy. When we finally achieve or\nacquire what we\u2019re seeking, we adapt to our success in a very short period\nof time, and our success no longer gives us pleasure. As a result, we begin\nseeking something new, and the cycle repeats.\n\nThe Hedonic Treadmill explains why people who achieve wealth, status,\nand fame continue to seek more. Since we\u2019re not satisfied with what we\nhave for very long, it\u2019s only a matter of time before we fixate on something\nelse to achieve or possess.\n\nThe Hedonic Treadmill is a major problem if you\u2019d like to experience a\nfeeling of success or achievement for an extended period of time. It\u2019s\npossible to work hard, invest, sacrifice, and push your way to the top of\nyour field, only to find yourself restless and despondent. You\u2019d be surprised\nat how many \u201csuccessful\u201d people aren\u2019t happy with their lives, even after\nthey\u2019ve achieved everything they set out to do.\n\nlikely to feel happy. The converse is also true: when you feel ill, you\ntend to experience less pleasure, enjoyment, and life satisfaction.\n\nExperimenting with ways to improve your typical level of health\nand energy can result in huge improvements in your quality of life.\nRemember, the human body has Performance Requirements: food,\nexercise, and rest are not optional. If you make it a priority to give\nyour body what it needs to thrive, you\u2019! reap the rewards over the\nyears to come.\n\n3.\n\nSpend time with people you enjoy. One of the single biggest\npredictors of happiness is the amount of time you spend with people\nyou enjoy: family, friends, and like-minded acquaintances. The\ncontext and environment are less important than the people you\nspend time with.\n\nDifferent people need different levels of social contact to feel\nhappy. Extroverted people feel energized by social contact and need\nto be around others on a regular basis. Introverted people (like me)\ncan go days or weeks with little social contact and get their energy\nfrom spending time alone. Still, introverted people benefit from\nspending time with people they like: regular social time with friends\nis highly correlated with major, sustained increases in life\nsatisfaction. Long meals and trips with friends are a great use of\ntime.\n\nAccording to George Vaillant, the project\u2019s director, the results of\nthe Harvard Study of Adult Development (the longest-running\nlongitudinal study of mental health) boil down to this: \u201cThe only\nthing that really matters in life are your relationships with other\npeople.\u201d\n\n4.\nRemove chronic annoyances. There are many things in life that can\nwear on your nerves. Examining ways to reduce or eliminate\nchronic stresses or annoyances can generate significant\nimprovements in life satisfaction.\n\nIf you find driving in rush-hour traffic stressful, moving closer to\nwork is a good solution.

By finding simple ways to remove unnecessary stress\nand frustration, you\u2019!I spend less time and energy feeling bad and\nmore time feeling good.\n\n5.\n\nPursue a new challenge. Most people assume retirees feel\noverjoyed, but that\u2019s often not the case. It\u2019s common for people to\nderive a sense of purpose and enjoyment from their work, and\nretirees can feel empty and lost when their former career is no\nlonger a priority. Left unresolved, this sense of loss can spiral into\ndepression.\n\nThe solution is to take on an exciting new challenge. This\nchallenge can be anything: mastering a new skill, completing a big\nproject, or pursuing a major accomplishment. Whether it\u2019s learning\na new language, playing an instrument, building something from\nscratch, or completing a marathon, striving for new achievement is\nthe best way to experience happiness and growth over long periods\nof time.\n\nFocusing on experiences over material goods goes a long way if\nyou want to step off the Hedonic Treadmill. In the immortal words\nof Charles Kingsley, a nineteenth-century historian and clergyman:\n\u201cWe act as though comfort and luxury were the chief requirements\nof life, when all we need to make us happy is something to be\nenthusiastic about.\u201d\n",

                        "extracted-text": "Never compare your inside with someone else's outside.\n\u2014HUGH MACLEOD, CARTOONIST AND AUTHOR OF IGNORE EVERYBODY\n\nn business and in life, it\u2019s easy to compare our situation to others\u2019. Status\nseeking ensures that we spend energy tracking our relative status to our\n\npeers, and most of the time our conclusions aren\u2019t favorable.\n\nWe tend to fixate on what other people are accomplishing instead of\nwhat we need to do next to achieve our Goals. When other people we know\naccomplish big things, it\u2019s easy to feel sad for ourselves instead of happy\nfor their achievements, as if their success diminishes us in some way. It\ndoesn\u2019t.\n\nThe Comparison Fallacy is a simple idea: other people are not you, and\nyou are not other people. You have unique skills, goals, and priorities. In the\nend, comparing yourself to other people is silly, and there\u2019s little to be\ngained by it.\n\nHere\u2019s an example: one of my friends is very successful in business and\nmakes about ten times what I make each year. He has received a lot of\npublic recognition for his work. His products sell well, and he enjoys his\nsuccess. There\u2019s a lot to envy.\n\nHere\u2019s the other side of the coin: my friend works twelve hours a day,\nsometimes more. He doesn\u2019t have a family. He has a large staff that requires\nconstant attention, and his business\u2019s Overhead is more than ten times mine.\nHe\u2019s overwhelmed with email, phone calls, and meetings. He\u2019s under\ntremendous stress almost all the time.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see the benefits of my friend\u2019s life, and just as easy to\noverlook the Trade-offs. That\u2019s the trick: he is successful in certain areas\nbecause he works very hard, and he\u2019s willing to pay the price of his success.\n\nIf I could swap lives with my friend, I wouldn\u2019t: I\u2019d be miserable. His\nlife doesn\u2019t mesh with my priorities or how I prefer to live and work. The\nbenefits he enjoys appeal to me, but I\u2019m not willing to pay the price he\u2019s\npaid for obtaining them. Remembering the Comparison Fallacy allows me\nto wish him well and stay focused on achieving the Goals that are most\nimportant to me. I can be genuinely happy for his success and not waste my\nenergy on pointless envy.\n\nThe same trick works in any situation that has the potential of generating\nfeelings of envy or inferiority. Whenever you\u2019re tempted to compare\nyourself to an acquaintance, colleague, classmate, or celebrity, it always\nhelps to keep in mind that your goals, preferences, and priorities are not the\nsame. You\u2019ve lived different lives, and you\u2019ve each paid a different price\nfor what you\u2019ve accomplished. Any comparison you try to make renders\nitself invalid, so you can relax.\n\nThe only metric of success that matters is this: are you spending your\ntime doing things you like, with people you enjoy, in a way that keeps you\nfinancially sufficient? If so, don\u2019t worry about what other people are doing.\nIf not, focus on making changes that are within your Locus of Control, so you\ncan start moving in the direction you desire. Remember the Comparison\nFallacy and keep moving closer to what you want.\n",

DEBS, LABOR UNION ACTIVIST\n\nn general, there are two primary ways of looking at the world\u2014two mind-\nsets that influence your response to new experiences.\n\nThe first basic mind-set is that your skills and abilities are fixed. If you\ntry something and it doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s because you\u2019re \u201cnot good at that,\u201d\nand you never will be. You were born with innate skills and abilities that\nwill never change.\n\nUsing this mind-set, if you experience a challenge or difficulty, you\u2019re\nlikely to stop\u2014you\u2019re obviously not good at it, so why bother?\n\nThe second basic mind-set is that your skills and abilities are malleable.\nIf you try something and it doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s because you haven\u2019t worked\non it very much, but if you keep trying, you\u2019ll get better. Your skills and\nabilities are like muscles\u2014they strengthen with use. If you experience a\nchallenge or difficulty, you\u2019re likely to keep going\u2014you might not be good\nat it yet, but you\u2019re always getting better.\n\nThese two mind-sets color how you experience everything in the world.\nIn Mindset: The New Psychology of Success, Dr. Carol S. Dweck calls these\nmind-sets the \u201cfixed\u201d and \u201cgrowth\u201d theories of intelligence. If you have a\n\u201cfixed\u201d mind-set, challenges are a commentary on your worth as a person\u2014\nyou\u2019ve been tried and found wanting, which makes trying new things feel\nthreatening. If you have a \u201cgrowth\u201d mind-set, challenges are an obstacle to\nbe overcome by working harder. The fixed mind-set is an example of a\nLimiting Belief: something you believe is true about the world that holds you\nback from achieving a Goal you value. The fixed mind-set isn\u2019t true, but it\u2019s\ncapable of holding you back if you choose to believe it.\n\nSome Limiting Beliefs are the result of errors in Pattern Matching. Here\u2019s\na common example: if you believe that wealthy people are superficial,\nunethical, or corrupt, you\u2019 ll find it difficult to make money. If you make\nmore money than you make now, you\u2019ll become one of \u201cthose people,\u201d and\nthe thought will make you uncomfortable anytime money is an issue.\n\nIf you don\u2019t identify the Conflict and resolve it, money matters will\nalways make you uncomfortable. Your mind is not malfunctioning: part of\nyour brain is anticipating the future and trying to protect you from\nsomething you don\u2019t want, but it\u2019s going about the task in a\ncounterproductive way. To make progress, you have to identify and\neliminate the beliefs that are holding you back.\n\nEveryone has Limiting Beliefs in certain areas. Anytime you use the\nwords \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d \u201cI have to,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not good at,\u201d you\u2019ve discovered a\npotential Limiting Belief. Most of the time, taking a moment to question the\nbelief is all you need to do to break it. \u201cIs that really true?\u201d and \u201cHow do |\nknow that\u2019s true?\u201d are very powerful and versatile Se/f-Elicitation questions.\n\nLimiting Beliefs may also appear when you consider doing things that\nmake you uncomfortable, like applying for a new job or selling an offer to a\nnew prospect. Images of rejection and disapproval start flashing through\n\nyour mind, and your first impulse is to conclude \u201cthis won\u2019t work\u201d before\nconducting a single test or gathering real feedback.\n\nHere\u2019s a useful rule of thumb for these types of situations: make the\nother party tell you no. This is a Habit worth installing: you may believe\nyou\u2019re going to be turned down when you make a request or propose an\nidea, but make the other party say it instead of assuming it\u2019s a given. You\u2019ll\nbe surprised at how often you get what you want, even when you believe\nthe odds are slim.\n\nThe way you choose to respond to challenges determines how successful\nyou will become. It\u2019s important to realize that you have no \u201cfundamental\ndefects\u201d\u2014there\u2019s nothing that you\u2019re incapable of learning or doing. It may\ntake time and effort, but you\u2019! improve if you make the effort.\n\nViewing your mind as a muscle is the best way to help it grow.\n",

In a world where we are so certain to incur them\nin spite of all our caution, a certain lightness of heart seems healthier than this excessive nervousness\non their behalf,\n\nWILLIAM JAMES, NINETEENTH-CENTURY DOCTOR AND PIONEERING PSYCHOLOGIST\n\n0 ften, we make decisions that don\u2019t turn out the way we expect:\nunnecessary purchases, bad hires, poor investments, and wasted energy.\n\nThis type of error is called Malinvestment: a \u201cbad\u201d or \u201cpoor\u201d investment.\nThe meaning of bad or poor is variable, but it\u2019s almost always tied up with a\nfeeling of \u201cThat was dumb . . . what a waste!\u201d\n\nMalinvestment is very common. You can\u2019t see the future, and that\nUncertainty introduces a significant risk of error whenever you make a\npurchase or investment of time and energy.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to feel bad about Malinvestment: making mistakes is never fun.\nFeeling too bad, however, is a form of Hindsight Bias: if you knew then what\nyou know now, you wouldn\u2019t have done what you did.\n\nSometimes, Malinvestment looks like a straightforward mistake\u2014an\nerror. You thought the investment was promising, wise, or prudent, and it\nturns out it wasn\u2019t. This usually takes the form of:\n\ne\n\nBuying items you don\u2019t use.\n\n\u00b0\n\nPurchasing a product that doesn\u2019t work or malfunctions.\n\u00b0\n\nA change in your preferences, needs, or priorities that makes past\ninvestments obsolete.\n\nThese errors often come from not having enough information before\nmaking a purchase decision. You can often prevent these types of errors by:\n\ne\n\nCollecting more information before you invest.\n\ne\n\nBeing more diligent about evaluating needs and priorities before\ninvesting.\n\ne\n\nInvesting only to solve a clear, present, recurring, immediate, or\nimportant need or problem.\n\nOther forms of Malinvestment look like inefficiency: an unnecessary\nwaste of resources. This usually takes the form of:\n\n\u00b0\nPaying insurance premiums without incident.\n.\n\nBuilding and maintaining backup systems and Fail-safes you never\nneed to use.\n\nIt\u2019s important to realize that this type of Malinvestment is very common\nwhen dealing with Uncertainty and risk. Paying Insurance premiums is\nusually a wise thing to do if you\u2019re not able or willing to mitigate certain\ncommon or large risks on your own.\n\nIf you don\u2019t end up collecting a claim on the Insurance, your premiums\nweren\u2019t really \u201cwasted,\u201d in the sense that you were paying to mitigate a\nvery real risk. You would\u2019ve saved money if you could see the future, but\n\nyou can\u2019t. Paying to mitigate major risks is a good decision as long as you\ndon\u2019t overpay for the Insurance.\n\nWhen you\u2019 re trying to do something new or different, you\u2019re bound to\nmake a few mistakes. Investing time, energy, or effort in something that\ndoesn\u2019t work out the way you hoped is almost a certainty:\n\nStarting to do something in a certain way, only to find out it won\u2019t\nwork.\n\nDoing something one way, then discovering a better way when\nyou\u2019re almost done.\n\nBreaking something important, then having to fix it.\n\nIn these cases, Malinvestment is a form of tuition: it\u2019s the price you\u2019re\npaying to learn more about the topic or area of interest. As long as the\ntuition costs aren\u2019t too steep, a certain amount of error can teach you a lot\nabout what\u2019s important, what works, and what not to do in the future.\n\nOften, it\u2019s wise to seek out a certain level of Malinvestment as a form of\nExploration. You\u2019|l never have perfect information, and you\u2019 ll never find the\n\u201coptimal\u201d or \u201cperfect\u201d strategy before you begin. If you wait until you\u2019re\n100 percent certain you\u2019ve found the best possible approach before you\nbegin, you\u2019ll never get started.\n\nHere\u2019s a useful question that\u2019s helpful in overcoming this tendency:\n\u201cHow quickly can I start making mistakes?\u201d The faster you jump in and\nstart trying to do what you want to be able to do, the faster you\u2019ll learn\u2014\nerrors and all.\n\nWhen in doubt, err on the side of imperfect experimentation.\n",

There\u2019s always another milestone to reach for, a new\n(and larger) sales goal to achieve, or a larger business valuation that\nrepresents \u201ctrue success.\u201d\n\nI know many professionals who have set their sights on substantial Goals\n\u2014and have achieved them. Instead of feeling a lasting sense of\naccomplishment, they find their dissatisfaction persists, and the goalposts\nshift to a new, even more difficult objective. \u201cWhen | achieve that,\u201d they\ntell themselves, \u201cI\u2019ll finally feel successful and happy.\u201d\n\nThe Arrival Fallacy is a way to recognize this pattern and short-circuit the\ndissatisfaction associated with pursuing Goals. If you recognize that your\nbusiness, career, and life will never be in a permanent ideal state and there\nwill be no end to your search for meaning and improvement, it becomes\nmuch easier to appreciate what you\u2019ve achieved to date and celebrate the\naccomplishment of Goals and milestones as they occur.\n\nThink of your current objectives as waypoints, not final destinations:\nthey\u2019re useful ways to orient and direct your attention, energy, and effort.\nWhen you accomplish your objective, there will always be something else\nto work on or improve\u2014and that\u2019s a good thing.

We can never control people in the sense that we\ndiscussed in the section on Perceptual Contro-\u2014we don\u2019t have direct access\nto the inner processes that make people do the things they do. All we can do\nis act in ways that encourage people to do what we suggest.\n\nThe use of Power takes one of two fundamental forms: influence or\ncompulsion. Influence is the ability to encourage someone else to want\nwhat you suggest. Compulsion is the ability to force someone else to do\nwhat you command.\n\nEncouraging an employee to \u201cgo the extra mile\u201d out of a sense of loyalty\nor craftsmanship is influence. Forcing the employee to work over the\nweekend by threatening to fire them if they refuse is compulsion. The\nactions that employee takes may be the same, but how they feel about\ntaking those actions will be quite different.\n\nOn the whole, influence is much more effective than compulsion. The\nvast majority of people resist being forced to do something against their\nwill or better judgment, so relying on compulsion to get things done is a\npoor strategy. Bossing people around only serves to make them dislike you,\nand they\u2019 ll find ways to retaliate or quit working with you at the earliest\navailable opportunity. Influence, on the other hand, is sustainable\u2014\nencouraging people to want what you want gets you the results you\u2019re\nlooking for without provoking unnecessary ill will.\n\nLike it or not, everyone relies on Power to get things done. Power is a\nneutral tool\u2014one that can be used for good or ill. Power represents your\nability to get things done through other people\u2014the more Power you have,\nthe more things you can do. There\u2019s nothing wrong with seeking to increase\nyour Power, provided you respect the rights of other people. The more\nPower you have, the more you can accomplish, but with great Power comes\ngreat responsibility.\n\nThe reason that interactions among large groups of people become\npolitical is the ever-present nature of Power. If you don\u2019t have a plan, your\nactions will be determined by someone else. By refusing to make the effort\nto move in the direction you think is best, you\u2019re ceding Power to those\nwho do have plans. Refuse to understand that Power is important and\nyou\u2019re likely to find that any influence you have rapidly disappears. The\nonly way to win is to decide to play.\n\nThe best way to increase your Power is to do things that increase your\ninfluence and Reputation. The more people know your capabilities and\nrespect the Reputation you\u2019ve built, the more Power you will have.\n",

If you can\u2019t control them and get\nthem to do what you want them to do all the time, why bother?\n\nThe answer is Comparative Advantage, a concept that originated in the\n\u201cdismal science\u201d of economics. Attributed to David Ricardo\u2019s 1817 text On\nthe Principles of Political Economy and Taxation, \u201cRicardo\u2019s Law of\nComparative Advantage\u201d provided an answer to a question of international\npolitics: is it better for the economies of countries to be self-sufficient and\nproduce everything themselves, or specialize in producing certain goods,\nthen trade with one another?\n\nUsing Portugal and England as examples, Ricardo calculated that even if\nboth countries were capable of producing cloth and wine, England could\nproduce cloth with much less effort, and Portugal was much better at\nproducing wine. As a result, instead of wasting time and money struggling\nto do something they weren\u2019t good at, Portugal and England would both be\nbetter off if they specialized, then traded with each other.\n\nComparative Advantage means it\u2019s better to capitalize on your strengths\nthan to shore up your weaknesses. In First, Break All The Rules, by Marcus\nBuckingham and Curt Coffman, and StrengthsFinder 2.0, by Tom Rath, the\nauthors share the results of Gallup\u2019s comprehensive research on human\nproductivity. As it turns out, Comparative Advantage applies as much to\nindividuals as it does to countries: businesses work better if the individuals\nwho operate them focus on what they\u2019re best at, working with other\nspecialists to accomplish everything else they need. \u201cStrengths-based\nmanagement\u201d is just another term for Comparative Advantage.\n\nComparative Advantage explains why it often makes sense to work with\ncontractors or employees rather than try to do everything yourself. If you\nwant to build a house, it\u2019s probably more efficient to hire a general\ncontractor and specialists who do the kind of work the project requires\nevery day. You could try to do it yourself, but unless you know what you\u2019re\ndoing, it\u2019ll probably take longer, and the results won\u2019t be as good.\n\nComparative Advantage also explains why diverse teams outperform\nhomogenous teams. Having a wide variety of team members with different\nskills and backgrounds is a major asset: it increases the probability that one\nof your teammates will know what to do in any given circumstance. If\nevery team member has the same skills and the same background, it\u2019s far\nmore likely the team will get stuck or make a preventable error.\n\nSelf-reliance improves your flexibility and knowledge over time, but too\nmuch self-reliance is a mistake. I\u2019m a huge advocate of self-education and\nlearning how to do things yourself, but taking the DIY ethic to an extreme\ncan do more harm than good. Working with others can help you get more\ndone, faster, and improve the quality of the end result. Even Thoreau left\nWalden Pond every once in a while to buy things in town.\n\nThe major benefit of self-education when working with others is\nknowing what skill looks like. You may be able to hire a programmer\nhalfway around the world online, but if you\u2019ve never done any\nprogramming yourself, you\u2019re going to have a difficult time figuring out\nwhether or not their work is good. Learn a little programming, however, and\nyour ability to identify good programmers will increase, making you more\nlikely to identify skilled colleagues and partners.\n\nIn the immortal words of John Donne: \u201cNo man is an island.\u201d Focus on\nwhat you can do well and work with others to accomplish the rest.\n",

In order to keep everyone on the same page, communication is\nnecessary. The more team members you have to work with, the more you\nhave to communicate with them to coordinate action.\n\nAs the number of people you work with increases, Communication\nOverhead increases geometrically until the total percentage of time each\nindividual must devote to group communication approaches 100 percent.\nAfter a certain threshold, each additional team member diminishes the\ncapacity of the group to do anything other than communicate.\n\nLarge companies are slow because they suffer from Communication\nOverhead. If you\u2019re responsible for working with a group of more than five\nto eight people, at least 80 percent of your job will be communicating with\nthe people you work with. Objectives, plans, and ideas are worthless unless\neveryone involved understands them well enough to take action.\n\nI experienced this phenomenon daily while working at P&G\u2014one of my\nprimary projects involved creating a company-wide strategy on how to\nmeasure certain marketing tactics. Because it was a global project, my\nrecommendation required input and/or approval from dozens of individuals\nacross the company before anything could be implemented.\n\nEveryone involved had different ideas, argued endlessly over various\napproaches, and wanted a share of the credit without having to commit to\ntoo much work or expense. I spent three months of full-time effort putting\ntogether a workable proposal. In the meantime, no actual work was being\naccomplished\u201499 percent of my time was spent doing little more than\ncommunicating with other members of the group. That\u2019s Communication\nOverhead.\n\nIn the book Beyond Bureaucracy,' Derek Sheane proposed \u201c8\nSymptoms of Bureaucratic Breakdown\u201d that appear in teams suffering from\nCommunication Overhead:\n\n1.\nThe Invisible Decision. No one knows how or where decisions are\nmade, and there is no transparency in the decision-making process.\n\n2.\nUnfinished business. Too many tasks are started but very few are\ncarried through to the end.\n\n3.\nCoordination paralysis. Nothing can be done without checking with\na host of interconnected units.\n\n4.\nNothing new. There are no radical ideas, inventions, or lateral\nthinking\u2014a general lack of initiative.\n\n5.\n\nPseudo-problems. Minor issues become magnified out of all\nproportion.\n\n6.\n\nEmbattled center. The center battles for consistency and control\nagainst local/regional units.\n\n7.\nNegative deadlines. The deadlines for work become more important\nthan the quality of the work being done.\n\n8.\nInput domination. Individuals react to inputs\u2014i.e., whatever gets\nput in their in-tray\u2014as opposed to using their own initiative.\n\nIf any of these qualities describe your daily work experience, your team\nis probably suffering from a case of Communication Overhead.\n\nThe solution to Communication Overhead is simple but not easy: make\nyour team as small as possible. You\u2019ll be leaving people out, but that\u2019s the\npoint\u2014 including them is causing more work than it\u2019s creating in benefits.\nRemoving unnecessary people from the team will save everyone\u2019s time and\nproduce better results.\n\nStudies of effective teamwork usually recommend working in groups of\nthree to eight people. In Peopleware, project managers Tom DeMarco and\nTimothy Lister recommend keeping teams \u201celite and surgical.\u201d Small\ngroups tend to be more effective than large groups because Communication\nOverhead is reduced\u2014each team member adds more networking capacity\nto the team than they require in communication to be effective. Once group\n\nsize expands above eight, each additional team member requires more\ninvestment in communication than they add in productive capacity.\n\nIf you want your team to perform at its best, make your teams as small\nand autonomous as possible.\n",

In What Got You Here\nWon't Get You There, veteran executive coach Marshall Goldsmith explains\nthat high-level executives often undermine or put down their peers and\nsubordinates to make themselves feel smarter or more Important, shutting\ndown effective communication.\n\nEffective communication can only occur when both parties feel safe. As\nsoon as people start to feel unimportant or threatened in a conversation,\nthey start \u201cstonewalling,\u201d shutting down communication. The threatened\nparty may continue to interact, but mentally and emotionally, they\u2019ve\nwithdrawn from the conversation.\n\nThe only way to prevent stonewalling is to make the person you\u2019re\ncommunicating with feel safe being open and honest with you. Just as\npeople have a fundamental need to feel Important, people also have a need\nto feel safe when expressing what\u2019s on their minds and talking about things\nthat are Important to them. The moment they begin to sense they\u2019re being\njudged, evaluated, or looked down upon because of an idea they have or a\nposition they hold, they\u2019! shut down.\n\nIn Crucial Conversations, a book about maintaining a sense of Safety\nwhile discussing important issues with colleagues and loved ones, authors\nKerry Patterson, Joseph Grenny, Ron McMillan, and Al Switzler\nrecommend using the STATE model to communicate without provoking\nanger or defensiveness:\n\n1.\nShare your facts. Facts are less controversial, more persuasive, and\nless insulting than conclusions, so lead with them first.\n\n2.\n\nTell your story. Explain the situation from your point of view, taking\ncare to avoid insulting or judging, which makes the other person feel\nless safe.\n\n3.\nAsk for others\u2019 paths. Ask to hear the other person\u2019s side of the\nsituation, what they intended, and what they want.\n\n4.\nTalk tentatively. Avoid conclusions, judgments, and ultimatums.\n\n5.\n\nEncourage testing. Make suggestions, ask for input, and discuss\nuntil you reach a productive and mutually satisfactory course of\naction.\n\nSome people are more sensitive than others. Becoming more aware of\nyour words and actions and how they might be interpreted by people with\ndifferent attitudes is half the battle. If you want to communicate with\nsomeone in such a way that you both benefit from the conversation and get\nsomething done, both parties need to feel safe. The best way to make that\nhappen is to avoid passing judgment and focus on making the other party\nfeel Important. Books like Crucial Conversations, Dale Carnegie\u2019s How to\nWin Friends and Influence People, and Daniel Goleman\u2019s Emotional\nIntelligence can help you learn how.\n",

Treating other people poorly sends a clear\nsignal to everyone that you can\u2019t be trusted.\n\nIf you make it a policy to treat people with appreciation, courtesy, and\nrespect in all circumstances, other people will feel Important and Safe in\nyour presence.\n",

PATTON, COMMANDER OF THE US THIRD ARMY IN WORLD WAR II\n\nA s arule, people hate to be told what to do. \u201cMicromanagement\u201d is the\nbane of any worker\u2019s existence\u2014if you\u2019re a competent professional,\nnothing is more demeaning than someone else defining and scrutinizing\nyour work to the last detail.\n\nMicromanagement isn\u2019t just annoying\u2014it\u2019s inefficient. Not only does\nspelling out every single detail make people feel less important, it impairs\ntheir effectiveness. No set of instructions, no matter how detailed, is capable\nof covering every contingency. When something changes,\nmicromanagement fails.\n\nThink of how overwhelmed a CEO who insists on micromanagement\nwill become\u2014remember, human beings don\u2019t Scale. The more people who\nwork for the company, the more directions the CEO must give to keep\neverything moving. If you have ten employees, micromanagement is a\nhassle. If you have hundreds or thousands, it\u2019s a nightmare.\n\nCommander's intent is a much better method of delegating tasks:\nwhenever you assign a task to someone, tell them why it must be done. The\n\nmore your agent understands the purpose behind your actions, the better\nthey\u2019 ll be able to respond appropriately when the situation changes.\n\nCommander\u2019s Intent originated on the battlefield. If a general tells a\nfield commander in detail how to capture a specific hill and the situation\nchanges, the field commander is forced to return to the general for new\norders, which is slow and inefficient. If the general explains the strategy to\nthe field commander and explains why that particular hill is important and\nhow it will support the overall strategy, the field commander is free to use\ntheir knowledge of the Goal and fresh intelligence to act in a new way that\nsupports the original intent.\n\nCommander\u2019s Intent alleviates Communication Overhead. By\ncommunicating the intent behind a certain plan, a leader can make constant\ncommunication less critical for the success of the entire team. If everyone\nunderstands the purpose of the plan, everyone can act in ways that support\nthe intent without requiring constant attention.\n\nWhen you communicate the intent behind your plans, you allow the\npeople you work with to respond to changes as they happen.\n",

It\u2019s far more effective to single someone out, make eye\ncontact, point, and say, \u201cYOU\u2014CALL 911.\u201d They will.\n\nBystander Apathy is an inverse relationship between the number of people\nwho could take action and the number of people who choose to act. The\nmore people available, the less responsibility each member of the crowd\nfeels to do anything about the situation.\n\nThe 1964 murder of Kitty Genovese and the 2009 shooting of Petru\nBarladeanu are dramatic, well-known examples of Bystander Apathy. In\nboth cases, the victims were attacked in the presence of many bystanders,\nall of whom were hesitant to offer assistance. There\u2019s some controversy\nover how many people witnessed the Genovese murder, but there\u2019s no\ndoubt about the Barladeanu case\u2014it was captured on video.

Unless every\nindividual on your team knows what they\u2019re responsible for and when it\nmust be done, it\u2019s very unlikely that they\u2019ll do it.\n\nWhen delegating responsibilities, always assign tasks to a single owner\nwith a clear deadline.

As uncomfortable as this\nsounds, any plan created by even the most intelligent and skilled CEO or\nproject manager will be inaccurate\u2014even if they\u2019ve done similar work\nbefore.\n\nAs Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson quip in their book\nRework, \u201cPlanning is guessing.\u201d The reason we\u2019re so bad at planning is\nbecause we\u2019re not omniscient\u2014unforeseen events or circumstances can\nimpact even the most detailed plans. When we create plans, we\u2019re guessing\nand using Interpretation to fill in the blanks, no matter how much we cloak\nthat uncomfortable reality in official-sounding language and fancy-looking\ncharts.\n\nThe Planning Fallacy means that people have a persistent tendency to\nunderestimate completion times. The more complex the project, the more\nInterdependencies the project contains. The more Interdependencies there\nare, the more likely it is that something at some time will not go according\nto plan.\n\nWhen planning, we tend to imagine a scenario in which everything goes\nwell. As a result, we tend to underestimate the likelihood of things that\n\ncould impact the plan, as well as how much those contingencies will affect\nthe project. Rare is the project plan that contains a line item that says,\n\u201cProject manager contracts mononucleosis: out for a month.\u201d\n\nMost plans drastically underestimate the amount of Slack necessary to\nmake the plan accurate. If you\u2019re responsible for completing a complex\nproject, including a few months of Slack time is appropriate\u2014unexpected\ndelays, vacations, sicknesses, and other unforeseen events are likely to\nmake things take longer than expected.\n\nThe challenge is that including significant Slack time is almost never\nseen as acceptable or appropriate. If you go to a CEO, customer, or partner\nwith a plan that involves three months of Slack time, the most common\nresponse is, \u201cThat\u2019s not acceptable\u2014get it done faster.\u201d The Slack is\neliminated, and as a result, almost every project plan is very likely to be\nwrong.\n\nThe inaccuracy of plans doesn\u2019t make planning worthless. Plans aren\u2019t\nuseful because they help you predict with better accuracy\u2014they\u2019re useful\nbecause the act of creating the plan helps you understand requirements,\ndependencies, and risks more thoroughly than when you started. In the\nimmortal words of Dwight D. Eisenhower: \u201cNo battle was ever won\naccording to plan, but no battle was ever won without one . . . Plans are\nuseless, but planning is indispensable.\u201d The value of planning is in Mental\nSimulation: the thought process required to create the plan itself.\n\nUse plans, but don\u2019t depend on them\u2014as long as you keep working with\nspeed and diligence, the project will be done as soon as it\u2019s feasible.\n",

Before the experiment started, the\n\ngroup of twenty-two was split into two groups and placed on opposite sides\nof the park. By design, neither group knew the other existed.\n\nThe original plan was to let each group coalesce for a while, then make\nthem aware that the other group existed, to see what would happen. The\ncamp counselors were psychologists and graduate students, who would be\nwatching the events unfold up close and personal.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened: the groups accidentally discovered each other\nearlier than planned, and hostilities started immediately.

For the safety of\nthe campers, the researchers tried to find a way to resolve the conflict.\n\nThe psychologists introduced challenges and goals that required both\ngroups to work together: solving a water shortage, deciding on a movie to\nwatch, and pushing a broken-down truck back to camp. When the campers\nstarted feeling like part of a larger group, the conflicts subsided.\n\nClanning is a natural human tendency\u2014we are always influenced by the\npeople around us. Identifying ourselves as part of a group and\ndistinguishing ourselves from other groups is an instinct that explains many\nof the ongoing wars and conflicts featured in the news every day.\n\nThink of sports fans. The players, coaches, and even stadiums and\nuniforms change so often, it\u2019s difficult to understand what the fans are\ncheering for\u2014the life of a die-hard New York Yankees fan will go on\nunchanged regardless of whether their team wins or loses. While that may\nbe true, it doesn\u2019t feel that way to the fan\u2014when the Yanks win, the fans\nfeel like winners too.\n\nSports rivalries happen for the same reason. I grew up in northern Ohio,\nwhere the Ohio State\u2014University of Michigan rivalry is alive and well.\nWhere I come from, during certain parts of the year, Michigan is evil in the\n\neyes of Ohio State fans. If you look at the situation from a distance, it\u2019s silly\n\u2014college kids scrambling for a little, oblong, brown ball while hundreds of\nthousands of people scream themselves hoarse. In the moment, however, for\nthose two groups the enmity is everything.\n\nGroups form around important issues, positions, or events. Understand\nthe group dynamic or you\u2019re likely to be caught up in it.\n",

In business, this is sometimes called a company \u201cculture,\u201d in the\nsense that people who work there tend to have similar characteristics,\nbehaviors, and philosophies.\n\nConvergence also means that groups have a tendency to police\nthemselves. The Norms of the group work like gravity\u2014if they are violated,\nothers will exert an influence on the rebel to bring them back in line. As the\nproverb goes, \u201cThe tallest blade of grass is the first to be cut.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever worked for a company with a workaholic culture, you\nknow how powerful Convergence can be. If it\u2019s normal for workers to come\nin at 6:00 in the morning and stay until 10:30 at night, it can be difficult to\nkeep shorter working hours, since violating the Norms is a social signal that\nyou don\u2019t belong in the group. One of my clients, who works for a major\nmedical research institution, often has conflicts with coworkers who believe\nhe\u2019s not \u201cpulling his weight\u201d because he leaves work at 5:00 p.m. instead of\n7:30 p.m., even though he does great work and gets everything done.\nInstead of being viewed as \u201cworking smart,\u201d going home at a reasonable\nhour is seen as a form of treason\u2014sad, but common.\n\nDivergence is the tendency for groups to become less like other groups\nover time. Since group behavior often evolves to distinguish members of\none group from another, the Norms of most groups change to resist being\nconfused with another group or imitator.\n\nDivergence explains why fashions among the socialite class in New\nYork City change so often. In certain social circles, dress is a way to signal\nyour wealth or status. When the latest fashions start appearing in Target so\npeople can imitate the look, fashions change to compensate. This constant\nDivergence keeps the group affiliation signal valid.\n\nAccording to the late Jim Rohn, author of The Art of Exceptional Living,\n\u201cYou are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.\u201d The\nvalues and behaviors of the people you interact with on a daily basis exert\nconstant pressures on you to adopt the same values and behaviors.\n\nConvergence can be useful if you choose to spend time with people\nyou\u2019d like to become more like over time. If you\u2019d like to become less shy\nand more outgoing, spending time with social people in social situations\ncan\u2019t help but influence your behavior. You won\u2019t become a social butterfly\novernight, but you will start to adopt the behaviors and Norms of the people\nyou\u2019re spending time with.\n\nBreaking away from groups that aren\u2019t serving you is painful but\nnecessary to grow. People who want to quit smoking or drinking often find\nit difficult to quit because a large portion of their social network engages in\nthose behaviors. Taking a smoke break at 3:00 p.m. or attending a 6:00 p.m.\nhappy hour is a very significant social event\u2014if your friends are expecting\nyou, the temptation is even harder to resist. To make significant changes,\nit\u2019s often necessary to leave one group and find another that\u2019s more\nsupportive of where you want to go, which is why joining support groups\nlike Alcoholics Anonymous is a very effective way to change specific\nbehaviors.\n\nOnce you realize how powerful Convergence and Divergence are, you\ncan use them to your advantage.

The\napproach worked so well that Sanka used \u201cDr. Welby\u201d to promote their\nproduct for decades.\n\nPeople have an inherent tendency to comply with Authority figures. This\ntendency begins in childhood\u2014we wouldn\u2019t survive very long if we didn\u2019t\nobey our parents most of the time. As we grow up, we\u2019re socialized to\nrespect and obey other Authority figures: teachers, police officers,\ngovernment officials, and clergy. As a result, when an Authority figure asks\nus to do something, we\u2019re very likely to comply\u2014even if the request isn\u2019t\nappropriate or doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nPeople tend to comply with Authority figures even if they\u2019d refuse to\ntake the same action under normal circumstances. In a famously disturbing\nsocial psychology experiment, Stanley Milgram proved that most\nindividuals will comply with Authority figures to a surprising degree\u2014even\nif the request appears to be morally wrong.\n\nIn a series of experiments that began in 1961, Milgram placed test\nsubjects in a room with a \u201cscientist\u201d in a white lab coat and another\nindividual, both of whom were actors. The subject was told the study was\nabout the effect of punishment on learning, and one of the participants was\n\u201crandomly\u201d selected to be the \u201clearner\u201d\u2014the actor. The \u201clearner\u201d was taken\nto an adjacent room, strapped into a chair, and attached to electrodes.\n\nThe test subject\u2019s job as the \u201cteacher\u201d was to read the learner questions,\nthen \u201cshock\u201d the learner if they responded incorrectly. The shocks weren\u2019t\nreal, but the actor would scream, cry, and beg to be released from the study.\nEvery few minutes, the \u201cscientist\u201d would instruct the teacher to raise the\n\nvoltage of the shocks. The intent of the study was to see how long the test\nsubject would obey the scientist before refusing to continue.\n\nThe results were disturbing: 80 percent of participants continued past the\npoint where the learner begged to stop, and 65 percent continued all the\nway to the maximum level of 450 volts, which was marked as deadly.\nThroughout the study, the subjects expressed discomfort with what they\nwere being asked to do. When subjects were ordered to continue, they\nresisted\u2014an example of Persuasion Resistance\u2014but when the Authority\nfigure told them continuing the study was important for the \u201cgreater\ngood\u201d\u2014the advancement of scientific knowledge\u2014they complied.2\n\nIn the presence of an Authority figure, people will do things they\u2019d\notherwise view as reprehensible, or wouldn\u2019t consider in the first place\u2014\nthe source of many a scandal involving famous and powerful people.\n\nIf you\u2019re in a position of Authority, your Authority will change the way\nothers interact with you. When you express an opinion, your subordinates\nwill be far more likely to interpret your position as a truth or as a command.\nAs a result, people will begin to filter the information they give you based\non what they think you want to hear\u2014which may not be what you need to\nhear. This filtering behavior is how Authority figures often end up \u201cliving in\na bubble\u201d\u2014the combination of Authority and Confirmation Bias shelters them\nfrom information that contradicts their opinions. As a result, it\u2019s difficult for\nAuthority figures to compensate for the Excessive Self-Regard Tendency.\n\nDeveloping a strong Reputation in a certain area confers the benefits of\nAuthority. Not all parts of Authority are insidious\u2014if people respect your\nknowledge and experience, they\u2019re more likely to do what you suggest. As\na result, developing clear expertise and a strong Reputation can be\nbeneficial\u2014it increases your own influence.

Here\u2019s the twist: they didn\u2019t ask for the donation\noutright. Instead, they asked if she\u2019d be \u201cwilling to donate money to the\nuniversity in the future.\u201d Thinking nothing of it, she agreed\u2014and promptly\nforgot about the call.\n\nJust before we moved from New York to Colorado, an official-looking\n\u201cinvoice\u201d for $150 from the university appeared in the mail. It said, \u201cHere\nis your $150 commitment\u2014you can send your check via the enclosed\nenvelope.\u201d\n\nMoney was tight, since we were paying for movers, buying cars, and\npurchasing furniture\u2014but Kelsey sent the check anyway. After all, she had\npromised, right?\n\nNo one wants to be considered an \u201coath breaker.\u201d Commitments have\nbeen used throughout history as a way of binding groups together. Breaking\na promise or Commitment can often have a negative impact on Social Status\nand Reputation, so most people will do whatever they can to act in ways that\ndemonstrate Consistency with previous positions and promises.\n\nEven small Commitments make it more likely that individuals will take\nactions Consistent with those Commitments in the future. One of my\nfavorite stories about Commitment comes from Michael Masterson, the\nauthor of Ready, Fire, Aim.4 On a trip to India, Masterson visited a rug\nmerchant. He entered the shop with a healthy level of skepticism and no\nintention of buying anything\u2014he was just interested in the experience.\n\nThe rug merchant was an excellent salesman and relied on two primary\nstrategies. To break down Masterson\u2019s skepticism, he used stories\n(Narratives) of past sales to encourage Masterson to like and Trust him before\nthe selling began. Then he used Commitment: Whenever Masterson so\nmuch as looked at a rug, the proprietor would have his staff take it down off\nthe racks to examine it closely. The rugs were heavy, and it was clear that\nthe sales staff was working hard on his behalf. By making a small\nCommitment\u2014expressing interest in a particular rug\u2014Masterson provoked\na flurry of action.\n\nAs the minutes passed, it became difficult for Masterson to imagine\nleaving without purchasing a rug\u2014it would be inconsistent with the interest\nhe\u2019d expressed and the work the proprietor\u2019s staff were doing for him. The\nleast he could do was engage in Reciprocation\u2014how could he tell them no?\n\nIn the end, he purchased a rug for $8,200 and walked away a happy\ncustomer.\n\nObtaining small Commitments makes it more likely people will choose\nto act in a Consistent way later. Salespeople are often taught to do what they\ncan to encourage their customers to start saying yes as soon as possible. By\ngetting a \u201cfoot in the door,\u201d they increase the probability that their prospect\nwill take further action.\n\nThat\u2019s why so many activists use opening questions like \u201cDo you care\nabout child safety?\u201d or \u201cDo you care about the environment?\u201d when\ntelemarketing or collecting signatures on a petition. Most people do care\nabout these things, so the reply is automatic and swift. Once you\u2019ve said\nyou care about something, however, it would be rude of you to refuse their\nrequest\u2014it\u2019s inconsistent with your previous statement.\n\nObtain a small Commitment and you\u2019ll make it far more likely that\nothers will comply with your request.\n",

Most agents won\u2019t\ntell you it\u2019s in your best interest to rent,? even if it\u2019s true.\n\nIncentive-Caused Bias explains why people with a vested interest in\nsomething will tend to guide you in the direction of their interest. We\ntouched on the idea of Incentive-Caused Bias when talking about Buffers. If\nyou\u2019re working with an agent who\u2019s paid on commission, it\u2019s not\nnecessarily in their best interest to tell you that purchasing something is not\na good idea. As the saying goes, \u201cDon\u2019t ask the barber if you need a\nhaircut.\u201d\n\nIncentives influence the way people act based on how they\u2019re rewarded.\nAs a result, the structure of the incentives people are exposed to has a\nsignificant impact on behavior. Assuming that the things people are\n\ncontrolling for stay the same, changing the incentives is also likely to\nchange behavior.\n\nIn The Knack, Norm Brodsky and Bo Burlingham describe how they\ncompensate their salespeople. Most companies compensate salespeople on a\ncommission basis: closing more sales nets the salesperson more money.\nUnder this incentive structure, their salespeople are hyperfocused on\nclosing sales\u2014even if those sales aren\u2019t profitable or in the long-term\ninterest of the company. By compensating their salespeople on a salary\nbasis and giving generous bonuses based on long-term performance,\nBrodsky and Burlingham encouraged salespeople to focus on making\nprofitable sales versus sales at any cost.\n\nSometimes incentives create unintended Second-Order Effects. Stock\noptions were created under the theory that executives who had an interest in\nthe company\u2019s stock price would act in ways to make the stock go up in\nvalue over time, which was in the best interest of the shareholders. That\u2019s\ntrue, but only to a point: the actual interest of those executives is in making\nthe stock price go up right before they intend to sell. Once the options are\nsold, they no longer care so much, leading to policies that sacrifice long-\nterm stability for short-term gains.\n\nIncentives are tricky because they interact with our Perceptual Control\nsystems. For example, giving an employee a bonus or raise for doing\nsomething good can create a curious result\u2014they stop doing what got them\nthe reward.\n\nThat makes no sense until you realize there was always a reward\u2014they\ndid what they did because they wanted to, so the reward was internal.\nPaying them makes the action part of their job, which reduces their inner\ndrive to complete it for its own sake. In the case of Conflict, Perceptual\nControls win over incentives every time.\n\nIncentives can be useful if used appropriately, but be careful. If the\nincentives of the people you work with aren\u2019t aligned with your interests,\nyou\u2019re bound to have problems.\n",

CLARK, MINISTER AND NEWSPAPER COLUMNIST\n\nA few years ago, I was traveling on business with a colleague who was\namazed that I was carrying a shoulder bag instead of a rolling suitcase. It\nwas an overnight trip, so I didn\u2019t need much\u2014a change of clothes, my\ncomputer, and a book. I had everything I needed, and the bag wasn\u2019t heavy,\nso my solution worked just fine.\n\nMy colleague thought my solution was absurd and spent the next ten\nminutes telling me so: \u201cIt\u2019s much better to carry a rolling suitcase! It would\nbe more comfortable, and there\u2019d be less weight. You should always carry a\nrolling suitcase .. .\u201d\n\nModal Bias is the automatic assumption that our idea or approach is best.\nMost of us like to assume we have everything together\u2014that we know what\nwe're talking about, we know what we\u2019re doing, and our way of doing\nthings is optimal. Very often, we are mistaken. There is always more than\none way to get something done, and good ideas can come from anywhere.\n\nIn the absence of evidence to the contrary, decisions are made according\nto the \u201cHighest Paid Person\u2019s Opinion.\u201d \u201cHiPPO\u201d is a term coined by\nAvinash Kaushik in Web Analytics: An Hour a Day to explain why it\u2019s\nimportant to support business proposals and decisions with data. In the\nabsence of data, you\u2019 ll be forced to do things the boss\u2019s way: Modal Bias\nensures that the boss always thinks that their way is best, unless you can\nprove otherwise. In a battle of opinions, the HiPPO always wins.\n\nThe best way to avoid Modal Bias in your own decision making is to use\nInhibition to temporarily suspend judgment. Part of the value of\nunderstanding cognitive biases is the knowledge that you\u2019re not immune to\nthem, and knowing they exist doesn\u2019t make them any less influential.\nModal Bias is automatic\u2014we have to use willpower to inhibit it.\n\nIf you\u2019re a leader or manager, it pays to suspend your judgment long\nenough to consider the perspectives and suggestions of the people you work\nwith. Otherwise, you\u2019re likely to miss important information. Remind\nyourself to keep an open mind and you\u2019ll enhance your ability to make wise\nDecisions.\n",

The\nsituation required finding another supplier on short notice, which was\ndifficult, since supplies of the materials were scarce.

Expected working hours are a common\npoint of tension: companies often require their employees to be at work at a\ncertain time and stay at work until a certain time. If an employee shows up\nlate or leaves early, that\u2019s a problem.\n\nBoundary Setting goes both ways: many employers expect a minimum\nnumber of work hours but encourage their employees to work additional\nhours unpaid. If you\u2019re willing to work from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on\nweekdays, but your place of employment expects you to work from 7:00\na.m. to 10:00 p.m. six or seven days a week, there\u2019s a fundamental Conflict.\nIt\u2019s up to you to enforce the boundary, or it doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nIf you work for yourself, it\u2019s important to set artificial boundaries on\nyour work time, or you\u2019ll find yourself on the wrong side of Parkinson's Law,\nmaking severe Trade-offs in your personal life for the sake of improving the\nbusiness. Likewise, if you send an immediate reply to the email your boss\nsends you at 2:00 a.m., you\u2019re sending a clear signal that you haven\u2019t set\nboundaries with respect to your time and attention outside of the office, and\nthat you\u2019re available to work at all hours.\n\nEthics standards, codes of conduct, and other formal behavior policies\nare examples of Boundary Setting at the organizational or cultural level. If\nyou predefine what is and is not acceptable behavior or activity, it\u2019s much\neasier to enforce boundaries when necessary. This makes it easier to handle\ndifficult situations, whether you\u2019re dealing with sensitive interpersonal\ntopics like harassment or shutting down a hacker who\u2019s accessing your\nwebsite a thousand times a second.\n\nBoundary Setting is also useful in defining acceptable behavior that\ndoesn\u2019t require oversight. One of the best policies | remember from my\ncorporate days was called the \u201cadult business deal.\u201d In essence, you never\nhad to ask for permission or time off to take care of mundane life concerns\n\u2014going to doctor or dentist appointments, voting, picking up a sick child\nfrom school, et cetera. The company assumed by default that you were a\nresponsible adult: you wouldn\u2019t have been hired otherwise. As long as you\n\ncompleted your work and didn\u2019t abuse the policy, there was no need for\nstrict oversight in these areas. There was no need to guess if something was\n\u201cokay\u201d or not: the policy was a formal, tangible indicator of Trust and had\nthe pleasant side effect of eliminating a huge amount of unnecessary\nmanagerial work.\n\nBoundary Setting is important. If you don\u2019t define what you\u2019re willing to\naccept and what you\u2019re not, you\u2019re setting yourself up for unnecessary\nConflict and a messy resolution. Be clear about what you expect, and when\nunacceptable situations occur, be ready to stand up for your values and\npriorities.\n",

That\u2019s not a huge problem, provided you learn to disagree in\na way that\u2019s productive for everyone involved.\n\nThe Principle of Charity is a way to overcome the tendency to disagree in a\ndisagreeable way: instead of picking a fight, it\u2019s useful to assume people\nhave reasons for what they say and do. As a result, it\u2019s a good idea to\nunderstand their position in more detail before assuming bad faith,\nignorance, incompetence, or other unsatisfactory qualities.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that you have to agree with the other person\u2019s point of\nview: you can take the time to understand their position, then come to\nconclusion that it\u2019s ill-informed, inaccurate, or that their proposed solution\ndoesn\u2019t work for you.

Dennett, the renowned philosopher and cognitive scientist,\npublished an eloquent interpretation of this idea in his book, Intuition\nPumps and Other Tools for Thinking, which is based on the work of Anatol\n\nRapoport, a mathematical psychologist and systems theorist. Before you\ncriticize someone\u2019s work:\n\n1.\n\nYou should attempt to re-express your target\u2019s position so clearly,\nvividly, and fairly that your target says, \u2018Thanks, I wish I\u2019d thought\nof putting it that way.\u2019\n\n2.\n\nYou should list any points of agreement, especially if they are not\nmatters of general or widespread agreement.\n\n3.\nYou should mention anything you have learned from your target.\n\n4.\nOnly then are you permitted to say so much as a word of rebuttal or\ncriticism.\n\nThis level of understanding takes time and energy, both of which are\nlimited resources. In an ideal world, we\u2019d be able to dig into the details and\nmotivations behind everything others say, but that isn\u2019t practical in most\ncases. Even if you don\u2019t have the capacity for extended conversation or\ndeep research, the Principle of Charity is a useful rule of thumb that makes\nit easier to have productive conversations.\n",

Don\u2019t make that team too large, however\u2014\nCommunication Overhead makes each additional team member beyond\na core of three to eight people a drag on performance. Small, elite\nteams are best.\n\n2.\n\nCommunicate the desired End Result, who is responsible for what,\nand the current status. Everyone on the team must know the\nCommander's intent of the project, the Reason Why it\u2019s important, and\nthe specific parts of the project they\u2019re responsible for completing\u2014\notherwise, you\u2019re risking Bystander Apathy.\n\n3.\nTreat people with respect. Applying the Golden Trifecta\u2014\nappreciation, courtesy, and respect\u2014is the best way to make the\n\nindividuals on your team feel important and is also the best way to\nensure that they respect you as a leader and manager. The more your\nteam works together under supportive conditions, the more Clanning\nwill occur and the more cohesive the team will become.\n\n4.\n\nCreate an Environment where everyone can be as productive as\npossible, then let people do their work. The best working\nEnvironment takes full advantage of Guiding Structure\u2014provide the\nbest equipment and tools possible and ensure that the Environment\nreinforces the work the team is doing. To avoid having energy\nsapped by the Cognitive Switching Penalty, shield your team from as\nmany distractions as possible, which includes nonessential\nbureaucracy and meetings.\n\n5.\n\nRefrain from having unrealistic expectations regarding certainty and\nprediction. Create an aggressive plan to complete the project, but be\naware in advance that Uncertainty and the Planning Fallacy mean your\ninitial plan will be incomplete or inaccurate in a few important\nrespects. Update your plan as you go along, using what you learn\nalong the way, and continually reapply Parkinson's Law to find the\nshortest feasible path to completion that works, given the necessary\nTrade-offs required by the work.\n\n6.\n\nMeasure to see if what you\u2019re doing is working\u2014f not, try another\napproach. One of the primary fallacies of effective Management is\nthat it makes learning unnecessary. This mind-set assumes your\ninitial plan should be 100 percent perfect and followed to the letter.\nThe exact opposite is true: effective Management means planning\nfor learning, which requires constant adjustments along the way.\nMeasure your performance across a small set of Key Performance\nIndicators\u2014if what you\u2019re doing doesn\u2019t appear to be working,\nexperiment with another approach.\n\nFollow these principles well, and your team will be productive. Follow\nthem poorly and you\u2019ll be fortunate to get anything useful done at all.\n\nThis style of management practice is not the command-and-control style\nof Management most people think of when they hear the term. On TV and\nin most management literature, managers are high-status executives who\nspend most of their time telling other people what to do and making\nimportant decisions. In practice, those behaviors are telltale signs of poor\nManagement.\n\nThe best managers don\u2019t act like big-shot executives: they\u2019re more like\nvery skilled assistants, whose primary purpose is to keep the people with\nEconomically Valuable Skills focused on improving the Five Parts of Every\nBusiness: that is, doing things that contribute to the company\u2019s results.\nImportant decisions are made by the individuals who have the most direct\nknowledge and experience of the area in question.\n\nIn a 2012 essay, software entrepreneur Joel Spolsky explains why\nmanagers should stop calling the shots and start letting people do their jobs:\n\nThe \u201cmanagement team\u201d isn\u2019t the \u201cdecision making\u201d team. It\u2019s a\nsupport function . . . You don\u2019t build a [business] with one big gigantic\nbrain on the top, and a bunch of lesser brains obeying orders down\nbelow. You try to get everyone to have a gigantic brain in their area,\nand you provide a minimum amount of administrative support to keep\n\nthem humming along.\u00b0\n\nManagement is a unique skill that requires discipline, patience, clear\ncommunication, and a commitment to keeping everyone working together\nwithout unnecessary distractions. By recruiting a good team and eliminating\nas much Friction as possible, you\u2019ll achieve the results you\u2019re seeking.\n",

What if you\u2019re responsible for\nrecruiting new employees as your company grows? How do you attract and\nretain the best employees you can find?\n\nHiring is a tricky business, and there\u2019s no foolproof method to find,\nattract, and retain star employees and contractors. Mistakes in hiring are\nalmost always expensive, and a bad hire can cost you precious time and\nmoney and your team\u2019s limited energy and patience.\n\nGood employees and contractors are not necessarily the people who\nhave the fanciest r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or perform the best in a phone screen or interview:\nthe best hires are people who get things done and work well with other\nmembers of your team. Ideally, you\u2019re looking for an individual who will\ncontribute valuable work, who\u2019s excited about the opportunity, and who\nyou\u2019 ll enjoy working with every day.\n\nHere\u2019s the golden rule of hiring: the best predictor of future behavior is\npast performance. If you want to hire people who will perform well for you\nin the months and years to come, you need to look for people who have\nperformed well in the past. That means digging deep into what the applicant\nhas accomplished, as well as giving each serious candidate a short-term\nopportunity to work with you before committing to a longer-term\nengagement.\n\nThe first step in Performance-Based Hiring is to publicize that you\u2019re\nlooking for help. For most companies, announcing the job involves writing\na job description, which is either published in a public format or used by a\nrecruiter to search private networks. Either way, don\u2019t write the job\ndescription like an advertisement: you want to describe what the applicant\nwill do on a day-to-day basis if they work for you, with as much\nunembellished detail as you can share. You\u2019re looking for people who are\nattracted to the work, and it\u2019s difficult for applicants to determine whether\nor not they\u2019ll be a good fit unless you describe what the job involves.\n\nNext, identify a basic \u201cacid test\u201d to screen applicants. In weak\nemployment markets, new job postings tend to be overwhelmed with\napplicants, many of whom are poor candidates. You\u2019ll need a way to\nidentify the most promising candidates without taking too much time per\ncandidate. Screening by degree or GPA is common but ineffective, since\nthese don\u2019t tell you anything about the candidate\u2019s current level of skill. In\nthe application, ask a few basic questions that require a certain amount of\nspecialized knowledge in the field to answer. The most promising\ncandidates will be easy to identify.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve identified a few promising candidates, ask each one to\nshow you examples of two or three of their best projects to date. These\n\nprojects don\u2019t have to be related to the job in question, but they should be\nwork that the applicant is proud of and that they believe highlights their\nskills. The idea is to see examples of what the candidate has accomplished\nto date, which makes it easier to gauge their relative level of experience and\nwork ethic. If a candidate claims that they have \u201cfive years of experience\u201d\nin product development but can\u2019t show you something they\u2019ve created,\nthat\u2019s a red flag.\n\nChecking references at this point is a good use of time. Along with the\nproject examples, request the names and contact information of people they\nworked with in the process. When you contact a candidate\u2019s references,\nyour questions should be simple: e.g., Would they work with the candidate\nagain? If they hesitate or talk around the question, it\u2019s a no. If you can\u2019t\nreach a reference when you call, leave a message and ask them to contact\nyou if the candidate is extraordinary. If they are, you\u2019ll receive a return call.\nIf they aren\u2019t, you won\u2019t.\n\nFinally, give promising candidates a short-turnaround project or scenario\nto see how they think, work, and communicate firsthand. Small projects\ntend to work best for skilled technical employees, while scenarios work best\nfor candidates who will be responsible for product creation, marketing,\nsales, business development, finance, and management roles. The outcome\nof the assignment should be a deliverable of some kind: a report, a pitch, an\nasset, or a process.\n\nDon\u2019t put the candidate in an artificial environment: they should be free\nto use whatever tools or resources they\u2019re comfortable using. They should\nbe free to contact you if they have questions. On completion of the project,\nbring the candidate in to meet you and present their results. This\npresentation replaces the interview.\n\nThe purpose of the project or scenario is to evaluate the candidate\u2019s\nactual work in a realistic environment. What does the candidate focus on\nfirst? What do they notice and what do they miss? How do they explain\ntheir choices and recommendations? How do they respond when you ask\nquestions or disagree with a conclusion?\n\nAssignments like these should be short, requiring no more than a few\nhours of work. Respect your applicants: your hiring process should not be a\ncover to obtain free consulting. If you\u2019d prefer to use longer projects to\nevaluate a candidate, you can always hire them as a part-time consultant,\nthen bring them on full-time if you\u2019re pleased with their work.\n\nThis general hiring process is a straightforward, effective way to\ndiscover and evaluate promising employees and contractors. It\u2019s important\nto note that this process doesn\u2019t rely on r\u00e9sum\u00e9s or traditional interviews,\nwhich only test for how well the candidate writes a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and performs in\nan interview. If you look for past performance and evaluate a candidate\u2019s\nwork firsthand, you\u2019ll make much better hires.\n",

No\npremanufactured parts or plans allowed. Just a block of metal, a few simple\n\ntools, your knowledge, and your imagination. How do you think your\nproject will turn out?\n\nEven if the project takes a year, chances are it will be a complete disaster\n\u2014if your car works at all (which is very, very unlikely), it\u2019ll be far less\nefficient and reliable than even the worst car from a commercial\nmanufacturer.\n\nNow imagine building a modern computer, creating a cure for cancer, or\ncloning a human being from scratch without relying on anything someone\nelse has already discovered. You'll suffer through a series of expensive and\ndemoralizing failures. If you succeed, it\u2019ll take decades.\n\nWhy is it so hard to build working complex systems from scratch? John\nGall, one of the first major complex-systems theorists, provided the answer.\nHere\u2019s Gail's Law: all complex systems that work evolved from simpler\n\nsystems that worked. Complex systems are full of variables and\nInterdependencies that must be arranged just right in order to function.\nComplex systems designed from scratch will never work in the real world,\nsince they haven\u2019t been subject to environmental selection forces while\nbeing designed.\n\nUncertainty ensures that you will never be able to anticipate all of these\nInterdependencies and variables in advance, so a complex system built from\nscratch will continually fail in all sorts of unexpected ways.\n\nGall\u2019s Law is where environmental Selection Tests meet systems design.\nIf you want to build a system that works, the best approach is to build a\nsimple system that meets the Environment's current Selection Tests first, then\nimprove it over time. Over time, you\u2019ll build a complex system that works.\n\nGall\u2019s Law is why Prototyping and Iteration work so well as a Value\nCreation methodology. Instead of building a complex system from scratch,\nbuilding a Prototype is much easier\u2014it\u2019s the simplest possible creation that\nwill help you verify that your system meets critical Selection Tests.\n\nExpanding that Prototype into a Minimum Viable Offer allows you to\nvalidate your Critical Assumptions, resulting in the simplest possible system\nthat can succeed with actual purchasers. The Iteration Cycle and Incremental\nAugmentation, over time, will produce complex systems that work, even as\nthe Environment changes.\n\nIf you want to build a system that works from scratch, violate Gall\u2019s\nLaw at your peril.\n",

Alleviate the Constraint, and the system\u2019s performance will\nimprove.\n\nIn The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement, Eliyahu Goldratt\nexplains what he calls the \u201cTheory of Constraints\u201d: any manageable system\nis always limited in achieving more of its Goa/ by at least one Constraint. If\nyou can identify and alleviate the Constraint, you\u2019ll increase the Throughput\nof the system.\n\nCreating or increasing the size of a Stock in front of a Constraint can help\nalleviate the issue. If you\u2019re running out of engines, increasing the S/ack in\nyour engine Stock is the best way to alleviate the Constraint. By ensuring\nthat the Constraint isn\u2019t \u201cstarved,\u201d you can increase the performance of the\nentire system.\n\nIn order to find and eliminate a Constraint, Goldratt proposes the \u201cFive\nFocusing Steps,\u201d a method you can use to improve the Throughput of any\nsystem:\n\n1.\n\nIdentification\u2014examining the system to find the limiting factor. If\nyour automotive assembly line is waiting on engines in order to\nproceed, engines are your Constraint.\n\n2.\n\nExploitation\u2014ensuring that the resources related to the Constraint\naren\u2019t wasted. If the employees responsible for making engines are\nalso building windshields, or stop building engines during\nlunchtime, exploiting the Constraint would look like having the\nengine employees spend 100 percent of their available time and\nenergy producing engines, and having them work in shifts so breaks\ncan be taken without slowing down production.\n\n3.\n\nSubordination\u2014redesigning the entire system to support the\nConstraint. Let\u2019s assume you\u2019ve done everything you can to get the\nmost out of the engine-production system, but you\u2019re still behind.\nSubordination would be rearranging the factory so everything\nneeded to build the engine is close at hand, instead of requiring\ncertain materials to come from the other end of the factory. Other\nsubsystems may have to move or lose resources, but that\u2019s not a\nhuge deal, since they\u2019re not the Constraint.\n\n4.\n\nElevation\u2014permanently increasing the capacity of the Constraint.\nIn the case of the factory, elevation would be buying another engine-\nmaking machine and hiring more workers to operate it. Elevation is\nvery effective, but it\u2019s expensive\u2014you don\u2019t want to spend millions\non more equipment if you don\u2019t have to. That\u2019s why exploitation\nand subordination come first: you can often alleviate a Constraint\nquickly, without resorting to spending more money.\n\n5.\n\nReevaluation\u2014after making a change, reevaluating the system to\nsee where the Constraint is located. Inertia is your enemy. Don\u2019t\nassume engines will always be the Constraint: once you make a few\nChanges, the limiting factor might become windshields. In that case,\nit doesn\u2019t make sense to continue focusing on increasing engine\nproduction\u2014the system won\u2019t improve until windshields become\nthe focus of improvement.\n\nThe \u201cFive Focusing Steps\u201d are very similar to Iteration Velocity\u2014the\nfaster you move through this process and the more cycles you complete, the\nmore your system\u2019s Throughput will improve.\n",

Feedback is how systems learn\u2014if the system\nis capable of perceiving its Environment, that feedback helps the system\nunderstand whether it\u2019s under control and satisfying the required Selection\nTests.\n\nBalancing loops dampen each system cycle\u2019s output, leading to system\nequilibrium and resistance to change. Think of dropping a tennis ball from\nshoulder height: it\u2019ll bounce up and down, each bounce smaller than the\nlast. Friction and air resistance dampen each cycle until the energy in the\nsystem reaches equilibrium and the ball sits at rest upon the ground.\n\nBalancing loops stabilize the system, dampening oscillations and\nkeeping the system in a certain state. Perceptual Control systems are usually\nmade up of balancing loops. Going back to the thermostat example: If the\ntemperature of a room is higher than the Reference Level, the cooling system\nwill kick in to move the temperature lower. If the temperature is lower than\nthe Reference Level, the heater will turn on to bring the temperature up. As\na result, the system tends to maintain a stable temperature, which is its\npurpose.\n\nReinforcing loops amplify the system\u2019s output with each system cycle.\nReinforcing loops tend to lead to runaway growth or decay over time. Think\nof a price war between two companies, each of which is competing to have\nthe lowest price. Company A lowers its price, then Company B retaliates by\nmoving its price even lower. As long as each company\u2019s Reference Level\nremains \u201cour price must be lower than our competitor\u2019s,\u201d prices will\ncontinue to drop until both companies eliminate their Profit Margins on that\noffering.\n\nCompounding is an example of a positive reinforcing loop. Each cycle of\ninterest payments makes the principal of the next cycle bigger, resulting in\neven more interest, continuing the cycle. Over time, accumulated interest\ncan build to enormous sums, which is the purpose of the system.\n\nMore often than not, the size of every Stock is influenced by several\nloops, all pulling it in different directions. Consider your bank account\nbalance: there are Feedback Loops controlling your income, rent/mortgage,\nfood expenditures, and other expenses. You\u2019re evaluating whether each\ncycle is too much or not enough, which represents a balancing Feedback\nLoop. Too much or not enough inflow or outflow causes you to jump into\naction, which affects the next cycle.\n\nLook around you\u2014there are Feedback Loops everywhere. Once you\nstart noticing them, you\u2019ll fully appreciate the ever-changing complexity of\nthe systems we live in.\n",

Unexpected or random events can occur suddenly, which can\nhave major impacts on your goals and plans.\n\nIn The Black Swan, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, a former hedge fund\nmanager, describes the perils of Uncertainty. No matter how stable or\npredictable things seem, unpredictable \u201cblack swan events\u201d can change\neverything in an instant.\n\nThe term \u201cblack swan\u201d was a common expression in sixteenth-century\nLondon for something that was impossible or didn\u2019t exist\u2014everyone knew\nthat all swans were white. The problem with the term is what eighteenth-\ncentury philosopher David Hume called the \u201cproblem of induction\u201d: until\nyou see every swan that exists, you can never assume the statement \u201call\nswans are white\u201d is true. All it takes is one black swan to invalidate the\nhypothesis, which happened when black swans were documented in\nAustralia in 1697 by Dutch sea captain Willem de Vlamingh.\n\nThe moment before they happen, the probability of \u201cblack swan\u201d events\noccurring is close to zero. In the wake of a black swan event, the probability\nof its occurring is a moot point: the event changes the Environment in which\nthe system operates, sometimes drastically changing Selection Tests without\nwarning. You can\u2019t know in advance if (or which) black swan events will\noccur: all you can do is be flexible, prepared, and Resilient enough to react\nappropriately if and when they do.\n\nEven the most detailed analysis with reams of historical data can\u2019t save\nyou from Uncertainty. The primary drawback of the financial models taught\nin most MBA programs is Uncertainty: your pro forma, net present value\n(NPV) or capital asset pricing model (CAPM) calculation is only as good as\nthe quality of your predictions. Many a business has been ruined by\nfinancial predictions that turned out to be wrong. How likely is it that your\nten-year financial projection predicts everything that will happen with 100\npercent accuracy? Who says tomorrow is going to be anything like today?\n\nMany people make a business of selling certainty, which doesnt exist.\nPrediction, forecasting, and other forms of business soothsaying are popular\nbecause they provide the illusion that the future is knowable and\ncontrollable. Exercises in prediction aren\u2019t worth the cost\u2014if there were a\nfoolproof way to predict gas prices, interest rates, or stock prices, the people\nwith that magic knowledge would be multibillionaires and would have no\nneed to sell anything to you.\n\nAbsorbing the ever-present nature of Uncertainty is an exercise in seeing\nthe world as it is, not as we want it to be. We all want to feel like we know\nwhat will happen in the future, particularly given how prone we are to Loss\nAversion and Threat Lockdown. Contemplating Uncertainty feels bad, because\nnot knowing what\u2019s going to happen feels like a threat. Instead of fixating\non predicting invisible and unknowable threats, it\u2019s better to channel your\nenergy into enhancing your ability to handle the unexpected.\n\nDon\u2019t rely on making accurate predictions\u2014things can change at any\ntime. Planning for flexibility in response to Uncertainty via Scenario Planning\nis far more useful than pretending to be a seer.\n",

Your refrigerator requires electricity to operate. When your local\npower plant fails, your refrigerator fails as well. That\u2019s interdependence.\n\nHighly Interdependent systems are sometimes referred to as \u201ctightly\ncoupled\u201d systems. The more tightly coupled the processes in a system are,\nthe more likely failures or delays will affect other parts of the system.\n\nTightly coupled systems are often time dependent and rigidly ordered,\nand have very little slack. There\u2019s often only one path to a successful\noutcome, and a failure in any part of the system can \u201ccascade\u201d to the rest of\nthe system.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever seen a Rube Goldberg machine or played the children\u2019s\nboard game Mousetrap, you\u2019ve seen a tightly coupled system. In a cascade\nof dominoes, when one domino fails to knock over the next, the entire\nsystem grinds to a halt.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever heard the project management term \u201ccritical path,\u201d you\nknow the importance of Interdependencies. The critical path contains only\nthe tasks that must be completed in order for the project to be finished on\nschedule. If something on the critical path changes, that change cascades to\neverything else on the path. Any delay in a task on the critical path will\ndelay the entire project.\n\n\u201cLoosely coupled\u201d systems have low degrees of Interdependence.\nLoosely coupled systems are more relaxed: they\u2019re not time dependent. You\nmay be able to use \u201cparallel processing,\u201d completing multiple steps at a\ntime. There\u2019s plenty of Slack, and you may be able to accomplish your goal\nusing many different strategies.\n\nThink of an orchestra, which consists of a conductor and many\ninstrumentalists. If the first violin hits the wrong note, the quality of the\nperformance will be affected, but the mistake won\u2019t necessarily cascade to\nthe rest of the orchestra.\n\nYou can make a system less Interdependent by removing dependencies.\nA \u201cdependency\u201d is an input that\u2019s required before the next stage of a\nprocess can take place. The more dependencies there are in a system, the\nhigher the likelihood of delay or system failure.\n\nEliminating dependencies makes a system less tightly coupled. Think\nback to the automotive assembly line example: if you must put in the engine\nbefore the windshield is installed, an engine problem will delay the entire\nsystem. If it doesn\u2019t matter in which order the parts are installed, it\u2019s\npossible to assemble a finished vehicle in more than one way.\n\nEliminate unnecessary dependencies and you\u2019ll reduce the risk of a\ncascading failure.\n",

Now known for its international banking prowess, pearl diving, and\ninternational Formula One racing track, it wasn\u2019t too long ago that Bahrain\nwas known for its unique ecosystem.\n\nA few decades ago, the interior of Bahrain was lush with natural\ngreenery\u2014an island oasis said to be the original site of the Garden of Eden.\nNow the interior of the island is a stark desert, and local plant life is\nmaintained via irrigation. What changed?\n\nBahrain is surrounded by a network of underground freshwater springs,\nwhich were responsible both for the island\u2019s plant life and for spurring the\n\nlocal oysters to cultivate pearls of remarkable quality. As the country\u2019s\nsingle large city, Manama, developed, land in the city center became scarce,\nso developers adopted a process called \u201cland reclamation,\u201d which involved\nexcavating dirt from the interior of the island and depositing it on the coast,\n\u201creclaiming\u201d land from the sea.\n\nThis approach was successful in creating new land, but at a much steeper\ncost than anticipated\u2014the island\u2019s network of springs dried up, turning the\ncountry into a desert.\n\nEvery action has a consequence, and those consequences have\nconsequences, which are called Second-Order Effects. Think of a line of\ndominoes\u2014a single push causes a chain of events to occur. Once the chain\nstarts, it\u2019s difficult (if not impossible) to stop or reverse the cascade of cause\nand effect.\n\nRent control in New York City after World War II is another sobering\nexample of unintended consequences. Originally intended to provide\nreturning veterans with affordable housing, the policy capped rent prices\n(and the ability of landlords to raise them) in certain areas of the city.\nAffordable housing for veterans is a noble idea, right?\n\nHere\u2019s what the city planners didn\u2019t expect: every year, the cost to\nmaintain properties in New York City continued to rise, but landlords\ncouldn\u2019t raise rent prices to compensate for their increased costs. By law,\nrent control couldn\u2019t be removed unless the original leaseholder moved or\nthe building was condemned, so landlords refused to maintain their property\n\u2014it was a waste of money. Financially, it was better to let the building\ndeteriorate around the remaining tenants.\n\nThe effect of this policy over time was a steep decline in the quality of\nproperty, and eventually supply, as buildings were condemned, making\nhousing even more expensive. A policy intended to make housing more\naffordable destroyed housing supply and made it more expensive\u2014the\nopposite of the original intent.\n\nChanging some aspect of a complex system always introduces Second-\nOrder Effects, some of which may be antithetical to the original intent of\nthe change. Elements in a complex system can be interrelated or dependent\nupon one another in millions of different ways, and Uncertainty guarantees\nthat you probably don\u2019t know how. Every action has a consequence, and\nthose consequences always have consequences\u2014even if you don\u2019t know\n\na a a a aT\n\nApproach making changes to a complex system with extreme caution:\nwhat you get may be the opposite of what you expect.\n",

In our obscurity, in all this vastness,\nthere is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves... To me, it underscores\nour responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot,\nthe only home we've ever known.\n\nCARL SAGAN, PHYSICIST AND AUTHOR OF PALE BLUE DOT: A VISION OF THE HUMAN FUTURE IN\nSPACE\n\nB etween 1868 and 1969, the Cuyahoga River\u2014a large tributary of Lake\nErie that runs through the city of Cleveland, Ohio, in the United States\u2014\ncaught fire on at least thirteen separate occasions. The largest of the fires,\nwhich occurred in 1952, caused over $1 million of property damage\u2014more\nthan $10 million in today\u2019s dollars.\n\nThe root cause wasn\u2019t a mystery: pollution from petrochemicals,\nsewage, and manufacturing by-products was so severe that a forty-mile\nstretch of the river\u2014from Cleveland to Akron\u2014was unable to support fish\nor other aquatic life. The river was an inexpensive and convenient place to\ndump garbage, so many factories took the path of least resistance, building\npipelines that carried industrial waste into the river in an effort to save\nmoney. The river died (and caught on fire) as a result.\n\nThe technical term for these events is Externality: a side effect of a\nprimary process that affects parties beyond the primary beneficiaries or\ndecision makers. Manufacturing in and around Cleveland was the primary\nprocess, and factory owners and employees were the primary beneficiaries:\nthe pollution of the Cuyahoga and the effects of that pollution on other\npeople and creatures were Externalities. The companies responsible for the\npollution shifted the cost of waste disposal from their businesses to society\nat large.\n\nToday, the Cuyahoga River is in much better shape. Improving the\nsituation required significant intervention: laws, policies, and regulations\nthat prevented and punished dumping, lawsuits and fines targeted at\nviolators, and funds for cleaning and restoration efforts. Once the\n\nExternality was identified and understood, it was possible to coordinate\nsocietal efforts to fix the issue and prevent it from happening again.\n\nPollution isn\u2019t the only type of negative Externality. Here\u2019s a common\nexample: many businesses collect Personally Identifiable Information (often\nabbreviated \u201cPII\u201d) as part of their marketing, sales, and customer-support\nefforts. This data is useful for Qualification, Segmentation, and outreach, so\nfirms go to great lengths to collect as much information as possible. There\nis, however, an important Externality to consider: if unauthorized users (like\nhackers) gain access to this personal information, it can be used for all sorts\nof nefarious purposes, many of which can create financial and legal issues\nfor the businesses\u2019 prospects and customers.\n\nSecuring this data is important, but it doesn\u2019t contribute to the\nbusinesses\u2019 bottom line, so there\u2019s little direct incentive to worry about it. In\nthe event of a data breach, the businesses\u2019 prospects and customers pay the\nprice. That makes PII both an asset and a liability: companies that collect\nthis sort of data have a responsibility to keep it secure and ensure their\nsystems are protected from unauthorized access.\n\nMany negative Externalities can be avoided or mitigated by anticipating\npotential Second-Order Effects and working to prevent unintended\nconsequences. As a general rule: if you anticipate or identify negative side\neffects that occur (or may occur) as a result of your actions, it\u2019s your\nresponsibility to prevent or mitigate those effects as much as possible.\n\nSome Externalities are positive. Consider communications technology\nlike the internet or telephone network: each additional user of the system\nmakes the network as a whole more valuable, creating a \u201cnetwork effect\u201d\nthat benefits every user of the system. Societal policies like widespread\nliteracy and public-health practices (like handwashing and vaccination)\nhave similar benefits: everyone benefits when there are lower barriers to\ncommunication and reduced exposure to infectious disease.\n\nExternalities are sometimes difficult to predict in advance, but that\ndoesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t try. The benefits and detriments of your actions\nare real, and it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s best interest to take full advantage of\nunexpected opportunities and prevent unnecessary issues.\n",

The problem is expecting otherwise and thinking that\nhaving problems is a problem\n\n\u2014THEODORE RUBIN, PSYCHIATRIST AND COLUMNIST\n\nThe space shuttle\u2014a vehicle capable of exiting the bounds of Earth\u2019s\ngravity with human travelers aboard\u2014is the epitome of a complex system.\n\nA highly engineered airplane strapped to three rockets holding millions\nof cubic feet of explosive hydrogen gas is also the epitome of a highly\nInterdependent system. Any error has the chance of cascading through the\nrest of the system, and every time the shuttle is launched, millions of things\ncould go wrong.\n\nIn 1986, the space shuttle Challenger suffered a catastrophe\u2014a seal in\none of the rockets froze, becoming brittle. When the seal was superheated\nduring takeoff, it failed. Challenger exploded seventy-three seconds after\nlift-off, killing everyone aboard.\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to believe that it\u2019s possible to create a system in which\nnothing ever goes wrong. Real-life systems always prove otherwise\u2014count\non it.\n\nThe theory of Normal Accidents is a more formal way of expressing a\nuniversal proverb: shit happens. In a tightly coupled system, small risks\naccumulate to the point where errors and accidents are inevitable. The\nlarger and more complex the system, the higher the likelihood that\nsomething will eventually go very, very wrong.\n\nOverreacting to Normal Accidents is counterproductive. When\nsomething goes wrong, our instinctive response is to become\nhypersensitive, locking things down and adding more controls to prevent\nthe unfortunate event from happening again. This response makes things\nworse: locking things down and adding more systems only makes the\nsystem more tightly coupled, increasing the risk of future accidents.\n\nNASA\u2019s response to the Challenger tragedy is instructive: instead of\nshutting down or adding more systems that could compound the issue,\nNASA engineers recognized the inherent risk and focused on finding other\nsolutions to the problem that would minimize the risk of the issue\nreoccurring, without adding more systems that could potentially fail.\n\nThe best way to avoid Normal Accidents is to analyze breakdowns or\n\u201cclose calls\u201d when they happen. Instead of going into the systems\nequivalent of Threat Lockdown, which can create even bigger issues in the\nlong term, looking at near misses can provide crucial insight into hidden\nInterdependencies. By analyzing the issue, it\u2019s possible to construct\ncontingency plans in the event a similar situation happens in the future.\n\nIn 2003, the space shuttle Columbia suffered a catastrophe of a different\nsort: the carbon-fiber heat shields designed to protect the shuttle as it\nreentered Earth\u2019s atmosphere failed, and the shuttle disintegrated. Again,\nNASA focused on how to prevent the issue in the future without making the\nsystem even more tightly coupled. When the space shuttle Discovery\nsuffered damage to its heat shields on takeoff a few years later, NASA\nengineers were prepared, and the crew landed safely.\n\nNormal Accidents are a compelling reason to keep the systems you rely\non as loosely coupled as you can. There are many positive things to be said\nfor systems, but expecting zero failures is unrealistic in the extreme.\nLoosely coupled systems may not be as efficient, but they last longer and\nfail less catastrophically.\n\nThe more complex a system is and the longer it operates, the more likely\nit is to suffer a major failure. It\u2019s not a matter of if\u2014it\u2019s a matter of when.\nBe watchful for system failure and be prepared to respond to it quickly.\n",

Every process involves breaking something up.\n\u2014JOSEPH CAMPBELL, MYTHOLOGIST AND AUTHOR OF THE HERO WITH A THOUSAND FACES\n\nC omptex systems, as we\u2019ve already discussed, are made up of many\ninterdependent Flows, Stocks, processes, and parts. As a whole, the system\n\nmay be too complex to take in all at once\u2014if there are more than seven or\neight variables or dependencies, Cognitive Scope Limitation kicks in and\nconfusion takes over.\n\nIf that\u2019s true, how can anyone analyze complex systems?\n\nDeconstruction is the process of separating complex systems into the\nsmallest possible subsystems in order to understand how things work.\nInstead of trying to understand the system all at once, you break up the\nsystem into parts, then work on understanding the subsystems and how they\ninteract with one another.\n\nDeconstruction is the reverse-engineering aspect of Gall\u2019s Law.\nRemember: complex systems that work evolved from simpler systems that\nalso worked. If you can identify simpler subsystems and focus on\nunderstanding how they work and how they fit together, you can eventually\nunderstand how the entire system works.\n\nIf you know nothing about how cars work, popping the hood of your\nvehicle and examining the contents is an exercise in confusion\u2014there are\nso many parts that it\u2019s hard to know where to begin. Understanding the\nsystem is not impossible, however: identifying important subsystems like\nthe engine, transmission, and radiator can give you valuable insight into\nhow the entire system functions.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve identified important subsystems, isolating them in your\nmind can help you understand how they work. Instead of focusing on how\nthe entire car works, you narrow your focus to the engine for a while.\nWhere does the subsystem begin? What Flows are involved? What\nprocesses take place inside the system? Are there Feedback Loops involved?\nWhat happens if inflows don\u2019t come in? Where does the system end? What\nare the outflows?\n\nIt\u2019s important not to lose sight of interdependence when using isolation to\nDeconstruct a system, since each subsystem is part of a larger system.\nIdentifying triggers and endpoints\u2014the parts of the system that interact\nwith other subsystems\u2014is just as important. Triggers teach you what makes\na subsystem start operating, and endpoints show you what makes the\nsystem stop.\n\nIn addition, it\u2019s important to understand the conditionals present in a\nsystem\u2014if-then or when-then relationships that influence the operation of\nthe system. For example, an engine requires an inflow of gasoline vapor to\noperate. If that inflow is present, a spark from the spark plug ignites it,\n\nproviding energy that pushes a piston that powers the rest of the system. If\nthat inflow is absent or a spark doesn\u2019t come from the spark plug, the\nenergy is absent and the system stops, making both the inflow of gasoline\nvapor and the spark from the spark plug conditions of the system\u2019s\noperation.\n\nCreating diagrams and flowcharts can help you understand how each\ninflow, process, trigger, conditional, endpoint, and outflow comes together.\nExplaining complex systems in words alone can be limiting\u2014for best\nresults, draw diagrams of the Flows, Stocks, conditionals, and processes\ninvolved. Well-constructed flowcharts can help you understand the Flows of\na system as it operates, which can go a long way toward helping you fix the\nsystem when things break down.\n\nTo analyze a system, Deconstruct complex systems into subsystems that\nare easier to understand, then build your understanding of the system from\nthe ground up.\n",

EDWARDS DEMING, PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT EXPERT AND PIONEER OF STATISTICAL\nPROCESS CONTROL\n\n0 nce you\u2019ve understood the parts of the system and how they interact\nwith one another, it pays to ask another question: How well is the system\noperating? To do that, we rely on measuring the system as it\u2019s operating.\n\nMeasurement is the process of collecting data as the system is operating.\nBy collecting information related to the core functions of the system, it\u2019s\nmuch easier to understand how well the system itself is performing.\n\nMeasurement also allows systems to be compared with one another. For\nexample, it\u2019s possible to use several different types of microprocessors to\nbuild a computer\u2014which one should you use? By measuring various\ncharacteristics of each processor\u2014cycle time, power consumption, heat\ngeneration, etc.\u2014it\u2019s possible to choose the best processor for your\ncomputer, resulting in better performance.\n\nMeasurement helps us avoid Absence Blindness when analyzing a system.\nRemember: we have a hard time seeing things that aren\u2019t present.\nMeasuring different parts of a system in operation helps to identify potential\nissues before they arise.\n\nFor example, diabetes is a condition that represents a fault in the\nFeedback Loop that controls the body\u2019s blood glucose levels. Too much or\ntoo little blood glucose is life threatening, so if the body produces too much\nor too little insulin to keep blood glucose levels stable, that\u2019s a major issue.\n\nEven though insulin levels are critical to a person with diabetes, you\ncan\u2019t figure out a person\u2019s insulin or blood glucose level just by looking at\nthem. Without measurement, Absence Blindness is the rule until the\ncondition becomes bad enough to become visible, which takes the form of\nthe person passing out or going into shock.\n\nTo avoid this situation, people with diabetes make a habit of measuring\ntheir blood glucose and insulin levels throughout the day.\n\nMeasuring something is the first step to improving it. In the immortal\nwords of Peter Drucker, \u201cWhat gets measured gets managed.\u201d It\u2019s true. If\nyou don\u2019t know how much money your business is collecting or spending,\nit\u2019s difficult to know whether or not any change you make to your business\nsystem is an improvement.\n\nWithout data, you\u2019re blind.

STATISTICIAN\n\nH ere\u2019s the primary problem with Measurement: you can measure a million\ndifferent things. Measure too much and you'll suffer from Cognitive Scope\nLimitation, drowning in a sea of meaningless data.\n\nSome Measurements are more important than others: Key Performance\nIndicators (KPIs) are Measurements of the critical parts of a system.\nMeasurements that don\u2019t help you make improvements to your system are\n\nworse than worthless: they\u2019re a waste of your limited Attention and energy.\nIf your intent is to improve the system you\u2019re examining, you don\u2019t have to\npay Attention to everything\u2014just a few key Measurements that matter.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to fixate on things that are easy to measure instead of things\nthat are important. Take, for example, a business\u2019s revenue\u2014seems pretty\nimportant, right? It is, but only to a point: revenue is important only because\nit\u2019s a key component of profit. It doesn\u2019t matter if you collected $1,000,000\nin revenue if you spent $2,000,000 to collect it. As Theo Paphitis, a serial\nentrepreneur and host of the hit BBC series Dragons\u2019 Den, put it: \u201cProfit is\nsanity. Turnover is vanity.\u201d Alone, revenue is not a KPI.\n\nThe same thing goes for other in-process Measurements. For example, if\nyou\u2019re managing a team of programmers, it\u2019s tempting to measure their\noutput in \u201clines of code\u201d\u2014a visible, easy-to-collect measure. Here\u2019s the\nproblem: more code is not necessarily better. A talented programmer can\nmake a program better by rewriting it using fewer lines of code. If you\nfixate on quantity, removing ten thousand lines looks like a setback, even if\nit\u2019s a huge improvement.\n\nThe situation gets even worse if you reward programmers based on lines\nof code: Incentive-Caused Bias will ensure that your code looks like the\nprogramming equivalent of War and Peace.\n\nBusiness-related KPIs are often related to either the Five Parts of Every\nBusiness OF Throughput. Here are a few questions | use to identify a\nbusiness\u2019s KPIs:\n\n.\nValue Creation: How fast is the system creating value? What is the\ncurrent level of inflows?\n\n.\n\nMarketing: How many people are paying Attention to your offer?\nHow many prospects are giving you Permission to provide more\ninformation?\n\n.\n\nSales: How many prospects are becoming paying customers? What\nis the average customer\u2019s Lifetime Value?\n\nValue Delivery: How fast can you serve each customer? What is\nyour current rate of returns or complaints?\n\nFinance: What is your Profit Margin? How much Purchasing Power do\nyou have? Are you financially Sufficient?\n\nAny Measurements related to these questions are probably KPIs.\nAnything that\u2019s not related to a core business process or a system\u2019s\nThroughput is probably not.\n\nTry to limit yourself to only three to five KPIs per system. When\ncollecting Measurements, it\u2019s tempting to build yourself a \u201cdashboard\u201d that\ncontains every piece of information you\u2019d ever want to see. Resist the\ntemptation: if you overload yourself with too much data, you\u2019ll be far less\nlikely to see Changes that are meaningful and important. You can always dig\ndeeper into the data at your disposal if necessary.\n\nFind your system\u2019s KPIs and you\u2019ll be able to manage your system\nwithout drowning in data.\n\npoeccocercc imi: nNorcanalmhs camilav.norfarmancea.indicatar!\n",

The higher the\nreliability, the higher the percentage.\n\nWhen you hear someone talk about \u201cfive nines\u201d reliability, that means\nthe system produces the intended result 99.999 percent of the time. This\nlevel of reliability is impressive, and often expensive to achieve. Companies\nuse this reliability measurement as a Tolerance, and they write a contract\ncalled a \u201cService Level Agreement\u201d (SLA) that promises to compensate\ncustomers if errors exceed a certain threshold.\n\nTight Tolerances are very useful and a positive indicator of quality: after\nall, you don\u2019t want mistakes or variations. Work to achieve tighter\nTolerances for the critical parts of your system over time.\n",

Existence\nflows past us like a river: the \u201cwhat\" is in constant flux, the \u201cwhy\u201d has a thousand variations. Nothing is\nstable, not even what's right here.\n\nMARCUS AURELIUS, SECOND-CENTURY-BCE PHILOSOPHER AND EMPEROR OF ROME\n\nM easures that fluctuate at random are often difficult to analyze. Unit\nsales figures are a good example: If you sell 3,017 units on Monday, 2,967\non Tuesday, and 3,142 units on Wednesday, how do you estimate your\n\u201cnormal\u201d daily sales? Even more challenging: if your sales increase or\ndecrease at random each day, how can you tell if a new marketing or sales\nstrategy is working?\n\nVariance is the degree of fluctuation in a measure or set of data. Measures\nof Typicality, like means or medians, are a natural place to start, but they\ndon\u2019t capture the range of fluctuations you\u2019re likely to experience. Without\nestablishing the degree of normal fluctuation, you\u2019re not equipped to make\ngood decisions.\n\nIn Understanding Variation: The Key to Managing Chaos, Dr. Donald J.\nWheeler describes an approach called \u201cstatistical process control\u201d that\nmakes analysis of Variance possible. Starting with a mean or median, it\u2019s\npossible to quantify the size of the fluctuations present in the data set. This\ngives you a typical value, an upper normal boundary, and a lower normal\nboundary: a range of expected normal values.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve established an upper and lower bound, you\u2019re in a much\nbetter position to make decisions. Data points that break the upper bound or\nlower bound are statistically significant, as are a series of consecutive data\npoints that are close to the boundary. Returning to the daily sales figure\nexample: if your normal upper bound is 3,500 units per day, it\u2019s worth\nlooking into a 4,000-unit sales day to see what led to that result. Likewise,\nif you have five consecutive days that exceed 3,500 units, that indicates you\nshould keep investing in your new marketing plan: it\u2019s working.\n\nMeasures of Variance are helpful in identifying opportunities or\nproblems when you don\u2019t have direct access to or visibility of all of the\ninputs and outputs. Defect rates are a good example: if you sell a Product,\nyou won\u2019t be able to test every unit, and Sampling may not catch problems\nthat occur in use. If you track the Variance of your customer-support\nrequests, return requests, and warranty requests, you can take immediate\naction if you see an increase that exceeds normal variation.\n",

HODGELL, PROFESSOR AND NOVELIST\n\nM y last position at Procter & Gamble involved creating an online\nmarketing Measurement strategy: figuring out a way to measure the\neffectiveness of P&G\u2019s advertising on the web. P&G spent millions of\ndollars every year on banner ads, search-engine advertising, and online\nvideo placements. My job was to figure out if the investment was worth it.\n\nOne of the things my team discovered while putting together our\nrecommendations was disturbing: the system we were using on most of our\nwebsites to measure unique visitors was wrong. Instead of counting human\nvisitors, the system was treating visits from automated search-engine\nsoftware bots as \u201cvisitors\u201d as well, even though they weren\u2019t people.\nComputer programs don\u2019t care about (and will never purchase) laundry\ndetergent and shampoo, but the system was counting them as potential\ncustomers.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for search-engine spider programs to visit a website\nmany times a day looking for new information, so the system was\noverstating how many people were visiting each website by a significant\nmargin. It was a Garbage In, Garbage Out situation, and it made our\nmeasurements much less useful.\n\nMy team recommended upgrading the tracking system to collect\naccurate visitor data. Without exception, the business units declined. They\nknew they were getting crappy data, but they didn\u2019t seem to care. Weird,\nright?\n\nHere\u2019s why: installing the new tracking system would make each\nwebsite\u2019s unique-visitors measurement\u2014considered a Key Performance\nIndicator by most teams\u2014decrease by an order of magnitude. Even though\nthe new system was more accurate, installing it would make the team look\nbad. Instead of correcting the issue, they chose to continue living a lie. As a\nresult, they seriously compromised their ability to improve their website\u2019s\nactual performance.\n\nAnalytical Honesty Means Measuring and analyzing the data you have\nwithout emotion or bias. Since humans are social creatures, we tend to care\ndeeply about how others perceive us, which gives us a natural incentive to\nmake things look better than they are. If your purpose is to make things\nbetter, this tendency can get in the way of collecting accurate data and\nconducting useful analysis.\n\nThe best way to maintain Analytical Honesty is to have your\nmeasurements evaluated by someone who isn\u2019t invested in your system.\nIncentive-Caused Bias and Confirmation Bias are easy to succumb to if your\nSocial Status is on the line. Having an experienced but dispassionate third\nparty audit your measurement and analysis practices is a neat workaround\nfor these tendencies: you might not like what you hear, but at least you\u2019ll be\nfully aware of potential issues.\n\nDon\u2019t look at your data through rose-colored glasses: always strive to be\nhonest with yourself about what the data indicates you can improve.\n",

If\nyou\u2019re managing a scalable system, it\u2019s often not possible to test every unit\nor find every error. How can you identify potential problems when your\nsystem is cranking out millions of units or completing millions of\ntransactions?\n\nSampling is the process of taking at random a small percentage of the\ntotal output, then using it as a proxy for the entire system. If you\u2019ve ever\nhad your blood taken at the doctor\u2019s office, you\u2019ll have a good idea of what\nSampling entails. The doctor or nurse draws a small amount of blood,\nwhich is then sent to a laboratory for analysis. If testing reveals anomalies\nin the sample, it\u2019s likely that the same issue is present in the bloodstream in\ngeneral.\n\nSampling can help you identify systemic errors without testing all of the\noutput of the system, which can be time-consuming and expensive. If\nyou\u2019re manufacturing mobile phones, you don\u2019t have to test every single\nphone that comes off the line.

Many retail stores\nemploy \u201csecret shoppers\u201d to test customer service or the skills of their sales\nstaff. These shoppers are hired to express interest in specific items, ask\ncertain questions, make a return, or act in annoying ways. Since the staff\ndoesn\u2019t know which customers are real and which ones are not, it\u2019s an\neffective way for the management of a store to test their staff without\nscrutinizing them every second of every day.\n\nSampling is prone to bias if the sample is not random or uniform. For\nexample, measuring the average household income in the United States by\nsurveying property owners in Manhattan will skew the data considerably\nhigher than if you survey property owners in West Virginia. For best results,\nuse the largest random sample you can.\n\nIf you need to test for quality, Sampling can help you collect good data\nwithout incurring enormous costs, provided you stay on the lookout for\n\nnatontial hiac that ran claw tho data\n",

Your \u201cclosing Ratio\u201d would be 10 divided by\n30: 1/3.\n\nLet\u2019s say you train your sales staff in techniques that result in 15 paying\ncustomers out of 30 who enter the store. Your new closing Ratio is 15\ndivided by 30: 1/2.\n\nPercentages are Ratios with a base of 100. Your first closing Ratio,\nconverted into a percentage, is 33 percent. Your second would be 50\npercent.\n\nHERE ARE SOME USEFUL RATIOS TO TRACK:\n\u00a9 Return on Promotion: For every $1 you spend in advertising,\nhow much revenue do you collect?\n\u00a9 Profit per Employee: For every person you employ, how much\nprofit does your business generate?\n\u00b0 Closing Ratio: For every prospect you serve, how many\npurchase?\n\n\u00b0 Returns/Complaints Ratio: For every sale you make, how many\nchoose to return or complain?\n\nFinancial Ratios are very helpful when examining financial statements.\nRatios like Return on Investment, return on assets, return on capital, inventory\nturns, and day sales outstanding are very useful in determining the health of\na business.

It's what you know that aint so.\n\u2014WILL ROGERS, AMERICAN COWBOY AND COMEDIAN\n\nThe average household net worth of a person who reads the Wall Street\nJournal is approximately $1.5 million.* Seems that Wall Street Journal\nreaders are well off, right?\n\nYes, but less than you might think. Bill Gates and Warren Buffett read\nthe Wall Street Journal, and their wealth is measured in the billions\u2014\nsignificantly more than even the top .01 percent of business professionals.\nUltra-high-net-worth executives like Gates and Buffett skew the average\nmuch higher than it would be otherwise. If you\u2019re relying on the average to\ntell you how much the typical Wall Street Journal reader is worth, you\u2019re\nmaking a mistake.\n\nMany forms of analysis rely on defining Typicality: identifying a normal\nor typical value for some important measurement. There are four common\nmethods of calculating a typical value: mean, median, mode, and midrange.\n\nA mean (or average) is calculated by adding the quantities of all data\npoints, then dividing by the total number of data points available. Averages\nare simple to calculate but are prone to Gates and Buffett syndrome: the\npresence of outliers that skew the average too high or low to be\nrepresentative. (Exclude the outliers, however, and the average becomes\nmore accurate.)\n\nA median is calculated by sorting the values in order of high to low, then\nfinding the quantity of the data point in the middle of the range. Medians\nare a specific form of analysis called a percentile: the median is the value\nthat expresses the fiftieth percentile. By definition, 50 percent of the values\nin the set will be below the median. Calculating the median and comparing\nit to the mean can tell you if the average is being influenced by a few heavy\nhitters.\n\nA mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a set of data. Modes\nare useful for finding clusters of data\u2014a set can have multiple modes,\nwhich can alert you to potentially interesting interdependencies in the system\nthat produced that data.\n\nA midrange is the value halfway between the highest and lowest data\npoints in a set of values. To calculate the midrange, add the highest and\nlowest values, then divide by two. Midranges are best used for quick\nestimates\u2014they\u2019re fast, and you only need to know two data points, but\nthey can be skewed by outliers that are abnormally high or low, like Bill\nGates\u2019s bank balance.\n\nMeans, medians, modes, and midranges are useful analytical tools that\ncan indicate typical results\u2014provided you\u2019re careful enough to use the right\ntool for the job.\n",

Professional billiards players are skilled at creating a Mental\nSimulation of these relationships so well that they can clear entire tables with\nlittle effort.\n\nThat\u2019s Causation: a complete chain of cause and effect. Since it\u2019s possible\nto calculate a complete chain of causality, you can say that striking the cue\nball caused a ball to fall into the corner pocket. If you hit the cue again in\nthe same way in the same situation, you\u2019ll get the same result every single\ntime.\n\nHere\u2019s another Thought Experiment, using hypothetical data: people who\nsuffer heart attacks eat, on average, 57 bacon double cheeseburgers every\nyear. Does eating bacon double cheeseburgers cause heart attacks? Not\nnecessarily. If people who suffer heart attacks take 365 showers a year and\nblink their eyes 5.6 million times a year, does taking showers and blinking\nyour eyes cause heart attacks?\n\nCorrelation is not Causation. Even if you notice that one measurement is\nassociated with another, that does not prove that one thing caused the other.\n\nImagine you own a pizza parlor and you create a thirty-second\nadvertisement to air on local television. Just after the commercial goes live,\nyou notice a 30 percent increase in sales. Did the advertisement cause the\nincrease?\n\nNot necessarily\u2014the increase could be due to any number of factors.\nMaybe a convention was held in town that day, so there were more visitors\nin town than usual and they needed a quick place to eat. Maybe school let\nout and families went out to eat to celebrate. Maybe you offered a special\ntwo-pizzas-for-the-price-of-one promotion at the same time, and that\u2019s what\nbrought more people in the door. So many things happened at the same\ntime, it\u2019s hard to be certain.\n\nIn fact, the commercial may have caused a decline in sales\u2014maybe\npeople found it unappealing or offensive, but another factor caused such a\nhuge increase in sales that it overshadowed the decline.\n\nCausation is always more difficult to prove than Correlation. When\nanalyzing complex systems with many variables and Interdependencies, it\u2019s\noften difficult to find true causality. The more changes that happen in a\nsystem over a period of time, the higher the likelihood that more than one\nchange had an impact on the result you\u2019re trying to analyze.\n\nAdjusting for known variables can help you isolate the potential causes\nof a change in your system. For example, if you know that families go out\nto celebrate the end of school or that an annual convention is coming up,\nyou can adjust for that seasonality by using historical data.\n\nThe more you can isolate the change you made in the system from other\nfactors, the more confidence you can have that the change you made caused\nthe results you see.\n",

Drawing on several years\u2019\nworth of data, it was possible to compare new advertisements with old\nadvertisements that had been successful.

For example, imagine a\ncustomer service department that answers customer complaints by\ntelephone. Reducing hold times from ten minutes to eight minutes sounds\ngreat\u2014that\u2019s a 20 percent improvement!\n\nPut the champagne away: what the data-centric viewpoint misses is the\nfact that you still have a dissatisfied customer waiting on the phone for\neight minutes, which still feels like an eternity. Every minute on hold makes\nthat customer angrier, which affects their perception of the company. That\n20 percent improvement pales in comparison to the Reputation hit your\nbusiness takes every time that customer tells their friends and associates\nhow horrible your company is to deal with.\n\nHumanization is the process of using data to tell a story (Narrative) about a\nreal person\u2019s experience or behavior. Quantifiable measures are helpful in\nthe aggregate, but it\u2019s often necessary to reframe the measure into actual\nbehavior to understand what\u2019s happening.\n\nMany businesses Humanize by developing a series of personas: fictional\nprofiles of people developed from data. When I developed home cleaning\nproducts for P&G, market research data told us that two broad Segments\nexisted: people who valued regular deep cleaning (\u201cUnless I\u2019m on my\nhands and knees cleaning with bleach and elbow grease, I\u2019m not satisfied\u201d)\nand people who wanted cleaning to be quick and convenient (\u201cI\u2019m too busy\nto clean\u2014as long as it looks good enough, I\u2019m happy\u201d).\n\nUsing this information, we combined these characteristics with other\ndata like household income, family statistics, and hobbies to create a profile\nof a fictional person. Once the profile was developed, it became easier to\nuse the data we had to make decisions\u2014instead of relying on statistics to\nevaluate an idea, we could rely on our intuition by asking ourselves if\n\u201cWendy\u201d would like it.\n\nDon\u2019t just present data\u2014tell a story that helps people understand what\u2019s\nhappening and you\u2019ll find your analysis efforts more useful.\n",

This predisposition affects how we work on systems: Intervention\nBias makes us likely to introduce changes that aren\u2019t necessary in order to\nfeel in control of a situation.\n\nMany corporate policies have their roots in Intervention Bias. When\nsomething bad happens, it\u2019s tempting to \u201cfix\u201d the situation by installing\nadditional layers of limitations, reporting, and auditing. The result isn\u2019t an\nimprovement in Throughput or efficiency: it\u2019s an increase in Communication\nOverhead, waste, and unproductive bureaucracy.\n\nThe best way to correct for Intervention Bias is to examine what\nscientists call a \u201cnull hypothesis\u201d: examining what would happen if you did\nnothing or assumed the situation was an accident or error.\n\nImagine a company that allows its employees to purchase any book they\nwant or need, no questions asked. Books are inexpensive sources of high-\nquality information, so making it easy for employees to obtain them makes\nsense.\n\nAll is well until one employee abuses the privilege and orders hundreds\nof novels for personal enjoyment. What should be done?\n\nMany companies would respond by eliminating the policy and requiring\na manager\u2019s approval for all book purchases. But this change wouldn\u2019t fix\nthe situation, because it isn\u2019t a widespread issue. Instead, it would annoy or\nanger employees who use the benefit responsibly, waste time for everyone\nby increasing paperwork and bureaucracy, and reduce employee\nproductivity by increasing the amount of time it takes to find information\nthey can use to improve the business.\n\nThe correct response in this case is to do nothing. One employee made\nan irresponsible decision, so the situation can be handled with a single\ndiscussion, without a major change in policy. The damage is limited, and\nthere\u2019s no sense in penalizing everyone for a single person\u2019s poor judgment.\nIt is a Normal Accident, so overreaction is counterproductive.\n\nExamining the null hypothesis before intervening will help you avoid\nIntervention Bias and ensure you make the best possible decisions.\n",

Optimization\nrevolves around the systems and processes behind your Key Performance\nIndicators, which measure the critical elements of the system as a whole.\nImprove your KPIs and your system will perform better.\n\nMaximization focuses on the system\u2019s Throughput. If you want to earn\nmore money, create more units to sell, or serve more customers, you\u2019re\nOptimizing for Throughput. Making Changes to the system that increase\nThroughput means your system is performing better in a specific,\nmeasurable way.\n\nMinimization focuses on in-process inputs required for the system to\noperate. If you\u2019re trying to increase your Profit Margin, costs are one of the\nkey inputs. Minimize your costs and your margins will increase.\n\nBy definition, if you\u2019re trying to maximize or minimize more than one\nthing, you\u2019re not Optimizing\u2014you\u2019re making Trade-offs. Many people use\nthe term Optimization to mean \u201cmaking everything better,\u201d but that\ndefinition doesn\u2019t help you do anything.\n\nIn practical terms, trying to Optimize for many variables at once doesn\u2019t\nwork\u2014you need to be able to concentrate on a single variable for a while,\nso you can understand how the Changes you make affect the system as a\nwhole.

The term comes from computer\nprogramming\u2014programmers will spend hours rewriting a program that, if\nall goes well, does the same thing when they\u2019re finished. What\u2019s the point?\n\nThe primary benefit of Refactoring isn\u2019t improving the output\u2014it\u2019s\nmaking the system itself faster or more efficient. By rearranging the\nprocesses the system uses to produce the result, it\u2019s possible to make the\nprogram run faster or require fewer resources while operating.\n\nRefactoring starts by Deconstructing a process or system, followed by a\nsearch for patterns. What are the critical processes that must be done right\nin order to achieve the desired objective? Do those processes have to be\ncompleted in a certain order? What are the current Constraints? What\nappears to be particularly important?

After collecting and analyzing a great deal of data,\nPareto found a curious pattern: over 80 percent of the land in Italy was\nowned by less than 20 percent of the population. The Italian economy\nwasn\u2019t distributed evenly, or in the bell curve\u2014shaped distribution many\npeople assumed: wealth was highly concentrated among a relatively small\ngroup of individuals.\n\nAs Pareto studied other areas of life, he found the same pattern: in\nPareto\u2019s garden, for example, 20 percent of the pea pods produced 80\npercent of the peas. What was going on?\n\nIn any complex system, a minority of the inputs produce the majority of\nthe output. This pattern of persistent nonlinearity is now called the Pareto\nprinciple, or the 80-20 rule. I prefer to call it the Critical Few.\n\nOnce you understand this common pattern, you\u2019!! find it in many areas\nof life:\n\n.\n\nIn many businesses, less than 20 percent of the customers account\nfor more than 80 percent of annual revenue.\n\nLess than 20 percent of a business\u2019s employees do 80 percent or\nmore of the most valuable work.\n\nYou wear less than 20 percent of the clothing in your closet over 80\npercent of the time.\n\nYou spend over 80 percent of your time communicating with less\nthan 20 percent of your personal contacts.\n\nThe nonlinearity of the Critical Few can often be extreme. For example,\nless than 3 percent of the world\u2019s population is in possession of over 97\npercent of the world\u2019s total wealth. Over time, political power (in both\n\ncountries and companies) also tends to concentrate in the hands of a few\npeople, which results in a very small group of individuals making decisions\nthat affect the lives of hundreds of millions of people. Far less than 1\npercent of movies ever produced become blockbusters, and less than 0.1\npercent of books ever written become bestsellers.\n\nFor best results, focus on the critical inputs that produce most of the\nresults you want. In The 4-Hour Workweek, Timothy Ferriss explains how\nhe used the Critical Few to identify his best customers. Out of the 120\ncustomers Ferriss was serving, 5 accounted for 95 percent of the business\u2019s\nrevenue. By focusing on those top-performing wholesalers and putting the\nrest of his customers on \u201cautopilot,\u201d Ferriss doubled his monthly revenue\nand cut his work time from eighty hours to fifteen hours a week.\n\nThe same approach is often useful to weed out results you don\u2019t want.\nWhile conducting his business analysis, Ferriss realized that two particular\ncustomers accounted for most of his frustration and stress. \u201cFiring\u201d these\nenergy-sucking customers, even though they represented significant sources\nof volume, liberated his time and energy. As a result, he was able to secure\ndistribution with three additional high-volume customers that boosted the\nbottom line without the constant headaches.\n\nNoncritical inputs are significant Opportunity Costs. If you\u2019re spending\nmost of your time in unproductive meetings, for example, you\u2019re wasting\ntime that could be used to get important things done. The same goes for\nnoncritical expenses: they represent money that you could be using to far\ngreater effect.\n\nFind the inputs that produce the outputs you want, then make them the\nfocus of most of your time and energy. Eliminate the rest.\n",

The most effective (and lowest-risk) strategy is to start with a\nsmall but manageable challenge, work at that level until it becomes easy,\nand increase the level of challenge over time as your body adapts.\n\nThe term for this strategy is Progressive Load: increasing the amount of\ntotal capacity in a system by gradually increasing demand on the system,\nprompting the system to Change to adapt to the new demands over time.\n\nProgressive Load is a universal approach that works in areas well\nbeyond fitness. Businesses are often tempted to solve problems by hiring\nadditional employees, particularly in areas like sales and customer support,\nbut it takes time and training for new employees to reach their maximum\neffectiveness. Instead of increasing capacity, hiring too fast can cause new\nproblems instead of solving them.\n\nUntrained salespeople have a higher risk of making promises the\nbusiness can\u2019t deliver on, and untrained customer-support staff aren\u2019t well\nequipped to handle frustrated customers, communicate company policies,\nand make exceptions to those policies when the situation warrants it.\nEffective training requires instruction, communication, and oversight from\nmanagers or experienced staff, increasing demands on current staff. That\ninvestment often pays off in the medium- to long term, but at the cost of\nstress in the short term. Adding too much stress can lead current employees\nto look for other options, and the loss of key employees can result in the\nloss of important experience and capacity.\n\nThe most effective way to add capacity is to add small amounts in a\nconsistent way over time, which increases capacity without adding demands\nthat are beyond the system\u2019s current ability to handle. Instead of hiring\nseveral new employees to a team at once, adding an additional employee a\nfew times per year is often a better approach.\n\nConsistent improvements Accumulate into large improvements.

WILLARD, EDUCATOR AND SUFFRAGIST WHO SPEARHEADED THE CAMPAIGN 10 ADOPT\nTHE EIGHTEENTH AND NINETEENTH AMENDMENTS TO THE US CONSTITUTION\n\nmagine a hockey puck on the ground in front of you. You\u2019re armed with a\nhockey stick, and the objective is to move the puck from its present location\nto the goal, which is located one mile away.\n\nFirst, assume the puck is sitting in a field of tall grass, which is waving\nin the wind. Each whack of the hockey stick will move the puck only a few\nfeet, since the tall grass robs the puck of energy. At this rate, you\u2019ll have to\nhit the puck thousands of times before you get to the goal, and you\u2019ll\nexhaust your energy quickly. It\u2019ll take you many frustrating hours to reach\nthe goal.\n\nNow let\u2019s assume you mow the field until the grass in front of you is\nvery short. Each time you hit the puck, it goes twenty feet or more\u2014a huge\nimprovement. The puck comes in contact with less grass, which means that\nit travels a longer distance with every strike. You\u2019ll still have to work to get\nthe puck to the goal, but you\u2019!l achieve your objective faster and with less\neffort.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s assume you flood the field with water and freeze it, until\nthe landscape is a smooth plane of ice. Now the puck will travel hundreds\nof feet every time you hit it, because the ice doesn\u2019t rob the puck of energy\n\u2014the puck glides along the surface. At this rate, you\u2019ll only need to hit the\npuck a few times before you\u2019ve achieved the objective, and you won\u2019t be\ntired when you\u2019re done.\n\nFriction is any force or process that removes energy from a system over\ntime. In the presence of Friction, it\u2019s necessary to continue to add energy to\na system to keep it moving at the same rate over time. Unless additional\nenergy is added, Friction will slow the system down until it comes to a stop.\nRemove the Friction and you\u2019ll increase the system\u2019s efficiency.\n\nEvery business process has some amount of Friction. The key is to\nidentify areas where Friction currently exists, then experiment with small\nimprovements that will reduce the amount of Friction in the system.\n\nRemoving small amounts of Friction over time Accumulates into large\nimprovements in both quality and efficiency.\n\nRemoving even small amounts of Friction from your marketing, sales,\nand value-delivery processes can generate major improvements in Profit. For\nexample, retailers like Amazon go to enormous lengths to minimize the\namount of effort it takes for a customer to place an order. From allowing\ncustomers to purchase items with a single click (which charges and ships\nthe order to the customer\u2019s default credit card and address on file) to\nrecommending related items for purchase, Amazon aims to make it as easy\nas possible for its customers to buy online.\n\nAmazon Prime, a service that upgrades every order a customer places to\ntwo-day shipping, is a textbook example of the benefits of reducing\nFriction.

All the human operators have to do is\npush a button, and the production system starts cranking out 2,400 finished\nproducts per minute. Life is good, right?\n\nYes, with a very important caveat. Imagine that a drill used to bore holes\nin the silicon wafer becomes misaligned and starts drilling microscopic\n\nholes through the middle of the processor core. Every second the system\nkeeps working, forty chips are ruined.\n\nAssume each processor costs $20 in raw materials\u2014that means the\nfactory starts losing $800 every second the error isn\u2019t found. Every minute\nthe system keeps running, the company loses $48,000. And that\u2019s just the\ndirect cost. If you take into account that each processor would sell for $200,\nthe company is losing $528,000 a minute: $48,000 in direct costs and\n$480,000 in Opportunity Costs.\n\nSound farfetched? Consider this: In late 2009, Toyota identified a major\nissue with the accelerator pedal in several popular vehicle models, which\nwere top sellers for many years. The error was Multiplied across every\nvehicle Toyota made, and the recall cost more than $5 billion.\n\nBefore the recall, Toyota was considered the best automotive\nmanufacturer in the world. They still are in many respects, but their\nReputation and financial situation suffered a major blow. Even the best can\nfall if costly mistakes are allowed to Multiply.\n\nHere\u2019s the Paradox of Automation: the more efficient the Automated\nsystem, the more crucial the contribution of the human operators of that\nsystem. When an error happens, operators need to identify and fix the\nsituation or shut the system down\u2014otherwise, the Automated system will\ncontinue to Multiply the error.\n\nDr. Lisanne Bainbridge, a psychologist at University College London,\nwas one of the first to rigorously study the ramifications of efficient and\nreliable systems.? She was the first to identify and express the \u201cparadox\u201d of\nAutomated systems: efficient Automated systems reduce the need for\nhuman effort but make human involvement even more critical.\n\nEfficient Automation makes humans more important, not less.\n",

Even if they\ndo, the operators will spend most of their time being bored out of their\nskulls.\n\nHere\u2019s the irony of Automation: the more reliable the system, the less\nhuman operators have to do, so the less they pay Attention to the system\nwhile it\u2019s in operation. Remember the Mackworth Clock and the vigilance\nstudies conducted on British radar operators in World War II from our\ndiscussion of Novelty? Humans get bored if things stay the same, and the\nmore reliable the system, the more things stay the same.\n\nReliable systems tend to dull the operator\u2019s senses, making it very\ndifficult for them to notice when things go wrong\u2014the moment when their\nAttention is required. As a result, the more reliable the system, the lower\nthe likelihood that human operators will notice when something goes wrong\n\u2014Particularly if the error is small.\n\nLeft long enough, small errors can become the \u201cnew normal,\u201d which is\nhow a company like Toyota ends up with a $5 billion recall.

Remember, Normal Accidents can and will\noccur. If you assume that errors will be made and plan a battery of tests to\nfind the most critical errors, you can keep your system operators engaged\nand increase the probability of finding important errors quickly.\n\nKeep your Automated system\u2019s operators mentally engaged, and they\u2019 ll\nbe far more likely to notice when errors occur.\n",

COAUTHOR OF FREAKONOMICS\n\nW ant to make sure an important task is done correctly every single time?\nCreate a checklist.\n\nA Checklist is an Externalized, predefined Standard Operating Procedure for\ncompleting a specific task. Creating a Checklist is enormously valuable for\ntwo reasons. First, Checklisting will help you define a system for a process\nthat hasn\u2019t yet been formalized\u2014once the Checklist has been created, it\u2019s\neasier to see how to improve or Automate the system. Second, using\nChecklists as a normal part of working can help ensure that you don\u2019t forget\nto handle important steps that may be overlooked when things get busy.\n\nPilots have detailed Checklists for takeoff and landing for a reason:\nskipping a step is easy but can have major consequences for everyone on\nboard. Even pilots with decades of flying experience always use Checklists\nto make sure everything is done right and in the proper sequence. As a\nresult, plane crashes are rare\u2014it\u2019s safer to travel via a commercial airline\nthan it is to drive.\n\nEven simple processes can benefit from Systemization and the use of\nChecklists. In 2001, Dr. Peter Pronovost conducted a study on the effects of\nChecklisting, which was described in detail in Dr. Atul Gawande\u2019s The\nChecklist Manifesto and in an article Gawande published in the New\nYorker.* The study was conducted in a hospital in Detroit that had the\nhighest rate of ten-day IV line infections (a costly and life-threatening\ncondition) in the country. Pronovost\u2019s objective was to determine whether\nor not using Checklists would reduce the rate of infections.\n\nHere\u2019s the entirety of the intervention: whenever a doctor inserted an IV\nline, they were instructed to use the following Checklist.\n\nStep 1: Wash hands with soap.\n\nStep 2: Clean the patient\u2019s skin with chlorhexidine antiseptic.\n\nStep 3: Put sterile drapes over the entire patient.\n\nStep 4: Wear a sterile hat, mask, gloves, and gown.\n\nStep 5: Put a sterile dressing over the catheter site once the IV line is\nin.\n\nThese steps aren\u2019t complicated. In fact, many doctors resisted the study,\nsince they felt that being forced to use a Checklist for such a simple\nprocedure was insulting, given their status as highly trained specialists.\nEven more insulting, the head nurse was empowered to stop the doctor if\nthey weren\u2019t using the Checklist\u2014an unusual role reversal that had many\ndoctors fuming.\n\nNevertheless, the results of this study over two years were astounding:\nthe ten-day IV line infection rate dropped from 11 percent to 0 percent and\nsaved the hospital more than $2 million in related costs. As it turns out,\nforgetting even basic, commonsense procedures is easy in a busy, stressful\nEnvironment.\n\nChecklisting can produce major improvements in your ability to do\nquality work, as well as your ability to delegate work. By taking the time to\ndescribe and track your progress, you reduce the likelihood of major errors\nand oversights and prevent Friction associated with figuring out how to\ncomplete the same task over and over again. In addition, once your\nChecklist is complete you can use it as the basis for full or partial\nAutomation of the system, which will allow you to spend time doing more\nimportant things.\n\nFor best results, create explicit Checklists for the Five Parts of Every\nBusiness, then make sure they\u2019re followed every single time.\n",

When the corrective actions\n\nappear to be successful, they come to view these measures as splendid\naccomplishments. People do this over and over again.

HOLLING, ECOLOGIST\n\nT sates aren\u2019t the sexiest creatures in the animal kingdom. They can\u2019t run\nfast. They can\u2019t fly. They don\u2019t have big, sharp teeth or claws. They can\u2019t\npuff themselves up to look menacing or poison their enemies with deadly\nvenom. Compared to the raw power of a tiger or a falcon, turtles are rather\n\nlame.\n\nWhat turtles do have is a variety of protective strategies\u2014they can\nswim, use camouflage, snap with their jaws, and, if all else fails, retract into\ntheir shell and wait for the threat to pass.\n\nCreatures elsewhere in the animal kingdom are in big trouble if they\u2019re\ncornered by a predator. Turtles have a fighting chance\u2014they win because\nthey\u2019re the armored tanks of nature. They can also eat many different things\nand go into hibernation when times get tough. That\u2019s why they live so long.\n\nTigers, on the other hand, rely on their strength, power, and speed to\nchase down their prey. When times are good, tigers are the kings of the\njungle. If prey becomes scarce or they lose their hunting prowess due to age\nor injury, death takes them without mercy\u2014no second chances.\n\nWhat the business world needs is more turtles and fewer tigers.\n\nThe world is a fundamentally Uncertain place. Unexpected things happen\n\u2014some good, some bad. You never know when Mother Nature, Lady Luck,\nor a hungry predator will decide that today is not your day.\n\nResilience is an underrated quality in business. Having the toughness and\nflexibility to handle anything life throws at you is a major asset that can\nsave your skin\u2014literally and metaphorically. Your ability to adjust your\nstrategy and tactics as conditions Change can be the difference between\nsurvival and disaster.\n\nResilience is never \u201coptimal\u201d if you evaluate a system solely on\nThroughput. Flexibility always comes at a price. A turtle\u2019s shell is heavy\u2014it\ncould move faster without it. Giving it up, however, would leave the turtle\nvulnerable in the moments when moving a little faster just isn\u2019t fast enough.\nIn an effort to chase a few more dollars, many businesses trade Resilience\nfor short-term results\u2014and pay a hefty price.\n\nThe big investment banks are a classic example. Keeping cash reserves\non hand to handle the unexpected has become \u201cultraconservative\u201d and\n\u201cinefficient\u201d\u2014 it\u2019s become a \u201cbest practice\u201d to Leverage the entire company\nmany times over times to squeeze out a few more cents in earnings per\nshare each quarter, leaving the business vulnerable to a very small decline\nin revenues.\n\nOperating a business with no cash reserves, no insurance, and high\nlevels of debt may improve your returns for a few months or quarters, but\nthe moment your revenues decline even by a little or someone decides to\nsue the business, you\u2019re sunk.\n\nLeverage works just like rocket fuel\u2014depending on how it\u2019s used, it can\npropel your business to dizzying heights or make the entire operation\nexplode. Many of the advanced financial manipulation tactics taught in\nbusiness schools implicitly trade Resilience for on-paper returns\u2014and\nonce-successful businesses pay the price by going out of business when\ntimes get tough.\n\nPreparing for the unexpected makes you more Resilient. On a personal\nlevel, investing in a home emergency/first aid kit, car kit, and extra\nresources like food and water isn\u2019t paranoid\u2014supplies like these are cheap\ninsurance for the intelligent. The same goes for purchasing Insurance and\nbuilding up cash reserves for unexpected events. You may never need them,\nbut you\u2019 ll be glad they\u2019re there if you do.\n\nHERE'S WHAT MAKES A BUSINESS RESILIENT:\n\u00a9 Low (preferably zero) outstanding debt\n\u00a9 Low overhead, fixed costs, and operating expenses\n\u00a9 Substantial cash reserves for unexpected contingencies\n\n\u00b0\n\nMultiple independent products/industries/lines of business\n\n\u00b0\n\nFlexible workers/employees who can handle many\nresponsibilities well\n\n\u00a9 No single points of failure\n\u00a9 Fail-safes/backup systems for all core processes\n\nPlanning for Resilience as well as performance is the hallmark of good\nmanagement. Resilience is not sexy, because the benefits suffer from\nAbsence Blindness. It can, however, save your hide when times get tough.\n\nThink less like a tiger and more like a turtle and your business will be\nable to withstand pretty much anything.\n",

If all goes well, it\u2019ll run for ten minutes, then turn off until the\nnext testing cycle, ready to spring into action if the power goes out.\n\nMy father once worked as a firefighter and emergency medical\ntechnician, and has refined \u201cbeing prepared\u201d into a high art. The generator\nis designed to turn on the moment the primary electricity to the house fails,\ntaking over the house\u2019s electrical demands in seconds if an outage occurs.\nThe generator is fed via a propane tank behind the garage, which has\nenough fuel to keep the generator running for a week. If a storm knocks out\npower to the area, Dad is prepared to handle it.\n\nDad\u2019s preparedness rubbed off on me. Now that we live in the mountains\nof Colorado, we have to be prepared for the possibility of our car breaking\ndown somewhere remote or cold and we can\u2019t rely on AAA (or cell phone\ncoverage) to save us.\n\nKelsey often makes fun of me for stocking our vehicles with extra\nclothing, sleeping bags, snowshoes, and satellite-driven personal locator\nbeacons, but I don\u2019t mind. If something happens, we\u2019ll be glad we were\nprepared\u2014I consider the investment in equipment a cheap, durable\nInsurance policy.\n\nA Fail-safe is a backup system designed to prevent or allow recovery\nfrom a primary system failure. If the primary system fails in some way,\nwell-designed Fail-safes can keep the system from collapsing unexpectedly.\nYou can find backup systems anywhere consistent performance is critical.\n\nActors in high-profile Broadway shows have understudies. If \u201cthe show\nmust go on,\u201d it pays to know you\u2019ll always have a replacement for any actor\nwho can\u2019t perform. Most shows even have a few \u201cswing\u201d actors\u2014\nperformers who are ready to play any role at a moment\u2019s notice.\n\nExternal hard drives back up critical computer data. If the hard drive in\nyour computer crashes, you can still access the data via the backup drive, so\nyou won\u2019t lose everything. Some businesses even take the precaution of\nstoring backup drives off-site in case of fire or natural disaster.\n\nAirplanes have a system that senses a failure in cabin pressure, which\ndeploys face masks attached to an oxygen tank. If the airplane\u2019s pressurized\ncabin fails for some reason, the passengers won\u2019t lose consciousness\u2014a\nvery good thing indeed.\n\nFail-safes are not efficient, in the sense that you\u2019re investing time and\nresources in a system you hope you\u2019ll never use. Backup systems and\n\nInsurance, from one perspective, can be seen as a waste of money\u2014why\nspend valuable resources on something you hope you\u2019!l never need?\n\nHere\u2019s why: by the time you need a Fail-safe, it\u2019s too late to develop\none. In order to be effective, Fail-safes must be developed before you need\nthem. If you wait to develop backup systems until you need them, it\u2019s too\nlate to make a difference. Paying for homeowners\u2019 insurance can feel like a\nwaste of money until your house burns down. If you wait to buy Insurance\nuntil something bad happens, it\u2019s already too late.\n\nTry to separate your Fail-safe and primary system as much as possible.\nOne of the reasons people rent safe deposit boxes in banks is to protect\ncertain items from loss in the event of fire or theft\u2014if something happens to\nthe house, the items in the safe deposit box will still be okay. The practice\nof backing up data to an off-site data center serves the same purpose: if\nsomething happens to the business\u2019s primary computers, the data is still safe\nin another location.\n\nFail-safes that are highly interdependent with the primary system can\nintroduce additional risks. One of the worst things you can do is make your\nbackup system a part of the system you\u2019re trying to protect. For example, it\nwouldn\u2019t do my father much good if a failure in the generator cascaded to\nthe house\u2019s primary electrical system and knocked out the power. An\nAutomated computer backup system doesn\u2019t do you any good if installing it\nrisks deleting all of your original files.\n\nAs much as possible, never have a single critical point of failure. If your\nsystem relies on critical inputs or processes in order to function, it\u2019s a good\nidea to plan for situations where those inputs aren\u2019t available or those\nprocesses are disrupted. What would you do if the primary system failed?\n\nPlan in advance to develop Fail-safes for all critical systems, and you\u2019ll\n\nmaka wnur cuctam 2c BDeciliant 2c UN] Fan\n",

That\u2019s a problem when\nyour plans and Goals depend on things outside of your Locus of Control. What\ncan you do to prepare for an Uncertain future?\n\nScenario Planning is the process of systematically constructing a series of\nhypothetical situations, then creating a Mental Simulation of what you would\ndo if they occurred. You may not be a seer, but Thought Experiments give you\na powerful capability: imagining things that might occur, then figuring out\nwhat you\u2019d do if they did. Scenario Planning is detailed, thorough, and\nsystematic Thought Experiments applied to major decisions.\n\nScenario Planning always starts with a simple question: \u201cWhat would I\ndo if... ?\u201d The \u201cwhat if\u201d part is called a \u201ccounterfactual,\u201d and it\u2019s what\nkicks your planning brain into gear, helping you imagine possible\nresponses. By writing down all of your potential courses of action in that\ncircumstance, it\u2019s possible to develop several responses to any situation you\ncan imagine.\n\nScenario Planning is the essence of effective strategy. Trying to base\nyour actions on predictions of interest rates, oil prices, or stock values is a\nfool\u2019s game. Instead of trying to predict the future with 100 percent\naccuracy, Scenario Planning can help you prepare for many different\npossible futures. Instead of rigidly focusing on only one option, your\nbusiness will become more flexible and Resilient, improving your ability to\nChange and adapt to a changing world.\n\nMost large businesses use Scenario Planning as the basis of a practice\ncalled \u201chedging\u201d: purchasing various forms of insurance to reduce the risk\nof unfavorable future events. For example, manufacturers care about oil\nprices because they increase the cost of importing raw materials and\nshipping finished products to their customers, both of which decrease their\nProfit Margins. By purchasing financial instruments called \u201cfutures,\u201d the\nbusinesses can make money if the price of oil goes up, which helps to offset\nthe losses they would incur in their primary line of business if oil prices\nincrease.\n\nScenario Planning is easy to skip, particularly if you already have a lot\nof work to do. The time you spend in Scenario Planning can be some of the\n\nmost valuable time you spend building your business, but it\u2019s easy to\noverlook if you\u2019re struggling to keep your head above water. Regular,\nnonnegotiable time to step back and plan for the future is always time well\nspent\u2014don\u2019t skip it.\n\nDon\u2019t waste time trying to predict an unknowable future\u2014construct the\nmost likely scenarios and plan what you\u2019ll do if they occur and you\u2019ll likely\nbe prepared for whatever happens.\n",

PEIRCE, NINETEENTH-CENTURY PHILOSOPHER AND MATHEMATICIAN\n\nF iguring out which changes or investments will give you the best\noutcomes is a major area of study in probability theory, which is best\nillustrated through the \u201cmulti-armed bandit\u201d problem.\n\nImagine walking into a casino to play the slot machines\u2014\u201cone-armed\nbandits.\u201d There\u2019s a row of machines, each of which has a different\nprobability of paying a reward when you pull the lever. Some machines pay\nmore\u2014some much more\u2014than the others, but you\u2019re not sure which\nmachine has the highest return.\u00ae\n\nIf you knew the best machine in advance, you\u2019d just pull that lever all\nthe time, but you don\u2019t know which lever is best, and no one is going to tell\nyou. The only way to discover the best lever is to start pulling levers at\nrandom, keep track of what works and what doesn\u2019t, and analyze the\nresults.\n\nThere\u2019s an important Trade-off inherent in this approach: when you\nchoose to pull a lever you haven\u2019t pulled before, you get new information\nabout that particular option, and that information is valuable in finding the\nbest overall machine. Pulling the less tested lever, however, has an\nOpportunity Cost: you\u2019re not pulling the lever you currently think will give\nyou the best return. There\u2019s a risk that the lever you pull will return less\nthan what you would\u2019ve brought in pulling the current optimal lever, and\nthat\u2019s a very real cost.\n\nInformation is valuable, but it comes at a price: experimentation is\nsometimes a form of Malinvestment. That insight is the key to solving the\nbandit problem.\n\nWithout going into the math, the solution to the bandit problem is easy\nto understand: the optimal strategy is to start with a period of Exploration,\nwhere you pull levers at random and gather information. Once you have\nmore information about what works and what doesn\u2019t, you shift to spending\nthe majority of your time pulling the best lever you\u2019ve discovered so far\n(Exploitation), but you keep exploring the other options in case your current\nbest option isn\u2019t the very best that exists.\n\nIt\u2019s important to emphasize the last part of the optimal strategy: the\nExploration phase never stops. Even if you\u2019re certain you\u2019ve found the best\npossible option, you never stop experimenting because the information you\ngather by experimenting is always valuable. The only way to beat the bandit\nis to keep trying new things.\n\nIn real-world circumstances, you have a major advantage over the\nsituation in this Thought Experiment: other people are playing the same game,\nand you can watch what they do to gather information about what works\nand what doesn\u2019t without having to try same approach. Learning from the\nactions of others\u2014and observing their results\u2014is an efficient way to gather\nuseful information.\n\nExtending this approach to day-to-day decisions is straightforward:\nexperiment as much as possible, with as much variation as you can, and pay\nclose attention to the experiments other people are doing.

Systems tend\nto have a natural size, and exceeding this size can cause many problems.\nElements of a system that are out of control need to be eliminated.\n\nTake cell growth, for example. The cells in your body tend to grow to a\ncertain size and to multiply at a rate that ensures new cells replace cells that\ndie. When these proportions are in balance, your body works quite well.\nWhen cells grow or multiply out of control, the situation can threaten the\nexistence of the entire system. Cancerous cells need to be removed to\nensure the health of the body.\n\nBusinesses and biological organisms have many things in common:\nthey\u2019re made up of many interrelated parts and systems that change and\ngrow over time. If the Five Parts of Every Business grow out of control or out\nof proportion to one another, the situation can threaten the health of the\norganization.\n\nThe Sustainable Growth Cycle is a pattern I\u2019ve noticed in businesses that\nare able to grow year after year without major difficulties. This cycle has\nthree distinct phases: expansion, maintenance, and consolidation.\n\nIn an expansion phase, the company is focused on growing. New offers\nare created and tested. New markets are explored. New business units are\nbuilt and staffed, and future plans are created. Early data about what works\nis collected for later use.\n\nIn a maintenance phase, the company is focused on executing the\ncurrent plan. The marketing, sales, and value-delivery parts of the business\nare in full swing, and emphasis is placed on fully exploring the potential of\nthe current business structure. Systems are put in place to ensure proper\nexecution.\n\nIn a consolidation phase, the company is focused on analysis.\nInformation about the performance of the business is examined in detail in\nan attempt to figure out what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not. Things that aren\u2019t\nworking are cut back or eliminated, and things that are working are given\nmore resources.\n\nThink of plant cultivation: the best gardeners allow plants to grow,\nensure they have enough resources to thrive, then cut back the plants that\n\ndon\u2019t. This cycle repeats, season after season. Every cycle is essential.\n\nMany entrepreneurs become frustrated when their business seems to hit\na \u201cplateau\u201d and growth appears to stop. Spending time on maintenance or\nconsolidation seems like a waste, or a flaw in the business idea. That\u2019s not\nthe case at all: these phases are necessary to ensure the business succeeds,\nand they should be respected.\n\nA business that fixates on expansion but shortchanges maintenance and\nconsolidation will experience the commercial equivalent of cancerous\ngrowth. Parts of the business will grow out of control, consuming too much\ntime, energy, and resources compared to what they contribute to the health\nof the business. New opportunities will be explored while proven\nopportunities are ignored or forgotten.\n\nMaintenance and consolidation are necessary to bring the system into\nbalance. Once the system is humming along, the growth cycle tends to kick\nin, and the process repeats.\n\nA healthy business cycles among expansion, maintenance, and\nconsolidation often. No matter which part of the cycle you\u2019re in, it\u2019s\nimportant to recognize that it\u2019s necessary and essential to the health of the\nbusiness. By giving each cycle the appropriate time and attention, you\u2019 ll\nensure the long-term success of the business.\n",
