ICE MELT IN WEST ANTARCTICA\nWhy in the News?\n\nAccelerated ice melt was noticed in West Antarctica through various studies and computer simulations.\nMore on the news\n\n* West Antarctic ice sheet, if completely lost, could contribute to sea level rise of up to 5 meters.\n\n* Ocean-driven melting of floating ice shelves in the Amundsen Sea is the main process contributing to sea-\nlevel rise.\no The Amundsen Sea is located off the coast of West Antarctica.\n\nSequence of ice melt- Anta rctica\n\n* Melting causes the retreat of the grounding line (i.e.\nthe line where the ice first goes afloat).\n\n* It reduces the resistance to ice flowing across the\ngrounding line.\n\n\u00ab Faster flow near the grounding line causes more\nhorizontal stretching leading to thinning.\n\n* It creates steeper surface slopes which increases\nthe stress that drives the ice forward,\n\n* The faster flow inland causes thinning to propagate\neven further into the interior of the ice sheet,\nincreasing the contribution to sea level rise.\n\nGlobal efforts to safeguard Antarctica\n\n\u00ab Antarctic Treaty, signed in 1959, with the objectives to\ndemilitarize Antarctica, promote international scientific cooperation etc. (India is a member).\n\n* Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals, 1972\n\n* Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, 1982 (ratified by India)\n\n* Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (Madrid Protocol), 1991 (signed by India)\n\nIndia\n\n\u00ab Indian Antarctic program, which began in 1981, built three research base stations in Antarctica, named\nDakshin Gangotri (1983), Maitri (1988) and Bharati (2012).\n\no Asof today, Maitri and Bharati are fully operational.\n\n* The Antarctic Act, 2022: Enacted by India to give effect to Antarctic Treaty, Convention on the\nConservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, and Protocol on Environmental Protection to the\nAntarctic Treaty and for matters connected.\n\no Key provisions: Establishment of Committee on Antarctic Governance and Environmental\nProtection; Permit system; Constitution of Antarctic fund; Stringent penalties; Designated court to\ntry punishable offences etc.\n\n1.1.2.2. ARCTIC AMPLIFICATION\n\nWhy in the News?\n\nWorld Metrological Organisation (WMO) study highlighted that Arctic has warmed twice as much as world\naverage.\n\nAbout Artic Amplification\n\n\u00ab Refers to warming differential between the poles and the tropics.\n\u00ab As per some other studies, Arctic has warmed nearly 4 times faster than the rest of the world over 1979-\n2021.\n\n\u00ab Reasons for faster warming of Arctic region\no Polar amplification is much stronger in the Arctic than in Antarctica as it is an ocean covered by sea\nice, while Antarctica is an elevated continent with permanent ice and snow.\no Melting of the ice cover in the Arctic exposes more land/water to the Sun, leading to more absorption\nof sunlight.\no Prevailing systems of air circulations transfer heat from the tropics to the poles.\n\u00ab Summer Arctic sea ice extent is shrinking by 12.6% per decade as a result of global warming.\n\n* Importance of Arctic seaice Po\nArctic Amplification \u201c4\n\nThe dynamics of global warming\n\no Role in keeping polar\n\nregions cool and\nmaintaining earth\u2019s\nenergy balance.\n\no Keeps the air cool by\nforming a barrier between\ncold air above and\nrelatively warmer water\nbelow.\n\no Changes in sea ice can\naffect biodiversity and\nimpact mammals such as\n\nMore aerosol\npolar bears and walruses. particles in the\no Affects traditional \u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nsubsistence hunting\nlifestyle of indigenous populations such as Yup\u2019ik, Ifupiat, and Inuit.\n* Reduced ice can open up shipping lanes and increase access to natural resources in Arctic region.\n\nRelated concept: Blue Ocean event\n\n* Refers to a situation in which the Arctic Ocean\u2019s ice area drops below 1 Million Sq.Km leading to the\nchange of arctic surface colour from white to blue.\n\n* Process reduces the amount of sunlight reflected into space, leading to further warming and ice loss.\n\n1.2.
