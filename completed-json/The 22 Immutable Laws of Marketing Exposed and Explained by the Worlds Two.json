                    "extracted-text": "Billions of dollars have been wasted on marketing programs that couldn\u2019t\npossibly work, no matter how clever or brilliant. Or how big the budgets.\n\nMany managers assume that a well-designed, well-executed, well-\nfinanced marketing program will work. It\u2019s not necessarily so. And you\ndon\u2019t have to look further than IBM, General Motors, and Sears, Roebuck\nto find examples.\n\nThe tools and techniques used at Sears, Roebuck might have been right,\nsometimes even spectacular. And the managers who ran the GM programs\nmight have been the best and the brightest. Certainly the best and the\nbrightest people traditionally have been attracted to the biggest and the best\ncompanies, like GM and IBM. But the programs themselves were based on\nassumptions that were flawed.\n\nJohn Kenneth Galbraith, when asked what he believed was America\u2019s\nperception of the country\u2019s giant corporations, said that we feared corporate\npower. Today, we fear corporate incompetence!\n\nAll companies are in trouble. Especially big companies. General Motors\nis a good example. Over the past decade the company paid a terrible price\nfor destroying the identity of its brands. (It priced them alike as well as\nmade them look alike.) Ten share points evaporated, which translates into\nabout $10 billion a year in sales.\n\nGM\u2019S problem wasn\u2019t a competitive problem, although competition did\nincrease. It wasn\u2019t a quality problem either, although GM obviously wasn\u2019t\ndelivering top-notch quality. It was very definitely a marketing problem.\n\nWhen a company makes a mistake today, footprints quickly show up on\nits back as competition runs off with its business. To get the business back,\nthe company has to wait for others to make mistakes and then figure out\nhow to exploit the situation.\n\nSo how do you avoid making mistakes in the first place? The easy\nanswer is to make sure your programs are in tune with the laws of\nmarketing. (Although we have defined our ideas and concepts under the\n\u201cmarketing\u201d banner, they are useful no matter where you are in a company,\nand no matter what product or service your company is selling.)\n\nWhat are these marketing laws? And who brought them down from\nMount Sinai on a set of stone tablets?\n\nThe fundamental laws of marketing are those described in this book.\n\nBut who says so? How come two guys from Connecticut have discovered\nwhat thousands of others have overlooked? There are, after all, many\nsophisticated marketing practitioners and academics. Why have they missed\nwhat we think is so obvious?\n\nThe answer is simple. As far as we can tell, almost no one is willing to\nadmit that there are any laws of marketing\u2014certainly none that are\nimmutable.\n\nThere are laws of nature, so why shouldn\u2019t there be laws of marketing?\nYou can build a great-looking airplane, but it\u2019s not going to get off the\nground unless it adheres to the laws of physics, especially the law of\ngravity. You can build an architectural masterpiece on a sand dune, but the\nfirst hurricane will undermine your creation. So it follows that you can\nbuild a brilliant marketing program only to have one of the immutable laws\nknock you flat if you don\u2019t know what they are.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s human nature not to admit there are things you can\u2019t do.\nCertainly most marketers believe that anything is achievable if you are\nenergetic enough, or creative enough, or determined enough. Especially if\nyou are willing to spend enough money.\n\nOnce you open your mind to the possibility that there are laws of\nmarketing, it\u2019s easy to see what they are. In truth, they are obvious.\n\nWe have been studying what works in marketing and what doesn\u2019t for\nmore than 25 years. What we have found is that programs that work are\nalmost always in tune with some fundamental force in the marketplace.\n\nIn our books, articles, speeches, and videos we have analyzed marketing\nprinciples in some detail. We have developed strategic models of the\nmarketing process, including a physical model of the human mind, which\nwe helped popularize under the concept of \u201cpositioning.\u201d We also\ndeveloped a military model of the marketplace, which assigns companies\n\nand brands to either defensive, offensive, flanking, or guerrilla modes of\nmarketing warfare.\n\nAfter years of working on marketing principles and problems, we have\ndistilled our findings into the basic laws that govern success and failure in\nthe marketplace.\n\nWe call these principles the Immutable Laws of Marketing, and there are\n22 of them. Violate them at your own risk.\n",

                    "extracted-text": "Many people believe that the basic issue in marketing is convincing\nprospects that you have a better product or service.\n\nNot true. If you have a small market share and you have to do battle with\nlarger, better-financed competitors, then your marketing strategy was\nprobably faulty in the first place. You violated the first law of marketing.\n\nThe basic issue in marketing is creating a category you can be first in. It\u2019s\nthe law of leadership: It\u2019s better to be first than it is to be better. It\u2019s much\neasier to get into the mind first than to try to convince someone you have a\nbetter product than the one that did get there first.\n\nYou can demonstrate the law of leadership by asking yourself two\nquestions:\n\n1) What\u2019s the name of the first person to fly the Atlantic Ocean solo?\nCharles Lindbergh, right?\n\n2) What\u2019s the name of the second person to fly the Atlantic Ocean solo? Not\nso easy to answer, is it?\n\nThe second person to fly the Atlantic Ocean solo was Bert Hinkler. Bert\nwas a better pilot than Charlie\u2014he flew faster, he consumed less fuel. Yet\nwho has ever heard of Bert Hinkler? (He left home and Mrs. Hinkler hasn\u2019t\nheard from him since.)\n\nIn spite of the evident superiority of the Lindbergh approach, most\ncompanies go the Bert Hinkler route. They wait until a market develops.\nThen they jump in with a better product, often with their corporate name\nattached. In today\u2019s competitive environment, a me-too product with a line\nextension name has little hope of becoming a big, profitable brand (chapter\n12: The Law of Line Extension).\n\nThe leading brand in any category is almost always the first brand into\nthe prospect\u2019s mind. Hertz in rent-a-cars. IBM in computers. Coca-Cola in\ncola.\n\nAfter World War II, Heineken was the first imported beer to make a name\nfor itself in America. So four decades later, what is the No. 1 imported\nbeer? The one that tastes the best? Or Heineken? There are 425 brands of\nimported beer sold in America. Surely one of these brands must taste better\nthan Heineken, but does it really matter? Today, Heineken is still the No.1\nimported beer, with 30 percent of the market.\n\nThe first domestic light beer was Miller Lite. So what is the largest-\nselling light beer in America today? The one that tastes the best? Or the one\nthat got into the mind first?\n\nNot every first is going to become successful, however. Timing is an\nissue\u2014your first could be too late. For example, USA Today is the first\nnational newspaper, but it is unlikely to succeed. It has already lost $800\nmillion and has never had a profitable year. In a television era, it may be too\nlate for a national newspaper.\n\nSome firsts are just bad ideas that will never go anywhere. Frosty Paws,\nthe first ice cream for dogs, is unlikely to make it. The dogs love it, but the\nowners are the ones who buy the groceries, and they think that dogs don\u2019t\nneed an ice cream of their own. They should be happy just to lick the plates.\n\nThe law of leadership applies to any product, any brand, any category.\nLet\u2019s say you didn\u2019t know the name of the first college founded in America.\nYou can always make a good guess by substituting leading for first. So\nwhat\u2019s the name of the leading college in America? Most people would\nprobably say Harvard, which is also the name of the first college founded in\nAmerica. (What\u2019s the name of the second college founded in America? The\nCollege of William and Mary, which is only slightly more famous than Bert\nHinkler.)\n\nNo two products are any similar than twins are. Yet twins often complain\nthat the first of the two whom a person meets always remains their favorite,\neven though the person also gets to know the other one.\n\nPeople tend to stick with what they\u2019ve got. If you meet someone a little\nbetter than your wife or husband, it\u2019s really not worth making the switch,\nwhat with attorneys\u2019 fees and dividing up the house and kids.\n\nThe law of leadership also applies to magazines. Which is why Time\nleads Newsweek, People leads Us, and Playboy leads Penthouse. Take TV\nGuide, for example. Back in the early fifties the then-powerful Curtis\nPublishing Company tried to field a television-listings magazine to compete\nwith the fledgling TV Guide. Even though TV Guide had only a minuscule\nhead start, and despite the awesome strength of Curtis, the Curtis\npublication never really got off the ground. TV Guide had preempted the\nfield.\n\nThe law of leadership applies equally as well to hard categories like\nautomobiles and computers as it does to soft categories like colleges and\nbeer. Jeep was first in four-wheel-drive off-the-road vehicles. Acura was\nfirst in luxury Japanese cars. IBM was first in mainframe computers. Sun\nMicrosystems was first in workstations. Jeep, Acura, IBM, and Sun are all\nleading brands.\n\nThe first minivan was introduced by Chrysler. Today Chrysler has 10\npercent of the car market and 50 percent of the minivan market. Is the\nessence of car marketing making better cars or getting into the market first?\n\nThe first desktop laser printer was introduced by a computer company,\nHewlett-Packard. Today the company has 5 percent of the personal\ncomputer market and 45 percent of the laser printer market.\n\nGillette was the first safety razor. Tide was the first laundry detergent.\nHayes was the first computer modem. Leaders all.\n\nOne reason the first brand tends to maintain its leadership is that the\nname often becomes generic. Xerox, the first plain-paper copier, became the\nname for all plain-paper copiers. People will stand in front of a Ricoh or a\nSharp or a Kodak machine and say, \u201cHow do I make a Xerox copy?\u201d They\nwill ask for the Kleenex when the box clearly says Scott. They will offer\nyou a Coke when all they have is Pepsi-Cola.\n\nHow many people ask for cellophane tape instead of Scotch tape? Not\nmany. Most people use brand names when they become generic: Band-Aid,\nFiberglas, Formica, Gore-Tex, Jello, Krazy Glue, Q-tips, Saran Wrap,\nVelcro\u2014to name a few. Some people will go to great lengths to turn a brand\nname into a generic. \u201cFedEx this package to the Coast.\u201d If you\u2019re\nintroducing the first brand in a new category, you should always try to\nselect a name that can work generically. (Lawyers advise the opposite, but\nwhat do they know about the laws of marketing?)\n\nNot only does the first brand usually become the leader, but also the sales\norder of follow-up brands often matches the order of their introductions.\nThe best example is ibuprofen. Advil was first, Nuprin was second,\nMedipren was third. That\u2019s exactly the sales order they now enjoy: Advil\nhas 51 percent of the ibuprofen market, Nuprin has 10 percent, and\nMedipren has 1 percent.\n\nThe fourth brand that entered the market was Motrin IB. Even though it\nhas the powerful prescription name for ibuprofen, Motrin\u2019s market share is\nonly 15 percent. (Keep in mind that Advil was introduced with a \u201cSame as\nthe prescription drug Motrin\u201d theme.) And note the generic substitution.\nConsumers use Advil as a generic term. Rarely do they use the word\nibuprofen. Even an M.D. will tell a patient, \u201cTake two Advil and call me in\nthe morning.\u201d\n\nAlso consider Tylenol, the first brand of acetaminophen. Tylenol is so far\nahead of the No. 2 brand that it\u2019s hard to determine who is No. 2.\n\nIf the secret of success is getting into the prospect\u2019s mind first, what\nstrategy are most companies committed to? The better-product strategy. The\nlatest and hottest subject in the business management field is benchmarking.\nTouted as the \u201cultimate competitive strategy,\u201d benchmarking is the process\nof comparing and evaluating your company\u2019s products against the best in\nthe industry. It\u2019s an essential element in a process often called \u201ctotal quality\nmanagement.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, benchmarking doesn\u2019t work. Regardless of reality, people\nperceive the first product into the mind as superior. Marketing is a battle of\nperceptions, not products.\n\nSo what\u2019s the name of the first brand of aspirin? The first brand of\nacetaminophen? The first brand of ibuprofen? (Hint: Substitute leading for\nfirst and you\u2019ll have the answers to these three questions.)\n\nCharles Schwab bills itself as \u201cAmerica\u2019s largest discount broker.\u201d Are\nyou surprised that the Charles Lindbergh of the discount brokerage business\nis Charles Schwab?\n\nNeil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon. Who was\nsecond?\n\nRoger Bannister was the first person to run a four-minute mile. Who was\nsecond?\n\nGeorge Washington was the first president of the United States. Who was\nsecond?\n\nThomas\u2019 was the first brand of English muffin. What was second?\n\nGatorade was the first sports drink. What was second?\n\nIf you\u2019re second into the prospect\u2019s mind, are you doomed to languish\nforever with Buzz Aldrin, John Landy, John Adams, some unknown\nEnglish muffin, and some unknown sports drink? Not necessarily.\nFortunately, there are other laws.\n",

But you do. It\u2019s Amelia Earhart.\n\nNow, is Amelia known as the third person to fly the Atlantic Ocean solo,\nor as the first woman to do so?\n\nAfter Heineken became a big success, the people at Anheuser-Busch\ncould have said, \u201cWe should bring in an imported beer, too.\u201d But they\ndidn\u2019t. Instead they said, \u201cIf there\u2019s a market for a high-priced imported\nbeer, maybe there\u2019s a market for a high-priced domestic beer.\u201d And so they\nstarted to promote Michelob, the first high-priced domestic beer, which\ntoday out-sells Heineken two to one. (Actually, Anheuser-Busch also\n\nbrought in an imported beer, Carlsberg, which has a very good reputation in\nEurope. In the United States, however, the me-too Carlsberg never went\nanywhere.)\n\nMiller Lite was the first domestic light. It took an importer five years to\nsay, \u201cIf there\u2019s a market for a domestic light beer, maybe there\u2019s a market\nfor an imported light beer.\u201d The result was Amstel Light, which became the\nlargest-selling imported light beer.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t get into the prospect\u2019s mind first, don\u2019t give up hope. Find a\nnew category you can be first in. It\u2019s not as difficult as you might think.\n\nAfter IBM became a big success in computers, everybody and his brother\njumped into the field. Burroughs, Control Data, General Electric,\nHoneywell, NCR, RCA, Sperry. Snow White and the seven dwarfs, they\nwere called.\n\nWhich dwarf grew up to become a worldwide powerhouse, with 126,000\nemployees and sales of $14 billion, a company often dubbed \u201cthe second\nlargest computer company in the world\u201d? None of them. The most\nsuccessful computer company of the seventies and eighties, next to IBM,\nwas Digital Equipment Corporation. IBM was first in computers. DEC was\nfirst in minicomputers.\n\nMany other computer companies (and their entrepreneurial owners)\nbecame rich and famous by following a simple principle: If you can\u2019t be\nfirst in a category, set up a new category you can be first in.\n\nTandem was first in fault-tolerant computers and built a $1.9 billion\nbusiness. So Stratus stepped down with the first fault-tolerant\nminicomputer. Today Stratus is a $500 million company.\n\nAre the laws of marketing difficult? No, they are quite simple. Working\nthings out in practice is another matter, however.\n\nCray Research went over the top with the first supercomputer. Today,\nCray is an $800 million company. So Convex put two and two together and\nlaunched the first mini supercomputer. Today, Convex is a $200 million\ncompany.\n\nSometimes you can turn an also-ran into a winner by inventing a new\ncategory. Commodore was just another manufacturer of home personal\ncomputers that wasn\u2019t going anywhere until it positioned the Amiga as the\nfirst multimedia computer. Today the Commodore Amiga is a big success,\nwith more than $500 million worth sold annually.\n\nThere are many different ways to be first. Dell got into the crowded\npersonal computer field by being the first to sell computers by phone.\nToday Dell is a $900 million company.\n\nWhen you launch a new product, the first question to ask yourself is not\n\u201cHow is this new product better than the competition?\u201d but \u201cFirst what?\u201d In\nother words, what category is this new product first in?\n\nCharles Schwab didn\u2019t open a better brokerage firm. He opened the first\ndiscount broker.\n\nLear\u2019s was not the first woman\u2019s magazine. It was the first magazine for\nthe mature woman. (The magazine for the woman who wasn\u2019t bom\nyesterday.)\n\nThis is counter to classic marketing thinking, which is brand oriented:\nHow do I get people to prefer my brand? Forget the brand. Think\ncategories. Prospects are on the defensive when it comes to brands.\nEveryone talks about why their brand is better. But prospects have an open\nmind when it comes to categories. Everyone is interested in what\u2019s new.\nFew people are interested in what\u2019s better.\n\nWhen you\u2019re the first in a new category, promote the category. In\nessence, you have no competition. DEC told its prospects why they ought to\nbuy a minicomputer, not a DEC minicomputer.\n\nIn the early days, Hertz sold rent-a-car service. Coca-Cola sold\nrefreshment. Marketing programs of both companies were more effective\nback then.\n",

Unfortunately, the product is no longer with us.\n\nDu Mont invented the first commercial television set. Duryea introduced\nthe first automobile. Hurley introduced the first washing machine. All are\ngone.\n\nIs something wrong with the law of leadership in chapter 1? No, but the\nlaw of the mind modifies it. It\u2019s better to be first in the prospect\u2019s mind than\nfirst in the marketplace. Which, if anything, understates the importance of\nbeing first in the mind. Being first in the mind is everything in marketing.\n\nBeing first in the marketplace is important only to the extent that it allows\nyou to get in the mind first.\n\nFor example, IBM wasn\u2019t first in the marketplace with the mainframe\ncomputer. Remington Rand was first, with UNIVAC. But thanks to a\nmassive marketing effort, IBM got into the mind first and won the computer\nbattle early.\n\nThe law of the mind follows from the law of perception.

That is, the resources\nto design and build product or service organizations plus the resources to\nhold press conferences, attend trade shows, run advertisements, and conduct\ndirect mail programs (chapter 22: The Law of Resources).\n\nUnfortunately, this gives rise to the perception that the answer to all\nmarketing questions is the same: money. Not true. More money is wasted in\nmarketing than in any other human activity (outside of government\nactivities, of course).\n\nYou can\u2019t change a mind once a mind is made up. It\u2019s like going head-to-\nhead against an entrenched enemy, the charge of the Light Brigade at\nBalaclava being history\u2019s most famous example, closely followed by\nPickett\u2019s fiasco at Gettysburg.\n\nWang was first in word processors. But the world passed such machines\nby and went on to computers. Wang, however, wasn\u2019t able to make the\ntransition. In spite of spending millions of dollars promoting its personal\ncomputers and minicomputers, Wang is still perceived as a word processor\ncompany.\n\nXerox was first in copiers and then tried to get into the computer\nbusiness. Twenty-five years and $2 billion later, Xerox is nowhere in\ncomputers.\n\nYou want to change something in a computer? Just type over or delete the\nexisting material. You want to change something in a mind? Forget it. Once\na mind is made up, it rarely, if ever, changes. The single most wasteful thing\nyou can do in marketing is try to change a mind.\n\n\u201cIf you want to make a big impression on another person, you cannot\nworm your way into their mind and then slowly build up a favorable\nopinion over a period of time. The mind doesn\u2019t work that way. You have to\nblast your way into the mind.\n\nThe reason you blast instead of worm is that people don\u2019t like to change\ntheir minds. Once they perceive you one way, that\u2019s it. They kind of file you\naway in their minds as a certain kind of person. You cannot become a\ndifferent person in their minds.\n\nOne of the mysteries of marketing is the role of money. One day a few\ndollars can work a major miracle. The next day millions of dollars can\u2019t\nsave a company from going under. When you have an open mind to work\nwith, even a small amount of money can go a long way. Apple got off the\ncomputer ground with $91,000 contributed by Mike Markkula.\n\nApple\u2019s problem in getting into its prospects\u2019 minds was helped by its\nsimple, easy-to-remember name. On the other hand, Apple\u2019s competitors\nhad complicated names that were difficult to remember. In the early days,\nfive personal computers were in position on the launching pad: Apple II,\nCommodore Pet, IMSAI 8080, MITS Altair 8800, and Radio Shack TRS-\n80. Ask yourself, which name is the simplest and easiest to remember?\n",

                    "extracted-text": "Many people think marketing is a battle of products. In the long run, they\nfigure, the best product will win.\n\nMarketing people are preoccupied with doing research and \u201cgetting the\nfacts.\u201d They analyze the situation to make sure that truth is on their side.\nThen they sail confidently into the marketing arena, secure in the\nknowledge that they have the best product and that ultimately the best\nproduct will win.\n\nIt\u2019s an illusion. There is no objective reality. There are no facts. There are\nno best products. All that exists in the world of marketing are perceptions in\nthe minds of the customer or prospect. The perception is the reality.\nEverything else is an illusion.\n\nAll truth is relative. Relative to your mind or the mind of another human\nbeing. When you say, \u201cI\u2019m right and the next person is wrong,\u201d all you\u2019re\n\nreally saying is that you\u2019re a better perceiver than someone else.\n\nMost people think they are better perceivers than others. They have a\nsense of personal infallibility. Their perceptions are always more accurate\nthan those of their neighbors or friends. Truth and perception become fused\nin the mind, leaving no difference between the two.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to see that this is so. To cope with the terrifying reality of\nbeing alone in the universe, people project themselves on the outside world.\nThey \u201clive\u201d in the arena of books, movies, television, newspapers,\nmagazines. They \u201cbelong\u201d to clubs, organizations, institutions. These\noutside representations of the world seem more real than the reality inside\ntheir own minds.\n\nPeople cling firmly to the belief that reality is the world outside of the\nmind and that the individual is one small speck on a global spaceship.\nActually it\u2019s the opposite. The only reality you can be sure about is in your\nown perceptions. If the universe exists, it exists inside your own mind and\nthe minds of others. That\u2019s the reality that marketing programs must deal\nwith.\n\nThere may well be oceans, rivers, cities, towns, trees, and houses out\nthere, but there just isn\u2019t any way for us to know these things except\nthrough our own perceptions. Marketing is a manipulation of those\nperceptions.\n\nMost marketing mistakes stem from the assumption that you\u2019re fighting a\nproduct battle rooted in reality. All the laws in this book are derived from\nthe exact opposite point of view.\n\nWhat some marketing people see as the natural laws of marketing are\nbased on a flawed premise that the product is the hero of the marketing\nprogram and that you\u2019ll win or lose based on the merits of the product.\nWhich is why the natural, logical way to market a product is invariably\nwrong.\n\nOnly by studying how perceptions are formed in the mind and focusing\nyour marketing programs on those perceptions can you overcome your\nbasically incorrect marketing instincts.\n\nEach of us (manufacturer, distributor, dealer, prospect, customer) looks at\nthe world through a pair of eyes. If there is objective truth out there, how\nwould we know it? Who would measure it? Who would tell us? It could\nonly be another person looking at the same scene through a different pair of\neye-windows.\n\nTruth is nothing more or less than one expert\u2019s perception. And who is\nthe expert? It\u2019s someone who is perceived to be an expert in the mind of\nsomebody else.\n\nIf truth is so illusive, why is there so much discussion in marketing about\nthe so-called facts? Why are so many marketing decisions based on factual\ncomparisons? Why do so many marketing people assume that truth is on\ntheir side, that their job is to use truth as a weapon to correct the\nmisperceptions that exist in the mind of the prospect?\n\nMarketing people focus on facts because they believe in objective reality.\nIt\u2019s also easy for marketing people to assume that truth is on their side. If\nyou think you need the best product to win a marketing battle, then it\u2019s easy\nto believe you have the best product. All that\u2019s required is a minor\nmodification of your own perceptions.\n\nChanging a prospect\u2019s mind is another matter. Minds of customers or\nprospects are very difficult to change. With a modicum of experience in a\nproduct category, a consumer assumes that he or she is right. A perception\nthat exists in the mind is often interpreted as a universal truth. People are\nseldom, if ever, wrong. At least in their own minds.\n\nIt\u2019s easier to see the power of perception over product when the products\nare separated by some distance. For example, the three largest-selling\nJapanese imported cars in America are Honda, Toyota, and Nissan. Most\nmarketing people think the battle between the three brands is based on\nquality, styling, horsepower, and price. Not true. It\u2019s what people think\nabout a Honda, a Toyota, or a Nissan that determines which brand will win.\nMarketing is a battle of perceptions.\n\nJapanese automobile manufacturers sell the same cars in the United\nStates as they do in Japan. If marketing were a battle of products, you\nwould think the same sales order would hold true for both countries. After\nall, the same quality, the same styling, the same horsepower, and roughly\nthe same prices hold true for Japan as they do for the United States. But in\nJapan, Honda is nowhere near the leader. There, Honda is in third place,\nbehind Toyota and Nissan. Toyota sells more than four times as many\nautomobiles in Japan as Honda does.\n\nSo what\u2019s the difference between Honda in Japan and Honda in the\nUnited States? The products are the same, but the perceptions in customers\u2019\nminds are different.\n\n\nIf you told friends in New York you bought a Honda, they might ask you,\n\u201cWhat kind of car did you get? a Civic? an Accord? a Prelude?\u201d If you told\nfriends in Tokyo you bought a Honda, they might ask you, \u201cWhat kind of\nmotorcycle did you buy?\u201d In Japan, Honda got into customers\u2019 minds as a\nmanufacturer of motorcycles, and apparently most people don\u2019t want to buy\na car from a motorcycle company.\n\nHow about an opposite situation? Would Harley-Davidson be successful\nif it launched a Harley-Davidson automobile? You might think it would\ndepend on the car. Quality, styling, horsepower, pricing. You might even\nbelieve the Harley-Davidson reputation for quality would be a plus. We\nthink not. Its perception as a motorcycle company would undermine a\nHarley-Davidson car\u2014no matter how good the product (chapter 12: The\nLaw of Line Extension).\n\nWhy is Campbell\u2019s soup No. 1 in the United States and nowhere in the\nUnited Kingdom? Why is Heinz soup No. 1 in the United Kingdom and a\nfailure in the United States? Marketing is a battle of perceptions, not\nproducts. Marketing is the process of dealing with those perceptions.\n\nSome soft-drink executives believe that marketing is a battle of taste.\nWell, New Coke is No. 1 in taste. (The Coca-Cola Company conducted\n200,000 taste tests that \u201cproved\u201d that New Coke tastes better than Pepsi-\nCola and Pepsi tastes better than their original formula, now called Coca-\nCola Classic.) But who is winning the marketing battle? The drink that\nresearch has proven to taste the best, New Coke, is in third place. The one\nthat research shows tastes the worst, Coca-Cola Classic, is in first place.\n\nYou believe what you want to believe. You taste what you want to taste.\nSoft-drink marketing is a battle of perceptions, not a battle of taste.\n\nWhat makes the battle even more difficult is that customers frequently\nmake buying decisions based on second-hand perceptions. Instead of using\ntheir own perceptions, they base their buying decisions on someone else\u2019s\nperception of reality. This is the \u201ceverybody knows\u201d principle.\n\nEverybody knows that the Japanese make higher-quality cars than the\nAmericans do. So people make buying decisions based on the fact that\neverybody knows the Japanese make higher-quality cars. When you ask\nshoppers whether they have had any personal experience with a product,\nmost often they say they haven\u2019t. And, more often than not, their own\nexperience is often twisted to conform to their perceptions.\n\n\nIf you have had a bad experience with a Japanese car, you\u2019ve just been\nunlucky, because everybody knows the Japanese make high-quality cars.\nConversely, if you have had a good experience with an American car,\nyou\u2019ve just been lucky, because everybody knows that American cars are\npoorly made.\n\nEverybody knows there\u2019s a problem with Audi cars. On November 23,\n1986, CBS broadcast a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d segment called \u201cOut of Control.\u201d It\ncalled attention to a number of complaints about Audi\u2019s \u201cunintended\nacceleration.\u201d American sales of Audis fell through the floorboards\u2014from\n60,000 in 1986 to 12,000 in 1991. But have you ever personally had any\nproblems with \u201cunintended acceleration\u201d while test-driving an Audi? It is\nunlikely. Every single automobile expert who has tested the car has failed to\nduplicate the complaint. Yet the perception lingers on.\n\nRecently Audi has been running advertisements comparing its cars to\ncomparable cars made by Mercedes-Benz and BMW. According to the ads,\nGerman automotive experts rated Audi cars ahead of both Mercedes and\nBMW.\n\nDo you believe that? Probably not. Is it true? Does it matter?\n\nMarketing is not a battle of products. It\u2019s a battle of perceptions.\n",

                    "extracted-text": "A company can become incredibly successful if it can find a way to own\na word in the mind of the prospect. Not a complicated word. Not an\ninvented one. The simple words are best, words taken right out of the\ndictionary.\n\nThis is the law of focus. You \u201cburn\u201d your way into the mind by\nnarrowing the focus to a single word or concept. It\u2019s the ultimate marketing\nsacrifice.\n\nFederal Express was able to put the word overnight into the minds of its\nprospects because it sacrificed its product line and focused on overnight\npackage delivery only.\n\nIn a way, the law of leadership\u2014it\u2019s better to be first than to be better\u2014\nenables the first brand or company to own a word in the mind of the\n\nprospect. But the word the leader owns is so simple that it\u2019s invisible.\n\nThe leader owns the word that stands for the category. For example, IBM\nowns computer. This is another way of saying that the brand becomes a\ngeneric name for the category. \u201cWe need an IBM machine.\u201d Is there any\ndoubt that a computer is being requested?\n\nYou can also test the validity of a leadership claim by a word association\ntest. If the given words are computer, copier, chocolate bar, and cola, the\nfour most associated words are IBM, Xerox, Hershey\u2019s, and Coke.\n\nAn astute leader will go one step further to solidify its position. Heinz\nowns the word ketchup. But Heinz went on to isolate the most important\nketchup attribute. \u201cSlowest ketchup in the West\u201d is how the company is\npreempting the thickness attribute. Owning the word slow helps Heinz\nmaintain a 50 percent market share.\n\nIf you\u2019re not a leader, then your word has to have a narrow focus. Even\nmore important, however, your word has to be \u201cavailable\u201d in your category.\nNo one else can have a lock on it.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be a linguistic genius to find a winner. Prego went\nagainst leader Ragu in the spaghetti sauce market and captured a 27 percent\nshare with an idea borrowed from Heinz. Prego\u2019s word is thicker.\n\nThe most effective words are simple and benefit oriented. No matter how\ncomplicated the product, no matter how complicated the needs of the\nmarket, it\u2019s always better to focus on one word or benefit rather than two or\nthree or four.\n\nAlso, there\u2019s the halo effect. If you strongly establish one benefit, the\nprospect is likely to give you a lot of other benefits, too. A \u201cthicker\u201d\nspaghetti sauce implies quality, nourishing ingredients, value, and so on. A\n\u201csafer\u201d car implies better design and engineering.\n\nWhether the result of a deliberate program or not, most successful\ncompanies (or brands) are the ones that \u201cown a word\u201d in the mind of the\nprospect. (Some words, like Volkswagen\u2019s fahrvergnugen, are not worth\nowning.) Here are a few examples:\n\nCrest ... cavities\n\nMercedes ... engineering\nBMvV ... driving\n\nVolvo ... safety\n\nDomino\u2019s ... home delivery\n\nPepsi-Cola ... youth\nNordstrom ... service\n\nWords come in different varieties. They can be benefit related (cavity\nprevention), service related (home delivery), audience related (younger\npeople), or sales related (preferred brand).\n\nAlthough we\u2019ve been touting that words stick in the mind, nothing lasts\nforever. There comes a time when a company must change words. It\u2019s not\nan easy task. The recent history of Lotus Development Corporation\ndemonstrates the nature of the problem.\n\nFor a number of years, Lotus has owned the word spreadsheet. Lotus was\nsynonymous with 1-2-3 and spreadsheet. But the world of spreadsheets is\ngetting competitive, and the potential for growth is limited. Like other\ncompanies, Lotus wants to grow. How is the company to get beyond its\nsingle-product business?\n\nThe conventional answer is to expand in all directions, as IBM and\nMicrosoft did. As a matter of fact, Lotus did some conventional line\nextension with the purchase of Ami Pro word processing software and the\nintroduction of a number of new software products. Then Lotus regrouped\nto focus on a new concept called \u201cgroupware,\u201d software products for\nnetworked PCs.\n\nLotus was the first software company to develop a successful groupware\nproduct. If things work out, the company will eventually own a second\nword in the minds of its prospects.\n\nUnlike Microsoft, Lotus now has a corporate focus. It won\u2019t happen\novernight, but Lotus could develop a powerful long-term position in the\nsoftware field. What overnight did for Federal Express and safety did for\nVolvo, groupware could do for Lotus Development Corporation.\n\nYou can\u2019t take somebody else\u2019s word. What makes the Lotus strategy\nplausible is that the groupware word is not owned by any other company.\nFurthermore, there is an enormous industry trend toward networked\ncomputers. (More than half of all business computers are connected to a\nnetwork. There\u2019s even a new magazine called Network Computing.) Many\ncompanies see the advantage of owning a single word or concept (often\ncalled \u201cthe corporate vision\u201d), but they neglect to be the first to preempt the\nword.\n\nWhat won\u2019t work in marketing is leaving your own word in search of a\nword owned by others. This was the case with Atari, which owned the\nwords video game. But the business turned out to be faddish, so in 1982 it\nsailed off in a new direction. It wanted Atari to mean computers. CEO\nJames Morgan laid it all out: \u201cAtari\u2019s strength as a name also tends to be its\nweakness. It is synonymous with video games. Atari must redefine its\nimage and broaden its business definition to electronic consumer products.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately for Mr. Morgan\u2019s strategy a host of other companies,\nincluding Apple and IBM, owned the word he was after. Atari\u2019s\ndiversification was a disaster. But the real irony was in that another\ncompany arrived in 1986 and took over the concept Atari walked away\nfrom. The company was Nintendo, which today has 75 percent of a\nmultibillion-dollar market. Who knows where Atari is these days?\n\nThe essence of marketing is narrowing the focus. You become stronger\nwhen you reduce the scope of your operations. You can\u2019t stand for\nsomething if you chase after everything.\n\nSome companies accept the need to narrow the focus and try to\naccomplish this strategy in ways that are self-defeating. \u201cWe\u2019ll focus on the\nquality end of the market. We won\u2019t get into the low end where the\nemphasis is on price.\u201d The problem is that customers don\u2019t believe you\nunless you restrict your business to high-priced products only, like\nMercedes-Benz or BMW.\n\nGeneral Motors tries to sell quality at all price levels. \u201cPutting quality on\nthe road\u201d is their latest corporate slogan. Every GM product includes the\n\u201cMark of Excellence.\u201d Guess what they\u2019re doing at Ford? The same thing.\n\u201cQuality is Job 1,\u201d say the Ford ads. Over at Chrysler, Lee Iacocca\nproclaimed, \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be the biggest, we just want to be the best.\u201d\n(Does anyone really believe that Iacocca doesn\u2019t want to be the biggest?)\n\nThis is great stuff inside the corporation. Total quality, the path to\ngreatness. It makes a terrific theme at dealer meetings, especially with the\ntrumpet flourishes and the dancers. But outside the corporation, the message\nfalls apart. Does any company proclaim itself as the \u201cunquality\u201d\ncorporation? No, everybody stands for quality. As a result, nobody does.\n\nYou can\u2019t narrow the focus with quality or any other idea that doesn\u2019t\nhave proponents for the opposite point of view. You can\u2019t position yourself\nas an honest politician, because nobody is willing to take the opposite\nposition (although there are plenty of potential candidates). You can,\n\nhowever, position yourself as the pro-business candidate or the pro-labor\ncandidate and be instantly accepted as such because there is support for the\nother side.\n\nWhen you develop your word to focus on, be prepared to fend off the\nlawyers. They want to trademark everything you publish. The trick is to get\nothers to use your word. (To be a leader you have to have followers.) It\nwould be helpful for Lotus to have other companies get into the groupware\nbusiness. It would make the category more important and people would be\neven more impressed with Lotus\u2019s leadership.\n\nOnce you have your word, you have to go out of your way to protect it in\nthe marketplace. The case of BMW illustrates this very well. For years,\nBMW was the ultimate \u201cdriving\u201d machine. Then the company decided to\nbroaden its product line and chase Mercedes-Benz with large, 700-series\nsedans. The problem is, how can a living room on wheels be the ultimate\ndriving machine? Not only can you not feel the road, but you\u2019ll also crush\nall the pylons in your driving commercials.\n\nAs a result, things started downhill for BMW. Luckily, it has recently\nintroduced a new small BMW and is emphasizing \u201cdriving\u201d once again.\nThe company has regained its focus.\n\nThe law of focus applies to whatever you\u2019re selling, or even whatever\nyou\u2019re unselling. Like drugs, for example. The antidrug crusade on\ntelevision and in magazines suffers from a lack of focus. There is no one\nword driven into the minds of drug users that could begin to unsell the drug\nconcept. Antidrug advertising is all over the map.\n\nYou\u2019d think the antidrug forces (who, after all, are professionals) would\nhave taken a leaf from the amateurs fighting the abortion issue. Both sides\nof the abortion issue have focused on single, powerful words\u2014pro-life and\npro-choice.\n\nThe antidrug forces should do the same\u2014focus on a single powerful\nword. What the campaign ought to do is make drugs what cigarettes are\ntoday, socially unacceptable. One word that could do this is the ultimate\ndown word, loser. Since drug usage causes all kinds of losses (of job,\nfamily, self-esteem, freedom, life), a program that said \u201cDrugs are for\nlosers\u201d could have a very powerful impact, especially on the recreational\nuser, who is more concerned with social status than with getting high.\n\nThe law of focus, a marketing law, could help solve one of society\u2019s\nbiggest problems.\n",

                    "extracted-text": "When a competitor owns a word or position in the prospect\u2019s mind, it is\nfutile to attempt to own the same word.\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, Volvo owns safety. Many other automobile\ncompanies, including Mercedes-Benz and General Motors, have tried to run\nmarketing campaigns based on safety. Yet no one except Volvo has\nsucceeded in getting into the prospect\u2019s mind with a safety message.\n\nThe Atari story shows the futility of attempting to move in on the home\ncomputer position against well-entrenched competitors. A variation called\ngame computer might have been possible because it would have taken\nadvantage of the perception of Atari as a creator of computer games. But\n\nthat\u2019s about it. The home computer position belonged to Apple,\nCommodore, and others.\n\nDespite the disaster stories, many companies continue to violate the law\nof exclusivity. You can\u2019t change people\u2019s minds once they are made up. In\nfact, what you often do is reinforce your competitor\u2019s position by making its\nconcept more important.\n\nFederal Express has walked away from overnight and is in the middle of\ntrying to take worldwide away from DHL. \u201cOvernight Letter\u201d used to be\nemblazoned on Federal Express envelopes. Today you\u2019ll find \u201cFedEx\nLetter\u201d instead. And its advertising no longer says, \u201cWhen it absolutely,\npositively has to be there overnight.\u201d Lately the word that has been\nappearing in Federal Express advertising is worldwide.\n\nThis raises the all-important question: Can Federal Express ever own the\nworldwide word? Probably not. Someone else already owns it: DHL\nWorldwide Express. Its concept: Faster to more of the world. To succeed,\nFederal Express must find a way to narrow the focus against DHL. The\ncompany can\u2019t do it by trying to own the same word in the prospect\u2019s mind.\n\nAnother massive marketing effort aimed at someone else\u2019s word can be\nfound in bunny land\u2014to be specific, the pink Energizer bunny that is trying\nto take the \u201clong-lasting\u201d concept away from Duracell. No matter how\nmany bunnies Eveready throws into the fray, Duracell will still be able to\nhang onto the long-lasting word. Duracell got into the mind first and\npreempted the concept. Even the Dura part of the name communicates it.\n\nWhat often leads marketers down this booby-trapped lane is that\nwonderful stuff called research. Armies of researchers are employed, focus\ngroups conducted, questionnaires tabulated\u2014and what comes back in a\nthree-pound report is a wish list of attributes that users want from a product\nor service. So if that\u2019s what people want, that\u2019s what we should give them.\n\nWhat\u2019s the biggest problem people have with batteries? They go dead at\nthe most inconvenient times. So what\u2019s the No. 1 battery attribute? Long-\nlasting, of course. If long-lasting is what people want, that\u2019s what we should\nadvertise. Right? Wrong.\n\nWhat researchers never tell you is that some other company already owns\nthe idea. They would rather encourage clients to mount massive marketing\nprograms. The theory is that if you spend enough money, you can own the\nidea. Right? Wrong.\n\nSome years ago Burger King started down this slippery slope from which\nit has never quite recovered. A market study showed that the most popular\nattribute for fast food was \u201cfast\u201d (no big surprise there). So Burger King did\nwhat most red-blooded marketers do. It turned to its advertising agency and\nsaid, \u201cIf the world wants fast, our advertising should tell them we\u2019re fast.\u201d\n\nWhat was overlooked in the research was that McDonald\u2019s was already\nperceived as being the fastest hamburger chain in the country. Fast\nbelonged to McDonald\u2019s. Undaunted by this, Burger King launched its\ncampaign with the slogan \u201cBest food for fast times.\u201d The program quickly\nbecame a disaster very nearly on a par with the one that involved \u201cHerb.\u201d\nThe advertising agency was fired, management was fired, the company was\nsold, and downward momentum was maintained.\n\nMany people have paid the price for violating the law of exclusivity.\n",

                    "extracted-text": "While being first into the prospect\u2019s mind ought to be your primary\nmarketing objective, the battle isn\u2019t lost if you fail in this endeavor. There\nare strategies to use for No. 2 and No. 3 brands.\n\nAll products are not created equal. There\u2019s a hierarchy in the mind that\nprospects use in making decisions.\n\nFor each category, there is a product ladder in the mind. On each rung is\na brand name. Take the car rental category. Hertz got into the mind first and\nwound up on the top rung. Avis got in second and National got in third.\n\nYour marketing strategy should depend on how soon you got into the\nmind and consequently which rung of the ladder you occupy. The higher the\nbetter, of course.\n\nTake Avis, for example. For years the company advertised the high\nquality of its rent-a-car service. \u201cFinest in rent-a-cars\u201d was one of its\ncampaigns. The reader looked at the ad and wondered, How could they\nhave the finest rent-a-car service when they\u2019re not on the top rung of my\nladder?\n\nThen Avis did the one thing you have to do to make progress inside the\nmind of the prospect. They acknowledged their position on the ladder. \u201cAvis\nis only No. 2 in rent-a-cars. So why go with us? We try harder.\u201d\n\nFor 13 years in a row, Avis had lost money. Then, when it admitted to\nbeing No. 2, it started to make money, lots of money. Shortly thereafter, the\ncompany was sold to ITT, which promptly ordered up the advertising\ntheme, \u201cAvis is going to be No. 1.\u201d\n\nNo, they\u2019re not, said the prospect. They\u2019re not on the top rung of my\nladder. And to make the point, many picked up the phone and called Hertz.\nThe campaign was a disaster.\n\nMany marketing people have misread the Avis story. They assume the\ncompany was successful because it tried harder (ie., it had the better\nservice). But that wasn\u2019t it at all. Avis was successful because it related\nitself to the position of Hertz in the mind. (If trying harder were the secret\nof success, Harold Stassen would have been president many times over.)\n\nMany marketers make the same mistake as Avis did. Currently, Adelphi\nUniversity in Garden City, Long Island, is comparing itself (favorably) with\nHarvard. Wait a minute, says the high school senior, Adelphi is not on my\ncollege ladder. As you might expect, Adelphi is not very successful in\nattracting the top students.\n\nThe mind is selective. Prospects use their ladders in deciding which\ninformation to accept and which information to reject. In general, a mind\naccepts only new data that is consistent with its product ladder in that\ncategory. Everything else is ignored.\n\nWhen Chrysler compared its cars with Honda, very few people traded in\ntheir Preludes and Accords for Plymouths and Dodges. The headline of one\nChrysler ad said: \u201cComparing a used Dodge Spirit to a new Honda Accord\nseemed a little ridiculous. Until we saw the results.\u201d According to the ad,\n100 people were asked to compare a Dodge Spirit with 70,000 miles on it to\nanew Honda Accord. The majority (58 out of 100) chose the used Dodge.\n\nRidiculous. (But not necessarily untrue.)\n\nWhat about your product\u2019s ladder in the prospect\u2019s mind? How many\nrungs are there on your ladder? It depends on whether your product is a\nhigh-interest or a low-interest product. Products you use every day\n(cigarettes, cola, beer, toothpaste, cereal) tend to be high-interest products\nwith many rungs on their ladders. Products that are purchased infrequently\n(furniture, lawn mowers, luggage) usually have few rungs on their ladders.\n\nProducts that involve a great deal of personal pride (automobiles,\nwatches, cameras) are also high-interest products with many rungs on their\nladders even though they are purchased infrequently.\n\nProducts that are purchased infrequently and involve an unpleasant\nexperience usually have very few rungs on their ladders. Automobile\nbatteries, tires, and life insurance are three examples.\n\nThe, ultimate product that involves the least amount of pleasure and is\npurchased once in a lifetime has no rungs on its ladder. Ever hear of\nBatesville caskets? Probably not, although the brand has almost 50 percent\nof the market.\n\nThere\u2019s a relationship between market share and your position on the\nladder in the prospect\u2019s mind. You tend to have twice the market share of\nthe brand below you and half the market share of the brand above you.\n\nFor example, Acura was the first Japanese luxury car Lexus was second.\nInfiniti was third. In a recent year, Acura sold 143,708 cars in the United\nStates, Lexus sold 71,206 cars, and Infiniti sold 34,890. The relationship\namong the three brands is almost a mathematically correct 4-2-1. (The\nAcura-Lexus-Infiniti battle is in its early stages, where the cars are new and\nthere\u2019s a lot of interest among the public and the press. In the long run,\nwhen the products are no longer exciting, another phenomenon occurs. See\nthe next chapter: The Law of Duality.)\n\nMarketing people often talk about the \u201cthree leading brands\u201d in a\ncategory as if it were a battle of equals. It almost never is. The leader\ninevitably dominates the No. 2 brand and the No. 2 brand inevitably\nsmothers No. 3. In baby food, it\u2019s Gerber, Beech-Nut, and Heinz. In beer,\nit\u2019s Budweiser, Miller, and Coors. In long-distance telephone service it\u2019s\nAT&T, MCI, and Sprint.\n\nWhat\u2019s the maximum number of rungs on a ladder? There seems to be a\ntule of seven in the prospect\u2019s mind. Ask someone to name all the brands he\nor she remembers in a given category. Rarely will anyone name more than\nseven. And that\u2019s for a high-interest category.\n\nAccording to Harvard psychologist Dr. George A. Miller, the average\nhuman mind cannot deal with more than seven units at a time. Which is\nwhy seven is a popular number for lists that have to be remembered. Seven-\ndigit phone numbers, the seven wonders of the world, seven-card stud,\nSnow White and the seven dwarfs, the seven danger signals of cancer.\n\nSometimes your own ladder, or category, is too small. It might be better\nto be a small fish in a big pond than to be a big fish in a small pond. In other\nwords, it\u2019s sometimes better to be No. 3 on a big ladder than No. 1 ona\nsmall ladder.\n\nThe top rung of the lemon-lime soda ladder was occupied by 7-Up.\n(Sprite was on the second rung.) In the soft-drink field, however, the cola\nladder is much bigger than the lemon-lime ladder. (Almost two out of three\nsoft drinks consumed in America are cola drinks.) So 7-Up climbed on the\ncola ladder with a marketing campaign called \u201cThe Uncola.\u201d\n\nAs tea is to coffee, 7-Up became the alternative to a cola drink. And 7-Up\nsales climbed to where the brand was the third largest-selling soft drink in\nAmerica.\n\nUnfortunately, in recent years 7-Up lost its grip on third place by\nviolating one of the laws yet to be discussed (chapter 12: The Law of Line\nExtension).\n\nThe ladder is a simple, but powerful, analogy that can help you deal with\nthe critical issues in marketing. Before starting any marketing program, ask\nyourself the following questions: Where are we on the ladder in the\nprospect\u2019s mind? On the top rung? On the second rung? Or maybe we\u2019re\nnot on the ladder at all.\n\nThen make sure your program deals realistically with your position on\nthe ladder. More on how to do this later.\n",

                    "extracted-text": "Early on, a new category is a ladder of many rungs. Gradually, the ladder\nbecomes a two-rung affair.\n\nIn batteries, it\u2019s Eveready and Duracell. In photographic film, it\u2019s Kodak\nand Fuji. In rent-a-cars, it\u2019s Hertz and Avis. In mouthwash, it\u2019s Listerine and\nScope. In hamburgers, it\u2019s McDonald\u2019s and Burger King. In sneakers, it\u2019s\nNike and Reebok. In toothpaste, it\u2019s Crest and Colgate.\n\nWhen you take the long view of marketing, you find the battle usually\nwinds up as a titanic struggle between two major players\u2014usually the old\nreliable brand and the upstart.\n\nBack in 1969, there were three major brands of a certain product. The\nleader had about 60 percent of the market, the No. 2 brand had a 25 percent\nshare, and the No. 3 brand had a 6 percent share. The rest of the market\nincluded either private label or minor brands. The law of duality suggests\n\nthat these market shares are unstable. Furthermore, the law predicts that the\nleader will lose market share and No. 2 will gain.\n\nTwenty-two years later, the leader dropped down to 45 percent of the\nmarket. The No. 2 brand has 40 percent, and No. 3 has 3 percent. The\nproducts are Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola, and Royal Crown cola, respectively,\nbut the principles apply to brands everywhere.\n\nLook at the three long-distance telephone companies. AT&T has 65\npercent of the market, MCI has 17 percent, and Sprint has 10 percent. Who\nwill win and who will lose in the telephone wars? While the future is\nunknowable (chapter 17: The Law of Unpredictability), a betting person\nwould put his or her money on MCI. MCI has won the battle with Sprint for\nsecond place, so now MCI ought to become the upstart alternative to old,\nreliable AT&T.\n\nSprint is probably feeling very comfortable on the third rung of the\nladder. Nine percent doesn\u2019t sound like much, but it translates to $6 billion\nin annual sales. And the market has been growing rapidly.\n\nFor the long term, however, Sprint is in serious trouble. Look what\nhappened to Royal Crown cola. Back in 1969, the Royal Crown company\nrevitalized its franchise system, 350 bottlers strong, and hired the former\npresident of Rival Pet Foods and a veteran of both Coke and Pepsi. The\ncompany also retained Wells, Rich, Greene, a high-powered New York\nadvertising agency. \u201cWe\u2019re out to kill Coke and Pepsi,\u201d declared Mary\nWells Lawrence, the agency\u2019s head, to the Royal Crown bottlers. \u201cI hope\nyou\u2019 ll excuse the word, but we\u2019re really out for the jugular.\u201d\n\nThe only brand that got killed was Royal Crown. In a maturing industry,\nthird place is a difficult position to be in.\n\nTake the domestic automobile industry. In spite of heroic measures\nundertaken by Lee Iacocca, Chrysler is in trouble. In the long run,\nmarketing is a two-car race.\n\nTake video games. In the late eighties, the market was dominated by\nNintendo with a 75 percent share. The two also-rans were Sega and NEC.\nToday Nintendo and Sega are neck and neck, and NEC is way behind. In\nthe long run, marketing is a two-game race.\n\nTime frames, however, can vary. The fast-moving video game market\nplayed itself out in two or three seasons. The long-distance telephone\nmarket might take two or three decades.\n\nTake the airline industry. American Airlines, with 20 percent of the\nmarket, got its nose out in front and will probably wind up as the Coca-Cola\nof the skies. The interesting battle is between Delta and United, tied at 18\npercent apiece. One of these two will take off like Pepsi\u2014the other is\nheaded down with Royal Crown. In the long run, marketing is a two-airline\nrace.\n\nAre these results preordained? Of course not. There are other laws of\nmarketing that can also affect the results. Furthermore, your marketing\nprograms can strongly influence your sales, provided they are in tune with\nthe laws of marketing. When you\u2019re a weak No. 3, like Royal Crown, you\naren\u2019t going to make much progress by going out and attacking the two\nstrong leaders. What they could have done is carved out a profitable niche\nfor themselves (chapter 5: The Law of Focus).\n\nKnowing that marketing is a two-horse race in the long run can help you\nplan strategy in the short run.\n\nIt often happens that there is no clearcut No. 2. What happens next\ndepends upon how skillful the contenders are. Take the laptop computer\nfield. Toshiba is in first place with 21 percent of the market. But there are\nfive companies in second place. Zenith, Compaq, NEC, Tandy, and Sharp\neach have between 8 and 10 percent of the market. It ought to be fun to\nwatch six horses come around a turn where there\u2019s room for only two.\nToshiba and who? Which one will finish second?\n\nWhat\u2019s especially tragic from the economy\u2019s point of view are the\nresources wasted in many high-visibility categories like laptop computers.\nCurrently there are 130 laptop brands on the market. The law of duality will\nsee to it that very few of these brands will be around in the twenty-first\ncentury.\n\nLook at the history of the automobile in the United States. In 1904, 195\ndifferent cars were assembled by 60 companies. Within the following 10\nyears, 531 companies were formed and 346 perished. By 1923, only 108 car\nmakers remained. This number dropped to 44 by 1927. Today, Ford and\nGeneral Motors dominate the domestic industry, with Chrysler\u2019s future in\ndoubt.\n\nSuccessful marketers concentrate on the top two rungs. Jack Welch, the\nlegendary chairman and CEO of General Electric, said recently: \u201cOnly\nbusinesses that are No. 1 or No. 2 in their markets could win in the\nincreasingly competitive global arena. Those that could not were fixed,\n\nclosed, or sold.\u201d It\u2019s this kind of thinking that built companies like Procter\n& Gamble into the powerhouses they are. In 32 of its 44 product categories\nin the United States, P&G commands the No. 1 or No. 2 brands.\n\nEarly on, in a developing market, the No. 3 or No. 4 positions look\nattractive. Sales are increasing. New, relatively unsophisticated customers\nare coming into the market. These customers don\u2019t always know which\nbrands are the leaders, so they pick ones that look interesting or attractive.\nQuite often, these turn out to be the No. 3 or No. 4 brands.\n\nAs time goes on, however, these customers get educated. They want the\nleading brand, based on the naive assumption that the leading brand must be\nbetter.\n\nWe repeat: The customer believes that marketing is a battle of products.\nIt\u2019s this kind of thinking that keeps the two brands on top: \u201cThey must be\nthe best, they\u2019re the leaders.\u201d\n",

Only seven people in the history of\nthe world have known the Coke formula, which is kept locked in a safe in\nAtlanta. Coca-Cola is the old, established product. However, using the law\nof the opposite, Pepsi-Cola reversed the essence of Coca-Cola to become\nthe choice of a new generation: the Pepsi Generation.\n\nWhen you look at customers in a given product category, there seem to\nbe two kinds of people. There are those who want to buy from the leader\nand there are those who don\u2019t want to buy from the leader. A potential No. 2\nhas to appeal to the latter group.\n\nIn other words, by positioning yourself against the leader, you take\nbusiness away from all the other alternatives to No. 1. If old people drink\nCoke and young people drink Pepsi, there\u2019s nobody left to drink Royal\nCrown cola.\n\nYet, too many potential No. 2 brands try to emulate the leader. This\nusually is an error. You must present yourself as the alternative.\n\nTime built its reputation on colorful writing. So Newsweek turned the idea\naround and focused on a straightforward writing style: \u201cWe separate facts\nfrom opinions.\u201d In other words, Newsweek puts its opinions in the editorial\ncolumns, not in the news columns.\n\nSometimes you need to be brutal. Scope, the good-tasting mouthwash,\nhung the \u201cmedicine breath\u201d label on its Listerine competition.\n\nBut don\u2019t simply knock the competition. The law of the opposite is a\ntwo-edge sword. It requires honing in on a weakness that your prospect will\nquickly acknowledge. (One whiff of Listerine and you know that your\nmouth would smell like a hospital.) Then quickly twist the sword. (Scope is\nthe good-tasting mouthwash that kills germs.)\n\nAlso in the mouthwash field is an interesting example of the futility of\ntrying to emulate the leader. In 1961, Johnson & Johnson introduced Micrin\nmouthwash, focusing on its \u201cscientific\u201d virtues. Within months Micrin\nbecame the No. 2 brand. But with its germ-fighting approach, Listerine was\nalso a scientific brand. So in 1965, when Procter & Gamble introduced\nScope, it had the \u201copposite\u201d position to itself. Scope went on to become the\nNo. 2 mouthwash. By 1978, when Johnson & Johnson withdrew the product\nfrom the market, Micrin\u2019s share had fallen to 1 percent.\n\nWhen Beck\u2019s beer arrived in the United States, it had a problem. It\ncouldn\u2019t be the first imported beer (that was Heineken), nor could it be the\nfirst German imported beer (that was Lowenbrau). It solved its problem by\n\nrepositioning Lowenbrau. \u201cYou\u2019ve tasted the German beer that\u2019s the most\npopular in America. Now taste the German beer that\u2019s the most popular in\nGermany.\u201d\n\nToday Beck\u2019s is the second largest-selling European beer in America.\n(When it comes to beer, Americans trust German mouths more than they do\ntheir own mouths.) This is a rare example of overturning the law of\nleadership and manipulating perceptions in the mind. (All this is academic\ntoday, since Lowenbrau is now brewed in America.)\n\nAs a product gets old, it often accrues some negative baggage. This is\nespecially true in the medical field. Take aspirin, a product introduced in\n1899. With thousands of medical studies conducted on aspirin, someone\nwas bound to find flaws in the product. Sure enough, they found stomach\nbleeding\u2014just in time for the 1955 launch of Tylenol.\n\nWith all the \u201cstomach bleeding\u201d publicity, Tylenol quickly was able to set\nitself up as the alternative. \u201cFor the millions who should not take aspirin,\u201d\nsaid the Tylenol advertising. Today Tylenol outsells aspirin and is the\nlargest-selling single product in American drugstores.\n\nStolichnaya was able to hang the label of \u201cfake Russian vodka\u201d on\nAmerican vodkas such as Smirnoff, Samovar, and Wolfschmidt by simply\npointing out that they come from places like Hartford (Connecticut),\nSchenley (Pennsylvania), and Lawrenceburg (Indiana). Stolichnaya comes\nfrom Leningrad (Russia), making it the real thing.\n\nThere has to be a ring of truth about the negative if it is to be effective.\nOne of the classic examples of hanging a negative on a competitor is an\nadvertisement that Royal Doulton China ran about its main U.S. competitor.\nThe headline said it all: \u201cRoyal Doulton, the china of Stoke-on-Trent,\nEngland vs. Lenox, the china of Pomona, New Jersey.\u201d The ad exploited the\nfact that many people thought Lenox was an imported china. By\nrepositioning Lenox where it really belonged, in Pomona, New Jersey,\nRoyal Doulton was able to establish itself as the \u201creal English china.\u201d\nReason: Most people have a hard time imagining craftsmen making fine\nwhite-bone china in a tacky-sounding place like Pomona, New Jersey.\n(When the folks in England saw the ad, they howled with laughter. It turns\nout that Stoke-on-Trent is just as tacky as Pomona.)\n\nMarketing is often a battle for legitimacy. The first brand that captures\nthe concept is often able to portray its competitors as illegitimate\npretenders.\n\nA good No. 2 can\u2019t afford to be timid. When you give up focusing on No.\n1, you make yourself vulnerable not only to the leader but to the rest of the\npack. Take the sad story of Burger King in recent years. Times have been\ndifficult for this No. 2 in hamburgers. It has been through many\nmanagement changes, new owners, and a parade of advertising agencies. It\ndoesn\u2019t take much of a history review to see what went wrong.\n\nBurger King\u2019s most successful years came when it was on the attack. It\nopened with \u201cHave it your way,\u201d which twitted McDonald\u2019s mass-\nmanufacturing approach to hamburgers. Then it hit McDonald\u2019s with\n\u2018Broiling, not frying\u201d and \u201cThe Whopper beats the big Mac.\u201d All these\nprograms reinforced the No. 2, alternative position.\n\nThen, for some unknown reason, Burger King ignored the law of the\nopposite. It got timid and stopped attacking McDonald\u2019s. The world was\nintroduced to \u201cHerb the nerd,\u201d \u201cThe best food for fast times,\u201d \u201cWe do it the\nway you do it,\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve got to break the rules,\u201d and on and on. It even\nstarted a program to attract little kids, the mainstay of McDonald\u2019s strength.\n\nThis is no way to stay a strong No. 2. Burger King\u2019s sales per unit\ndeclined and have never returned to the level they were when it was on the\nattack.\n\nBurger King made the mistake of not taking the opposite tack.\n",

                    "extracted-text": "Like an amoeba dividing in a petri dish, the marketing arena can be\nviewed as an ever-expanding sea of categories.\n\nA category starts off as a single entity. Computers, for example. But over\ntime, the category breaks up into other segments. Mainframes,\nminicomputers, workstations, personal computers, laptops, notebooks, pen\ncomputers.\n\nLike the computer, the automobile started off as a single category. Three\nbrands (Chevrolet, Ford, and Plymouth) dominated the market. Then the\ncategory divided. Today we have luxury cars, moderately priced cars, and\ninexpensive cars. Full-size, intermediates, and compacts. Sports cars, four-\nwheel-drive vehicles, RVs, and minivans.\n\nIn the television industry, ABC, CBS, and NBC once accounted for 90\npercent of the viewing audience. Now we have network, independent, cable,\npay, and public television, and soon we\u2019ll have instore and interactive\ntelevision.\n\nBeer started the same way. Today we have imported and domestic beer.\nPremium and popular-priced beers. Light, draft, and dry beers. Even\nnonalcoholic beer.\n\nThe law of division even affects countries. (Witness the mess in\nYugoslavia.) In 1776, there were about 35 empires, kingdoms, countries,\nand states in the world. By World War II, the number had doubled. By 1970,\nthere were more than 130 countries. Today, some 190 countries are\ngenerally recognized as sovereign nations.\n\nLook at the music field. It used to be classical and popular music. To stay\non top of the popular music field you could watch \u201cYour Hit Parade,\u201d which\nfeatured the top 10 hits of the week. Radio adopted the same idea with a\n\u201cTop 40\u201d format. Today Top 40 is falling apart because there isn\u2019t one list\nanymore.\n\nBillboard, the bible of the music business, has 11 separate hit lists:\nclassical, contemporary jazz, country, crossover, dance, Latin, jazz, pop,\nrap, rhythm and blues, and rock. And 11 leaders for the 11 categories. They\nrecently included Itzhak Perlman, Four-play, Garth Brooks, Luciano\nPavarotti, Michael Jackson, Mi Mayor Necesidad, Dave Grusin, Enya,\nPublic Enemy, Vanessa Williams, and Bruce Springsteen.\n\nEach segment is a separate, distinct entity. Each segment has its own\nreason for existence. And each segment has its own leader, which is rarely\nthe same as the leader of the original category. IBM is the leader in\nmainframes, DEC in minis, Sun in workstations, and so on.\n\nInstead of understanding this concept of division, many corporate leaders\nhold the naive belief that categories are combining. Synergy and its kissing\ncousin the corporate alliance are the buzzwords in the boardrooms of\nAmerica. IBM, according to the New York Times, is poised \u201cto take\nadvantage of the coming convergence of whole industries, including\ntelevision, music, publishing and computing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIBM\u2019s strongest suit,\u201d says the Times, \u201cin the expected convergence of\ncable and telephone networks with computer and television manufacturers\nmay be technology that it has developed to create extremely high-speed\nnetworks.\u201d (See chapter 20: The Law of Hype.)\n\nIt won\u2019t happen. Categories are dividing, not combining.\n\nAlso look at the much-touted category called \u201cfinancial services.\u201d In the\nfuture, according to the press, we won\u2019t have banks, insurance companies,\nstockbrokers, or mortgage lenders. We\u2019ll have financial services companies.\nIt hasn\u2019t happened yet.\n\nPrudential, American Express, and others have fallen into the financial\nservices trap. Customers don\u2019t buy financial services. They buy stocks or\nlife insurance or bank accounts. And they prefer to buy each service from a\ndifferent company.\n\nThe way for the leader to maintain its dominance is to address each\nemerging category with a different brand name, as General Motors did in\nthe early days with Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick, and Cadillac\n(and recently with Geo and Saturn).\n\nCompanies make a mistake when they try to take a well-known brand\nname in one category and use the same brand name in another category. A\nclassic example is the fate that befell Volkswagen, the company that\nintroduced the small-car category to America. Its Beetle was a big winner\nthat grabbed 67 percent of the imported-car market in the United States.\n\nVolkswagen was so successful that it began to think it could be like\nGeneral Motors and sell bigger, faster, and sportier cars. So it swept up\nwhatever models it was making in Germany and shipped them all to the\nUnited States. But unlike GM, it used the same brand, Volkswagen, for all\nof its models.\n\n\u201cDifferent Volks for different folks,\u201d said the advertising, which featured\nfive different models, including the Beetle, the 412 Sedan, the Dasher, the\nThing, and even a station wagon. Needless to say, the only thing that kept\nselling was the \u201csmall\u201d thing, the Beetle.\n\nWell, Volkswagen found a way to fix that. It stopped selling the Beetle in\nthe United States and started selling a new family of big, fast, expensive\nVolkswagens. Now you had the Vanagon, the Sirocco, the Jetta, the Golf\nGL, and the Cabriolet. It even built a plant in Pennsylvania to build these\nwondrous new cars.\n\nUnfortunately for Volkswagen, the small-car category continued to\nexpand. And since people couldn\u2019t buy a long-lasting, economical VW, they\nshifted to Toyota, Honda, and Nissan.\n\nToday Volkswagen\u2019s 67 percent share has shrunk to less than 4 percent.\n\nVolkswagen isn\u2019t some minor European brand like Saab or Alfa Romeo.\nVolkswagen is the largest-selling automotive brand in Europe. The cars VW\nsells in the United States are the same as the ones it sells in Europe. Only\nthe minds of the people buying them are different. In America, Volkswagen\nmeans small and ugly. Nobody here wants to buy a big, beautiful\nVolkswagen (chapter 4: The Law of Perception).\n\nOne of Volkswagen\u2019s competitors, Honda, decided to go up-market.\nRather than use the Honda name in the luxury-car market, it introduced the\nAcura. It even took the expensive step of setting up separate Acura\ndealerships to avoid confusion with Honda.\n\nThe Acura became the first Japanese luxury car in the United States,\nwhere today Honda sells many more Acuras than Volkswagen sells\nVolkswagens. Honda now has the leading brand in two categories.\n\nWhat keeps leaders from launching a different brand to cover a new\ncategory is the fear of what will happen to their existing brands. General\nMotors was slow to react to the super premium category that Mercedes-\nBenz and BMW established. One reason was that a new brand on top of\nCadillac would enrage GM\u2019s Cadillac dealers.\n\nEventually, GM tried to take Cadillac up-market with the $54,000\nAllante. It bombed. Why would anyone spend that kind of money on a so-\ncalled Cadillac, since their neighbors would probably think they paid only\n$30,000 or so? No prestige.\n\nA better strategy for General Motors might have been to put a new brand\ninto the Mercedes market. (They might have brought back the classic\nLaSalle.)\n\nTiming is also important. You can be too early to exploit a new category.\nBack in the fifties the Nash Rambler was America\u2019s first small car. But\nAmerican Motors didn\u2019t have either the courage or the money to hang in\nthere long enough for the category to develop.\n\nIt\u2019s better to be early than late. You can\u2019t get into the prospect\u2019s mind first\nunless you\u2019re prepared to spend some time waiting for things to develop.\n",

                    "extracted-text": "Is alcohol a stimulant or a depressant?\n\nIf you visit almost any bar and grill on a Friday night after work, you\u2019d\nswear that alcohol was a stimulant. The noise and laughter are strong\nevidence of alcohol\u2019s stimulating effects. Yet at 4:00 in the morning, when\nyou see a few happy-hour customers sleeping it off in the streets, you\u2019d\nswear that alcohol is a depressant.\n\nChemically, alcohol is a strong depressant. But in the short term, by\ndepressing a person\u2019s inhibitions, alcohol acts like a stimulant.\n\nMany marketing moves exhibit the same phenomenon. The long-term\neffects are often the exact opposite of the short-term effects.\n\nDoes a sale increase a company\u2019s business or decrease it? Obviously, in\nthe short term, a sale increases business. But there\u2019s more and more\n\nevidence to show that sales decrease business in the long term by educating\ncustomers not to buy at \u201cregular\u201d prices.\n\nAside from the fact that you can buy something for less, what does a sale\nsay to a prospect? It says that your regular prices are too high. After the sale\nis over, customers tend to avoid a store with a \u201csale\u201d reputation.\n\nTo maintain volume, retail outlets find they have to run almost\ncontinuous sales. It\u2019s not unusual to walk down a retail block and find a\ndozen stores in a row with \u201cSale\u201d signs in their windows.\n\nHave the automobile rebate programs increased sales? The rise of auto\nrebates have coincided with a decline in auto sales. U.S. vehicle sales have\ndeclined for five straight years in a row.\n\nThe largest furniture company in the New York City area, Seamans, has\nbeen running a sale every week. Recently, Seamans went bankrupt.\n\nThere is no evidence that couponing increases sales in the long run.\nMany companies find they need a quarterly dose of couponing to keep sales\non an even keel. Once they stop couponing, sales drop off.\n\nIn other words, you keep those coupons rolling out not to increase sales\nbut to keep sales from falling off if you stop. Couponing is a drug. You\ncontinue to do it because the withdrawal symptoms are just too painful.\n\nAny sort of couponing, discounts, or sales tends to educate consumers to\nbuy only when they can get a deal. What if a company never started\ncouponing in the first place? In the retail field the big winners are the\ncompanies that practice \u201ceveryday low prices\u201d\u2014 companies like Wal-Mart\nand K Mart and the rapidly growing warehouse outlets.\n\nYet almost everywhere you look you see yo-yo pricing. The airlines and\nthe supermarkets are two examples. Recently, however, Procter & Gamble\nmade a bold move to establish uniform pricing, which could become the\nstart of a trend.\n\nIn everyday life there are many examples of short-term gains and long-\nterm losses, crime being a typical example. If you rob a bank for $100,000\nand wind up spending 10 years in jail, you either made $100,000 for a day\u2019s\nwork or $10,000 a year for 10 years of labor. It depends on your point of\nview.\n\nInflation can give an economy a short-term jolt, but in the long run,\ninflation leads to recession. (The nuts in Brazil haven\u2019t figured this out yet.)\n\nIn the short term, overeating satisfies the psyche, but in the long run it\ncauses obesity and depression.\n\nIn many other areas of life (spending money, taking drugs, having sex)\nthe long-term effects of your actions are often the opposite\u2019 of the short-\nterm effects. Why then is it so hard to comprehend that marketing effects\ntake place over an extended period of time?\n\nTake line extension. In the short term, line extension invariably increases\nsales. The beer industry clearly illustrates this effect. In the early seventies,\nMiller High Life was barreling along with sales increases averaging 27\npercent a year. Miller\u2019s success was fueled by \u201cMiller Time,\u201d a blue-collar\ncampaign focused on rewarding yourself at the end of the day with a Miller\nbeer. Then Miller got greedy and in 1974 introduced Miller Lite, a brilliant\nconcept (chapter 2: The Law of the Category) buried under a line extended\nname.\n\nIn the short term the two Millers could coexist: the blue-collar beer (High\nLife) and the yuppie beer (Lite). But in the long term, line extension was\nbound to undermine one or the other brand.\n\nThe high-water mark for Miller High Life was 1979, five years after the\nintroduction of Miller Lite. In those five years Miller High Life\u2019s annual\nsales almost tripled, from 8.6 million to 23.6 million barrels. This was the\nshort-term effect of line extension.\n\nThe long-term effect was grim. From a high of 23.6 million barrels in\n1979, Miller High Life declined 13 years in a row to just 5.8 million barrels\nin 1991. And the decline is bound to continue.\n\nNor has Miller Lite been immune to the ravages of line extension. In\n1986, the brewer introduced Miller Genuine Draft. The brand took because\nit was the first beer in a new category. Unfortunately, the brand also carried\nthe Miller name. (See the next chapter: The Law of Line Extension.)\nHistory repeats itself. Five years later, Miller Lite peaked in sales and then\nstarted to decline. Once started, the decline is almost impossible to stop.\n\nUnless you know what to look for, it\u2019s hard to see the effects of line\nextension, especially for managers focused on their next quarterly report. (If\na bullet took five years to reach a target, very few criminals would be\nconvicted of homicide.)\n\nThe same thing that happened to Miller happened to Michelob. Three\nyears after the introduction of Michelob Light, regular Michelob peaked in\nsales and then declined 11 years in a row. Today the four Michelob flavors\ncombined (regular, light, dry, and classic dark) sell 25 percent fewer barrels\nthan Michelob alone did in 1978, the year Michelob Light was introduced.\n\nThe same thing happened to Coors. The introduction of Coors Light\ncaused the collapse of Coors regular, which today sells one-fourth of what it\nused to.\n\nEven the king is down. After annual sales increases stretching back to the\nend of Prohibition, Budweiser has been slipping the last three years in a\nrow. The cause? Bud Light.\n\nYou might be thinking that Miller, Coors, and Anheuser-Busch had to\nline extend because light beer has taken over the market. If you believe\nwhat you read in the papers, you\u2019d think that everyone is drinking light\nbeer. Not true. Today, 18 years after the introduction of Miller Lite, light\nbeer still accounts for only 31 percent of the beer market.\n\nIn other areas of marketing, the short-term/long-term line extension\neffects occur much more rapidly. Coca-Cola clothes were introduced by\nMurjani in 1985. Two years later wholesale volume reached $250 million.\nThe following year, the line dried up virtually overnight, saddling Murjani\nwith millions of dollars\u2019 worth of inventory.\n\nWhat happened to Coca-Cola clothes also happened to Donald Trump. At\nfirst, The Donald was successful. Then he branched out and put his name on\nanything the banks would lend him money for. What\u2019s a Trump? A hotel,\nthree casinos, two condominiums, one airline, one shopping center.\n\nFortune magazine called Trump \u201can investor with a keen eye for cash\nflow and asset values, a smart marketer, a cunning wheeler-dealer.\u201d Time\nand Newsweek put The Donald on their covers.\n\nToday Trump is $1.4 billion in debt. What made him successful in the\nshort term is exactly what caused him to fail in the long term. Line\nextension.\n\nIt looks easy, but marketing is not a game for amateurs.\n",

                    "extracted-text": "If violating any of our laws was a punishable offense, a large portion of\ncorporate America would be in jail.\n\nBy far the most violated law in our book is the law of line extension.\nWhat\u2019s even more diabolical is that line extension is a process that takes\nplace continuously, with almost no conscious effort on the part of the\ncorporation. It\u2019s like a closet or a desk drawer that fills up with almost no\neffort on your part.\n\nOne day a company is tightly focused on a single product that is highly\nprofitable. The next day the same company is spread thin over many\nproducts and is losing money.\n\nTake IBM. Years ago when IBM was focused on mainframe computers,\nthe company made a ton of money. Today IBM is into everything and\nbarely breaking even. In 1991, for example, IBM\u2019s revenues were $65\n\nbillion. Yet the company wound up losing $2.8 billion. That\u2019s almost $8\nmillion a day.\n\nIn addition to selling mainframe computers, IBM markets personal\ncomputers, pen computers, workstations, midrange computers, software,\nnetworks, telephones, you name it. IBM even tried to get into the home\ncomputer market with the PCjr.\n\nAlong the way, IBM dropped millions on copiers (sold to Kodak), Rolm\n(sold to Siemens), Satellite Business Systems (shut down), the Prodigy\nnetwork (limping along), SAA, TopView, OfficeVision, and OS/2.\n\nWhen a company becomes incredibly successful, it invariably plants the\nseeds for its future problems. Take Microsoft, the most successful company\nin the software field. (Even though the company is one-fiftieth the size of\nGeneral Motors, Microsoft\u2019s stock is worth more than GM\u2019s.) What is\nMicrosoft\u2019s strategy? In a word, more.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft Corp. said it is aggressively seeking the dominant share in\nevery major software applications category in the personal computer field,\u201d\nsaid the Wall Street Journal recently. \u201cMichael Maples, senior vice\npresident of Microsoft\u2019s applications division, suggested that Microsoft\nmight be able to achieve as much as a 70 percent share in every major\napplications category,\u201d continued the Journal.\n\nWhom does that sound like? Sounds like IBM. Microsoft is setting itself\nup as the next IBM, with all the negative implications the name suggests.\n\nMicrosoft is the leader in personal computer operating systems, but it\ntrails the leaders in each of the following major categories: spreadsheets\n(Lotus is the leader), word processing (WordPerfect is the leader), and\nbusiness graphics (Harvard Graphics from SPC Software Publishing is the\nleader).\n\nMicrosoft keeps puffing itself up by expanding into new categories, such\nas pen computers. Recently, Microsoft bought Fox Software for $170\nmillion in order to get into the data base software field. (What do you bet\nthe company kills the Fox and changes it to Microsoft?)\n\nThere are ominous signs of softness in Microsoft\u2019s strategy. The\nEconomist reported in early 1992, \u201cMr. Gates is putting together a range of\nproducts, based on a common core of technology, that will compete across\nvirtually the whole of the software industry: from big computers to small\nones, and from operating systems in the information engine-room to\ngraphics programs that draw every picture for executives. Nobody in the\n\nsoftware industry has yet managed a venture of that complexity\u2014though\nIBM has tried and failed.\u201d\n\nWhen you try to be all things to all people, you inevitably wind up in\ntrouble. \u201cI\u2019d rather be strong somewhere,\u201d said one manager, \u201cthan weak\neverywhere.\u201d\n\nIn a narrow sense, line extension involves taking the brand name of a\nsuccessful product (e.g., A-1 steak sauce) and putting it on a new product\nyou plan to introduce (e.g., A-1 poultry sauce).\n\nIt sounds so logical. \u201cWe make A-1, a great sauce that gets the dominant\nshare of the steak business. But people are switching from beef to chicken,\nso let\u2019s introduce a poultry product. And what better name to use than A-1.\nThat way people will know the poultry sauce comes from the makers of that\ngreat steak sauce, A-1.\u201d\n\nBut marketing is a battle of perception, not product. In the mind, A-1 is\nnot the brand name, but the steak sauce itself. \u201cWould you pass me the A-\n1?\u201d asks the diner. Nobody replies: \u201cA-1 what?\u201d\n\nIn spite of an $18 million advertising budget, the A-1 poultry launch was\na dismal failure.\n\nThere are as many ways to line extend as there are galaxies in the\nuniverse. And new ways get invented every day. In the long run and in the\npresence of serious competition, line extensions almost never work.\n\nCreating flavors is a popular way to try to grab market share. More\nflavors, more share. Sounds right, but it doesn\u2019t work.\n\nBack in 1978, when 7-Up was simply the lemon-lime uncola, it had a 5.7\npercent share of the soft-drink market. Then the company added 7-Up Gold,\nCherry 7-Up, and assorted diet versions. Today 7-Up\u2019s share is down to 2.5\npercent.\n\nWherever you look, you\u2019! find line extensions, which is one reason why\nstores are choked with brands. (There are 1,300 shampoos, 200 cereals, 250\nsoft drinks.)\n\nInvariably, the leader in any category is the brand that is not line\nextended. Take baby food, for example. Gerber has 72 percent of the\nmarket, way ahead of Beech-Nut and Heinz, the two line-extended brands.\n\nIn spite of evidence that line extensions don\u2019t work, companies continue\nto pump them out. Here are some examples:\n\nIvory soap. Ivory shampoo?\n\nLife Savers candy. Life Savers gum?\n\nBic lighters. Bic pantyhose?\n\nChanel. Chanel for men?\n\nTanqueray gin. Tanqueray vodka?\n\nCoors beer. Coors water?\n\nHeinz ketchup. Heinz baby food?\n\nUSA Today. \u201cUSA Today on TV\u201d?\n\nAdidas running shoes. Adidas cologne?\nPierre Cardin clothing. Pierre Cardin wine?\nLevi\u2019s blue jeans. Levi\u2019s shoes?\n\nColgate-Palmolive: \u201cWe want to leverage our basic core brands and trade\non our brand names to extend into new categories.\u201d Ed Fogarty, President.\n\nCampbell Soup Company: \u201cLeveraging and extending high-quality,\nrepeat-purchase brand names is always preferred over launching a new\nname.\u201d David W. Johnson, CEO.\n\nDel Monte: \u201cWe\u2019re dedicated to the single brand concept. We\u2019re going to\nkeep extending the Del Monte name into new areas.\u201d Ewan MacDonald,\nPresident.\n\nUltra Slim-Fast: \u201cThere will be soups, pastas, salad dressings, soda, fruit\njuices and a new, thicker diet drink called Ultra Slim-Fast Plus.\u201d Daniel\nAbraham, Chairman.\n\n(Good luck and good night, Mr. Abraham.)\n\nWhy does top management believe that line extension works, in spite of\nthe overwhelming evidence to the contrary? One reason is that while line\nextension is a loser in the long term, it can be a winner in the short term\n(chapter 11: The Law of Perspective). Management is also blinded by an\nintense loyalty to the company or brand. Why else would PepsiCo have\nintroduced Crystal Pepsi in spite of the failures of Pepsi Light and Pepsi\nAM?\n\nMore is less. The more products, the more markets, the more alliances a\ncompany makes, the less money it makes. \u201cFull-speed ahead in all\ndirections\u201d seems to be the call from the corporate bridge. When will\ncompanies learn that line extension ultimately leads to oblivion?\n\nLess is more. If you want to be successful today, you have to narrow the\nfocus in order to build a position in the prospect\u2019s mind.\n\nWhat does IBM stand for? It used to stand for \u201cmainframe computers.\u201d\nToday it stands for everything, which means it stands for nothing.\n\nWhy is Sears, Roebuck in trouble? Because the company tried to be all\nthings to all people. Sears was big in hard goods, so it went into soft goods\nand then fashion. The company even hired Cheryl Tiegs. (Do fashion\nmodels really buy their miniskirts at Sears?)\n\nIn the conventional view, a business strategy usually consists of\ndeveloping an all-encompassing vision. In other words, what concept or\nidea is big enough to hold all of a company\u2019s products and services on the\nmarket today as well as those that are planned for the future?\n\nIn the conventional view, strategy is a tent. You stake out a tent big\nenough so it can hold everything you might possibly want to get into.\n\nIBM has erected an enormous computer tent. Nothing in the computer\nfield, today or in the future, will fall outside the IBM tent. This is a recipe\nfor disaster. As new companies, new products, new ideas invade the\ncomputer arena, IBM is going to get blown away. You can\u2019t defend a\nrapidly growing market like computers even if you are a financial\npowerhouse like IBM. From a strategic point of view, you have to be much\nmore selective, picking and choosing the area in which to pitch your tent.\n\nStrategically, General Motors is in the same boat as IBM. GM is into\nanything and everything on wheels. Sedans, sports cars, cheap cars,\nexpensive cars, trucks, minivans, even electric cars. So what is GM\u2019s\nbusiness strategy? If it runs on the road, or off the road, we\u2019ll chase it.\n\nFor many companies, line extension is the easy way out. Launching a\nnew brand requires not only money, but also an idea or concept. For a new\nbrand to succeed, it ought to be first in a new category (chapter 1: The Law\nof Leadership). Or the new brand ought to be positioned as an alternative to\nthe leader (chapter 9: The Law of the Opposite). Companies that wait until a\nnew market has developed often find these two leadership positions already\npreempted. So they fall back on the old reliable line extension approach.\n\nThe antidote for line extension is corporate courage, a commodity in\nshort supply.\n\n",

                    "extracted-text": "The law of sacrifice is the opposite of the law of line extension. If you\nwant to be successful today, you should give something up.\n\nThere are three things to sacrifice: product line, target market, and\nconstant change.\n\nFirst, the product line. Where is it written that the more you have to sell,\nthe more you sell?\n\nThe full line is a luxury for a loser. If you want to be successful, you have\nto reduce your product line, not expand it. Take Emery Air Freight. Emery\nwas in the air freight services business. Anything you wanted to ship you\ncould ship via Emery. Small packages, large packages, overnight service,\ndelayed service.\n\nFrom a marketing point of view, what did Federal Express do? It\nconcentrated on one service: small packages overnight. Today Federal\n\nExpress is a much bigger company than Emery.\n\nThe power of the sacrifice for Federal Express was in being able to put\nthe word overnight in the mind of the prospect. When it absolutely,\npositively had to be there overnight, you would call Federal Express.\n\nThen what did Federal Express do? The company did the same thing\nEmery did. It threw away its overnight position by buying Tiger\nInternational\u2019s Flying Tiger cargo line for $880 million. Now Federal\nExpress is a worldwide air cargo company without a worldwide position. In\njust 21 months Federal Express lost $1.1 billion in its international\noperations.\n\nMarketing is a game of mental warfare. It\u2019s a battle of perceptions, not\nproducts or services. In the mind of the prospect, Federal Express is the\novernight company. Federal Express owns the overnight position. When the\nmarket turned international, Federal Express faced a classic marketing\ndilemma. Should it try to take a domestic name into the international field?\nOr should it create a new worldwide name? Furthermore, how should it deal\nwith DHL, the company that got into the international field first?\n\nIt\u2019s bad enough that Federal Express walked away from the \u201covernight\u201d\nidea. What\u2019s worse is that it didn\u2019t replace the idea with a new one.\n\nEveready was the long-time leader in batteries. But new technology\narrived\u2014as it does in most industries. The first technology to change the\nbattery business was the heavy-duty battery. What would you call your\nheavy-duty battery if you had the No. 1 name in batteries? You\u2019d probably\ncall it the Eveready heavy-duty battery, which is what Eveready did.\n\nThen the alkaline battery arrived. Again, Eveready called its alkaline\nbattery the Eveready alkaline battery. It seemed to make sense.\n\nThen P.R. Mallory introduced a line of alkaline batteries only.\nFurthermore, the company gave the line a better name: Duracell.\n\nThe power of the sacrifice for Duracell was in being able to put the\n\u201clong-lasting battery\u201d idea in the mind of the prospect. Duracell lasts twice\nas long as Eveready, said the advertising.\n\nEveready was forced to change the name of its alkaline battery to \u201cthe\nEnergizer.\u201d But it was too late. Duracell had already become the leader in\nthe battery market.\n\nThe world of business is populated by big, highly diversified generalists\nand small, narrowly focused specialists. If line extension and diversification\n\nwere effective marketing strategies, you\u2019d expect to see the generalists\nriding high. But they\u2019re not. Most of them are in trouble.\n\nThe generalist is weak. Take Kraft, for example. Everybody thinks Kraft\nis a strong brand name. In jellies and jams, Kraft has 9 percent of the\nmarket. But Smucker\u2019s has 35 percent. Kraft means everything, but with a\nname like Smucker\u2019s, it has to be jelly or jam because that\u2019s all Smucker\u2019s\nmakes. In mayonnaise, Kraft has 18 percent of the market. But Hellmann\u2019s\nhas 42 percent.\n\n(Kraft does have a leading brand in terms of market share. However, its\nname isn\u2019t Kraft, it\u2019s Philadelphia. Philadelphia brand cream cheese has 70\npercent of the cream cheese market.)\n\nTake the retail industry. Which retailers are in trouble today? The\ndepartment stores. And what\u2019s a department store? A place that sells\neverything. That\u2019s a recipe for disaster.\n\nCampeau, L.J. Hooker, and Gimbels all wound up in bankruptcy court.\nAmes department stores filed for bankruptcy. Hills department stores filed\nfor bankruptcy. Macy\u2019s, the owner of the world\u2019s largest store, filed for\nbankruptcy.\n\nInterstate Department Stores also went bankrupt. So the company looked\nat the books and decided to focus on the only product it made money on:\ntoys. As long as Interstate was going to focus on toys, it decided to change\nits name to Toys \u201cA\u201d Us. Today Toys \u201cA\u201d Us does 20 percent of the retail\ntoy business in the country. Very profitably, too. In its last fiscal year, Toys\n\u201c3\u201d Us made $326 million on sales of $5.5 billion.\n\nMany retail chains are successfully patterning themselves on the Toys \u201c4\n\u201d Us formula: a narrow focus with in-depth stock. Staples (office supplies)\nand Blockbuster Video are two recent examples.\n\nIn the retail field generally, the big successes are the specialists:\n\n* The Limited. Upscale clothing for working women.\n\n* The Gap. Casual clothing for the young at heart.\n\n+ Benetton. Wool and cotton clothing for young swingers.\n* Victoria\u2019s Secret. Sexy undergarments.\n\n+ Foot Locker. Athletic shoes.\n\n+ Banana Republic. Safari wear.\n\n(When a clothing chain with a name like Banana Republic can be\nsuccessful, you know we live in the age of the specialist.)\n\nLet\u2019s discuss the second sacrifice, target market. Where is it written that\nyou have to appeal to everybody?\n\nTake the cola field. Coca-Cola got into the prospect\u2019s mind first and built\na powerful position. In the late fifties, for example, Coke outsold Pepsi\nmore than five to one. What could Pepsi-Cola do to go against Coke\u2019s\npowerful position?\n\nIn the early sixties Pepsi-Cola finally developed a strategy based on the\nconcept of sacrifice. The company sacrificed everything except the teenage\nmarket. Then it brilliantly exploited this market by hiring its icons: Michael\nJackson, Lionel Richie, Don Johnson.\n\nWithin one generation, Pepsi closed the gap. Today it is only 10 percent\nbehind Coca-Cola in total U.S. cola sales. (In the supermarket, Pepsi-Cola\nactually outsells Coca-Cola.)\n\nIn spite of Pepsi-Cola\u2019s success, however, the pressure for enlarging the\ntent is always present. Recently it succumbed to temptation. According to\nAdvertising Age, \u201cPepsi-Cola Co. has outgrown the Pepsi generation. In a\nmajor marketing shift, flagship Pepsi will be pitched as the soft drink for the\nmasses.\u201d\n\n\u201cGotta have it\u201d is Pepsi\u2019s new theme. The advertising shows older people\nlike Yogi Berra and Regis Philbin drinking Pepsi.\n\n\u201cThe one drawback of Pepsi advertising in the past has been a little too\nmuch focus on youth,\u201d says Phil Dusenberry of Pepsi\u2019s ad agency BBDO.\n\u201cWe could have made greater gains had we expanded our horizons to cast a\nwider net and catch more people.\u201d\n\nAccording to Fortune magazine, Coca-Cola is the world\u2019s most powerful\ntrademark. When an also-ran like Pepsi-Cola develops a narrowly focused\nstrategy that puts it within an eyelash of the leader, why would it change its\npowerful strategy?\n\nWhy indeed! There seems to be an almost religious belief that the wider\nnet catches more customers, in spite of many examples to the contrary.\n\nTake Budweiser, for example. \u201cWhen we go out to develop a plan for\nBudweiser, we have to cover everybody above 21 years of age, whether\nthey\u2019re male, female, black, white,\u201d says August Busch IV.\n\nLook at cigarette advertisements, especially old cigarette ads. They\ninvariably show both a man and a woman. Why? In an age when most\n\nsmokers were men, cigarette manufacturers wanted to broaden their market.\nWe got the men, let\u2019s go out and get the women, too.\n\nSo what did Philip Morris do? It narrowed the focus to men only. And\nthen it narrowed the focus even more to a man\u2019s man, the cowboy. The\nbrand was called Marlboro. Today, Marlboro is the largest-selling cigarette\nin the world. In the United States, Marlboro is the largest-selling cigarette\namong men and women.\n\nThe target is not the market. That is, the apparent target of your\nmarketing is not the same as the people who will actually buy your product.\nEven though Pepsi-Cola\u2019s target was the teenager, the market was\neverybody. The 50-year-old guy who wants to think he\u2019s 29 will drink the\nPepsi.\n\nThe target of Marlboro advertising is the cowboy, but the market is\neverybody. Do you know how many cowboys are left in America? Very\nfew. (They\u2019ve all been smoking Marlboros.)\n\nFinally, the third sacrifice: constant change. Where is it written that you\nhave to change your strategy every year at budget review time?\n\nIf you try to follow the twists and turns of the market, you are bound to\nwind up off the road. The best way to maintain a consistent position is not\nto change it in the first place.\n\nPeople Express had a brilliant \u201cnarrow\u201d position to start with. It was the\nno-frills airline that flew to no-frills cities at no-frills prices. People used to\nget on a People Express plane and say, \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d They didn\u2019t\ncare, as long as it was cheap enough.\n\nWhat did People Express do after it became successful? It tried to be all\nthings to all people. It invested in new equipment, like 747s. It started to fly\nthe heavily traveled routes to places like Chicago and Denver, not to\nmention Europe. It bought Frontier Airlines. It added frills, like first-class\nsections.\n\nPeople Express promptly lost altitude and only escaped bankruptcy court\nby selling itself to Texas Air, which did it for them.\n\nWhite Castle, on the other hand, has never changed its position. A White\nCastle today not only looks the same as a White Castle did 60 years ago, it\nalso sells the same \u201cfrozen sliders\u201d at unbelievably low prices. Would you\nbelieve the average White Castle does more than $1 million a year in\nrevenues? (That\u2019s more than Burger King and not too far behind\nMcDonald\u2019s.)\n\n\nGood things come to those who sacrifice.\n",

You must try and own the most\nimportant attribute.\n\nCavity prevention is the most important attribute in toothpaste. It\u2019s the\none to own. But the law of exclusivity points to the simple truth that once\nan attribute is successfully taken by your competition, it\u2019s gone. You must\nmove on to a lesser attribute and live with a smaller share of the category.\nYour job is to seize a different attribute, dramatize the value of your\nattribute, and thus increase your share.\n\nFor many years IBM dominated the world of computers with its\nattributes of \u201cbig\u201d and \u201cpowerful.\u201d Companies that tried to move in on\nthose attributes had little success. RCA, GE, UNIVAC, Burroughs,\nHoneywell, NCR, and Control Data lost a lot of money on mainframe\ncomputers. Then an upstart from Boston went for the attribute of \u201csmall\u201d\nand the minicomputer was born. They probably laughed in Armonk because\nthey knew corporate America wanted \u201cbig and powerful.\u201d Today \u201csmall\u201d\nhas grown to such proportions that IBM\u2019s vast mainframe empire is in\nserious trouble.\n\nA company that never laughs at new attributes that are exactly the\nopposite of their current products is Gillette, the world\u2019s No.1 razor blade\nmaker. Its dominance revolves around its high-technology razors and\ncartridge systems. When an upstart from France brought an opposite\nattribute to the category in the form of a \u201cdisposable\u201d razor, Gillette could\nhave laughed and wheeled out its research on how America wants hefty,\nexpensive, high-technology razors. But it didn\u2019t.\n\nInstead, Gillette jumped in with a disposable razor of its own, called\nGood News. By spending heavily, Gillette was able to win the battle of the\ndisposables.\n\nToday the Gillette Good News razor dominates the disposable category,\nwhich has grown to dominate the razor blade business. Moral: You can\u2019t\npredict the size of a new attribute\u2019s share, so never laugh.\n\nBurger King was unsuccessful when it tried to take the attribute \u201cfast\u201d\nfrom McDonald\u2019s. What should Burger King have done? Use the opposite\n\nattribute? The exact opposite attribute, \u201cslow,\u201d won\u2019t do for a fast-food\nplace (although there is an element of slowness in Burger King\u2019s \u201cbroiling\u201d\nconcept).\n\nA single trip to any McDonald\u2019s should be enough to find another\nattribute that McDonald\u2019s owns: \u201ckids.\u201d This is indeed the place to which\nkids drag their parents, and McDonald\u2019s has the swing sets to prove it. This\nsets up an opportunity vividly demonstrated by the Coke and Pepsi battle. If\nMcDonald\u2019s owns kids, then Burger King has the opportunity to position\nitself for the older crowd, which includes any kid who doesn\u2019t want to be\nperceived as a kid. That generally works out to be everyone over the age of\n10 (not a bad market).\n\nTo make the concept work, Burger King would have to invoke the law of\nsacrifice and give all the little kids to McDonald\u2019s. While this might mean\ngetting rid of a few swing sets, it also allows Burger King to hang \u201ckiddie\nland\u201d on McDonald\u2019s (chapter 9: The Law of the Opposite).\n\nTo drive the concept into prospects\u2019 minds, Burger King would need a\nterm. It could be grow up. Grow up to the flame-broiled taste of Burger\nKing.\n\nThe new concept for Burger King would strike fear and terror in the\nboardroom at McDonald\u2019s, always a good sign of an effective program.\n",

                    "extracted-text": "It goes against corporate and human nature to admit a problem. For years,\nthe power of positive thinking has been drummed into us. \u201cThink positive\u201d\nhas been the subject of endless books and articles.\n\nSo it may come as a surprise to you that one of the most effective ways to\nget into a prospect\u2019s mind is to first admit a negative and then twist it into a\npositive.\n\n\u201cAvis is only No. 2 in rent-a-cars.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith a name like Smucker\u2019s, it has to be good.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe 1970 VW will stay ugly longer.\u201d\n\n\u201cJoy. The most expensive perfume in the world.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s going on here? Why does a dose of honesty work so well in the\nmarketing process?\n\nFirst and foremost, candor is very disarming. Every negative statement\nyou make about yourself is instantly accepted as truth. Positive statements,\non the other hand, are looked at as dubious at best. Especially in an\nadvertisement.\n\nYou have to prove a positive statement to the prospect\u2019s satisfaction. No\nproof is needed for a negative statement.\n\n\u201cThe 1970 VW will stay ugly longer.\u201d A car that ugly must be reliable,\nthinks the prospect.\n\n\u201cJoy. The most expensive perfume in the world.\u201d If people are willing to\npay $375 an ounce, it must be a sensational perfume.\n\n\u201cWith a name like Smucker\u2019s, it has to be good.\u201d Most companies,\nespecially family companies, would never make fun of their own name. Yet\nthe Smucker family did, which is one reason why Smucker\u2019s is the No.1\nbrand of jams and jellies. If your name is bad, you have two choices:\nchange the name or make fun of it. The one thing you can\u2019t do is to ignore a\nbad name. Which is one reason why you won\u2019t find beer brands like\nGablinger\u2019s, Grolsch, and Gresedieck in your supermarket today.\n\n\u201cAvis is only No. 2 in rent-a-cars.\u201d So why go with them? They must try\nharder. Everybody knew that Avis was second in rent-a-cars.\n\nSo why go with the obvious? Marketing is often a search for the obvious.\nSince you can\u2019t change a mind once it\u2019s made up, your marketing efforts\nhave to be devoted to using ideas and concepts already installed in the\nbrain. You have to use your marketing programs to \u201crub it in.\u201d No program\ndid this as brilliantly as the Avis No. 2 program.\n\nPositive thinking has been highly overrated. The explosive growth of\ncommunications in our society has made people defensive and cautious\nabout companies trying to sell them anything. Admitting a problem is\nsomething that very few companies do.\n\nWhen a company starts a message by admitting a problem, people tend\nto, almost instinctively, open their minds. Think about the times that\nsomeone came to you with a problem and how quickly you got involved\nand wanted to help. Now think about people starting off a conversation\nabout some wonderful things they are doing. You probably were a lot less\ninterested.\n\nNow with that mind open, you\u2019re in a position to drive in the positive,\nwhich is your selling idea. Some years ago, Scope entered the mouthwash\nmarket with a \u201cgood-tasting\u201d mouthwash, thus exploiting Listerine\u2019s truly\nterrible taste.\n\nWhat should Listerine do? It certainly couldn\u2019t tell people that Listerine\u2019s\ntaste \u201cwasn\u2019t all that bad.\u201d That would raise a red flag that would reinforce\na negative perception. Things could get worse. Instead, Listerine brilliantly\ninvoked the law of candor: \u201cThe taste you hate twice a day.\u201d\n\nNot only did the company admit the product tasted bad, it admitted that\npeople actually hated it. (Now that\u2019s honesty.) This set up the selling idea\nthat Listerine \u201ckills a lot of germs.\u201d\n\nThe prospect figured that anything that tastes like disinfectant must\nindeed be a germ killer. A crisis passed with the help of a heavy dose of\ncandor.\n\nAs another example, General Foods admitted that Grape-Nuts cereal was\na \u201clearned pleasure\u201d and advised consumers to \u201ctry it for a week.\u201d Sales\nwent up 23 percent.\n\nOne final note: The law of candor must be used carefully and with great\nskill. First, your \u201cnegative\u201d must be widely perceived as a negative. It has to\ntrigger an instant agreement with your prospect\u2019s mind. If the negative\ndoesn\u2019t register quickly, your prospect will be confused and will wonder,\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this all about?\u201d\n\nNext, you have to shift quickly to the positive. The purpose of candor\nisn\u2019t to apologize. The purpose of candor is to set up a benefit that will\nconvince your prospect.\n\nThis law only proves the old maxim: Honesty is the best policy.\n",

                    "extracted-text": "Many marketing people see success as the sum total of a lot of small\nefforts beautifully executed.\n\nThey think they can pick and choose from a number of different\nstrategies and still be successful as long as they put enough effort into the\nprogram. If they work for the leader in the category, they fritter away their\nresources on a number of different programs. They seem to think that the\nbest way to grow is the puppy approach\u2014get into everything.\n\nIf they\u2019re not with the leader, they often end up trying to do the same as\nthe leader, but a little better. It\u2019s like Saddam Hussein saying that all we\nhave to do is fight a little harder and everything will work out. Trying\nharder is not the secret of marketing success.\n\nWhether you try hard or try easy, the differences are marginal.\nFurthermore, the bigger the company, the more the law of averages wipes\nout any real advantage of a trying-harder approach.\n\nHistory teaches that the only thing that works in marketing is the single,\nbold stroke. Furthermore, in any given situation there is only one move that\nwill produce substantial results.\n\nSuccessful generals study the battleground and look for that one bold\nstroke that is least expected by the enemy. Finding one is difficult. Finding\nmore than one is usually impossible.\n\nMilitary strategist and author B.H. Liddell Hart calls this bold stroke \u201cthe\nline of, least expectation.\u201d The Allied invasion came at Normandy, a place\nwhose tide and rocky shore the Germans felt would be an unlikely choice\nfor a landing of any scale.\n\nSo it is in marketing. Most often there is only one place where a\ncompetitor is vulnerable. And that place should be the focus of the entire\ninvading force.\n\nThe automobile industry is an interesting case in point. For years, the\nleader\u2019s main strength was in the middle of the line. With brands like\nChevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick, and Cadillac, General Motors easily\nbeat back frontal assaults by Ford, Chrysler, and American Motors. (The\nEdsel fiasco is a typical example.) GM\u2019s dominance became legendary.\n\nWhat works in marketing is the same as what works in the military: the\nunexpected.\n\nHannibal came over the Alps, a route deemed impossible to scale. Hitler\ncame around the Maginot Line and sent his panzer divisions through the\nArdennes, terrain the French generals thought impossible to traverse with\ntanks. (As a matter of fact, he did it twice\u2014once in the Battle of France and\nagain in the Battle of the Bulge.)\n\nIn recent years there have been only two strong moves made against GM.\nBoth were flanking moves around the GM Maginot Line. The Japanese\ncame at the low end with small cars like Toyota, Datsun, and Honda. The\nGermans came at the high end with super premium cars like Mercedes and\nBMW.\n\nWith the success of Japanese and German flanking attacks, General\nMotors was under pressure to commit resources in an attempt to shore up\nthe bottom and the top of its lines. (Cadillacs were too cheap to block the\nhigh-priced German imports.)\n\nIn an effort to save money and maintain profits, GM made the fateful\ndecision to build many of its midrange cars using the same body style.\nSuddenly, no one could tell a Chevrolet from a Pontiac or an Oldsmobile or\na Buick. They all looked alike.\n\nIts look-alike cars weakened General Motors in the middle and opened\nup a move for Ford as it broke through with the European-styled Taurus and\nSable. And then the Japanese jumped in with Acura, Lexus, and Infiniti.\nNow General Motors is weak across the board.\n\nLook at Coke. At present, Coca-Cola is fighting a two-front battle with\nClassic and New Coke. While Coca-Cola Classic has regained a lot of its\noriginal strength, New Coke (an Edsel from Atlanta) is barely hanging on.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen endless slogans for Coca-Cola: \u201cWe have a taste for you.\u201d\n\u201cThe real choice.\u201d \u201cCatch the Wave.\u201d \u201cRed, white, and you.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t\nbeat the feeling.\u201d And now, \u201cYou can\u2019t beat the real thing.\u201d Nothing has\nmoved the needle very much.\n\nThe folks at Coca-Cola keep trying. They\u2019ve even hired a Hollywood\ntalent agency to contribute creative ideas.\n\nAny day now, the new shooters will parade into an Atlanta conference\nroom and paper the wall with a new set of slogans. Top Coke management\nwill then sit around and discuss the latest batch of creative moves. While\nit\u2019s theoretically possible to stumble across the right idea if you haphazardly\ngenerate all the ideas you can possibly think of, it\u2019s not an efficient way to\nwork.\n\nCoke needs to make progress beyond just buying business. As we see it,\nCoke has only one two-part move to make\u2014one part is a step backward, the\nother is a step forward.\n\nFirst of all, Coke has to bite the bullet and drop New Coke. Not because\nit\u2019s a loser or an embarrassment, but because the existence of New Coke\nblocks the company from effectively using the only weapon it has.\n\nWith New Coke safely tucked away in the archives, Coke would be able\nto invoke the law of focus and bring back the concept of the \u201cReal Thing\u201d\nand use it against Pepsi.\n\nTo pull the trigger, Coke could go on television and say to the Pepsi\nGeneration, \u201cAll right kids, we\u2019re not going to push you. When you\u2019re\nready for the Real Thing, we\u2019ve got it for you.\u201d That would be the\nbeginning of the end of the Pepsi Generation (if Pepsi-Cola hadn\u2019t already\nkilled it off all by itself).\n\n\nNot only is this idea simple and powerful, but it\u2019s really the only move\navailable to Coke. It exploits the only words that Coke owns in the minds of\nits prospects: The Real Thing.\n\nTo find that singular idea or concept, marketing managers have to know\nwhat\u2019s happening in the marketplace. They have to be down at the front in\nthe mud of the battle. They have to know what\u2019s working and what isn\u2019t.\nThey have to be involved.\n\nBecause of the high cost of mistakes, management can\u2019t afford to\ndelegate important marketing decisions. That\u2019s what happened at General\nMotors. When the financial people took over, the marketing programs\ncollapsed. Their interest was in the numbers, not the brands. The irony is\nthat the numbers went south, along with the brands.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to find that single move if you\u2019re hanging around headquarters\nand not involved in the process.\n",

                    "extracted-text": "Implicit in most marketing plans is an assumption about the future. Yet\nmarketing plans based on what will happen in the future are usually wrong.\n\nWith hundreds of computers and an army of meteorologists, no one can\npredict the weather three days in advance, so how do you expect to predict\nyour market three years in advance?\n\nIBM developed a massive marketing plan to hook up all PCs to its\nmainframes. The company called it OfficeVision. Yet the plan is dead in the\nwater thanks to developments at Sun Microsystems, Microsoft, and other\ncompanies. You might say that OfficeVision foresaw everything but the\ncompetition.\n\nFailure to forecast competitive reaction is a major reason for marketing\nfailures. When Pickett was asked which Confederate leader was responsible\nfor the defeat at Gettysburg, he replied, \u201cI\u2019ve always thought the Yankees\nhad something to do with it.\u201d\n\nYet there are those who would say that America\u2019s big problem is the lack\nof the long view, that American management is too short term in its\nthinking. Won\u2019t eliminating long-term plans make things even worse?\n\nOn the surface those concerns are real. But it\u2019s important to understand\nwhat is meant by long term versus short term. Most of corporate America\u2019s\nproblems are not related to short-term marketing thinking. The problem is\nshort-term financial thinking.\n\nMost companies live from quarterly report to quarterly report. That\u2019s a\nrecipe for problems. Companies that live by the numbers, die by the\nnumbers. Harold Geneen of ITT fame is one man in recent times who best\nexemplifies this approach. He would wheel and deal and beat up his\nmanagers for ever-increasing earnings.\n\nGeneen\u2019s efforts resulted in a house of cards that eventually fell apart.\nToday ITT is a shell of what it once was. Good accounting, bad marketing.\n\nGeneral Motors was doing fine until the financial folks took over and put\nthe focus on the numbers instead of the brands. They allowed Alfred P.\nSloan\u2019s plan of differentiated brands to fall apart. Every division head, in\norder to make their short-term numbers, started to chase the middle of the\nmarket.\n\nGood short-term planning is coming up with that angle or word that\ndifferentiates your product or company. Then you set up a coherent long-\nterm marketing direction that builds a program to maximize that idea or\nangle. It\u2019s not a long-term plan, it\u2019s a long-term direction.\n\nTom Monaghan\u2019s short-term angle at Domino\u2019s Pizza was to come up\nwith that \u201chome delivery\u201d idea and build a system that delivered pizzas\nquickly and efficiently. His long-term direction was to build the first\nnationwide home delivery chain as rapidly as possible.\n\nMonaghan couldn\u2019t own the words home delivery until he had enough\nfranchisees to afford national advertising. He accomplished both objectives,\nand today Domino\u2019s is a $2.65 billion company with a 4 percent share of\nthe home delivery business. Monaghan did it all without a complex, 10-year\nplan.\n\nSo what can you do? How can you best cope with unpredictability?\nWhile you can\u2019t predict the future, you can get a handle on trends, which is\na way to take advantage of change. One example of a trend is America\u2019s\ngrowing orientation toward good health. This trend has opened the door for\na number of new products, especially healthier foods. The recent runaway\nsuccess of Healthy Choice frozen entr\u00e9es is a clear example of a product\nthat took advantage of this long-term trend.\n\nConAgra introduced Healthy Choice in March 1989. Years earlier,\nhowever, there were plenty of low-sodium, low-fat, light brands on the\nmarket. But these healthy ideas were buried under line extension names.\nConAgra was the first to use a simple name and concept to take advantage\nof a trend that has been going on for years.\n\nUnfortunately, ConAgra is well on its way to confusing things with a\nwide array of Healthy Choice line extensions that go way beyond entr\u00e9es. It\nis violating the law of sacrifice.\n\nThe danger in working with trends is extrapolation. Many companies\njump to conclusions about how far a trend will go. If you believed the\nprognosticators of a few years ago, everyone today is eating broiled fish or\nmesquite-barbecued chicken. (Hamburger sales are doing just fine, thank\nyou.)\n\nEqually as bad as extrapolating a trend is the common practice of\nassuming the future will be a replay of the present. When you assume that\nnothing will change, you are predicting the future just as surely as when you\nassume that something will change. Remember Peter\u2019s Law: The\nunexpected always happens.\n\nWhile tracking trends can be a useful tool in dealing with the\nunpredictable future, market research can be more of a problem than a help.\nResearch does best at measuring the past. New ideas and concepts are\nalmost impossible to measure. No one has a frame of reference. People\ndon\u2019t know what they will do until they face an actual decision.\n\nThe classic example is the research conducted before Xerox introduced\nthe plain-paper copier. What came back was the conclusion that no one\nwould pay five cents for a plain-paper copy when they could get a\nThermofax copy for a cent and a half.\n\nXerox ignored the research, and the rest is history.\n\nOne way to cope with an unpredictable world is to build an enormous\namount of flexibility into your organization. As change comes sweeping\n\nthrough your category, you have to be willing to change and change quickly\nif you are to survive in the long term.\n\nYesterday, General Motors was slow to react to the small-car trend. It has\ncost the company dearly.\n\nToday, IBM is slow to acknowledge the trend away from mainframes. It\ncould cost the company dearly.\n\nAt present, the workstation is a real threat to both mainframes and\nminicomputers. It offers enormous power at very low cost. If IBM is going\nto protect its computer leadership, the company must become a serious\nplayer in a category dominated by Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard.\n\nA natural move would be to introduce a new generic. IBM\u2019s best\nopportunity might be to name its new line of high-powered workstations\n\u201cPMs,\u201d just as it did with its very successful \u201cPCs.\u201d \u201cPM\u201d could stand for\n\u201cpersonal mainframe.\u201d These two generic words dramatically capture the\nspeed and power of these new desktop machines. They are also words that\nIBM owns in the mind. The combination would be very powerful.\n\nThe only problem with a concept like this probably lies inside IBM itself.\nThe term personal mainframe would strike terror in IBM\u2019s mainframe\ndivision as well as in its personal computer division. We suggest that the\nphones would ring and the case would quickly be made that a \u201cpersonal\nmainframe\u201d would undermine these two important sources of income.\n\nIt\u2019s probably true that a personal mainframe product would undermine\nIBM\u2019s two other main sources of revenue, but a company must be flexible\nenough to attack itself with a new idea. Change isn\u2019t easy, but it\u2019s the only\nway to cope with an unpredictable future.\n\nOne final note that\u2019s worth mentioning: There\u2019s a difference between\n\u201cpredicting\u201d the future and \u201ctaking a chance\u201d on the future. Orville\nRedenbacher\u2019s Gourmet Popping Corn took a chance that people would pay\ntwice as much for a high-end popcorn. Not a bad risk in today\u2019s affluent\nsociety.\n\nNo one can predict the future with any degree of certainty. Nor should\nmarketing plans try to.\n",

                    "extracted-text": "Ego is the enemy of successful marketing.\n\nObjectivity is what\u2019s needed.\n\nWhen people become successful, they tend to become less objective.\nThey often substitute their own judgment for what the market wants.\n\nDonald Trump and Robert Maxwell are two examples of people blinded\nby early success and untainted by humility. And when you\u2019re blind, it is\nindeed hard to focus.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s strategy was to put his name on everything, committing the\ncardinal sin of line extension. (Denial seems to go hand in hand with a big\nego. When we first met The Donald, his opening remarks were about how\npeople accuse him of having a big ego. He went on to state that it was\ntotally untrue, he did not have a big ego. All the while, it was hard to avoid\n\nnoticing a three-foot-high brass \u201cT\u201d sitting on the floor next to his desk. So\nmuch for the sermon.)\n\nSuccess is often the fatal element behind the rash of line extensions.\nWhen a brand is successful, the company assumes the name is the primary\nreason for the brand\u2019s success. So they promptly look for other products to\nplaster the name on.\n\nActually it\u2019s the opposite. The name didn\u2019t make the brand famous\n(although a bad name might keep the brand from becoming famous). The\nbrand got famous because you made the right marketing moves. In other\nwords, the steps you took were in tune with the fundamental laws of\nmarketing.\n\nYou got into the mind first. You narrowed the focus. You preempted a\npowerful attribute.\n\nYour success puffs up your ego to such an extent that you put the famous\nname on other products. Result: early success and long-term failure as\nillustrated by the failure of Donald Trump.\n\nThe more you identify with your brand or corporate name, the more\nlikely you are to fall into the line extension trap. \u201cIt can\u2019t be the name,\u201d you\nmight be thinking when things go wrong. \u201cWe have a great name.\u201d Pride\ngoeth before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall. Proverbs 16:18.\n\nTom Monaghan of Domino\u2019s Pizza is one of the few executives who have\nrecognized how ego can lead you astray. \u201cYou start thinking you can do\nanything. I was that way back in the early days. I got into frozen pizzas for\na while and that was a disaster. If I hadn\u2019t messed around with those frozen\npizzas for the better part of a year, trying to sell them in bars and\nrestaurants, Domino\u2019s probably would have a lot more stores by now.\u201d\n\nActually, ego is helpful. It can be an effective driving force in building a\nbusiness. What hurts is injecting your ego in the marketing process.\nBrilliant marketers have the ability to think like a prospect thinks. They put\nthemselves in the shoes of their customers. They don\u2019t impose their own\nview of the world on the situation. (Keep in mind that the world is all\nperception anyway, and the only thing that counts in marketing is the\ncustomer\u2019s perception.)\n\nAs their successes mounted, companies like General Motors, Sears,\nRoebuck, and IBM became arrogant. They felt they could do anything they\nwanted to in the marketplace. Success leads to failure.\n\nConsider Digital Equipment Corporation, the company that brought us\nthe minicomputer. Starting from scratch, DEC became an enormously\nsuccessful $14 billion company.\n\nDEC\u2019s founder is Kenneth Olsen. His success made Ken such a believer\nin his own view of the computer world that he pooh-poohed the personal\ncomputer, then open systems, and, finally, reduced instruction set\ncomputing (RISC). In other words, Ken Olsen ignored three of the biggest\ndevelopments in the computer category. (A trend is like the tide\u2014you don\u2019t\nfight it.) Today Ken Olsen is out.\n\nThe bigger the company, the more likely it is that the chief executive has\nlost touch with the front lines. This might be the single most important\nfactor limiting the growth of a corporation. All other factors favor size.\nMarketing is war, and the first principle of warfare is the principle of force.\nThe larger army, the larger company, has the advantage.\n\nBut the larger company gives up some of that advantage if it cannot keep\nitself focused on the marketing battle that takes place in the mind of the\ncustomer.\n\nThe shootout at General Motors between Roger Smith and Ross Perot\nillustrates the point. When he was on the GM board, Ross Perot spent his\nweekends visiting dealers and buying cars. He was critical of Roger Smith\nfor not doing the same.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to nuke the GM system,\u201d Perot said. He advocated atom-\nbombing the heated garages, chauffeur-driven limousines, executive dining\nrooms. (Chauffeur-driven limousines for a company trying to sell cars?)\n\nIf you\u2019re a busy CEO, how do you gather objective information on what\nis really happening? How do you get around the propensity of middle\nmanagement to tell you what they think you want to hear?\n\nHow do you get the bad news as well as the good?\n\nOne possibility is to go \u201cin disguise\u201d or unannounced. This is especially\nuseful at the distributor or retailer level. In many ways this is analogous to\nthe king who dresses up as a commoner and mingles with his subjects.\nReason: to get honest opinions of what\u2019s happening.\n\nLike kings, chief executives rarely get honest opinions from their\nministers. There\u2019s too much intrigue going on at the court.\n\nAnother aspect of the problem is the allocation of time. Quite often the\nCEO\u2019s time is taken up with too many United Way meetings, too many\n\nindustry activities, too many outside board meetings, too many testimonial\ndinners.\n\nAccording to one survey, the average CEO spends 18 hours a week on\n\u201coutside activities.\u201d The next time-waster is internal meetings. The average\nCEO spends 17 hours a week attending corporate meetings and 6 hours a\nweek preparing for those meetings. Since the typical top executive works 61\nhours a week, that leaves only 20 hours for everything else, including\nmanaging the operation and going down to the front. No wonder chief\nexecutives delegate the marketing function. That\u2019s a mistake.\n\nMarketing is too important to be turned over to an underling. If you\ndelegate anything, you should delegate the chairmanship of the next fund-\nraising drive. (The vice president of the United States, not the president,\nattends the state funerals.) The next thing to cut back on are the meetings.\nInstead of talking things over, walk out and see for yourself. As Gorbachev\ntold Reagan, \u201cIt is better to see once than to hear a hundred times.\u201d\n\nSmall companies are mentally closer to the front than big companies.\nThat might be one reason they grew more rapidly in the last decade. They\nhaven\u2019t been tainted by the law of success.\n",

                    "extracted-text": "Too many companies try to fix things rather than drop things. \u201cLet\u2019s\nreorganize to save the situation\u201d is their way of life.\n\nAdmitting a mistake and not doing anything about it is bad for your\ncareer. A better strategy is to recognize failure early and cut your losses.\nAmerican Motors should have abandoned passenger cars and focused on\nJeep. IBM should have dropped copiers and Xerox should have dropped\ncomputers years before they finally recognized their mistakes.\n\nThe Japanese seem to be able to admit a mistake early and then make the\nnecessary changes. Their consensus management style tends to eliminate\nthe ego. Since a large number of people have a small piece of a big\ndecision, there is no stigma that can be considered career damaging. In\nother words, it\u2019s a lot easer to live with \u201cWe were all wrong\u201d than the\ndevastating \u201cI was wrong.\u201d\n\nThis egoless approach is a major factor in making the Japanese such\nrelentless marketers. It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t make mistakes, but when they\ndo, they admit them, fix them, and just keep coming.\n\nThe hugely successful Wal-Mart has another approach that enables the\ncompany to deal with failure. It\u2019s called Sam Walton\u2019s \u201cready, fire, aim\u201d\napproach. It\u2019s an outgrowth of his penchant for constant tinkering.\n\nWalton was well aware that nobody hits the target every time. But at Wal-\nMart, people aren\u2019t punished if their experiments fail. As Wal-Mart\u2019s chief\nexecutive said in a Business Week article, \u201cIf you learn something and\nyou\u2019re trying something, then you probably get credit for it. But woe to the\nperson who makes the same mistake twice.\u201d\n\nWal-Mart is different from many large corporations because, so far, it\nappears to be free of an insidious disease called the \u201cpersonal agenda\u201d that\ncan creep into any corporation. Marketing decisions are often made first\nwith the decision maker\u2019s career in mind and second with the impact on the\ncompetition or the enemy in mind. There is a built-in conflict between the\npersonal and the corporate agenda.\n\nThis leads to a failure to take risks. (It\u2019s hard to be first in a new category\nwithout sticking your neck out.) When the senior executive has a high\nsalary and a short time to retirement, a bold move is highly unlikely.\n\nEven junior executives often make \u201csafe\u201d decisions so as to not disrupt\ntheir progress up the corporate ladder. Nobody has ever been fired for a\nbold move they didn\u2019t make.\n\nIn some American companies nothing gets done unless it benefits the\npersonal agenda of someone in top management. This severely limits the\npotential marketing moves a company can make. An idea gets rejected not\nbecause it isn\u2019t fundamentally sound but because no one in top management\nwill personally benefit from its success.\n\nOne way to defuse the personal agenda factor is to bring it out in the\nopen. 3M uses the \u201cchampion\u201d system to publicly identify the person who\nwill benefit from the success of a new product or venture. The successful\nintroduction of 3M\u2019s Post-it Notes illustrates how the concept works. Art\nFry is the 3M scientist who championed the Post-it Notes product, which\ntook almost a dozen years to bring to market.\n\nWhile the 3M system works, in theory the ideal environment would allow\nmanagers to judge a concept on its merits, not on whom the concept would\nbenefit.\u2019\n\n\nIf a company is going to operate in an ideal way, it will take teamwork,\nesprit de corps, and a self-sacrificing leader. One immediately thinks of\nPatton and his Third Army and its dash across France. No army in history\ntook as much territory and as many prisoners in as short a period of time.\n\nPatton\u2019s reward? Eisenhower fired him.\n",

                    "extracted-text": "When IBM was successful, the company said very little. Now it throws a\nlot of press conferences.\n\nWhen things are going well, a company doesn\u2019t need the hype. When you\nneed the hype, it usually means you\u2019re in trouble.\n\nYoung and inexperienced reporters and editors tend to be more impressed\nby what they read in other publications than by what they gather\nthemselves. Once the hype starts, it often continues on and on.\n\nNo soft drink has received more hype than New Coke. By one estimate,\nNew Coke received more than $1 billion worth of free publicity. Add to that\nthe hundreds of millions of dollars spent to launch the brand, and New Coke\nshould have been the world\u2019s most successful product. It didn\u2019t happen.\n\nLess than 60 days after the launch, Coca-Cola was forced to come back\nwith the original formula, now called Coca-Cola Classic. Today Classic\noutsells New about 15 to 1.\n\nNo newspaper has received more hype than USA Today. At its launch in\n1982 were the president of the United States, the speaker of the House of\nRepresentatives, and the majority leader of the U.S. Senate. The residue of\nthis initial hype is still so great that most people cannot believe USA Today\nis a loser.\n\nNo computer has received more hype than the Next computer. Demand\nfor press conference credentials was so great that Steve Jobs had to print\ntickets in advance, even though the auditorium could hold several thousand\npeople. All the seats were filled.\n\nSteve Jobs makes television news as well as the cover of many major\npublications. IBM, Ross Perot, and Canon have invested $130 million.\n\nWill Next be a winner? Of course not. Where is the opening? Next is the\nfirst in a new category of what?\n\nHistory is filled with marketing failures that were successful in the press.\nThe Tucker 48, the U.S. Football League, Videotext, the automated factory,\nthe personal helicopter, the manufactured home, the picturephone, polyester\nsuits. The essence of the hype was not just that the new product was going\nto be successful. The essence of the hype was that existing products would\nnow be obsolete.\n\nPolyester was going to make wool obsolete. Videotext was going to make\nnewspapers obsolete. The personal helicopter was going to make the roads\nand highways obsolete. The Tucker 48 with its \u201ccyclop\u2019s eye\u201d headlight\nwould revolutionize the way Detroit makes automobiles. (Only 51 were\never built.)\n\nIn the heavily touted \u201coffice of the future,\u201d everything was going to be\nintegrated into one ball of computer wax. The last time we looked, there\nwere separate typewriters (now called personal computers), separate laser\nprinters, separate fax machines, separate copy machines, separate postal\nmeters. The office of the future is aptly named\u2014a concept that will remain\nforever in the future.\n\nThese predictions violate the law of unpredictability. No one can predict\nthe future, not even a sophisticated reporter for the Wall Street Journal. The\nonly revolutions you can predict are the ones that have already started.\n\nDid anyone predict the overthrow of communism and the Soviet Union?\nNot really. It was only after the process had started that the press jumped on\nthe \u201ccrumbling communist empire\u201d story.\n\nContrast the first Tucker with the first Toyopet that hit the shores of\nCalifornia. Did the Los Angeles Times do a story on how Japanese imports\nwere going to shake up the auto industry? Not at all. The only stories that\nmade the news were about the little cars from Japan that fell apart because\nthey weren\u2019t up to the rigors of American roads. (Toyopet, of course, went\non to become a big winner after changing the cars and changing the car\u2019s\nname to Toyota.)\n\nWhen MCI got started by launching a microwave service between\nChicago and St. Louis, did the press say, \u201cWatch out, AT&T, here comes the\ncompetition?\u201d No, they pretty much ignored littlke MCI. When Sun\nMicrosystems shipped its first workstation, did the press note the\nsignificance of the event, that someday workstations would rattle the cages\nat IBM and DEC? No, the press ignored Sun.\n\nForget the front page. If you\u2019re looking for clues to the future, look in the\nback of the paper for those innocuous little stories.\n\nNeither the personal computer nor the facsimile machine took off like a\nrocket. The personal computer was introduced in 1974. It took six years for\nIBM to strike back with the PC. Even the PC didn\u2019t boom until a year and a\nhalf later, when Lotus 1-2-3 hit the market.\n\nCapturing the imagination of the public is not the same as revolutionizing\na market. Take the picturephone, now called the videophone. Ever since its\nintroduction at the 1964 New York World\u2019s Fair, the picturephone has been\nin the news, usually on the front page. The latest example is a front-page\nstory in the Wall Street Journal, \u201cThe Videophone Era May Finally Be\nNear, Bringing Big Changes.\u201d\n\nThis is the third try for AT&T. In the seventies, it failed with the\npicturephone at $100 a month. In the eighties, it failed with a picturephone\nmeeting service at $2,300 an hour. In the nineties, AT&T is hustling $1,500\nvideophones.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why the videophone hasn\u2019t made much progress. Who\nwants to get dressed up to make a phone call?\n\nWhat isn\u2019t so easy to see is why the videophone gets so much hype.\nThere\u2019s a clue in the subhead of the Journal article, \u201cAn Alternative To\nTravel.\u201d Look out American Airlines, United, and Delta, your days are\n\nnumbered. The hype really isn\u2019t about the videophone at all. It\u2019s about the\ncoming revolution in the travel industry.\n\nOver the years, the greatest hype has been for those developments that\npromise to single-handedly change an entire industry, preferably one that\u2019s\nvital to the American economy. Remember the helicopter hype after World\nWar II? Every garage would house a helicopter, making roads, bridges, and\nthe entire automobile industry obsolete overnight. Did Donald Trump get a\nhelicopter? Did you get yours? (Donald actually did get his, but he had to\ngive it back to the bank.)\n\nThen there was the manufactured-home hype. It was reported that the\nsingle most expensive product a family ever buys could be made on the\nassembly line, revolutionizing the construction industry.\n\nFrom time to time, no-frills food makes the headlines. It is reported that\nthis development will revolutionize the packaged-goods industry. Brands\nare out. People will read the labels and buy products on their merits rather\nthan on the size of the brand\u2019s advertising budget. It\u2019s all hype.\n\nThe latest overhyped development is that of the pen computer, which will\nrevolutionize the personal computer field and make computers accessible to\neveryone whether they can type or not. It\u2019s all hype.\n\nNot that there isn\u2019t a grain of truth in every over-hyped story. Anyone\nwith $580,000 plus tax can buy a little five-seat Bell helicopter. The pen\ncomputer might be attractive to a narrow segment of the market, especially\nthe traveling-salesperson crowd. The videophone could revolutionize the\nphone-sex industry, and there\u2019s a substantial market for mobile homes and\nrecreational vehicles, all manufactured on assembly lines.\n\nBut, for the most part, hype is hype. Real revolutions don\u2019t arrive at high\nnoon with marching bands and coverage on the 6:00 P.M. news. Real\nrevolutions arrive unannounced in the middle of the night and kind of sneak\nup on you.\n",

                    "extracted-text": "A fad is a wave in the ocean, and a trend is the tide. A fad gets a lot of\nhype, and a trend gets very little.\n\nLike a wave, a fad is very visible, but it goes up and down in a big hurry.\nLike the tide, a trend is almost invisible, but it\u2019s very powerful over the long\nterm.\n\nA fad is a short-term phenomenon that might be profitable, but a fad\ndoesn\u2019t last long enough to do a company much good. Furthermore, a\ncompany often tends to gear up as if a fad were a trend. As a result, the\ncompany is often stuck with a lot of staff, expensive manufacturing\nfacilities, and distribution networks.\n\n(A fashion, on the other hand, is a fad that repeats itself. Examples: short\nskirts for women and double-breasted suits for men. Halley\u2019s Comet is a\nfashion because it comes back every 75 years or so.)\n\nWhen the fad disappears, a company often goes into a deep financial\nshock. What happened to Atari is typical in this respect. And look how\nColeco Industries handled the Cabbage Patch Kids. Those homely dolls hit\nthe market in 1983 and started to take off. Coleco\u2019s strategy was to milk the\nkids for all they were worth.\n\nHundreds of Cabbage Patch novelties flooded the toy stores. Pens,\npencils, crayon boxes, games, clothing. Two years later, Coleco racked up\nsales of $776 million and profits of $83 million. Then the bottom dropped\nout of the Cabbage Patch Kids. By 1988 Coleco went into Chapter 11.\n\nColeco died, but the kids live on. Acquired by Hasbro in 1989, the\nCabbage Patch Kids are now being handled conservatively. Today they\u2019re\ndoing quite well.\n\nHere\u2019s the paradox. If you were faced with a rapidly rising business, with\nall the characteristics of a fad, the best thing you could do would be to\ndampen the fad. By dampening the fad, you stretch the fad out and it\nbecomes more like a trend.\n\nYou see this in the toy business. Some owners of hot toys want to put\ntheir hot toy name on everything. The result is that it becomes an enormous\nfad that is bound to collapse. When everybody has a Ninja turtle, nobody\nwants one anymore.\n\nThe Ninja turtle is a good example of a fad that collapses in a hurry\nbecause the owner of the concept got greedy. The owner fans the fad rather\nthan dampening it.\n\nOn the other hand, the Barbie doll is a trend. When Barbie was invented\nyears ago, the doll was never heavily merchandised into other areas. As a\nresult, the Barbie doll has become a long-term trend in the toy business.\n\nThe most successful entertainers are the ones who control their\nappearances. They don\u2019t overextend themselves. They\u2019re not all over the\nplace. They don\u2019t wear out their welcome.\n\nElvis Presley\u2019s manager, Colonel Parker, made a deliberate attempt to\nrestrict the number of appearances and records the King made. As a result,\nevery time Elvis appeared, it was an event of enormous impact. (Elvis\nhimself contributed to this strategy by overdosing early and severely\n\ndampening his future appearances. Likewise Marilyn Monroe and James\nDean.)\n\nForget fads. And when they appear, try to dampen them. One way to\nmaintain a long-term demand for your product is to never totally satisfy the\ndemand.\n\nBut the best, most profitable thing to ride in marketing is a long-term\ntrend.\n",

                    "extracted-text": "If you have a good idea and you\u2019ve picked up this book with the thought\nin mind that all you need is a little marketing help, this chapter will throw\ncold water on that thought.\n\nEven the best idea in the world won\u2019t go very far without the money to\nget it off the ground. Inventors, entrepreneurs, and assorted idea generators\nseem to think that all their good ideas need is professional marketing help.\n\nNothing could be further from the truth. Marketing is a game fought in\nthe mind of the prospect. You need money to get into a mind. And you need\nmoney to stay in the mind once you get there.\n\nYou\u2019!l get further with a mediocre idea and a million dollars than with a\ngreat idea alone.\n\nSome entrepreneurs see advertising as the solution to the problem of\ngetting into prospects\u2019 minds. Advertising is expensive. It cost $9,000 a\n\nminute to fight World War II. It cost $22,000 a minute to fight the Vietnam\nWar. A one-minute commercial on the NFL Super Bowl will cost you $1.5\nmillion.\n\nSteve Jobs and Steve Wozniak had a great idea. But it was Mike\nMarkkula\u2019s $91,000 that put Apple Computer on the map. (For his money,\nMarkkula got one-third of Apple. He should have held out for half.)\n\nIdeas without money are worthless. Well ... not quite. But you have to\nuse your idea to find the money, not the marketing help. The marketing can\ncome later.\n\nSome entrepreneurs see publicity as a cheap way of getting into\nprospects\u2019 minds. \u201cFree advertising\u201d is how they see it. Publicity isn\u2019t free.\nRule of thumb: 5-10-20. A small public relations agency will want $5,000 a\nmonth to promote your product; a medium-size agency, $10,000 a month;\nand a big-time agency, $20,000 a month.\n\nSome entrepreneurs see venture capitalists as the solution to their money\nproblems. But only a tiny percentage succeed in finding the funding they\nneed this way.\n\nSome entrepreneurs see corporate America as ready, willing, and\nfinancially able to get their offspring off the ground. Good luck, you\u2019ll need\nit. Very few outside ideas are ever accepted by large companies. Your only\nreal hope is finding a smaller company and persuading it of the merits of\nyour idea.\n\nRemember: An idea without money is worthless. Be prepared to give\naway a lot for the funding.\n\nIn marketing, the rich often get richer because they have the resources to\ndrive their ideas into the mind. Their problem is separating the good ideas\nfrom the bad ones, and avoiding spending money on too many products and\ntoo many programs (chapter 5: The Law of Focus).\n\nCompetition is fierce. The giant corporations put a lot of money behind\ntheir brands. Procter & Gamble and Philip Morris each spend more than $2\nbillion a year on advertising. General Motors spends $1.5 billion a year.\n\nLife can be unfair for the smaller marketer facing larger competitors.\nConsider A&M Pet Products, a small company in Houston, Texas. A&M\ninvented \u201cclumping\u201d cat litter, one of the most important breakthroughs in\nthe category. The concept is simple. When cats use the litter box, this new\ntype of litter clumps the waste into balls, which are easily scooped out and\ndisposed of. There is no need to replace the entire box.\n\n\nThe brand, called Scoop Away, took off wherever it was introduced. This\nquickly got the attention of Golden Cat Corporation, which has the No.1 cat\nlitter brand, Tidy Cat.\n\nRecognizing a threatening idea when they see one, Golden Cat\nintroduced their own version of clumping cat litter, called Tidy Scoop. Not\nonly, did they jump on A&M\u2019s idea, they also borrowed the Scoop part of\ntheir brand name. (How unfair can you be?)\n\nThe winner of this cat fight will probably be determined by money. Who\nhas the most money to drive in the idea?\n\nUnlike a consumer product, a technical or business product has to raise\nless marketing money because the prospect list is shorter and media is less\nexpensive. But there is still a need for adequate funding for a technical\nproduct to pay for brochures, sales presentations, and trade shows as well as\nadvertising.\n\nHere is the bottom line. First get the idea, then go get the money to\nexploit it. Here are some short cuts you could take:\n\n* You can marry the money. Georgette Mosbacher married Commerce\nSecretary Robert Mosbacher in 1985. Three years later, Ms.\nMosbacher bought La Prairie, a Swiss cosmetics firm, for $31.5\nmillion. Where did she get the money? From everyone. Venture\ncapitalists, La Prairie distributors in Switzerland and Japan, plus her\nown and her husband\u2019s resources. In the first year under Georgette\nMosbacher\u2019s control, La Prairie\u2019s sales were up 30 percent. Then\nshe sold out at a hefty profit.\n\n+ You can divorce the money. Frances Lear arrived in New York in\n1985 at the age of 61. Freshly divorced from her television\nproducer-husband Norman (\u201cAll in the Family\u201d) Lear, she was\ndetermined to launch a magazine for women over 40. She was\nprepared to spend $25 million of her expected $112 million\nsettlement on the project. By its fifth issue, Lear\u2019s magazine had\n350,000 readers.\n\n+ You can find the money at home. Donald Trump would never have\ngotten anywhere without Dad\u2019s millions behind him.\n\n* You can \u201cshare\u201d your idea by franchising it. Tom Monaghan was\nable to put Domino\u2019s Pizza on the map by pursuing an aggressive\nprogram of franchising his home delivery idea.\n\nSo far we\u2019ve been talking about smaller companies and their fund-raising\nstrategies. What about a rich company? How should it approach the law of\nresources? The answer is simple: Spend enough. In war, the military always\nerrs on the high side. Do you know how many rations were left after\nOperation Desert Storm? A lot. So it is in marketing. You can\u2019t save your\nway to success.\n\nThe more successful marketers front load their investment. In other\nwords, they take no profit for two or three years as they plow all earnings\nback into marketing.\n\nMoney makes the marketing world go round. If you want to be successful\ntoday, you\u2019ll have to find the money you need to spin those marketing\nwheels.\n",

                    "extracted-text": "We would be remiss if we did not warn our readers about the potential\ndangers of trying to apply the laws of marketing within an existing\norganization. Many of these laws fly in the face of corporate ego,\nconventional wisdom, and the Malcolm Baldrige awards.\n\nThe law of perception runs counter to the corporate culture of most\ncompanies where trying to be better is deeply ingrained. People are forever\nrunning around and \u201cbenchmarking\u201d the leader in the category and then\nsetting out to \u201cbeat their specs.\u201d It\u2019s what the quality movement is all about.\n\nThe law of leadership is tough for many to swallow. Most people want to\nbelieve they got to the top by being better, not by being first.\n\nSo beware! Management won\u2019t take kindly to any suggestions that will\ntake the emphasis off their better product strategy.\n\nThe law of sacrifice could cause you problems. Offering everything for\neverybody is deeply ingrained in most organizations. If you have any\ndoubts, just stroll down the aisles of any supermarket. What you will find is\nvariation upon variation of sizes, flavors, and forms. It boggles the mind.\nWhy this happens is painfully obvious. Nobody wants to focus.\n\nLarge companies have offices filled with young, bright marketing people.\nDo you expect them to just sit there and do nothing? They feel compelled to\ntinker and make improvements. After all, how can they make their mark on\nthe organization?\n\nSo beware! Those young, bright marketing people will not take kindly to\nany efforts to curtail their tinkering.\n\nThe law of focus suggests owning a word in the prospects\u2019 minds. What\nword does your company own in the minds of your prospects? \u201cI don\u2019t\nknow,\u201d might be your response. \u201cWe make a variety of products for many\ndifferent industries.\u201d\n\nSo beware! You have some pruning to do, which, isn\u2019t going to be easy to\nsell to the powers that be.\n\nThe law of perspective will frustrate anyone looking for quick marketing\nvictories. Companies want to see instant results.\n\nSo beware! Those accountants will give you a hard time in the short term.\n\nThe law of line extension is the most dangerous law of all to deal with. In\nthis case, you have to be prepared to demolish what management holds to\nbe a basic truth: Big successful brands have an equity that can be exploited\nto encompass different kinds of products.\n\nLine extension makes eminent sense in the boardroom. You won\u2019t find\none director in a dozen who would be willing to challenge management on\nthis critical issue.\n\nSo beware! Management will not take kindly to any efforts to curtail their\nequity expansions. You may just have to wait them out. Management is\nmutable, but the laws of marketing are not.\n\nThus are you duly warned. If you violate the immutable laws, you run the\nrisk of failure. If you apply the immutable laws, you run the risk of being\nbad-mouthed, ignored, or even ostracized.\n\nHave patience. The immutable laws of marketing will help you achieve\nsuccess. And success is the best revenge of all.\n",
